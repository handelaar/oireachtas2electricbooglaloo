      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is the Minister in charge of Foras &Aacute;iseanna Saothar, or F&Aacute;S.  Any Deputy in the House can point to areas in the country, the city, the town and other places where F&Aacute;S has given very valuable assistance in the development of community facilities.  That must be recognised.  It is more than a year since I, along with Deputy Varadkar, raised questions in the House about activities within the F&Aacute;S organisation at senior level.  Last Sunday week, the chairman of F&Aacute;S announced on RTE that the entire board would resign.  When I raised this matter first the Taoiseach defended the actions of the former chief executive and, as Minister, the T&aacute;naiste said that all matters which were in the public domain were in the past.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">We hear a great deal about the Government getting matters right and value for money, seeing that targets are met and objectives are achieved and that the country is run as effectively as it should be.  As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and as deputy leader of the Government, the T&aacute;naiste presides over F&Aacute;S.   She either knew these things were going on or she was complicit in them.   If that is the case it is a demonstration of utter incompetence.  The T&aacute;naiste said these matters were in the past and would never happen again.  The board had her full support on two occasions: in February and June.  Now the board is to resign <i>en bloc</i> in September.  Why has the board lost the confidence of the Government?  Is it because of the &euro;600,000 advertisement which was placed and never delivered?  Is it about the car that was purchased which never arrived?  Or is it about the &euro;622,000 which is now the subject of a <Col N="2" />file sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of which nobody seems to know what the money was spent on or where it went?  What are the reasons the board has lost the support of the T&aacute;naiste and the Government?  Regarding the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s previous comments, was she aware of, or complicit in, the actions that were revealed publicly over the past 12 months regarding the higher echelons of F&Aacute;S?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I refute that charge on the following basis.  On the occasion of the internal audit report being made available to me, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a further investigation and report on this matter.  The Committee of Public Accounts was carrying out an investigation and the Comptroller and Auditor General advised that he did not wish to complete the terms of reference until he heard what the committee had to say.  That report was brought to my attention by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the interim, several other actions were taken by me.  First, the director general stepped down, an interim director general was appointed and, subsequently, a new director general was appointed.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That included a golden handshake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Second, arising from the internal audit that took place, on my instruction the board was advised to take on board the Department of Finance&rsquo;s regulations.  All those actions were taken and the board supported all actions that were necessary in the interim.  Yesterday the Cabinet signed off on new legislation regarding the structures of the board.  We hope this legislation will be facilitated very quickly in this House, at which stage a new structure will be put in place.  </P>
        <P>I do not accept there should be any loss of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  That is why the Garda is investigating two matters, one of which is with the Director of Public Prosecutions at this time.  Following receipt of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, on my instruction my Secretary General sent the report to the Garda Commissioner for further examination in case any criminal proceedings are needed.</P>
        <P>I agree with one point Deputy Kenny made, namely, that the role of F&Aacute;S is paramount in the support and training of people in this country.  Every Member of this House is more than complimentary about the work being carried out.  This is a grave distraction and disappointment to those people who work on behalf of F&Aacute;S who had nothing to do with what happened in the corporate side.  However, I am adamant that the work of F&Aacute;S, its board and the structures that will be set in place by this House very soon will be fit for purpose, very strategic and focused on the needs of the people here who are unemployed and in need of training.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The board was asleep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is another demonstration of a senior Minister in a party that has been in Government for too long. The T&aacute;naiste missed completely the extent of anger, frustration and concern that exists among people who are very hard pressed when they see, read about and understand the profligate misspending and misuse of money in this way, after which nothing happens.  </P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the Committee of Public Accounts.  There were personnel who refused to attend that committee and Deputies of this House, on all sides, including the Government&rsquo;s, were not in a position to ask them questions.  The T&aacute;naiste has reports of very high levels of facility being made available on credit cards and the apparent playing fast and loose with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  She pointed out the Garda is carrying out an investigation in this regard but it is not carrying out an investigation into the top up of the pension to the former director general, nor do I suggest it should.  The T&aacute;naiste is the person who signed off on that arrange<Col N="3" />ment.  What has gone wrong in the public service which does down so many fine officials in so many sectors is precisely that where targets are not met, where targets and objectives are not achieved, where it is clear there is incompetence, gross incompetence in some instances, this is rewarded.  This is what causes so much anger for people across the country who are very hard-pressed to make ends meet on a daily and a weekly basis.  The former director general admitted he was incorrect and admitted that mistakes were made.  The T&aacute;naiste signed off, apparently, on an extra four and a half years of pensionable service for that director general who had, I think, 35 years of service prior to that.  Can the T&aacute;naiste justify this on the basis of targets not being achieved, on the basis of incompetence and on the basis of this being admitted by a director general of a very important and massive organisation spending almost &euro;1 billion?  She is aware that if a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na steps out of line in a serious manner, his or her pension is ended.  In this case as in others, the regulator included, there has been a very hefty reward for incompetence.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to explain to the House why she, as T&aacute;naiste and as the Minister presiding over F&Aacute;S, was in a position to sign off on an extra four and a half years&rsquo; pensionable service for the former director general, in view of the incompetence and the inefficiency palpably demonstrated and the waste of public money at the very highest level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>First, the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts are all included in the new legislation. Second, with regard to Mr. Molloy&rsquo;s departure, the severance package has been in the public domain for a considerable period.  I did not make the decision lightly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Justify it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I agreed, not on the basis of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 &mdash; as purported in the public domain &mdash; rather on the basis of the Labour Services Act 1987 which provides for the terms and conditions of directors general of F&Aacute;S, including their remuneration and this may be determined by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the consent of the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not make it right.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At that time, around this time last year, I thought the most appropriate action would be his speedy departure.  Also, the terms of the legislation allow an entitlement of up to five eightieths to employees of non-commercial semi-State bodies where contracts are being terminated.  Both the Minister for Finance and I worked within the terms of reference of that legislation, on the basis that I was of the view that the speedy departure of the director general from that organisation was appropriate.  The alternative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;was to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money for the next six to nine months in the Four Courts and I thought this would not be the most appropriate action, on the basis that these matters were destroying an organisation whose role&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone was shocked during the week at the death of Mr. Paddy Barry, an elderly pensioner in Waterford, following a burglary in his home.  We all wish to sympathise with his family.  Out of respect for them and because I understand a file is being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, I do not wish to focus on that individual case.  However, it brings into focus the fear and apprehension experienced by many elderly people, particularly those who are living alone, in the face of the kind of anti-social behaviour such as groups of youths who are out of control and criminal activity.  Many are afraid in their own homes and in their communities.  This fear would have been added to during the week by reports that one in seven of the prison population is now out on temporary release, a total of 600 prisoners who have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and who are now out and about, largely because the Government has made a mess of the provision of prison places.  </P>
        <P>In that context I recall in my own constituency the closure five years ago of Shanganagh prison.  This was a facility for young male offenders which was closed down by the Government.  I would ask the Government to reopen it but it would be unable to do so because it sold the prison to a developer.  It was reflected in last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme that one of the measures which reduces fear for people who are living alone, particularly elderly people, is a visible presence of garda&iacute;, particularly in their local community.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report recommends the closure of half of the Garda stations in the country, the closure of approximately 350 small Garda stations. I understand there are 22 such stations in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own county.  I have one simple question for the T&aacute;naiste which I think might go some way towards alleviating people&rsquo;s fear.  Will she give the House an assurance that those 350 Garda stations will not be closed, that the recommendation will be rejected and that there will not be closure of the small Garda stations throughout the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express the Government&rsquo;s sympathy to the Barry family because this was a terrible tragedy.  As Deputy Gilmore has correctly stated, the issues he has raised are not within the context of one specific tragedy.  However, he referred to temporary releases and prison places.  Since 1997 this Government has provided an additional 1,400 places and by the end of this year, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have provided an additional 450 prison places&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>And the criminals to go with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The McCarthy report proposals regarding the closure of 350 Garda stations would provide a saving of &euro;1 million.  No decisions have been made on any of the McCarthy proposals.  They are all being considered in the context of the budgetary discussions currently under way.  Therefore, I am not in a position to give an assurance, one way or the other, as to what will happen with regard to the McCarthy proposals.  However, the new model of community policing which was announced by the Minister at the beginning of the year, is working well.  We started a process of taking garda&iacute; out of stations and putting them on the beat rather than doing clerical work.  This process is progressive and is significant.  The Garda Commissioner has been very enthusiastic about providing a visible presence of members of the force.  I must reiterate what the Commissioner said in the context of the terrible tragedy in Waterford during the week, namely that he is anxious that the people who are aware of issues should support the garda&iacute;.</P><Col N="5" />
        <P>Additional places have been provided and a new model of community policing has been set up by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In the context of the McCarthy report all these issues are being considered by the Government but no decisions have been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was specifically about the Garda stations.  I note that the T&aacute;naiste is not giving the House any assurance that those Garda stations will not be closed.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Last night, the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme showed the degree to which people throughout the country are apprehensive.  This is a problem of fear.  People are afraid.  One of the things which would alleviate the fear is an assurance from the Government that their local Garda station will not be closed down.</P>
        <P>There is a recommendation that small Garda stations in villages and local communities throughout the country should be closed down.  The T&aacute;naiste should categorically rule out the closure of those Garda stations.  I see the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is providing the T&aacute;naiste with a prompt to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate that there is a financial difficulty but where is the sense in closing 350 Garda stations to make a saving of &euro;1 million?  One could save &euro;1 million by abolishing two ministers of state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Or the head of F&Aacute;S.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and leaving the 350 Garda stations that would provide a far greater comfort for people who are fearful in their homes.</P>
        <P>This recommendation is nonsense.  Everyone knows the presence of garda&iacute; in local communities contributes to the prevention of crime, reassures people and is a visible presence of garda&iacute;.  It does not make sense to close these Garda stations, particularly when the saving is so small.</P>
        <P>If this were a big question about some of the major recommendations in the McCarthy report I would understand the T&aacute;naiste saying the Government is reflecting on the matter and has not yet made a decision, and so on.  This is an issue the T&aacute;naiste could put to bed now.  She should reassure people that local Garda stations will not be closed and that she will find the million euro savings from elsewhere in the State&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to reiterate that Garda numbers are at an all-time high, with 14,800.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>And no students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We have 2,600 civilians and 600 students in Templemore.  Therefore the Garda force is at an all-time high.  On the issue of the McCarthy report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>On Garda stations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>No students, no stations to put them in and no guards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed that &euro;1 million should be saved on Garda stations.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, will deal with those issues.  If the Government decides this is not an appropriate action the million euro will be found elsewhere.  There are many recommendations in the McCarthy report which do not make sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P><Col N="6" />
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a matter for the Government to make a decision on how to find the appropriate savings to deal with the country&rsquo;s economic and financial difficulties.  I am sure Opposition Members will be constructive in their proposals as to where we will find savings of &euro;4 billion.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government established a working group on D&aacute;il reform earlier this year, comprising the Ministers for Transport and Justice Equality and Law Reform, Deputies Noel Dempsey and Dermot Ahern, Senator Dan Boyle and myself as Government Chief Whip.  Proposals regarding the length of D&aacute;il terms, the timetabling of business and areas were submitted to the Government in June.  Following Government approval they were brought to the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for consideration.  No final decisions have yet been taken but discussion on the proposals is continuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Will his proposals for D&aacute;il reform be published at some stage so that the public will know Government thinking in this area?  How soon will he do that?  It is important that there be a public debate as well as parliamentary debate on this matter.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Can the Minister of State indicate to the House what the proposals contain?  For instance, would he agree with the Fine Gael motion, which has been on the Order Paper for several months, that supplementary questions could be asked on the Adjournment Debate?  Would he be in favour of a commencement debate, whereby Deputies could ask Ministers questions before the day&rsquo;s business begins?  Deputies raise matters under Standing Order 32 but they are rarely allowed.  Is it not time we changed that procedure?  Does the Minister of State not agree that it is archaic?</P>
        <P>How many times has the working group met since it was established on 27 January last?  What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on televising the proceedings of the Oireachtas?  What is the Government&rsquo;s current thinking on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I pay tribute to my colleagues, the other party Whips.  There has been real engagement at the meetings of the sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform.  Many of the proposals emerging are coming by way of agreement.  I hope we will have another meeting in the week after the Lisbon treaty referendum to progress further the areas we discussed in July and come <Col N="7" />quickly as near as we can to agreement.  My preference is to work towards agreement, as far as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of areas of agreement are emerging.  There is general agreement, for example, that the D&aacute;il year should be about 35 weeks and that the D&aacute;il should start earlier on each sitting day.  Everyone agrees on supplementary questions to what we now call Adjournment debates.  Several other issues were discussed and others have been tabled in the meantime.</P>
        <P>The working group has met three times and reported to Cabinet earlier this year.</P>
        <P>With regard to televising D&aacute;il debates, previous committees, such as the broadcasting committee, have gleaned much from what they saw in Canada, Australia and other countries.  Practice in other parliaments has been cited as good examples of how we can develop greater engagement with our constituents.  It is extremely important that we talk about the efficiency of the House although this is only one aspect of D&aacute;il reform.</P>
      
        <P>Some commentators believe that what we are discussing is D&aacute;il reform, but I am discussing a more efficient and streamlined presentation of the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s activities.  In recent months, we have formally or informally discussed more fundamental issues that are in the public domain.  Fine Gael has raised the question of the number of Deputies, how they are elected and so on.  While that is a wider debate, it merits thought.</P>
        <P>We have held summer schools on a variety of subjects and I have informally suggested to colleagues something like a summer school at which academics, constitutional lawyers, practising politicians and those who have left the political arena could make a significant contribution.  In this way, the House could develop worthwhile proposals that would benefit and improve the engagement of both Houses of Parliament, although whether the system would be bicameral or unicameral is another debate.  This could not be done quickly, but it should be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State in that there are two issues.  If we wished, some of the House&rsquo;s procedures could be brought up to date tomorrow to make the House more efficient and the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s job easier.  We have been calling for a longer term development for some time.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s assertion that there might be a wider debate on the role of Parliament in the 21st century, the electoral system and so on.  We would support that proposal and encourage the Minister of State to table it.</P>
           <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What are the opinions of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Government colleagues in respect of making State agencies more accountable through parliamentary question systems?  Does he not agree that many agencies, while called quangos, are autonomous in many ways?  F&Aacute;S has been mentioned.  Does he not agree that the opportunities for Deputies to question, scrutinise and oversee the work of agencies that spend taxpayers&rsquo; money are limited to the committees?  Does he not agree that it would be better for Ministers to answer questions regarding the work and responsibilities of those agencies on the floor of the House?  Ministers cannot be responsible for the agencies&rsquo; day-to-day operations, but surely they could get the information and put it on the floor of the House.  This would prevent the types of issue that have caused such recent trouble in many State agencies.  For example, I asked a question yesterday about a child with special needs who does not have a school place, but I was told that the Minister for Education and Science had no responsibility for the matter.  This was appalling.  The Minister should have asked the agencies involved, reverted to the House and answered the question.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State not agree that we used to ask questions about the HSE and get responses within one week, but that we now get responses privately after three, four or five weeks, meaning that they do not appear on the public record?  Many quangos were established to protect Ministers from scrutiny.  Is it not time to change the system?  The National Roads <Col N="8" />Authority is another example.  When one writes to it, one gets a cursory response.  Were our questions to be answered in public in the House, the NRA would be careful about its responses and we might get proper information, particularly if procedures were changed to allow Ministers to be quizzed.  Had our procedures been correct, we might not be in our current economic mess.  Deputies could have asked questions and scrutinised issues to a deeper level.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on this important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this issue.  As he knows, the Ceann Comhairle advanced some proposals on how the matter of accountability of State agencies to the Houses of the Oireachtas could be further explored.  It will be an item of discussion at our next meeting.</P>
        <P>We suggested that we would consider amending legislation to allow the tabling of questions to State agencies by Deputies.  In terms of greater transparency and accountability, there is significant merit in exploring how some of those agencies could be made more accountable than they appear to be currently.  At a previous meeting, it was proposed that one or two of those agencies would be chosen on a pilot basis to determine how the idea would work in practice.  To be fair to the HSE, its parliamentary affairs division is improving in providing information, but I take the point that the information is provided directly to the Member who tabled the question and does not appear on the House&rsquo;s record.  If we are to move forward on significant reform, this is an area that we need to consider.</P>
        <P>We have also been considering the suggestion by virtually everyone in the working group that a mechanism could be found whereby a number of written questions of a relevantly urgent nature could be tabled by Members in July and September.  Whenever there is a proposal, there is a knock-on effect on the resources of the Houses and so on but no one is discussing tabling a flurry of questions on a range of topics.  The group is exploring this suggestion and I am minded to support it as one of our final recommendations, which I hope will be presented shortly to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Stanton referred to a specialised parliamentary channel, which was also mentioned at our committee meeting.  The Oireachtas is only televised on Wednesday and Thursday mornings on TG4 and on Wednesday mornings on RTE, which has its own political programme.  One must then depend on the &ldquo;Week in Politics&rdquo;, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; or the news.  Other countries have a specialised parliamentary channel.  Although we are under economic constraints, we should not forget this matter.  The Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas is paying people to visit schools and so forth to teach pupils about the Houses&rsquo; workings.  This money would be better spent were we to have a specialised television channel for the D&aacute;il, Seanad and committee meetings.  Some people outside the Houses do not even know that committees sit or what work they do.  Is the Government trying to hide the House&rsquo;s workings?  Does it not want the bad news to be televised via a D&aacute;il channel?  I would like to see this issue worked upon.  Since we have a broadcasting unit, taking this extra step would not cost much money.</P>
        <P>Does the Government plan to reduce the size of the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s membership within the realm of the Constitution?  It has been discussed in the media and Government circles.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kehoe and I, and I suspect most other Members in the Chamber at present, are members of the Joint Administration Committee, which is meeting today at 12.15 p.m.  The second item on its agenda is the dedicated Oireachtas TV channel.  As the Deputy knows, presentations have been made by two groups on how this service could be <Col N="9" />delivered.  It is recognised it is desirable that it be established.  However, it is also recognised that it probably cannot be established at present because of the cost.  Most of us are extremely anxious to find a way to ensure &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is not broadcast at a time when, as Deputy Rabbitte said, it is of interest only to insomniacs and alcoholics.</P>
        <P>While I commend both TG4 and RTE on the way the are covering the work of the Oireachtas at present, I must castigate &mdash; that is probably too strong a word &mdash; the print media, in particular, for their relative inattention to the work of committees.  I have heard some commentators on radio and television programmes dismissing it.  Committees, while believed by some to be surplus to requirements, comprise one way, and a good way, for citizens to engage with Parliament.  They can lobby on a variety of issues and receive a hearing.  In many cases, their insights inform legislation.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Kehoe&rsquo;s question, the Government favours the introduction of an Oireachtas channel as early as possible but, in the current financial circumstances in this digital era, it is unlikely that it will be established in the shorter term unless other means are found to fund it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>

	<P>With regard to Deputy Kehoe&rsquo;s question, there is nothing in An Agreed Programme for Government or elsewhere on the size of the D&aacute;il.  As I stated in reply to Deputy Stanton, issues concerning the size and composition of the Parliament, and the question of whether it should be an Assembly of one or two Chambers, ought to be explored in a very serious way.  This process should not be embarked upon without very significant research involving current and former Members of this House and experts in constitutional and parliamentary law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no faith whatever in the Fianna F&aacute;il Members in Government proposing to or attempting to reform the D&aacute;il.  I have been sitting opposite its members at Oireachtas committees for ten years and they have stonewalled and blocked every single proposal for D&aacute;il reform, even minor ones.  Is the Minister of State aware that the Ceann Comhairle used his good offices to bring forward a package for modest but significant D&aacute;il reform and that it was simply blocked and scuttled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party?  It was not blocked by the Green Party or the Government as a whole but by the members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in Government.  The package covered addressed how the taking of Leaders&rsquo; Questions might be made more effective and how the Order of Business should be tidied up and made efficient.</P>
        <P>It was also proposed that parliamentary questions be allowed on the 200-odd quangos that the Government has set up and on which Members cannot ask questions in the Chamber.  Proposals also covered the management of committees of the Oireachtas and the holding of Adjournment debates on topical issues.  The package of proposals was simply scuttled.  There was agreement among the group that met the Ceann Comhairle but, at the next step, the proposals were blocked.</P>
        <P>In the proposals the Minister of State made to us at the committee there was not a word about the inability of Members of this House to ask questions and obtain answers on where public money is spent.  I refer to the HSE, the National Roads Authority and the other 198 quangos that have been set up.  By setting them up, the Government has removed power from this Chamber, thereby from the people of the country, and has handed it over to so-called <Col N="10" />independent authorities.  I wonder whom they are independent of.  We cannot ask questions in this House about the colossal amounts of public money handed over to these agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Ceann Comhairle had a proposal to address this, as did the Labour Party and Fine Gael, but I now hear the Minister is paying lip service to it.  If the Government had any intention of implementing the proposal, it would have done so long ago.  Does the Minister of State not agree?  Instead of implementing the proposals, every new Bill in the House establishes another agency and removes power from the House.  Members cannot even ask questions about such agencies.  Major reform is required in this area and it will involve the amendment of several Acts.  Does the Government want to achieve this?</P>
        <P>The Labour Party and Fine Gael have proposed that, during the summer recess, Members would be entitled to table written parliamentary questions.  The Minister of State did not mention this in his proposals to us.  I could not find a reference to it.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett sat with me on a committee making the first major attempt at D&aacute;il reform some years ago but the process died a death when it came to the point of making a decision.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must be aware that there are now joint proposals from Fine Gael and the Labour Party on D&aacute;il reform.  Proposals have also been made by the Ceann Comhairle.  There are minimal proposals by the Government that involve tinkering at the edges without making any serious attempt to effect change.  The only changes that are being proposed are to benefit the Government and effectively silence the Opposition.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il might find itself in opposition shortly.  Will the Minister of State consider my points from an Opposition point of view, in which case we might make some progress before he leaves office?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should hold on.  Over the summer period, the staff working with the committee were working on revised Standing Orders in the areas where agreement had been reached or where we were close to achieving agreement.  I already addressed the issue of the questions to agencies and written parliamentary questions by Members of the D&aacute;il on other issues.  There is agreement on those and it will not take very long for us to bring the proposals forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of what Deputy Stagg says might make good rhetoric in the House and good copy but the reality is that this side of the House, in co-operation with the Opposition, by and large, managed to sit longer last year than in many a long day.  It sat for more weeks and for longer <Col N="11" />hours and put through a greater volume of legislation.  There was also a wide range of debates at very short notice and that was to the benefit of the House and of the people we represent.  I will not take lectures from anyone concerning the commitment of this Government.  The issue of Leaders&rsquo; Questions is set down in Standing Orders and as far as I recall the Labour Party was a party to those and to the way in which Leaders&rsquo; Questions were to be taken on Tuesday and Wednesday.  If Deputy Stagg wishes to propose a change to Standing Orders, it is open to his party to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply telling the Deputy what is on the record.  I repeat my earlier comments on State agencies.  The proposals of the Ceann Comhairle concerning the examination of one or two of those State agencies to establish how a mechanism could be found to have questions replied in written form in the House should be explored.  Some progress was made with the HSE and the National Roads Authority in the past year about how that could be delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that many people are cynical when they hear the words &ldquo;D&aacute;il reform&rdquo; mentioned?  It has been discussed for many years and to date there is very little evidence of progress.  Does the Minister of State agree that the issue that distracts from much of the important and &mdash; I acknowledge &mdash; valuable work being done by the D&aacute;il and all Members of the House is the issue of the expenses of Members?  Quite frankly, it is the elephant in the room.  Would the Minister of State support a system of complete openness and transparency in which all expenses are vouched, fully reported and accounted for, open to scrutiny by the public and reported on an annual basis such that there would be no longer a dependency on freedom of information inquiries by journalists to establish the facts?  Surely this is one of the first reforms we should present at this time because, no matter what else one addresses in terms of so-called reform of the institution and its workings, this critical area is the single greatest issue in the minds of the people and we must come to terms with it.  This is the only way it can be done and any objection to full accountability, scrutiny and verification is simply not on anymore.  I strongly urge the Chief Whip to take on board this point concerning any proposals, and I trust any such proposals would come early in order that we could all agree and have such an approach adopted and implemented.</P>
        <P>There was a proposal to abolish certain Oireachtas committees.  Where does this stand?  I take the view that the committee system with all its flaws, warts <i>et al</i> is still an important part of the workings of the Houses of the Oireachtas and I am not an advocate of the abolition of committees.  Would the Chief Whip agree that a much better approach to reform in this area would be the cessation of special payments to the Chairs and convenors of committees?  There would be savings in respect of the workings of the committees because all Chairs and convenors are already paid Members of the Houses and are, therefore, remunerated, as we all are, for our participation in committees.  The most important thing to be protected is the important work of the committees.  It should not be a case of paring by cutting off committees but of facing up to the fact that it is not justifiable for payments to continue to Chairs and convenors for their participation, which is no different from that of any other Member of the D&aacute;il or Seanad in that process.  The committees should be retained and they could be reviewed from time to time in terms of their relevance but, critically, the real issue in terms of reform is to get the situation in respect of expenses and payments correct such that the people can have confidence in the system operated within the Houses and with this institution and then notice would be taken of other reforms and other measures to ensure greater efficiencies in the future.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="12" />
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that this House must do everything it can to reassure the electorate which put us here that everything we do is being done in the public interest and no other.  In respect of the issue of committees, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Allowances to Chairs have been cut in half and allowances to Vice-Chairs and convenors have been abolished and, as I understand it, staffing levels to committees have been reduced significantly by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission by non-replacement of staff who have moved on, been reassigned and so on.  The committees carry out very valuable work and they should be allowed to complete their work programme.  As I stated in reply to an earlier question, this system is one of the ways in which citizens can engage with Members of Parliament, have their voices heard and put their views across.  Very often their views inform proposed and upcoming legislation.</P>
        <P>Sometimes we sell ourselves short and it may not be widely known but, similar to every other member of the public service, Members, Senators, Ministers and so on have taken a cut in pay.  The Minister for Finance has reduced the level of allowances and expenses very significantly.  The budget for foreign travel has been cut by 50% and people are very careful about the trips they make anywhere overseas or outside this city.  Some issues should be understood more widely.  In respect of expenses, I wholeheartedly agree that the sooner the better both Houses agree that, as a matter of course, on a monthly basis or whatever, the allowances and expenses paid to Members should be simply put up on the website of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Other issues concerning a composite allowance and so on should be also brought to a conclusion sooner rather than later.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility for a system to be found for verification of attendance and to give effect to such a system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">One does not often get the opportunity to speak on the way in which the workings of this House should be amended or changed.  As someone who was a Whip both in Government and in Opposition in the 1980s and 1990s, I have heard much over the years about D&aacute;il reform. I can state honestly, however, that this place is not working any better today than it was 25 years ago when there was no commission or any of the nonsense currently taking place with vast sums of money being spent, but getting us nowhere.  The purpose of this Parliament is for the elected representatives to meet and to bring to the attention of the Executive the concerns of the public.  That is basically what this is about and all the rest is simply frills.  We ask ourselves how we manage this process.  I may table a parliamentary question but the quality of the reply has deteriorated significantly, especially if it is an oral question.  We decided that we would draw up and use a list but the Departments are aware well in advance of the numbers of questions that are likely to be reached.  As a former Minister I had to raise the matter with the Secretary General at the time.  I realise that if it is unlikely that the question will be reached, the quality of the answer reduces, which is a flagrant abuse of democracy.  Any D&aacute;il should ensure the right to ask a parliamentary question and to a proper and full answer.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not happening.  All the scandals which have happened down through the years were a result of the inability to get proper answers to parliamentary questions.  It is a matter of this Parliament keeping a check on the Executive.</P>
        <P>Is the system we are using for parliamentary questions working?  For oral questions, a spokesperson has half an hour, which is all right, and there are 45 minutes for backbenchers.  Two or <Col N="13" />three questions may be answered before having to wait six weeks for that Minister to answer questions again.  That is a scandal.</P>
        <P>Many of us remember a time when if environment questions were scheduled, every question would have been answered.  That is the way it should be.  If I put down an oral question for answer, I should be entitled to a response.  The chance should not lapse only to be replaced with a written reply of two lines.  As Deputy Stanton has said, the Department of Education and Science can then tell an elected Member that the Minister has no say in the placing of a child with special needs.  Where are we going with that?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State mean to tell me that as a result of having a commission, this democracy is working far better but we cannot afford to send a signal into the airwaves so people sitting at home or in schools can see the work of this Parliament?  Nevertheless, we can afford to plough up the lawn outside and restore it.  We can afford to run a commission.</P>

Issues now go before a commission and unelected people are telling us how to run the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I fully support the work of committees but there are too many of them.  These committees were set up to mark each Department, although there is no need for that.  Legislation is being passed in committee rooms with two people in a room, which is not the way to do it.  Legislation should be examined in this Chamber and if we must sit on a Friday in order to complete a Committee Stage, let it be so.  Every Member should have a right to the debate and it should be broadcast on radio and television.</P>
        <P>Every year a finance Bill is examined in a committee room and there would be two men and a dog present except the dog would not be allowed in.  Nobody knows what is happening in the debate so it is a complete waste.  We should go back to the days when committees dealt with the heads of a Bill and proposals from the Government.  People can be invited in for their opinions before a report goes to the Government.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister of State considering that sort of reform?  We are currently struggling to get the Lisbon treaty passed.  A very interesting poll was carried out by Eurobarometer which showed that only 40% of the Irish people had any idea how the European institutions work.  In other words, 60% of people openly admitted they did not have a clue how that system works.  I would bet a similar result would emerge from a survey on the workings of this Parliament.  We must use every available technology to educate people on the workings of this Parliament and the European Parliament.</P>

	<P>On the quality of replies, at a meeting earlier this year a representative from the Office of the Information Commissioner spoke on the broader issue of freedom of information, FOI, inquiries.  Some Members complained, as Deputy Barrett has mentioned, that the quality of the information was not adequate.  We have been talking about how we can <Col N="14" />have a better way of dealing with Question Time and so on.  The issue of oral and written questions is different.</P>
        <P>Are we to expect that the same amount of information would be available in a written question as might become available as a result of an FOI inquiry, bearing in mind that there is a longer period available for that?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree and nobody has any difficulty in principle with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.  However, the timeframe for submitting the detail required for all the information is relatively short.  We must consider the matter and I am very conscious of the fact that we need to provide far better quality information everywhere we can.</P>
        <P>We have been trying to explore other issues.  We have questions to the Taoiseach two mornings a week but most people would agree that the current system is not entirely satisfactory.  We need to see if there is a better way for the information requested and topics addressed to be processed in a timely fashion and in a way which would add information to the public domain.</P>
        <P>Deputy Barrett spoke about the number of committees.  As I stated in answer to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the current committees should be allowed to complete their work programme.  Every committee feels it is doing a really good job but we should allow the existing committees complete their work, bearing in mind the cost reductions which have taken place.  A number of committees are time-limited and will automatically cease to operate anyway.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State aware of the recent debate at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, when Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn brought to our attention the fact that Ministers were only answering one part of a question?  The committee agreed wholeheartedly that this should change and asked our officials to draw up Standing Orders to effect the change, which they duly did.  When the new Standing Orders came before us the Minister of State, as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group on the committee, applied a Fianna F&aacute;il whip and voted the matter down without any reason.  The Minister of State will recall that on that occasion, all Fianna F&aacute;il members spoke with one voice &mdash; as if they had a script &mdash; to directly contradict what they said at the previous meeting.  That is what I have been dealing with and that is the reason I am sceptical of what the Minister of State is now saying about D&aacute;il reform.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the important matter of expenses.  The commission has put forward a proposal for a unitary parliamentary allowance to replace the bits and pieces which are now involved in our allowances.  It would be absolutely transparent and everybody would know what is received and why.  The D&aacute;il has passed a Bill to enable its implementation.  Is there any truth in the rumour that the Minister is not doing so because he is afraid some of the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers will revolt if he does?  Perhaps the Minister of State will confirm whether that rumour is true.  If it is not, will he indicate why this is not being done, particularly in view of the fact that the commission agreed to it and the House has already passed enabling legislation?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State provide an assurance that the package of D&aacute;il reforms proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, which is very skimpy in nature and the majority of which favours the parties in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that all reform which comes before the House &mdash; this has certainly been the case during my time as a Member &mdash; favours the parties in Government?  The reason for this is that those in Government refuse to listen to the Opposition.  If a change of Government ever occurs, the latter will hope to treat the former with the same contempt.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State also agree that FOI requests should not be treated as being on an equal footing with parliamentary questions?  Such questions are the best means of obtaining information in these Houses of Parliament.  People with a subjective agenda should not be allowed to equate parliamentary questions with FOI requests.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree that some Departments regard Oireachtas committees as extensions or appendages of themselves?  To work properly, the committee system must operate as part of the Parliament.  These are parliamentary, not departmental, committees and the Department should do nothing other than preparing Ministers to come before them in order to discuss matters with Members.</P>
        <P>When Opposition Members raise matters on the Adjournment, either the relevant Minister does not attend in the House or else a single Minister replies in respect of three or four such matters.  Ultimately, this means that the House is being treated with contempt.  It would be of major assistance if the Government treated the Opposition and the Houses of Parliament with a little respect.  This, in turn, would go a long way towards engendering respect among members of the public for the Houses.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State indicated that Members are being careful with regard to foreign travel.  Is he indicating that Members have become reluctant to or do not want to travel as a result of adverse publicity?  Is this having an impact on Government and State business?

	<P Just="Left">I am sure the T&aacute;naiste would have been as disturbed as I was to read the household budget survey published yesterday which shows that 60% of the 175,000 jobs that have been lost in the past two years were lost by those under the age of 25.  The unemployment rate among this category of people has increased by 17%, which is extraordinary.  Effectively, the lives of 90,000 young people have been placed on hold.  The Government presented some 20 legislative priorities to the D&aacute;il but none of these contains any employment-related proposals.  I would be the first to recognise that noise nuisance, the control of dogs or the levy on plastic bags are important issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  They are major issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely, however, we should be transforming the way we focus on the priority of employment.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate why the consumer and competition Bill, which will deal with the amalgamation of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, will not be published this year?</P>
        <P>Are we still going to have the same archaic debate on the Estimates this year?  Will it be the case that they will be produced on budget day and that the D&aacute;il will not be treated with respect <Col N="17" />by being given the opportunity to debate the choices on offer in advance of decisions being made?  Is it envisaged that there be a change in this process?</P>
        <P>Will it be the case that, as requested by numerous Deputies, the Committee Stage debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill will take place in the Chamber in order that every Member who wishes to participate may do so?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in a crisis situation.  Young people whose futures have been placed on hold are watching our proceedings in order to discover whether the decisions we make will shorten the recession or prolong it.  The matters to which I refer are just three which could be treated as priority changes.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to making these three changes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the legislation relating to the merger of the NCA and the Competition Authority is complicated.  I am putting together the new structure at present.  On the formulation relating thereto, a proposal has been put forward to the effect that we should transfer the consumer side of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s business to the NCA.  That is work in hand.  I am not in a position to state for certain whether this legislation will be available by the end of the year.  That is why I did not pursue the matter with the Whip.  However, I am working to the best of my ability to ensure that the legislation is drawn up.  On the basis of the review that has taken place, our competition law will require some further time to develop.  The matter is in hand and it is my intention to introduce the legislation as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>A decision has not been made in respect of the Committee Stage debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill.  I am not in a position to say otherwise.  In addition, there are as yet no proposals with regard to changes in the Estimates process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to pursue further with the T&aacute;naiste a matter I raised yesterday, namely, the date on which the budget will be introduced.  As she is aware, the date of the budget was moved from January to December.  Since this change was made &mdash; with the exception of last year when the Government introduced the budget in October &mdash; the first Wednesday in December has always been budget day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I asked the T&aacute;naiste yesterday to tell the House when budget day would be, I expected her to state it would be on 2 December.  I was greatly surprised when she appeared to indicate there was some uncertainty about the date of the budget.  The T&aacute;naiste should clarify this issue for the House.  Can she confirm that budget day will be on 2 December and if she is unable to do so, what alternatives are being considered by the Government?  Is it intended to bring the date forward and have it on an earlier date? Will it be on another day on the same week or is <Col N="18" />it intended to put it back?  It is a fairly significant day in the life of the House and the country and I seek clarity in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, Deputy Hogan asked yesterday about the promised local government Bill to give effect to the public commitment by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that there will be a position of directly elected mayor of Dublin and that the election for that office will take place in 2010.  However, as Deputy Hogan pointed out yesterday, the problem is that the requisite promised legislation is not due to be published until 2010, which would make it highly difficult to hold an election in 2010.  Does the Government still intend to hold an election in 2010 for a directly elected mayor of Dublin?  When will the enabling legislation in this regard be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the final question first.  The heads of the legislation pertaining to the Dublin mayoral election will come before the Cabinet before the end of the year and hopefully we will be able to facilitate the passage of the legislation fairly quickly.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill is before the Seanad at present and the Minister proposes to include therein some additional amendments to which he alluded in public.  As for the final decision, Deputy Gilmore asked me a question in this regard yesterday.  The Cabinet will make the decision.  The Cabinet did not meet yesterday and will not meet again until next week.  The Cabinet will decide what date the election or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Regarding the same Minister&rsquo;s portfolio and promised legislation from the Department of Health and Children, I note the recent statement that the HSE is considering the establishment of what has been described as four so-called mini-health boards.  Does that change require legislation?  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware whether legislation is being drafted to facilitate such a change and, if so, when will that proposition come before Members in legislative form in the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised in that area?</P>

	<P>There is no legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the present economic climate, one would assume that a certain urgency would be accorded to matters of financial nature.  The Government&rsquo;s legislation programme contains a proposal &ldquo;to consolidate and modernise financial services legislation in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s Better Regulation agenda&rdquo;.  Its current publication status is &ldquo;not possible to indicate at this stage&rdquo;.  I refer to the financial services regulation Bill, which I would have thought was an urgently required item of legislation that was more important than the control of dogs (amendment) Bill, the Bill pertaining to plastic bags or the other Bills that now have made their way onto the pink paper.  Obviously, the Government thinks otherwise.</P>
        <P>Another highly pertinent item of legislation is &ldquo;to bring greater clarification and simplification to the companies code and to modernise Irish company law through the consolidation of the existing 13 Company Law Acts, other regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Again, under the heading &ldquo;publication expected&rdquo; it is stated that this is &ldquo;not possible to indicate at this stage&rdquo;.  I refer to the company law consolidation and reform Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question of the T&aacute;naiste about these Bills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste not agree that both legislative items are urgently required at this time and are far more urgent than is the control of dogs (amendment) Bill or the Bill on plastic bags or the other items proposed on the pink paper?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the company law Bill, that legislation contains 1,270 sections and a great deal of work has been under way in my Department.  As soon as I am in a position to bring forward the legislation to this House, I will do so.  On the issue of the financial services regulation Bill, there are 250 financial instruments and 50 Acts to be brought together, which constitutes a seismic amount of work.</P>

We are doing all we can to get the legislation on the floor of this House as quickly as we can, but the most important thing is to present legislation that is correct.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the comments of An Taisce and the environmental aspects of NAMA.  The body referred to large scale overzoning in the country, a matter to which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, referred.  An Taisce stated that over zoning and the banks childish lending policies have inevitably lead to the present crisis and hundreds of thousands of empty properties, half finished projects, planning permissions and acres of zoned land.  An Taisce also makes an interesting point about the potential for land swaps, where amenities such as parks, sports facilities and allotments could be provided.  A number of Deputies have referred to this and I welcome the comments made in this regard.</P>
        <P>An Taisce also objected to extension of the life of planning permissions, saying this should not be accepted.  I do not agree with this point because in many situations an extension to the life of planning permission would be of great benefit.  I am thinking of a school in County Galway, work on which was able to proceed because some work had been started before the end of the five-year planning permission.  In a five-year period it is sometimes difficult to start projects before the planning permission comes to an end.  I welcome some of the points made but we need to re-examine the matter of planning permission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the group of 46 economists at third level colleges who do not agree with NAMA.  The point was made by Dr. Alan Ahearne that 250 economists were contacted.  If 46 signed up to a position against NAMA, more than 200 economists did not do so.  We all agree that the main issue is to get the banking system working.  I welcome this Bill.  We must be in a position to benefit from the upturn in the world economy in the future.  Some countries in Europe and in the United States are beginning to recovery economically.  If we do not have our house in order we will lose jobs and market share.  I hope we will be in a position to take advantage of the global market in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  In an economic context this legislation is the most important to come before the House in many years.  In the debate in the House we are getting to the bottom of the challenges that face the country.  Some of the commentary over the summer was unhelpful, misleading, misguided and based on populist party politics but at least we are getting to the nub of the problems facing this country in the context of the supply of credit and addressing the impaired balance sheets of our financial institutions. </P>
        <P>Last September, the Government provided a guarantee to depositors and lenders of the systemically important banks in Ireland.  This was a brave decision, supported by some but not <Col N="25" />all parties in this House.  Unfortunately, people used the opportunity to go down the populist route but we are all very well aware of the difficulties that we face as an economy, particularly the financial institutions in the country which are its lifeblood as they provide credit to small and medium sized businesses and to people who want to purchase homes or want access to credit.  This is why we are here debating the National Asset Management Agency Bill, which is critical to address the impaired balance sheets of the systemically important banks.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Minister for Finance outlined how NAMA will work in the context of valuations of loans and the percentage of haircut on the loans.  More importantly, we must accept one premise.  The lending that went on prior to the difficulties was, in a way, irresponsible but it was based in a time of continued growth and access to cheap credit internationally, and the banks were using wholesale money markets to borrow credit in the short term for long-term lending into the property market in Ireland.  That was fine until the international credit crisis occurred.  It is a bit disingenuous for people to point out that all of these difficulties are as a direct result of Government policies of recent years.  If the international credit crisis had not occurred the property market in this country would have had a softer landing.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the context of our property bubble that had evolved. </P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important to point out that the euro has been a saving grace in the context of ensuring that we had access to the European Central Bank which provided liquidity into the Irish market and that has had a stabilising effect in itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody else would lend the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>For many reasons, the Bill shows the importance of the debate we are having on the Lisbon treaty and the decision the Irish people will make on 2 October.  That is an aside but it is critical to point out that the European Central Bank has stepped in to ensure that there is liquidity in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>The major banks were capitalised and &euro;3.5 billion was provided to two major institutions.  That allowed the banks to try to open up credit supplies to small and medium enterprises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Which they did not do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Much more has to be done on this but everybody inside and outside the House knows that until such time as the impaired balance sheets of the banks are addressed their access to wholesale money markets and lending will also be impaired.  I urge people debating this legislation not to make throwaway flippant remarks such as &ldquo;bail out the bankers and builders&rdquo;.  We all know the difficulties we are in but the parties using lines about bailouts know well, as the Minister for Finance outlined on a number of occasions for those who want to listen, that people who owed money to the banks will owe the same amount to the National Asset Management Agency and they will have to pay it back or be pursued for default in the normal way.  These populist lines do not do justice to the seriousness of the debate before the House.</P><Col N="26" />
        <P>Approximately two-thirds of the properties involved are in Ireland, one fifth are in Great Britain and 6% are in Northern Ireland.  The remainder of the properties that will be taken into NAMA are in the United States and Europe.  A view is being expressed that this is bailing out developers who invested abroad.  However, if there is recovery in those economies those assets will inflate in value.  Not having all its eggs in the Irish market could be of assistance to NAMA and we should acknowledge that if there is a recovery in parts of Europe or in the United States it may assist in inflating the value of the loans that NAMA is taking on.</P>
        <P>We must also acknowledge that some of the lending practices, not only in property development but in all credit, were not done in a sustainable way.  People purchasing homes received mortgages of 103% and 105% and stamp duty, car loans and credit loans were rolled into them and that is an unacceptable practice.  On another day we must discuss how we as a society should lend to people.</P>
        <P>The Bill is very important.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I travel abroad and there is an acceptance outside of Ireland that we are dealing with this in a structured and managed way.  It has been complimented by the European Central Bank and the IMF and many commentators throughout the world have stated that Ireland is making critical decisions and is going the right way to address the problems we face in our financial institutions.</P>
        <P>Some parties take the view that nationalisation is the appropriate measure as if it were a free ride and that the taxpayer would not be exposed to any risk.  As we all know, the opposite is the case; if the banks were nationalised the full exposure would be on the Irish taxpayer.  Simplistic views are expressed that there are easier ways to address the difficulties but there are no easy ways to address this and when we have these debates we should debate with honesty and integrity knowing well that there are no easy options in trying to address the huge problems we face.</P>
        <P>In recent times we had huge contraction in the Irish economy and projections are for a 9% contraction this year and 3.5% next year.  However, there is evidence to suggest that the rate of contraction is slowing.  That is no comfort to the many thousands of people losing their jobs and those who have lost them but at some stage this recession must bottom out and there is evidence to suggest that this is approaching faster than was anticipated in projections by the Government and commentary in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>We are quickly becoming more competitive.  We are an open trading economy and we live or die by our exports.  Recently, there has been a major restructuring downwards of labour unit costs in the broader economy.  While that might create certain difficulties for workers and employees, it adds to our competitiveness.  Recent trade figures suggest we are regaining competitiveness in the international markets.  Over the coming months, if we see signs of recovery in the French or German economies or other large economies into which we trade it will provide huge potential for us to gain market share in those areas.</P>
        <P>We would all prefer if were not discussing this Bill because the difficulties we face had not come about.  However, they are present and the Government has dealt with them resolutely.  It has had a clear strategy since the brave decision on 29 September last year on the guarantee of the banks.  That was very important as we would not be debating banking issues if that guarantee was not put in place because there would have been a systemic collapse of the major banking institutions in the country.  That would have had profound implications for the broader economy, jobs and opportunities.</P>
        <P>While we discuss this it is important to acknowledge that some commentators have stated recently that the National Asset Management Agency is the way to go and that other options proposed by political parties, while put forward with the right ideas in mind, cannot address <Col N="27" />the problems we are trying to address to ensure credit flows to small and medium sized businesses and to people who want to purchase homes.  The Taoiseach clearly stated that is the only motivation for proposing this Bill and those who continually slur the integrity of the Government by stating it is a bailout for developers and builders are not being fair and honest in their assessment.  This is about addressing the problems in the financial services to allow credit to flow to the broader economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this legislation which I believe is the crime of the century.  It will be unmatched in the history of this State or any state in Europe.  The only reason the ECB is bailing out the banks here or putting up the money that the taxpayer is underwriting is because nobody else in the international financial markets will touch it.  They know the banking system here is still corrupt to the core.  They know that many of the boards and even the executives who were in place when all of this carry-on was happening are still in place now.  The Minister of State is right to state that if it was not for the ECB there would be a significantly different problem facing the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The proposed NAMA Bill represents a project of such magnitude that it should not be undertaken without the consent of the people.  This Bill cannot be treated like an annual budgetary matter.  It is not an annual budgetary matter.  It is taking in &euro;40,000 plus from every family in this State without their permission.  The Minister of State and the Government do not have a mandate to do that.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is misleading the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State does not believe this is a bailout for bankers.  It is a bailout for bankers and speculators, and I will explain why.  I will deal with the bankers first.  The estimation the Minister for Finance gave to this House last week was that there is approximately &euro;88 billion in toxic loans but, of course, he used the atrocious term &ldquo;hair cut&rdquo;.  It is back down to a 47% reduction from the &euro;88 billion which is a figure of approximately &euro;47 billion for the value of the loans.</P>
        <P>Like me and everyone here, the Minister of State knows that if one buys a property anywhere in the world, the first question the lending institution will ask will concern the market value of the property.  That is what people will go by.  They will not ask about one&rsquo;s expectation of the long-term economic value of the property.  Any lending institution would laugh at one if one submitted such a notion.</P>
        <P>How can we guess the current market value in this State?  There is only one piece of solid evidence on which one can rely and it relates to the Carroll-Zoe application to the High Court for protection.  ACC Bank is pursuing the Carroll-Zoe group.  Zoe agreed, and the judges in <Col N="28" />the High Court and the Supreme Court accepted, that in the event of a fire sale of the properties, the market value would probably be of the order of 25%.</P>
        <P>Why are we paying exorbitant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money?  People have their backs to the wall, they are losing their jobs, their homes are being foreclosed on and they are threatened with losing their family homes, yet we are shovelling money from these people &mdash; low and middle income families &mdash; to support corrupt bankers.  This part of our history will be looked on with significant sadness in generations to come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We talk about nationalising the banks but do not put forward nationalisation as a simplistic measure.  It is not simplistic; it is a complex measure but a tried and tested one which has been implemented in many states on numerous occasions.  It is important this State has a state bank.  If we had a state bank which operated with honesty and integrity and did not engage in the carry-on of these corrupt bankers, we would not be in this mess because we could have measured the carry-on of other bankers against the proper measures of a state bank.  It is a bailout by any measure for corrupt bankers.  It legalises and rewards corruption and it should not happen.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Carroll-Zoe group of companies, I refer to another document put forward which is of interest in this debate and should be mentioned.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January.  It is the Government&rsquo;s and the taxpayers&rsquo; bank.  It is a state bank owned and controlled by the State.  According to papers lodged with the High Court and the Supreme Court, Anglo Irish Bank submitted a document stating that it would continue to employ Carroll companies to build its new headquarters in south Dublin at a cost of &euro;68 million.  Some &euro;68 million is being spent on a new headquarters for the most toxic zombie bank on the face of the earth.  How can the Minister of State justify that?  Why has the Government not told Anglo Irish Bank to wise up, that it will not get new palatial headquarters with a cushion for its bum, that it is all right where it is for the moment and that it will not transfer &euro;65 million to it for fine new headquarters?  It is scandalous that is being allowed to happen.  That bank is under the direct control of the Government which can move to stop that nonsense.</P>
        <P>I compare that to the north-east region, and I do not mean counties Antrim, Down and Armagh.  In this context, I refer to Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan where there has been a health crisis for decades.  There is a proposal to build a regional hospital but it cannot proceed because no funding is available to build it.  However, there is funding to the tune of &euro;68 million available to build a new headquarters for Anglo Irish Bank in south Dublin.  Somebody needs to look at what is going on because I find that obnoxious in the extreme.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is from Fianna F&aacute;il but the other party in government is the Green Party.  What is the Green Party doing?  Every now and again it sends a Senator out to the plinth to throw shapes, as Christy Moore would have said, at the media and threaten what it will do with the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il and whether the party will walk out of, or stay in, government.  As soon as he finishes throwing shapes, he hurries back into the other House, as do his colleagues in this House, to vote with the Government.</P>
        <P>Despite all its fine rhetoric when it was on this side of the House a couple of years ago, the Green Party has lost its social conscience and lost sight of the needs of ordinary people.  It does not care whether children get a proper education or whether people in need of health care get it.  I do not know where Christy Moore is at the moment but I hope he is noting what is going on in this State because he would write some ballad to cover this episode of our history.  I hope if he is about he will do so and record it very soon.</P>
        <P>The Green Party told us it will ensure equal sharing of the risk between the bankers and the taxpayer.  To me, that means 50:50 sharing of the risk but the Green Party has agreed to the <Col N="29" />taxpayer taking on 95% of the risk and the bankers taking on 5%.  It is throwing some shapes.  That is some equality in the sharing.  Members of the Green Party are some bunch.</P>
        <P>This is a bailout for the bankers.  Where is the bailout for ordinary people?  Where is the bailout for people who have lost their jobs, who are struggling to feed and clothe their families and who are probably facing foreclosure on their homes?  Where is the bailout for that category?  What is the Government doing to deal with those people who are at their wits&rsquo; end to try to feed their families and to survive?  I see nothing from this Government to deal with the needs of those people and the crisis they face.</P>
        <P>I watched a programme on television on Monday evening last.  There were two people on the panel &mdash; one represented the bankers and the other the developers.  They were two interesting characters.  Eamon Dunphy, commentator and media personality, pointed out that one of them was a former Fianna F&aacute;il national secretary and the other, Tom Parlon, a former Minister of State.  That demonstrates a firm connection between politicians, bankers and developers.  While that extremely unhealthy triangle exists, we cannot expect anything different from this Government and that needs to change.  That culture is innate but at long last I believe the people have copped on to it.  I hope they have an opportunity shortly in a general election to deal with that issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said NAMA is not a bailout for the speculators and the developers.  Why does the Bill state that not only will it give speculators money to help them finish their projects but NAMA will become partners with the speculators in finishing unfinished developments?  That sounds like a bailout for developers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Up to this point the Minister of State has shown no concern for the plasterers, electricians or anyone else.  He has had scant regard for the very people I referred to a few moments ago.  Where is the NAMA for these the ordinary people?  What is the Minister of State doing about them?  He should not say he is worried about them because he is not.  If they are cannon fodder to help bail out the speculators and developers, so be it.  However, he cannot tell me this legislation is not a bailout for developers.  It is in this legislation that speculators and developers will get funds from NAMA to bail them out.  That tells me everything I need to know about the bailout aspect of this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where are the crooks, particularly those in the banking sector, who were behind this scam?  A visitor from space would be convinced these people would be jailed in Mountjoy or Portlaoise prisons but they are not.  Instead, they are in their palatial homes swanning around in their jets and helicopters.  This crisis is not impacting on them at all.  We have even seen one of them walk away with a pension of &euro;27 million and a &euro;1 million bonus.  When will we see the result of inquiries into these characters?  When will we see them held to account for their part together with the Government and the speculators who created this mess in the first instance?</P>
        <P>I accept there is an international dimension to this financial crisis.  However, we are in a much worse mess than any other country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;because of the operation of the Government&rsquo;s banks, regulators and policies, above all else.  This NAMA business is not some neutral enterprise that will not <Col N="30" />impact on education, health care provision and looking after our pensioners.  It will impact on these because every euro spent underwriting NAMA will be a cost to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of its costs, I do not believe NAMA will work.  At least with nationalisation of the banks there would be a sure-footedness in approach.  It would provide an instant control to ensure the credit stream goes to SMEs and those who want to develop the economy again.  However, as we know, there will be no NAMA for ordinary people.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s opposition to NAMA is clear.  It is not the solution to our banking crisis.  It is too costly and too risky.  The only correct solution is nationalisation of the main banks and from these creating a State bank that will operate in the interest of would-be home owners and small businesses.</P>
        <P>Unlike Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in has no agenda of protecting elites who have bankrupted us while continuing to enjoy affluent lifestyles, who have left us with a legacy of ghost housing estates on the edge of our towns, reminiscent of Famine villages.  We will stand up for the ordinary people who want action to address the fact that their homes are in negative equity, who want jobs to be created, who need credit to keep their business afloat and who want to see those responsible for this economic crisis held to account.</P>
        <P>We need to aspire to a better future, not a return to some less extravagant version of the Celtic tiger.  It has to involve dealing with the legacy of the corruption and malpractice of the Celtic tiger, writing off the negative equity portion of the mortgages of those on average and low incomes, redistributing land and housing developments which will be foreclosed on for the public good, social housing, schools, play facilities and other public needs.  It has to involve providing education, training and alternative employment particularly for those who were tempted out of education to make their living in the booming construction sector.  It has to involve the establishment of a State bank that would support productive entrepreneurial activity over useless greedy speculation and be ethical in its lending practices.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance need to ask themselves why the people do not trust the Government or NAMA.  Is it because people believe the economic crisis was caused by the policies this Government pursued?  Is it because this Government stood over cheering on and incentivising the reckless greed of developers and the malpractice of bankers?  Is it because they know this Government has done nothing as thousands have lost their jobs but is willing to intervene to save the ill-gotten gains of property developers?</P>
        <P>It is against the background of repeated lies by this Government that we have to judge the proposition with which we are presented.  It lied about the state of the economy in advance of and after the 2007 general election.  The Fianna F&aacute;il 2007 general election manifesto was a pack of lies.  The Government party had access to information about the state of the economy but chose to mislead and bluff the public.  It misled people when it said no one warned about the implications of the property bubble and the economy&rsquo;s overdependency on construction.  It lied when claiming there is no alternative.  There are alternatives but the Government does not want to know them because they are not bailouts.</P>
        <P>The response of this Government to those of us who raised questions repeatedly about the need to address soaring house prices was to ridicule any suggestion that a property bubble was developing.  How often did we hear the words &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo;?  Ministers who said there were no affordability problems were telling bare-faced lies.  It is ordinary people in negative equity and now facing repossession who are paying the price for those lies.</P>

Those of us who stood against tax and PRSI cuts because we knew taxes had already been cut to an unsustainable level were told we were economically illiterate.  Fine Gael and Labour have some cheek attacking Fianna F&aacute;il now when their own populist policies would have led us down the same route.  The media must examine its role in protecting Fianna F&aacute;il by attacking those who sought to challenge the Government&rsquo;s economic policies.</P>
        <P>We have a long way to go on this legislation.  I will oppose it at every opportunity.  The NAMA model is unnecessary and the wrong approach.  There is a much better option for the people and the next generation.  Nationalisation would be expensive but it would be &euro;10 billion to &euro;15 billion cheaper than the NAMA option.  It would be a much more sure-footed approach, would do what it says on the tin and do so quickly when NAMA will still be examining toxic loans in the middle of next year.  The banks have already said this will be a long process, that lending will not start quickly and some businesses will go to the wall.  That is unacceptable and I will oppose the NAMA legislation on every Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il in government has made a series of critical decisions over the past year to tackle the largest challenge faced since the foundation of the State.  To date the Government bank guarantee, the &euro;7 billion recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, have all been vital in stabilising the banking sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s approach to the banking crisis is along the lines adopted in Sweden in the early 1990s when its government introduced a state guarantee without which its banking system would have collapsed with dire consequences for the Swedish economy.  It did not involve blanket nationalisation of the banks despite claims to the contrary.  Only one private bank, Gota, was fully nationalised which happened only after it had collapsed.  The Swedish Government also took full control of the already largely State-owned, some 77%, Nordbanken.  All the banks remained in private hands.  Sweden then transferred the impaired loans to bad banks to clear the banks&rsquo; balance sheets.  This prevented a fire sale of properties and delivered an orderly resolution to the crisis.</P>
        <P>The establishment of NAMA is the critical development that will create a functioning banking system and return the banks to liquidity, as happened in Sweden.  NAMA will have significant success.  The banks will be lending to the real economy by Christmas and will begin to make a profit for the taxpayer.  The value to be paid has been defined under the EU framework as the long-term economic value.  That means that NAMA cannot pay more than it expects to realise from the loans over its lifetime.  There has been much misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the application of the long-term economic value to the present market valuation of property.</P>
        <P>In a normally functioning property market, price corresponds to the long-term value of property.  In the past six years speculative forces here drove market prices through the roof and as a result they did not correspond to the long-term economic value.  This ignorance of the long-term economic value caused by speculative gain in property prices caused the problems in our property sector.  If people had been paying what corresponded to long-term economic value the bubble would have been avoided.  On the same principle, current property prices do not correspond to long-term economic value.  In the same way as upward forces distorted market prices between 2003-07, market prices are distorted now and will continue on a downward spiral and, consequently, there is a need for an adjustment to reflect the inevitable recovery in the market.  That is the long-term economic value.</P>
        <P>There is a well-informed article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> entitled, &ldquo;Nama will do the business&rdquo; by Bill Nowlan, a chartered surveyor.  He writes that he had been concerned that <Col N="32" />the economic value premium over the current market values would be set at a much higher level but adds that as an asset manager, with more than 40 years experience, he believes &ldquo;15 per cent over 10 years is an achievable target, particularly with ultra-low funding.&rdquo;  This is one of the best articles I have read on NAMA.  It is well-informed and written by somebody who has worked for a lifetime in the business.  It is worthwhile reading for anyone who wants a good understanding of how NAMA will work.</P>
        <P>The bonds the banks receive from NAMA in payment for the loans they purchase can be exchanged for cash at the ECB at 1.5%.  NAMA transforms illiquid assets, loans for property, on the balance sheets of banks into liquid assets, bonds, which will result in an injection of tens of billions of euro in cash from the ECB into the banking system and the economy.  It is a stimulus package, similar to the quantitative easing packages used in the United States and Britain that we cannot use because our currency is the euro.</P>
        <P>Deputy Lee stated in a debate with me some weeks ago on Morning Ireland that the taxpayer would fund NAMA.  That is nonsense.  NAMA will be self-financing as it will have its own income stream through the collection of interest due from the good loan assets transferred to it.  Proceeds from the eventual sale of the underlying assets will also accrue to NAMA and be used to pay off the bonds.  NAMA&rsquo;s projections for property prices over the next decade or so will be prudent and realistic.  To counter the misinformation put about by the Opposition parties it is important to note that there will be a forensic valuation of every loan that NAMA takes over.  If losses do occur the taxpayer will be protected by one or more risk-sharing mechanisms.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 31 August, NAMA will not pay anything other than the current market value for certain assets, where this is the appropriate approach.  John Mulcahy, the valuer who has been seconded to NAMA, confirmed this when he said that NAMA will pay for development land in many areas at its agricultural value.</P>
        <P>It is also alleged that NAMA is a bail-out or rescue for builders or developers.  This is simply not true.  Developers who currently owe money to the banks will continue to owe that money to NAMA.  Furthermore, as the Minister for Finance has confirmed, developers who are insolvent will be liquidated and NAMA will have the full range of remedies already available to the banking system, including repossession, enforcement of mortgages, the appointment of a receiver and the liquidation of companies.</P>
        <P>If NAMA cannot recover the loans, the banks, not the taxpayer, will be penalised.  We will see several liquidations of major property companies before Christmas.  That is the first thing NAMA will be required to do in taking over loans where the losses have already accrued and the companies or individuals involved are insolvent.  It is significant that 30% of the loans transferring to NAMA have been made on properties in the US, the UK and Europe.  The US is already showing signs of recovery and the trend is for recovery to follow in Ireland and the UK.  We can expect to see a significant improvement in the NAMA loan book over the short to medium term as a result of the international diversity of the properties involved.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael, and Deputy Lee in particular, have been advocating letting the banks struggle on for another year before setting up a national asset management agency in September 2010.  Does the Deputy not understand that businesses and families around the country cannot wait for another year, that we desperately need to get credit flowing now?  Fine Gael&rsquo;s new &ldquo;magic&rdquo; wholesale bank would supposedly receive &euro;2 billion in capital from the taxpayer and could borrow &euro;40 billion from the ECB.  This is nonsense because the ECB demands collateral.  The magic bank would have to raise deposits, and these would almost certainly comprise funds <Col N="33" />withdrawn from the current banks.  Alternatively, the State would have to provide the magic bank with &euro;50 billion to &euro;60 billion in bonds.  There would be no benefit to the economy, since the banks have access to the ECB.</P>
        <P>A central part of the Fine Gael plan is to set up legacy banks as a way to default on senior bond holders of Irish banks.  The bulk of these senior bonds are held by pension funds, insurance companies and credit unions and are covered by the bank guarantee.  Defaulting on senior bonds would dry up funding for Irish banks and for the State.  Many of those who hold high-risk bonds, subordinated debt, have already incurred large losses.  All three banks have already bought back up to &euro;4 billion worth of subordinated debt at a significant loss to the debt holders.  International experience shows that the failure of a bank would leave businesses and individuals at the loss of their savings, undermine confidence in the banking system in general and cause serious damage to a whole economy, requiring even greater State intervention to fix.</P>
        <P>I had a high regard for Deputy Lee when he was an economic commentator on RTE.  What a disappointment he has proved to be since becoming a Member of this House.  The Fine Gael proposal has blown up in his face and the Irish public has seen through it.  It is quite easy to understand that no credit bureau would lend to one who had previously defaulted on a loan.  If one defaults on a car loan, one&rsquo;s credit history is damaged.  Similarly, if one defaults to international lenders in one bank, those lenders are not likely to lend to one at another bank.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has further shown its ignorance of the issue at hand by comparing its proposal with the French financing corporation, the SFEF.  It does not seem to realise that a similar entity here would be completely redundant.  The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Financement de l&rsquo;Economie Fran&ccedil;aise, SFEF, is 66% owned by the French banks.  It requires that the banks provide collateral against the loans it makes.  A SFEF-type entity here would not make any loans because the Irish banks have already used their collateral to borrow from the European Central Bank.  In addition, French banks can issue their own bonds but because France does not have a State guarantee scheme those bonds are not Government guaranteed.  The SFEF is therefore a mechanism to provide a State guarantee to the funding of banks.  There are other differences between the French financing corporation and Fine Gael&rsquo;s wholesale bank.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s bank supposedly would attain funds from the ECB while the SFEF raises funds from wholesale markets, not the ECB.</P>
        <P>In what was a very disappointing speech the other day, Deputy Enda Kenny mentioned the proposal made by Dermot Desmond in <i>The Irish Times</i> as being similar to Fine Gael&rsquo;s magic bank.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Dermot Desmond&rsquo;s proposal was simply an insurance scheme designed to help bank shareholders.  Although I do not disagree with much of what Dermot Desmond has to say, his proposal for an insurance scheme would not work in this country.  It was examined and found not to be successful because it would leave the banks with the same problem they now have, whereas NAMA tackles the problem upfront and deals with the issue of liquidity.  Unfortunately, Dermot Desmond&rsquo;s proposal would not.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s negativity in the debate has been the most misguided of all.  Deputy Eamon Gilmore may have left the Workers Party behind but he took some of its policies with him to the Labour Party.  Nationalising the banks in a pre-emptive strike, ending bank guarantees &mdash; one of the worst decisions taken by a political party in this country since I came to this House &mdash; and giving the &ldquo;two fingers&rdquo; to pensioners who have lost everything in the crash are more like the work of Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s radical days when he was the president of UCG Students&rsquo; Union than the stuff of an aspiring statesman.</P>
        <P>In a debate last autumn I brought to the House&rsquo;s attention the international headlines that were fuelled by the irresponsible comments of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Those head<Col N="34" />lines have cost us dearly.  The cost of borrowing for Ireland has rocketed.  Anyone who has looked at Indecon&rsquo;s recent report on the Lisbon treaty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Anyone who has looked at Indecon&rsquo;s recent report on the Lisbon treaty will see how the cost of borrowing has fluctuated wildly during the past year.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, may need to consider careful monitoring to ensure, when the banks get back to lending and confidence flows again, that people will be able to borrow as cheaply as possible, and that no excessive margins are made by the banks on money they are borrowing cheaply because of our sovereign guarantees.  I am anxious to see some form of oversight being put in place on Committee Stage to ensure that banks act responsibly in the interest of the taxpayer as well as that of their shareholders.  I am very concerned by what I understand to be the policy of AIB to propose increasing interest rates to 4% above the cost of funds.  That is not acceptable to this House and the Minister for Finance must take on AIB on this issue.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, some weeks ago I asked that Permanent TSB be brought in to explain why it has put up its interest rates.  It is coming in today.  I asked this morning that AIB and Bank of Ireland be brought before the committee to explain what their interest rate policy will be when they receive as much as &euro;20 billion in funds between now and Christmas.</P>
        <P>Although I understand well that the Minister for Finance and politicians cannot interfere with banking or the market, it is very important that the interests of the taxpayer are paramount in the new regime in Irish banking.  There is a need for a culture change in Irish banking and I agree with what Deputy Michael Noonan said yesterday.  There is a need for the Irish banking system to be honest.  It has not been so on a number of occasions when its representatives spoke to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  There is a need for significant reform in the banking system and for fundamental change in its management.  I sincerely hope that an outsider will be brought in to become the managing director of AIB.</P>
        <P>The speeches of the leaders of the Opposition parties in the debate last week reflect the bankruptcy of their ideals.  The negativity of their contributions was breathtaking and demonstrated an absence of moral fibre regarding the needs of the country.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are looking for and expecting an election in the near future.  God only knows what sort of solution they would bring forward to deal with our banking difficulties.  They are so diametrically opposed in their proposed solutions that it is difficult to see how they could come together on the issue.  I refer to the pre-emptive nationalisation proposed by the Labour Party along with de-listing from the Stock Exchange while, at the same time, a magic bank is proposed by Fine Gael which will find funny money in some location.  This Government has not been popular in recent times but when one looks at the alternative proposed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party the ability of those parties to take on the difficult decisions that are now necessary to bring us through this crisis is called into question.</P>
        <P>This is in stark contrast to the position taken by the Green Party.  Our Government colleagues have had issues with NAMA but instead of wallowing in negativity like Fine Gael and <Col N="35" />the Labour Party, the Green Party has been constructive and in my view has improved the proposals significantly with its contributions.  I agree with these proposals and I commend the party on the responsible approach it has taken.  In view of much of what has now been put across by the Minister for Finance, there is no need to worry about some of the concerns individual members of the Green Party have expressed.  These are the facts of the matter as opposed to the irresponsible and inaccurate claims made by the Opposition.</P>
        <P>The Government has the right plan for recovery. As the International Monetary Fund stated in June, the policies are right.  What is needed for recovery now is a determined execution of NAMA and for the Government to get on with its budgetary plans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with some astonishment to what Deputy Fahey had to say, particularly his critique of the Fine Gael Party and other Opposition parties.  The truth is that Deputy Fahey should hang his head in shame in this House in that he is a member of a party which, after 12 years in office, has brought this country to its knees.  It presides over and is responsible for the greatest economic calamity in the history of this State.  Deputy Fahey&rsquo;s concluding comments were especially interesting.  I would say to the Green Party to beware of the embrace of Deputy Fahey and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.  The Deputy&rsquo;s praise for the amendments the Green Party seeks to the NAMA legislation makes it absolutely clear that he and his colleagues believe the Green Party has no influence or impact.  </P>
        <P>We are debating this Bill for a very specific reason.  Reckless banking, grotesque regulatory failure, ministerial and Government incompetence and a betrayal of the public interest lay at the heart of our economic and banking crisis.  Bank directors are directly responsible.  They were obsessed by personal status, dividends and salary or, as some liked to put it in more highfaluting terms, &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;, for lording over banks in directors&rsquo; boardrooms.  They were more concerned with their own self interest than in ensuring the continued viability of the banks of which they were directors.  Due to their irresponsibility, not a single person in any of the covered institutions who was a director in our banks prior to 2008 should today sit in the boardroom of a single bank.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Institutional investors also have a case to answer.  Institutional investors who administer pension schemes and who dominate the annual general meetings of public companies and who are paid excessive fees for managing pension funds clearly took their eye off the ball.  They were more in cahoots with the directors of the banks than they were interested in protecting the interests of pension-holders and the pension funds they administered.  They failed to exercise any proper due diligence on behalf of those who contributed pension moneys on an annual basis to ensure that the products in which they were investing truly reflected the real value being given to them on the stock markets.</P>
        <P>With regard to developers, arrogance, greed, hubris replaced all relevant commercial principle.  They boasted not about which of them could secure the most commercially astute and viable deal but about which of them could raise the biggest loan.  Bankers, with an eye on their bonuses, chased after developers across the length and breadth of this country with the enthusiasm of the Viagra salesman stalking the over-70s.</P>
        <P>Deputy Fahey talked in this House as if Fianna F&aacute;il has not been in Government for the past twelve and a half years.  Political accountability for where we now find ourselves, political accountability to this House for the gross incompetence, not just of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments but also of the present Government, is something that neither Fianna F&aacute;il nor the Green Party is able to recognise or respect.</P>
        <P>Deputy Brian Cowen as Minister for Finance, will go down in history as the worst Minister for Finance who ever held office in the State.  He sleepwalked through four years in office as <Col N="36" />bank lending expanded to an unprecedented level, property prices grew to insane levels and public sector expenditure increased to an entirely unsustainable level.  Expenditure substantially in the years from 2003 onwards depended on stamp duty received as a consequence of the growing property bubble.  As Minister for Finance he essentially became addicted not just to property but to annual increase in property values to meet the totally insane and unsustainable levels of public expenditure over which he had ministered.</P>
        <P>Then as the hurricane clouds appeared on the horizon, as Minister for Finance he remained in denial of imminent disaster.  In his 2007 budget, when property had stopped selling, when it was absolutely clear that the stamp duty on which the State was so reliant for meeting public expenditure was going to dry up, he increased current expenditure by 10%.  That was done by a Government of which the Green Party was part and where two Green Ministers sat in Cabinet.  The difficulties which confront the State today are compounded, not just by the foolish budgetary decisions made in 2007 but by the state of paralysis which Deputy Cowen, both as Minister for Finance and then as Taoiseach, seemed to be locked into throughout 2008.  As piecemeal decisions were made to confront the increasing economic difficulties and public sector expenditure, no overall coherent strategy was ever articulated as to where the State was going.  Outside of dealing with the issue of NAMA and the banking difficulties which confront us, it is still not clear what, if any strategy the present Government has.</P>
        <P>The New Orleans and Irish experience have uncanny similarities.  As the hurricane approached New Orleans, George Bush first ignored the danger signals and warnings and when the levees broke and the city was flooded, he went into denial and failed to act until far too late.  As the economic and banking tsunami approached our shores, Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Finance, ignored the danger signals and warnings and when our financial levees broke, he went into denial and it has taken him far too long to act to try and protect jobs and to ensure that we make the structural changes necessary to stabilise our economic system and to travel down the road to recovery.  As a consequence, there are now almost 450,000 unemployed and we heard yesterday that net emigration is taking place from our shores for the first time for well over a decade.</P>
        <P>There is an essential need to get credit and liquidity flowing into our economy.  The Fine Gael critique of the NAMA legislation which Deputy Fahey ignored is that there is nothing in the legislation which guarantees that credit will start flowing, that small and medium-sized businesses will be able to access the funds they require to remain in business and preserve jobs.  There is no guarantee of any description that when funds are made available to the banks, the banks will not simply retain those funds to improve their capital position.  There is nothing in the legislation that will ensure that within the next 12 months there will be any major economic change in the state of this country because of the timeframe that will be required after this legislation has passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; as seems inevitable with the support of the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.  It will take very many months for the structure prescribed by NAMA to bring about the effect intended of making funds available to our banks to even test whether there is any reality in their increasing liquidity and credit.  There is a real timeframe problem with this proposal which Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal for a good bank addresses and which would facilitate liquidity flowing at a far earlier point than is even envisaged in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P>With regard to the financial institutions that are being bailed out, 40% of the borrowings relate to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Both are basket cases, neither of which will provide credit or liquidity to the business sector.  These are two banks, operated by chairmen and chief executives in the shape of Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and Mr. Michael Fingleton as if they were Russian oligarchs running financial institutions and manipul<Col N="37" />ating those institutions for their own personal benefit.  Reckless banking is at the very heart of our economic collapse and the origins of the property bubble commenced in 2002 to 2003.  Anglo Irish Bank was the rogue bank which led the way and the rest, like sheep, subsequently followed.  In the period 2002 to 2003, ratios of loans to customer deposits started to rise and then continued to rise beyond anything sustainable.  Basic banking and regulatory prudential principle meant that the ratio of loans to customer deposits should have been maintained in the region of 80% to 90% but from 2003 onwards such principles were totally abandoned.  Exceeding 90% meant exposing the liquidity and solvency position of a bank but from 2003 onwards, Irish banks turned to highly volatile inter-bank markets to obtain inter-bank deposits.  As Peter Matthews pointed out in last Sunday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, analysis of the most up to date published accounts of the six Irish banks and building societies reveals loan to customer deposit ratios rose to their current weighted average of 173%, far above the 100% maximum limit.  The scale of the failure on the part of the banks, their directors and regulators, is breathtaking.  This failure also lies at the door of a Minister for Finance in the shape of the current Taoiseach who should have listened to the warnings being voiced by those who knew better but who chose to ignore them.  In conjunction with other members of his party, he chose to deride and abuse anyone who suggested that the level of borrowing from our banks, the extent of the property bubble and the level of borrowings which individuals were having made available to them were creating a huge problem.</P>
        <P>Now we have the NAMA proposal and the concept within it of long-term economic value.  This has been discussed at great length in this debate.  It is difficult enough in the current climate to ascertain the current market value of a property.  Long-term market value is nothing other than hope value.  Various factors, detailed in the legislation and draft regulations, to which regard is to be had to determine long-term economic value are the same factors which so-called experts relied on to tell us, in 2005 and 2006, that Irish property values were reasonable and based on true market value and that if there was any cyclical change there would be a soft landing.  Long-term economic value is nothing other than a journey into the unknown.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the terms of this legislation, the concept of long-term economic value is to be applied with regard to land.  The Minister is supposing, as Deputy Fahey did, that there will be a 10% increase, at least, in the value of property over the next ten years.  There may be in some property but who says there will be in land?  Vast areas of former agricultural land have been rezoned and some have been bought in the hope of obtaining a rezoning.  Land has been bought at enormous prices with huge borrowings from financial institutions.  Who would bet that vast tracts of that land would increase in value by 10% in the next ten years.  That bet is being made by the Government on behalf of taxpayers.</P>
        <P>The Government has got many of its figures wrong.  The Minister insists that NAMA will meet its own debt servicing costs.  He is recklessly ignoring the fact that the 1.5% introductory discounted rate on which he bases his calculations for the &euro;54 billion in new borrowings will, inevitably, increase as the European economy comes out of recession.  The long-term forecasted ECB rate is 3.8% over the next ten years.  When the agreed 0.5% over the main ECB re-financing rate is added, average debt funding will cost 4.3%, it is estimated, over the next ten years.  This will produce running costs of approximately &euro;10 billion in respect of NAMA in the next ten years.</P>
        <P>In the context of the value of the loan book, we are told that &euro;9 billion is rolled-over interest owed by developers which has not been paid to the banks.  What we do not know, and what the Minister has not yet told us, is the monthly increase in this roll-over figure.  How, for example, will it stand in 12 months time?  Will the roll-over of &euro;9 billion have reached &euro;12 billion in 12 months time?  For how long will the roll-over be permitted?  These are issues of substantial relevance which remain to be clarified.</P><Col N="38" />
        <P>In the context of long-term economic value, there is a contradiction at the heart of the legislation.  The provisions which allow a price between the market and long-term economic value to be used in the determination of value of lands are entirely different from later provisions in the Bill which provide for the vesting of property in NAMA when property owners fail to meet their financial obligations.  Where property is vested the courts are asked to determine the likely sale price of the land or property if sold within three months of the court proceeding.  The courts are being asked to determine the current market value at the time of an application for vesting.  If NAMA has taken over land based on a long-term economic value and if a developer finds himself in a court system where the land may be vested in NAMA at a lower level of value and wants to protect other property or assets used to guarantee bank debt, what will happen?  The developer will demand access to information to ascertain the value NAMA attached to the land when the loan was taken over.  NAMA will give a bank X amount for the loan in the context of bonds which can be cashed, but will seek to attribute to the developer a lower value.  There is an inherent contradiction in the value provisions in the legislation, which is an invitation to litigation.  It will facilitate developers ensuring substantial delays in NAMA taking action to have property vested in it when there is a default in repayment.</P>
        <P>There is no indication in the legislation of for how long NAMA will allow loans to be rolled over.  When property has collapsed in value and loans continue to roll over, the debt increases.  For how many years will roll-over be allowed?  There is no clarity to this.  What happens if a developer comes to NAMA and says, &ldquo;You can take my property.  You do not need to take a court case.  I will vest it in you but please do not proceed on foot of any guarantees&rdquo;.  What direction is there in the legislation to clarify the action NAMA might take in that context?</P>
        <P>There have been extraordinary revelations about the behaviour of our banks.  In the United States, within months of investigations having been conducted, bankers were arrested and some imprisoned.  In the context of the conduct of certain institutions, in particular Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, it is extraordinary that no prosecutions have been initiated.  I am conscious of the importance of saying nothing in this House which might prejudice a prosecution.  However, I wonder what is the reason for the delay.  Is it that those investigating the accounting systems and the conduct of people within those institutions have discovered that much more was known by the regulator and the Minister for Finance of the day than has been disclosed?  Would a prosecution be an embarrassment and is that why it is being avoided?  Anglo Irish Bank can best be described as a rogue bank.  Is there a conflict of interest?  Is it the objective of the Minister at some stage in the future to float off this bank again for public quotation on the stock market and is there a conflict of interest to the extent that there is a concern that if prosecutions are taken they may inhibit the possible future flotation of a reconstituted Anglo Irish Bank?  If that is the case it should not be the case.</P>
        <P>The general public find it extraordinary that a year after so many revelations not a single prosecution has taken place.  In the United States one banker, Mr. Madoff, has been sentenced and imprisoned.  In Ireland, those responsible for the debacle we are confronted by have, largely, made off to Marbella and Puerto Banus and are celebrating their golden handshakes on the golf courses in that region.  That is not acceptable and the time has come for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and tell us why these investigations are so slow and whether prosecutions are anticipated?  Anglo Irish Bank is a nationalised bank controlled by the State.  There should be no difficulty in the investigative authorities accessing all of the information required to address the problems that have arisen and the dreadful disaster that the bank has brought on the country.</P>

	<P>It is with great pride that I support my Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in introducing this wonderful and badly needed rescue of the economy, property developers and the banking system.  NAMA is not a Fianna F&aacute;il bailout for banks, which is the accusation.  NAMA is the European Central Bank&rsquo;s carefully planned rescue of the Irish economy, preventing the International Monetary Fund, IMF, from needing to do the same for Ireland.  When NAMA takes bad property loans worth more than &euro;90 billion from the banks, it will deposit &euro;60 billion in NAMA bonds, which will be exchanged in Frankfurt for ECB funds.</P>
        <P>NAMA&rsquo;s bailout has been welcomed by all international agencies and investors as being good business for Ireland and the EU.  Much nonsense has been stated, but the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s courage, innovation and imagination in putting NAMA in place have been greatly admired.  Many people of all parties and political persuasions are proud of his efforts.</P>
        <P>The ECB has been generous to Ireland since the crisis arose.  Some &euro;100 million in European Investment Bank money has been given to Ireland at a rate of 1% plus the banking institutions&rsquo; margin.  This has kept the country going and was achieved through the negotiations of the Minister for Finance.  The ECB supports our proposal.</P>
        <P>Some 30% of the developments in question are in England, a sterling area, France, Holland and many other European countries.  I suspect that developments in the former eastern bloc, now a part of the EU, are not profitable.  We can look back on the past 20 years of the world&rsquo;s economy, particularly England in the 1980s under Mrs. Thatcher.  When Canary Wharf &mdash; now the UK&rsquo;s pride and joy and the place people visit when they travel to London &mdash; was developed, the state of the UK&rsquo;s economy was similar to ours.  Many developers went bust and property investors were in trouble.  Canary Wharf has since become London&rsquo;s showpiece.</P>
        <P>Before the unification of Germany, Bonn was the capital of West Germany and Berlin was the capital of East Germany.  With unification, considerable investment in Berlin occurred, even though many developers and bankers went bust.  This was news in the financial newspapers, including Ireland&rsquo;s.  Since then, it has all come right.</P>
        <P>There is a bright future for what we are doing because there will always be better days in the economy.  Dublin, Cork and many large towns will not go wrong, but there are land banks in villages and small towns that must be rescued.  NAMA will be a profitable organisation.  It is an innovative measure and, in two or three years time, will make an unexpected return to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I am appalled and disappointed at the attitude adopted by Fine Gael, the party of business, which attacked share prices last week.  Those prices are important to small investors and I am sure there are more Fine Gael shareholders than Fianna F&aacute;il shareholders, knowing the structure of the former and the background of its members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends on the shares.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Edward O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that small shareholders be looked after.  I am a shareholder in both of the banks in question.  Many people have depended on their dividends in recent years.  I know of several wheelchair users who invested their money in organisations like the banks, but have no incomes now and are dependent on the State for their security and livelihood.  This is a sad state of affairs.  We must get the banks back on stream soon.</P>
        <P>Nationalisation has been mentioned, but that is rubbish.  No good has ever come from nationalisation because it removes incentive from people&rsquo;s work.  Moreover, we would need to pay shareholders, even though the price may be small, and take on the banks&rsquo; large debts.  What occurred to the banking system is clear, namely, that there was too much competition in <Col N="40" />the system.  On 9 July, my party was taken aback by a speech I made in the House because I stated that we should have higher levels of capital gains tax on developments.</P>
        <P>After the Northern Rock problem came Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers and AIG, the insurance company, in the USA.  The whole world fell inwards.  It was not all our fault.  A small open economy surrounded by water, we were the victims.  Competition meant it was like buying boots and shoes, in that one could go up and down a street from one bank to another, submit a proposal to build 50 houses in one place and buy 40 acres up the road.  Foreign banks would say, &ldquo;Fine&rdquo;, but they are now taking their money back, as we can read in the newspapers every day.  If people went to the local bank with which they always dealt, it would have told them that it could not lend the money and they would show the letter from the foreign bank saying that it would.  The local bank had no choice.</P>
        <P>We landed ourselves in this trouble.  It is ridiculous that we were building 90,000 houses per year for a population of less than 4.5 million people.  No one on either the left or right side of the House said, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  Shopping centres, hotels and business parks were being built on tax breaks.  It was unreal.  I stated this clearly, but I was seen as having the wrong view.  That we were going to go astray was as obvious as the nose on my face.  I must blame the Opposition as much as the Government because it is meant to keep us on our toes.  There was a game of poker between McNamara and Dunne in Ballsbridge.  Many other property developers were doing the same.  This is what landed us in this trouble.  Competition in the banking system was the problem.  Unjustified figures for properties and land were being thrown around and nothing was done.</P>
        <P>I have a problem with Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s ideas on nationalisation, but it is a small party.  If its comments were popular, the entire country would vote for it.</P>
        <P>The matter of internal auditors will definitely get into the Guinness Book of Records.  The internal auditor of the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas has retired or resigned.  It is the first internal auditor I have ever heard of who resigned.  Where we went astray was with the internal auditors.  Internal auditing that forms part of a company&rsquo;s financial structure must be sorted out.  Internal auditors are usually appointed by management and the chief executive will have a say in the internal audit.  Until such time as internal auditing is set aright, it will be no good.</P>
        <P>I come from Mitchelstown, which had a fine co-operative society that got involved in development.  We had three directors from Dublin, Mr. Michael Jacob of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Liam McGreal of where I do not know and Mr. John Fitzgerald, the famous former Dublin city manager.  They were involved in directing a company called Reox, which is facing liquidation and bankruptcy and has destroyed Mitchelstown, Mallow and north County Cork, as the Acting Chairman is aware.  I went hoarse giving out about it because I knew what was occurring.  Mr. Fitzgerald was a Dublin city manager and received more directorships.  There is no point in appointing bank directors if they do not have good business backgrounds or if they have failed elsewhere, and they have failed. There is no advantage in appointing directors from government into banks.  If they do not know where they are going, they are wasting their time.  I am not friends with any bank director and no longer know any.  Let shareholders appoint directors and interrogate them more at annual general meetings.  AGMs of banks and businesses have become a joke where one cannot ask a question without being shouted down.  That situation must be sorted out.  The standing orders in those places have been changed, but whether we can change in this House, I do not know.</P>
        <P>As I stated one year ago, auditors are a disgrace.  They have put us where we are.  If the auditing system does not change, we will go nowhere.  The structure of appointing auditors is suspect because they are appointed before an AGM.</P>

	<P>Supporting Irish communities overseas, and in particular the most vulnerable members of these communities, is an important priority for the Government, as it has been for many Governments.</P>
        <P>Since the establishment of the Irish abroad unit in 2004, the Government has allocated more than &euro;60 million under the emigrant support programme, ESP, to support Irish communities abroad.  Funding to Irish organisations in the United States has increased significantly in this same period, from just over $653,000 in 2004 to a record $5 million in 2008.  This figure includes a specific item.  A further $2.83 million has been allocated so far this year.  Further details of grants allocated to support Irish community organisations and projects in the United States in 2008 and so far in 2009 are outlined in the table circulated for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The primary focus of this funding is to support the provision of key welfare, information and immigration advisory services to the more marginalised members of our community in the United States.  The front line Irish immigration organisations offer a wide range of socially sensitive services to the undocumented, elderly, homeless and other vulnerable persons.  These services make a substantive difference to the lives of thousands of Irish emigrants in the US, reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation and enabling access to local statutory entitlements.</P>
        <P>The embassy and consulates general have also worked closely with Irish immigration centres and organisations in the United States to design innovative and collaborative projects that address specific community needs.  This approach has been particularly successful in developing outreach services for the elderly, many of whom live outside the community centres&rsquo; traditional catchment areas.  In May of this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs launched one such innovative project, the New York Senior Helpline.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the support of front line welfare services continues to be the priority, the expansion of the emigrant support programme since 2003 has also enabled the Government to invest in <Col N="42" />a range of community and heritage projects, which foster a greater sense of Irish identity, in addition to strategic capital projects.  In 2008, ESP grants were allocated to support flagship community projects in New York, San Francisco and Boston.  These grants are a key part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to ensuring that the links between Ireland and Irish America remain strong and vibrant and complement other initiatives in this area, including the strategic policy review of Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the United States.</P>
        <P>Despite the current challenging budgetary situation, support for emigrant services worldwide has this year been maintained at its record 2008 level of &euro;15.183 million.  This is a significant achievement in the current economic climate, one which underlines our strong commitment to our overseas communities.  The current allocation is some five times greater than the 2003 equivalent and represents a 15-fold increase on the 1997 figure.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State outline how a US organisation makes its application for funding?  Does it submit an application directly to the Department or to the embassy?  What are the links?</P>
        <P>I may have misheard or misinterpreted the Minister of State.  Did he say one item was excluded from the funding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>One additional, very large item.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State outline what that item was?  In 2004, the funding amounted to $653,000 and in 2008 it was $5 million.  Was this because additional funds came on stream or have circumstances deteriorated for many of the undocumented Irish in the United States?  What is the current position on the attempts to obtain recognition for the undocumented Irish in the United States?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, said the amount of money allocated for Irish emigrant services abroad was &euro;15.1 million last year.  No reduction is proposed for this year.  This contrasts starkly with the reduction in funding for Irish Aid under the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power.  Was the allocation for Irish emigrant services under threat at any stage?  Was a policy decision taken to hit Irish Aid but not Irish emigrant services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>To take the last point first, as every Member of the House will be aware, we face very difficult economic circumstances and the budgetary situation could not really be worse.  All programmes are under review.</P>
        <P>On the first point, I did not mean to mislead the Deputy.  There was a specific allocation of $2 million for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum in Boston, thereby increasing the figure to $5 million.  The sum of $2.8 million, which has been allocated to date in 2009, is the second highest that has been allocated.  I wanted to draw attention to the $2 million for the library last year because it was a specific capital fund.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked how various groups apply for funding.  There are very good connections between the Irish community and the embassy and consulates general.  This is very much encouraged by the people we have on the ground.  There is a good community network involving the Irish embassies, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.  Applications are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  I visited a number of the centres in receipt of funding.</P>
        <P>If I travel to the United States, I try to go to some of the centres we support.  It strikes me that the people who are most assisted are those in the parts of the Irish diaspora who did not break through the ceiling and did not do as well as some other Irish people.  We have a specific responsibility towards them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State say which organisation receives the greatest proportion of funding and what this amounts to?  Does his Department ever receive represen<Col N="44" />tations from other groups complaining that some organisations receive funding they should not get?  How are the audits of the organisations in receipt of funding carried out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, the greatest allocation was for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum.  The Deputy has been given a full list of the allocations in tabular form.  The second highest allocation, $500,000, was to San Francisco GAA.  Some $250,000 was allocated to the American Irish Historical Society.  Various grants were given, including grants as low as $25,000.  The largest allocation so far this year, $350,000, was to the Irish Cultural Centre in New England.  The allocations range from this sum down to approximately $10,000.  There is a very wide scale and it is part of the ongoing audit in the Department.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the recent expulsion of UNICEF officials from Sri Lanka for seeking to highlight the detention of civilians and treatment of children, among others, during the conflict in the country; if he supports the call for an international investigation into human rights abuses; his views on same; and the steps the international community is taking in order to help restore peace. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31856/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s dismay over the decision of the Government of Sri Lanka to order the expulsion of Mr. James Elder, the UNICEF communications chief in Sri Lanka, on 21 September.  Mr. Elder&rsquo;s expulsion follows the sentencing on 31 August of the journalist J. S. Tissainayagam to 20 years hard labour by the Colombo High Court on charges of violating anti-terrorism laws.  Both cases give rise to concerns related to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press in Sri Lanka.  I believe an independent review should consider the allegations of serious breaches of international humanitarian law in the course of the conflict in Sri Lanka, including intensive shelling by Government forces in areas in which significant numbers of civilians were trapped, the use of civilians as human shields by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, and the forced conscription of civilians and children into LTTE units.  These are issues of concern.  At the European Foreign Ministers meeting on 18 May the need for the parties to respect their obligations fully under international humanitarian and human rights law was reiterated and a call made that the alleged violations of these laws would be investigated through an independent inquiry.</P>
        <P>The call was reiterated by the EU Presidency at a special session of the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in Sri Lanka held in Geneva from 26 to 27 May.  In its national statement at the special session, Ireland also called for an independent inquiry.  My preference is for this inquiry to be carried out under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council and to cover violations perpetrated by all parties.  However, efforts by the European Union to have a resolution passed which would endorse a call for an inquiry into breaches of international law have regrettably been unsuccessful.  Despite this, I remain committed to the principle of such an inquiry, although I concede the chances of securing a UN-based inquiry now appears to be slim.  I envisage such an inquiry as one element in the overall response of the international community to Sri Lanka&rsquo;s post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At EU level, Foreign Ministers will discuss the situation in Sri Lanka at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in October.  Ministers will discuss how best to engage the Government of Sri Lanka in a meaningful dialogue which will enable us to assist the internally displaced persons in the camps, of whom there are more than 280,000, and which will also facilitate the genuinely inclusive process of political reconciliation with the Tamil minority <Col N="45" />which is urgently needed.  This must be based on the principles of parity of esteem, consent, equality, the rule of law and, above all, respect for human rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for his reply but it is rather depressing to hear that so little can be done.  I put a number of points to the Minister of State.  I understand the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, is in New York today raising the issue with the President of Sri Lanka.  In that regard I trust the international community will support the Secretary General in defending the right of James Elder to express his views.  Is the Minister of State not concerned at the use of the international media during the final days of this conflict?  The LTTE has not sought independence for some time.  Rather there are many sections of the Tamil community simply seeking recognition and parity of esteem in negotiations.  Those who contacted the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, which discussed the issue, spoke of the necessary conditions for peace talks.  At the same time the Sri Lankan Government announced it was on the verge of a military victory.  This has led, in turn, to the removal of Tamil civilians into what are effectively holding camps or concentration camps and this includes many young children.  In fairness to James Elder, the person expelled, he drew attention in his work to the mistreatment of children on both sides, the point made by the Minister of State regarding the use of civilians, especially children, as human shields.  Mr. Elder addressed this point.  Is it the case that we can expect the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his influence to support the efforts being made very directly today by the Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to address this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree absolutely with the Deputy.  His point is well made and a purely military victory is bound to be pyrrhic.  I also agree with the Deputy because a range of views exist within the Tamil community and clearly not everyone sought some form of military action.  The Deputy is also correct to state &mdash; this is the strong view of the Government &mdash; that only through respect for human rights and parity of esteem can progress be made.  That community and the Government of Sri Lanka must work closely together if any progress is to be made.  I agree with the point made by the Deputy and the fact that more than 280,000 people are in what are effectively concentration camps in this day and age is simply not acceptable.  As the Deputy is probably aware there has been very inclement weather in that area and the point was made by the UN that there is a very real danger of disease as we enter this particular season and people and civilians will suffer unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked if the Minister is supportive of Ban Ki-moon&rsquo;s efforts today in New York and I have no doubt the Minister is so but I would be misleading the House if I suggested that I knew there would be any direct contact.  The Deputy may rest assured that it will become an issue at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council; we will give very strong support and we believe New York has a strong role to play.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a serious issue with which both Ministers of State will be familiar.  It was an opinion advanced by Dr. Sahnoun, among others, that the previous Secretary General of the United Nations has stressed the importance of humanitarian protection.  In both this case and in a case I will discuss presently related to Gaza the sovereignty argument is being used to defeat the humanitarian protection principle.  The United Nations took a significant decision when it decided to invoke humanitarian protection as a principle of policy.  The Sri Lankan Government has stated that the onus is on anyone interested in dealing with the issue, for which the Minister of State and I share a concern, to recognise in the first instance that it is for the Sri Lankans themselves to recognise vulnerability.  If that is the case it means that humanitarian protection has gone out the window as a principle of the international <Col N="46" />community although it is a matter of fundamental importance for peace building in the world community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that unfortunately not all members of the UN Security Council are <i>ad idem</i> on this issue.  It seems this is where a degree of cynicism has entered into the discussions.  A member of Irish Aid rapid response has been deployed to Sri Lanka to assist in the emergency response and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, is providing funding of &euro;308,000 to emergency responses for NGOs.  The Deputy is absolutely correct in his analysis and unless the international community speaks with one voice on this matter the issue will drag on, unfortunately.</P>

        <Quest> the implications of the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes for his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31895/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In light of the current challenges in the public finances, the Government is examining all areas of expenditure to identify where savings can be made, while minimising the impact on front line services to the public.  The Deputy is correct to state a great range of subjects have been mentioned in the McCarthy report or the report of the special group on public sector numbers and expenditure programmes.  The report suggested the following &mdash; a reduction in the number of missions to 55, currently we have 75 missions; to grade all head of mission posts at principal officer level with the exception of three or four posts; to reduce foreign service allowances by 12.5%; to cease funding to the UN Association in 2010; to cease funding to the European Movement in 2010; to reduce the allocation for contributions to international organisations by &euro;5 million; to cease expenditure on a technical assistance programme for new EU member states; to maintain the allocation for Vote 29 (Irish Aid) at 0.39% in 2010; to extend the timeframe for reaching the UN target for overseas development aid until 2015; to reduce expenditure on support for emigrant services; to remove the free passport scheme for those aged 65 years and over; and to reduce staff numbers by 65.</P>
        <P>Planned expenditure and resource levels for the Department are currently being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010.  This will include consideration of the report of the special group and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.  As the Deputy will be aware from my previous comments on such issues as support for emigrant services, we must make difficult choices, of that there is no doubt.  There are some services which are provided through our embassies and consulates general which should be regarded as inviolable.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister mentioned that it would be inappropriate for him to comment, so I assume he means in advance of budgetary Estimates.  That has not prevented some of his colleagues from commenting.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has stated there should be no cuts, and the T&aacute;naiste seemed to dismiss the McCarthy report today out of hand.  The Minister of State is adopting a fairly responsible position.  Perhaps he is looking for favour in his application for the EU Commissioner post.  I wish him well in his covert &mdash; or overt &mdash; application.</P>
        <P>There is a realisation on this side of the House that changes must be made and some areas will have to suffer because the money is not available.  The Minister of State mentioned cutting back the number of embassies from 75 to 55.  In doing so we should consider appropriate <Col N="47" />amalgamations because we export so much.  We could develop the Irish house concept as opposed to the stand-alone embassy and Departments having various bodies and facilities abroad.  We have approximately ten Irish houses across the globe.  We should develop this concept rather than cut back on embassies, as it would lead to rationalisation.  It may enhance the service we provide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The list which was mentioned would do irreversible damage to our reputation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be easy for me to be critical of Mr. McCarthy and his report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The report considered the issue from a blank sheet perspective but we never start from a blank sheet.  There would be very significant damage done in some of those areas where we have built up resources.  The point made by Deputy Timmins is valid, as there is undoubtedly capacity for synergies; many of our State bodies also operate in other member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am being coy in advance of the annual budgetary process, as that is just getting under way.  Would that I could inform one how it will end.  Axes are being wielded and as the Deputy stated, we must cut our cloth according to our measure.  We must be very careful about where to impose those cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot recall the exact year but when Mr. Walsh was Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs there were cutbacks in the mid to late 1920s.  It was only getting a pittance at the time but it took a massive hit relative to other areas.  I would not like to think it would be the politically soft option because it may be so with much of the public.  It fulfils a valuable and good purpose, particularly as we export so much.  We must get the Department involved with trade, etc., and extend its remit rather than narrow it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot export to Latin America if there are no embassies there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s positive contribution and synergies must be sought within existing services.  The Deputy is correct in that we depend on exports; more than 80% of what we produce is exported and we must keep in touch with what is happening on the ground.  The only way to do so is to be represented on the ground.</P>

        <Quest> the action he will take and the initiatives, within the European Union, that he will initiate or support by way of response to the UN report on the recent killings, injuries and destruction in Gaza and neighbouring areas in Israel (details supplied); and the further steps as indicated in the report as appropriate Ireland will initiate or support. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32668/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the UN fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict mandated by the UN Human Rights Council last April and chaired by the distinguished South African jurist, Judge Richard Goldstone, was issued on 15 September.  The House will know that it makes for salutary reading.  Judge Goldstone and his team, including retired Irish Army officer, Colonel Desmond Travers, have produced an extraordinarily comprehensive report with evidence compiled from almost 200 individual interviews and an examination of over 300 reports and submissions as well as public hearings held in both Gaza and Geneva.  The report will be formally introduced in the UN Human Rights Council on 29 September.</P>
        <P>The main findings of the Goldstone report are deeply disturbing.  The evidence it presents indicates that serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, amounting to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, were committed by both Israeli military forces and Palestinian armed groups during Operation Cast Lead.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has consistently underlined the Government&rsquo;s view that the most serious incidents which occurred during the Gaza conflict required a full and impartial investigation.  The Government also believes, as the Minister has made clear, that there must be full accountability for any serious violations of international law committed during the conflict.  The Goldstone report makes a number of important recommendations with a view to ensuring such accountability.  These include possible reference to the UN Security Council and even to the International Criminal Court in the event of the very serious allegations documented not being properly and independently investigated by Israel and the authorities in Gaza.</P>
        <P>The exhaustive findings and recommendations made by Judge Goldstone and his colleagues deserve the most serious consideration by all those concerned with the defence of human rights.  It is appropriate that the report should receive full and urgent consideration at the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  As I have indicated, this will happen next week during the course of the council&rsquo;s current session.  We are working closely with our EU partners at present on the development of the EU&rsquo;s response to the report.  Although Ireland is not currently a member of the Human Rights Council, we will help to prepare the ground for fruitful discussion there and the preparation of an appropriate response by the council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State concerned about the use of the name of  former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, in dismissing the Goldstone report?  The media responses from the Israeli side have suggested that former President Robinson, a distinguished international jurist, declined to participate in the exercise on the basis that the terms of reference were not acceptable to her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Leaving that aside, Professor Goldstone is a very distinguished scholar who has made enormous contributions towards peace building and so forth, and a number of questions now arise.  He has suggested a set of actions which should follow the report.  For the sake of economy I will put my questions into two brief categories.  He has drawn attention to the fact that the materials which were approved by Israel two years ago, for example, which were worth &euro;29 <Col N="49" />million have not been executed by way of building and repair because of the blockade.  The other projects which UNRWA would seek to develop could provide employment and shelter and they are valued at approximately &euro;1 billion.  Mr. John Ging has welcomed the Goldstone report and particularly those aspects which would free up materials to help the people of Gaza immediately.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the legal side of the Goldstone report, it has already been bad-mouthed.  There is the suggestion that if there is no compliance, the matter should move on to the UN Security Council and the International Criminal Court.  What is the position of the Government on the suggested strategy in the short term with regard to humanitarian aid, and in the medium term with regard to legal strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I have previously discussed the matter with the Deputy.  On several occasions at European Council of Ministers meetings I have stressed the point on which there is general agreement in this House; it is simply wrong in every sense of the word that the people who live in Gaza should be isolated and aid should have to go through the current process and be delayed as a result.</P>
        <P>On the other point, one should dismiss the comments about our former President for what they are, black propaganda aimed partly at undermining the Goldstone report.  The point about the report which jumps off the pages is a comment that an action which was supposed to begin as self-defence was disproportionate and tried to punish, humiliate and terrorise the civilian population.  That is unacceptable from any civilised country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It also criticised Hamas.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be balanced.  It also criticised Hamas and its use of rockets as deliberate and focused terror attacks on Israeli citizens.  We have been around the grounds on that before.  The Government will continue, with its EU partners, to support a request that Israel terminate its completely erroneous policy in respect of the blockade as quickly as possible.  Mr. Ging has been extremely important in the context of identifying the priorities in that regard.  As already stated, if a full and independent inquiry does not come about on foot of the Goldstone report, the appropriate response would be to refer the matter to the international courts.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I hope we will do so.  As the Deputy is aware, I formerly held a UN human rights fellowship.  I take a particular interest in this matter.  One of the saddest aspects of what is happening in the Middle East is that Israel, which should know more than any other nation about affronts to human dignity, has become mired in this situation.  Unless both sides decide to respect human dignity and the rule of international law, a solution will not be found in respect of this particularly troubled region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has an enviable and impressive record on funding overseas development assistance, ODA.  Our progress up the league table of development donors has been realised through a combination of strong economic growth and our desire to move in a planned manner towards the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA.  This approach has served Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme well.</P>
        <P>The aid figures clearly demonstrate just how successful our approach has been.  In the past six years alone Ireland has contributed well in excess of &euro;4 billion to ODA.  The annual development aid budget more than trebled between 2000 and 2008.  In the same period, we almost doubled our share of GNP spent on ODA from 0.3% to 0.59%.  In 2008, Ireland&rsquo;s total spending on the development assistance programme was &euro;920 million, or approximately 0.59% of GNP.  This made Ireland the sixth most generous donor in the world on a <i>per capita</i> basis, an impressive achievement of which we can all be justifiably proud.  The total budget for ODA in 2009 is expected to reach &euro;696 million.  Based on current projections, this will represent at least 0.48% of GNP.  This means that Ireland will remain one of the most generous donors in the world on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
        <P>I fully recognise that the reduction in the 2009 ODA budget has been significant.  However, this necessary but regrettable decision was made solely in the context of the exceptional economic situation the country currently faces.  Our sole objective is to assist in stabilising the public finances to establish a solid platform for renewed economic growth.  This is the only secure and sustainable way for Ireland to meet its commitments to ODA.</P>
        <P>The Estimates process that will lead to the introduction of the budget in December is under way.  No decisions have yet been made in respect of the aid budget for 2010.  As the Deputy will be aware, these are difficult times and there are many competing and deserving demands for scarce resources.  However, our aid programme must be protected to the maximum possible extent achievable in the current circumstances.  I cannot provide an undertaking in respect of the exact figure for development assistance for 2010 in advance of the budget, which is the prerogative of the Minister for Finance and the Government.  However, the Deputy may rest assured that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will make the strongest possible case for the aid programme as part of the Estimates process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to planning.  I have been informed by NGOs that they cannot make plans.  They are making people redundant in the programme countries and cannot plan ahead in respect of their programmes.  The ambassadors who have come before the sub-committee indicate that they are breaking the commitments they made in these countries.</P>
        <P>The other Minister of State present, Deputy Roche, referred earlier to attracting reputational damage by making cuts too severe.  The question that arises revolves around the point at which we will incur massive reputational damage in the programme countries by breaking our commitments in respect of aid.  I accept that the country is facing into extremely uncertain economic times.  However, our ambassadors, their staff and the NGOs that we fund require a degree of certainty so that they might continue the life-and-death work they are doing.  There will come a point when the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, will be obliged to make a case to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Cabinet to the effect that the damage we will do by making further cuts will in turn lead to our incurring major reputational damage in the programme countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that it is difficult for NGOs to plan ahead.  It is extremely difficult to plan our budget for 2010 now because we simply do not know the <Col N="51" />Exchequer returns for October and November.  In view of the unpredictable nature of the financial and economic crisis the world faces, we are finding it difficult to make plans across every Department and in respect of the economy as a whole.  In January we made a significant, up-front payment of 70% of the entire funding for the MAPS partners &mdash; our largest partners &mdash; for the year to try to confer on them a degree of certainty in an extremely unpredictable environment.</P>
        <P>The targets relating to ODA are expected to be reached over a period of many years.  It would be well nigh impossible to reach those targets in a uniform and linear fashion, even in an ideal and predictable economic cycle.  We are not in such a cycle at present.  Rather, we are in the middle of an unpredictable period.  The Government must take a long-term view and state that these targets are expressed over a period of many years.  The question we must answer is how we can achieve those targets in a way which will ensure that our programmes remain sustainable.  In addition, we must also balance our efforts against the reputational damage that might be incurred by the country.  Such damage would be far worse if we allowed the country slide into the type of situation which obtained in the 1980s when we did not confront our difficulties in a timely manner.</P>

        <Quest> if cuts imposed in the 2008 and 2009 budgets have impacted on the achievement of the six high-level goals from the statement of strategy 2008 to 2010; if the goals and the statement of strategy have been reviewed in view of the cutbacks imposed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31774/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The high-level goals of the Department of Foreign Affairs address the full range of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy objectives.  Successful delivery of its objectives is critically dependent upon the effective management of the Department&rsquo;s resources and its ability to adapt and to manage change.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal adjustment process, the Department has undergone a reduction in the financial resources available to it.  The Department&rsquo;s budget for this year is 21% less than its outturn expenditure for 2008.  Naturally, this reduction in resources has had some impact on the speed at which we attain our objectives.</P>
        <P>Beyond the question of resources, the delivery of our objectives also depends on the context and environment in which we operate.  Our credibility abroad and our international reputation are as important as the availability of resources.  An important element in Ireland&rsquo;s success over recent years has been its ability to be a constructive and reliable partner in the conduct of foreign policy.  Our ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances has been another aspect that has served as strength.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that events in 2008 and 2009 have tested our ability, as a country, to respond to changing circumstances.  During this period, the Department has been working very hard to ensure that our international reputation is preserved and our international partners fully understand the Government&rsquo;s strategy for recovery.  It is also fair to say that the outcome of the Lisbon treaty referendum last summer further complicated this task.</P>
        <P>The achievement of the specific high-level goals of the Department is kept under regular review.  Earlier this month, the Minister convened a meeting of the heads of mission of all our embassies to review the goals and re-examine our priorities.</P><Col N="52" />
        <P>At that conference, it was stressed to the heads of mission that advancement of our economic interests overseas was of paramount importance in the coming period.  I note Deputy Timmins made this point a few moments ago.  To ensure that the Department continues to maximise its performance, a strategy and performance unit has been established dedicated to overseeing the review of the Department&rsquo;s structures.  I greatly regret that in response to budgetary pressures the Government was obliged to make the short-term reductions outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, on the overseas development aid, ODA, side.</P>
        <P>Adjustments were implemented across the programme in such a way as to minimise the impact in any single area.  While the cut in the ODA allocation for 2009 is significant, as the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, has stated, this follows a period of unprecedented increases in ODA volumes.  We face a specifically difficult period and the allocation of &euro;696 million for 2009 on ODA represents a trebling in the volume of ODA delivered over the past ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has acknowledged there will be an impact on achievement of the aforementioned six high-level goals.  Does the Government intend to change or amend those goals?  Clearly there must be an impact and it was mentioned earlier that the commitment given on Irish Aid will not be adhered to.  Does the Minister intend to drop any of the goals or does he intend to publish a statement to amend the intentions as outlined in the Statement of Strategy 2008-2010?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State noted in the previous response, we are working closely to achieve our goals over a period in respect of ODA.  It is worth mentioning the six goals because Members have been discussing them in the abstract.  The first goal is to contribute to international peace and security &mdash; no Government, irrespective of its make-up, will demur from that &mdash; and to promote conflict resolution and respect for human rights.  This is at the core of our values as a nation.  The second goal pertains to implementation of the Good Friday Agreement regarding which, thankfully, we have moved on.  The goal regarding Irish Aid already has been discussed.  Promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with other countries and advancement of our economic interests remains a goal.  However, the question arises as to how to achieve it.  I refer to Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s earlier contribution and perhaps one can consider different deployments and methods to this end.  As for securing Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the European Union, the Irish people will make a major decision in this regard on 2 October.  The sixth high-level goal is to provide a high-quality passport and consular service to all Irish citizens and to engage with the Irish diaspora.  While it may be that we will suffer some curtailment of our ambitions in respect of each area, I do not foresee our abandonment of any of these goals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>To be constructive, I wish to make a point on this issue.  I understand that NGOs have been more or less told to make preliminary plans on the basis of a 70% allocation and some of them have been trying to respond in this regard.  I note the annual audit report of 2008 places significant emphasis, for example, on what one might call the improvement of on-site financial reporting from the different recipient countries.  While I do not argue against this, it is not at the top of my priorities.  It might be valuable to consider how goals are established in such recipient countries as to what is most valuable to them.  However, my most important point is that there should be dialogue between the Department and its recipient NGOs to ensure that the number of people engaged in projects is not lost to avoid severe disruptions to the programmes.  Consequently, even if a programme is thinner, at least the people working in it will not be lost.  This is a terribly important point.</P><Col N="53" />
        <P>I will make a final point because this is my only opportunity.  I am worried about the inability of the Department to respond to disasters associated with climate change.  For example, the position in northern Kenya is serious.  The animals there have been lost as the effects of drought and famine have meant that people are killing elephants to eat their flesh, apart from stealing the ivory.  The Department should be able to respond immediately, even if the Kenyan Government is slow to make an appeal for assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>To take that last point, the Deputy is aware that a &euro;75 million fund has been set aside to address humanitarian emergencies, including climate-related emergencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State consider this particular issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The other point already has been addressed by Deputy Peter Power, who, with his section, is working closely with the NGO community to deal with the specific point made by Deputy Deasy earlier.  There is realisation in the community that while times are difficult, we wish to avoid, in so far as is possible, discontinuities, particularly on the issue of staffing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, may wish to add a comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern to try to resolve the difficulties which these reductions impose.  I acknowledge they pose severe challenges for the NGOs.  However, the real challenge is to use the reduced allocations and resources in a much more effective fashion.  We are doing so in Irish Aid and are challenging all our partners to do the same.  While this is not easy, I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point regarding the retention of the bank of human knowledge, experience and capital within the NGO sector.  In addition, we are working to keep volunteering alive and the Department will host a volunteering fair at the end of next week to encourage additional volunteering.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the situation in Iran, including the statement made by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran was unlikely to produce a nuclear warhead. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The internal political situation in Iran remains of serious concern.  While the public demonstrations arising from last June&rsquo;s disputed presidential election may have abated somewhat, the overall human rights situation has deteriorated considerably in Iran since then.  The response of the Iranian authorities to the largely peaceful protests, the most recent of which took place on 18 September, has been harsh and repressive, with many hundreds arrested and detained.  There are disturbing reports of maltreatment of prisoners and on the conditions of their detention.  There have been allegations of torture, rape and even death in custody.  We have witnessed what can only be described as mass show trials of opposition political activists and others who participated in peaceful demonstrations against the election result.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the European Union continue to make known to the Iranian authorities our serious concerns at these developments as we have done since the start of the crisis.  Any failure on Iran&rsquo;s part to ensure observance of international legal standards in conducting the trial of those now charged will have serious consequences and will draw an appropriate response from the European Union.  We also continue close contact with and support for our French and United Kingdom colleagues in their ongoing diplomatic efforts to secure the freedom of the French national, Clothilde Reiss, and to ensure the proper and lawful treatment of locally-employed embassy staff.  This has been a particular issue for the United Kingdom.  One must <Col N="54" />keep human rights in Iran at the forefront of our relations with that country in light of the current difficult internal political situation.</P>
        <P>On the second issue of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, attention is currently focused on the proposals submitted by the Iranian Foreign Minister to representatives of the E3+3 group, that is, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and Russia on 9 September.  Having read through it, I must state that it is a slim document.  These proposals outline a general commitment on Iran&rsquo;s part to engage in comprehensive, all-encompassing negotiations but do not refer directly to its nuclear programme and contain no real indication from the Iranian Government that it is willing to suspend any ongoing enrichment activities.  The E3+3 group has agreed, however, to meet Iran representatives to discuss these proposals.  A meeting between Javier Solana and the Iranian chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, is scheduled for 1 October.  In the meantime, Iran and its nuclear ambitions are likely to be a major topic of discussion at the UN General Assembly session this week and at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0" Just="Left">Considerable question marks remain over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear activities.  Reference has been made to comments made by the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, that Iran was unlikely to produce a nuclear warhead.  Dr. ElBaradei made these comments in July.  However, one should be careful with selective and out-of-context quotations.  Just one month earlier, for example, Dr. ElBaradei said it was his &ldquo;gut feeling&rdquo; that Iran would like to have the technology to &ldquo;enable it to have nuclear weapons if they decided to do so&rdquo;.  Addressing the IAEA board earlier this month he stated clearly that Iran had not co-operated with the agency in a manner which would allow it to &ldquo;exclude the possibility of there being military dimensions to Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme&rdquo;.  This remains the crux of the problem.  Until Iran co-operates fully with the IAEA and responds to the demands of the international community as set out in a series of UN Security Council resolutions to suspend uranium enrichment, there will be continuing unease within the international community regarding its ultimate intentions.</P>
        <P>We must hope that behind the latest Iranian proposals there is a real willingness to negotiate on the nuclear issue and that Iran will opt for engagement on this issue rather than further international isolation.  In line with our longstanding support for the efforts of the E3+3 group, Ireland has always made clear that, in the event of continuing non-compliance by Iran with the demands of the international community, we could contemplate the necessity for further restrictive measures being adopted against Iran.  Preferably this should take the form of a new UN Security Council resolution.  However, if this does not prove possible, the EU may need to look to adopting further measures of its own.  Ultimately, the priority remains the attainment of a diplomatic resolution to this most sensitive of current international issues, which also affects the wider Middle East region.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome and join in the Minister of State&rsquo;s emphasis on defending the rights of those who are being incarcerated and those who are being made the subject of show trials in Iran.  He has my support in this regard.  I remain unconvinced about the viability of the negotiations with the E3+3 group regarding the issue of nuclear enrichment.  The inspector, on behalf of the IAEA, has published a report that suggests that Iran is not proximate to the capacity for a nuclear missile.  That is a fact.</P>
        <P>Ireland is getting sucked into an unreal conversation with those who will not submit themselves to the non-nuclear proliferation treaty by way of inspection, such as Israel, whose official policy is non-denial, which I think means that it has capacity but is not willing to state it.  I refer to President Obama&rsquo;s statements, in co-operation with the Israeli and Russian response. <Col N="55" /> I do not want to be regarded as making the case for President Ahmadinejad but there is no demonstrable breach in the non-proliferation agreement.  There is a report from the inspector to say that one is very far from a finished project with regard to material.  This is a space that President Obama&rsquo;s Administration is willing to enter, with Russian assistance.  I contrast that approach with those representing the European Union, which has an interest in not taking the same position as the advanced position of the United States in recent times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy is correct.  Dr. ElBaradei made a number of comments in June and July on the issue.  We must be careful because there have been cases of selective, out of context quotations as there always are in these issues.  A month earlier he said it was his gut feeling that Iran would like to have the technologies &ldquo;to enable it to have nuclear weapons if they decided to do so&rdquo;.  Addressing the IAEA board earlier this month, he stated that Iran had not co-operated with the agency.  From the discussions I have been party to within the European Council, a cat and mouse game is being played and this is causing difficulties.  It serves Iran ill to behave in this manner because it allows speculation.  Deputy Higgins is correct in saying that Dr. ElBaradei made those comments.  One must be even-handed in these matters.  That is very important because the tut-tutting and finger-pointing at Iran alone is unlikely to bring Iran into the space we want to bring it into.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making the case for Iran.  The raising of a non co-operation issue to a treaty breach issue, which it is not, is very dangerous in seeking a resolution to this matter.  Proposals have been made, for example with the Russian agency, that would have enabled significant progress to be made but the use of the non co-operation issue and its assertion inappropriately has tended to block at least two separate independent initiatives on the supply of material, which would have allowed us to make progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy is correct but there is a core issue of failing to co-operate with the IAEA, which is a serious matter.  I accept that Deputy Higgins is not an apologist for President Ahmadinejad and his regime.  On top of other matters, including human rights violations, it is true that there is not full co-operation with the IAEA.</P>

        <Quest> the constitutional or legislative steps he expects will be required following the outcome of the EU summit in Brussels on 18 and 19 June 2009. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24931/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Gilmore in his absence from the Chamber because he, like myself, shares a passion for where we find ourselves over the next nine days.  The outcome of the European Council held in Brussels on 18 to 19 June was a considerable success for Ireland.  We achieved all of our pre-summit goals, including the permanent retention of an EU Commissioner for Ireland and a set of legally binding guarantees on the right to life, family and education, taxation, security and defence.  The legal guarantees will later be attached to the EU treaties as a protocol at which stage they will enjoy full treaty status.  In the interim they will be lodged with the United Nations.</P>
        <P>On foot of the decisions taken at the June European Council, the Government agreed to propose a constitutional amendment so as to permit the State to ratify the Lisbon treaty.  The wording of the amendment is contained in the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009.  This Bill was approved by an overwhelming majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 July.  On the same date, a statement for the information of <Col N="56" />voters, which includes the wording of the amendment, was agreed by the Oireachtas.  It is being sent to each voter in advance of the referendum.</P>
        <P>In the event that the people vote to approve the treaty, I anticipate further legislation will be required in two areas.  As with all previous amendments of the EU treaties, the European Communities Acts 1972 to 2007 will need to be amended to give effect to the Lisbon treaty in domestic law.  The European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 will also need to be updated to take account of the new treaty.</P>
        <P>The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 was published on 6 September and has an important role to play.  If the referendum is successful, it is intended to enact this Bill.  It has two main purposes: to enhance Oireachtas control of the State&rsquo;s participation in EDA projects and programmes and to make participation by the State in permanent structured co-operation under the Lisbon treaty subject to D&aacute;il approval.  Both of these Bills are contingent on the outcome of the referendum.</P>
        <P>As a result of the positive outcome to the June European Council, the issues about which concerns were raised last year have all been satisfactorily addressed.  This means that the Lisbon treaty will this year be a very different proposition for Ireland in that it comes with substantive additional guarantees.  This new package provides an excellent basis for consulting the people and seeking their approval for the ratification of the treaty.  This is a positive step we can take on the road to economic recovery which is why ratification is supported not just by the main political parties but by Irish businesses, Irish trade unions and Irish farming bodies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State confirm that the process of lodging the guarantees as an agreement with the United Nations, for example, follows the process followed in the Good Friday Agreement, which was also lodged with international bodies?  For that reason it acquired status.</P>
        <P>I refer to the conclusion on the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which becomes a primary instrument of law.  The position that no principle of the treaty can overrule a principle of the charter creates a space for legislation advancing workers&rsquo; rights.  I refer to the statement of the Heads of State in respect of social Europe.  This is seen as a strengthening against the more ribald competitive aspects of the original draft of the Lisbon treaty.  This is important as people come to make their decision.  Work remains to be done in member states but it will be in the best interests of the good faith of the whole matter if legislation could be prepared to advance the legislation in respect of workers&rsquo; rights that the charter makes possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not agree more with the Deputy, particularly in respect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  This is a singularly uplifting document.  It is probably the best document that has been produced since the Treaty of Rome.  It is an extraordinary document that sets out the values we, as Europeans, espouse.  On the matter of workers, John Monks of the ETUC, who is no <i>ingenue</i> and is not easily fooled in these matters, said that &ldquo;the EU is like a European trade union; whenever we do things together, we are more effective, more powerful and more impressive than if we act separately&rdquo;.  The ETUC supports ratification of the Lisbon treaty and the final point to Congress made by Mr. Monks was that he hoped the Irish people would approve it.</P>
        <P>What is really significant about the charter and the extraordinary mendacious statements made on some of the more lurid posters around the city is that the charter is not just an uplifting document, it is a celebration of the values that have helped us as a nation since we joined the European Union.  There are few rights that workers have enjoyed in this country that have not been advanced by our membership of the European Union.  The Deputy and I <Col N="57" />both recall the bad days prior to our entry to the European Union when women workers were treated as second class citizens by the laws of this State.  Their rights were vindicated and furthered by Europe.  I was much impressed by Des Geraghty when he recently stated that every trade union official dealing with an employer knows the enormous benefit Europe has brought to the fight for the protection of workers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was my great privilege to work with Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, during the course of the Convention on the Future of Europe in the social Europe group.  The people who work there, whether from the left, right or centre, would not recognise the debate taking place in this country on the issue.  The suggestion that somehow workers&rsquo; rights will be trampled on is such a farce when one considers what impelled the movement towards the enactment of the charter.  The suggestion that our minimum wage rate will be undermined is a downright lie.  I am sad Sinn F&eacute;in Members are not in the House because I heard their spokesperson recently state that the Lisbon treaty does not alter the minimum wage, and that was honest.  The treaty cannot do so.  I have been a trade unionist for most of my life and I am still a member of a trade union, and I support that.  Joe Higgins, MEP, of all people speaks about C&oacute;ir&rsquo;s posters which suggest that the minimum wage will do a disservice to those who fought for workers&rsquo; rights.  The mendacious statements that are made are not just a disservice to workers&rsquo; rights, they are a disservice to the truth, and political debate above all else should depend on truth.</P>

	<P>To draw on one of the points made by the Minister of State at the June Council meeting and the legal guarantees which were agreed by the 27 member states on that occasion, I have read much literature in recent weeks, particularly a leaflet distributed to every home in the country by the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, which is ultimately the UK Independence Party and the pro-Commonwealth anti-European grouping in the European Parliament.  It states these legal guarantees are not worth the paper on which they are written.  Will the Minister of State clarify the legal status of those guarantees and precisely how they are legally binding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputy for the question.  We find ourselves in the bizarre situation that wearing a different label, the UK Independence Party, a party not known to be interested in workers or Ireland, has a view that happens to accord with Sinn F&eacute;in and C&oacute;ir-Youth Defence.  The guarantees have full international status.  First and foremost, they come from a decision of the European Council, made by 27 sovereign and independent states and have all the weight that goes with that.  During this debate I have challenged people to name one occasion on which the 27, 15 or six member states reneged on a decision they made with regard to one another.  It is preposterous.  Going beyond that, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins stated, this decision will be lodged with the United Nations and nobody has ever challenged that process, which was adopted in the case of Denmark and, the Deputy reminded the House, in the case of the Belfast Agreement; it is not challengeable.  These groups can make as many charges and allegations as they wish but the reality is that the guarantees will be translated into a protocol.  Given that an agreement has been reached between Slovenia and Croatia on the thorny issue on the piece of coastline outside Izola and Piran, we will see progress made there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish people are entitled to a truthful debate.  I respect people who take a different view from me on Europe, and I have stated this on several occasions, even though I will never turn around to their view and they will probably never turn around to mine.  However, I disrespect people, such as members of UKIP, making mendacious claims that have nothing to do with Irish life.  During a recent debate at the Shelbourne Hotel I said to Mr. Farage, a charming gentleman from that party, that I do not object to his views because of where he comes from but I object to the views he expressed in the literature referred to by Deputy Creighton because <Col N="58" />of what he stands for.  It is a bigoted, narrow, insular, little Englander view that has nothing whatsoever to add to political debate in this country and certainly it is not a view held with the interests of the Irish people at heart.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 32 and 46 together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, and as stated previously in the House on many occasions, most recently on 16 September, the Government is deeply concerned about the situation in Burma and plays an active role in international efforts to bring about positive change there.  It is worth reminding ourselves that Seanad &Eacute;ireann was the first parliamentary assembly to pass a resolution on the incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated in a statement on 11 August, the arrest, trial and conviction of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on the most spurious of charges further compounds the already bleak situation in Burma, where repression against members of the opposition, the ethnic groups and the population at large continues unabated and human rights and fundamental freedoms are systematically denied.</P>
        <P>The sentence provides clear evidence of the regime&rsquo;s intent to silence Aung San Suu Kyi in the lead-up to the elections it plans to hold next year.  These elections will be held on the basis of a discredited new constitution, which excludes her from running in them.  The treatment meted out to Aung San Suu Kyi suggests that the Burmese regime is determined to continue its illegal rule without regard for the will of the Burmese people, in blatant disregard of the demands of the international community, including the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and his predecessor.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the efforts being made in this regard by the Secretary General and his team, and by ASEAN leaders, to secure the early release of Aung San Suu Kyi.  Despite the fact that the military junta released a small number of political prisoners on Friday last as part of an amnesty it has announced for 7,000 prisoners, Aung San Suu Kyi was not among them.  Regrettably, I do not have at present any reliable information indicating that her release may be imminent.</P>
        <P>At present, more than 2,200 political prisoners are serving sentences in deplorable conditions, many on questionable charges.  The elections which the Burmese authorities are planning to hold next year will have no credibility or legitimacy if they are not opened up fully to the opposition and to all ethnic groups.</P>
        <P>Efforts by the international community &mdash; including those by the UN Secretary-General himself during his visit to Burma in July and by his good offices mission &mdash; to secure the release <Col N="59" />of political prisoners and the launching of a process of national dialogue, unfortunately, have been rejected by the regime to date.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, Ireland favours strong international action against the Burmese regime, including sanctions and an arms embargo; in fact the latter should be automatic.  We have been among those who urged a strengthening of EU sanctions in response to the developments anticipated following the recent arrest and trial of Aung San Suu Kyi.  After her conviction, I am happy to note, the EU took immediate action to extend its sanctions against the regime and the judges involved in her farce of a trial and sentencing.  These additional restrictive measures came into force on 13 August.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to work in the EU and UN frameworks, and with the countries of the region, to do all possible to advance our objectives on Burma and to press for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners there.  The current session of the Human Rights Council<b> </b>in Geneva from 14 September to 2 October offers another such opportunity, and we will use it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and I am encouraged that he will use the opportunity to convey the European view to the ASEAN states because it is an opportunity for additional pressure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and I commend U2 on highlighting this issue on its recent world tour as we can often forget about an injustice such as this.  We support every measure the Government takes through whatever framework is available to it through the EU and the UN to continue to highlight this issue until the release of Aung San Suu Kyi is secured.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputies.  When this was discussed at a recent General Affairs Council meeting I made the point that there are few issues in Ireland that unite people on all sides of the political divide in the same way as this issue does.  There is real anxiety, growing impatience and a feeling of impotence about this.  We believe this is undoubtedly one of those areas where we can have more effect by acting under the aegis of the European Union than by making speeches in this House.  What is happening in what was once a beautiful country and which has been spoiled is an abomination.  The Deputies can be assured that I will continue in my efforts in this regard, as will the Minister.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
<P el="0">The issue of foreign direct investment, FDI, in land in developing countries, whether in the form of outright land purchase or the signing of long-term leases, has been the subject of some commentary in recent times.  The food price crisis of 2007 to 2008 and the food security concerns it prompted have highlighted the issue.</P>
        <P>Understandably, the issue of land in Africa can be an emotive matter given the centrality of land to food security.  A sensitive dimension of foreign land acquisition is its impact on the small rural farmers whose land is being sold or leased.  Smallholder farmers can lack the bargaining power to enforce agreements on compensation, jobs or promised local infrastructure.  This is especially true when the community has no formal title to the land from which it might be displaced.</P>
        <P>Africa needs foreign direct investment to provide the stimulus for economic growth, the building of infrastructure and the improvement in the social and economic conditions of its population.  Africa receives well under 5% of global FDI and much of that goes into a small number of countries.  Africa needs more FDI for poverty reduction but this must be balanced against the rights of the poor, particularly those who are vulnerable, such as indigenous and minority groups.</P>
        <P>If managed properly, there are enormous benefits from foreign direct investment in land.  It is clear that local consultation and engagement are key success factors.  It is important also to encourage the integration of clauses on sustainable land management, enforcing compliance with investor commitments and promoting business models that maximise local benefit through employment creation and infrastructure development into leasing arrangements.</P>
        <P>Efforts are under way to clarify the extent, conditions and effects of foreign direct investment in land in the developing world.  Ireland, through our investments in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD, will continue to work together with other donors to influence and improve the transparency around these transactions.  The FAO is leading a process to develop voluntary guidelines for responsible governance of land and other natural resources.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also been actively working with partner developing countries to strengthen governance arrangements that give a voice to farming communities.  For example, in Tanzania we have supported the registration process of land rights for poor farmers.  Through our work on hunger reduction and the implementation of the recommendations of the hunger task force, we will continue to make a significant contribution to reducing food insecurity and to strengthening smallholder agriculture in Africa.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>My reason for tabling this question is that in a number of countries, including some of our partner countries, thousands of acres have been purchased by countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and others on the basis of there being a global food shortage.  That will entirely disrupt native agriculture.</P>
        <P>I refer to the rights of indigenous producers.  The Minister of State said conflicts in Africa are being resource based in so far as migrants are returning from cities and elites in different governments, including some of our receiving governments, are negotiating with multinationals on the basis of land titles.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is aware of my academic views on this but my net point is that the notion of the so-called establishment of titles to land is being used as a Trojan horse which will have the effect of quenching any prospect for women, who have no rights in agricultural pro<Col N="61" />duction, quenching the rights of people who are, for example, returned migrants from the cities and of provoking, as it has, loss of life and conflict, most recently in Kampala in Uganda where there are disputes in regard to land titles.</P>
        <P>Can I take it that Irish Aid and others will look at indigenous rights and new indigenous models of conveyancing land title which will serve the indigenous people rather than multinationals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome this question.  I am aware of the reports which underpin the question, namely, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, reports and the Institute for Environment Development report issued earlier this year.  They estimate that 2.5 million hectares of land have been bought by other countries.</P>
        <P>We need to make a distinction in terms of the motivation behind the purchase of these lands and acknowledge the difficulties which may arise from that while looking at the possibility and potential that arises from this investment.  One must remember that what really unlocked the potential of this country was foreign direct investment.  If managed properly and in partnership with our priority countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Not with absentee landlords.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but not with absentee landlords or multinationals corporations, which would be the modern analogy, there is a potential for a win-win situation.</P>
        <P>Foreign direct investment, if managed in a transparent way and in partnership with local communities and respecting local traditions and land rights, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, is quite possibly a real tool for development.  Ireland benefited enormously from foreign direct investment.  The arguments now being correctly put forward and the fears and concerns being raised were also raised when major foreign direct investment began to take place in this country.  There was a question as to whether we would be taken over by foreign multinationals.  Our experience on the whole has been very welcome.</P>
        <P>I do not believe it to be the Trojan horse the Deputy portrays but I understand there are certain possibilities of exploitation contained in that Trojan horse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of third level institutions have been seduced into accepting the de Soto model which effectively led to the destruction of indigenous economy in Mexico.  It is used as the prototype land title model.  If it is introduced in Africa, it will be as destructive there as it was in Mexico, which is denied by people like Professor de Soto.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Edward O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Government and the people to encourage Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to seek a rights issue rather than take further capital from the State.  There is a buoyancy in the stock market currently and people will be generous enough to further capitalise the banks to which they have a great loyalty.  I do not like to see too much State involvement in our banking system and there is a danger of that.</P>
        <P>There is a theory that banks should lend money more often.  If people do not have the ability to repay the money, there is no point lending the money by way of an overdraft or a loan.  That is one of the issues which arises throughout the country.  I have met several people who are not in a position to get additional finance from their bank but when one questions them further, one finds they do not have the capacity to repay it and they may not have paid previous loans or leases.  We need to be very careful about placing people in further debt.</P>
        <P>Earlier I listened to Deputy Shatter make a statement about Mr. Madoff in the United States of America who is in prison.  The best of luck to him in that place.  However, I do not believe <Col N="63" />he was a banker.  He sold derivatives and was a financial intermediary who took money from people for investment and he abused his position.  We have seen that happen throughout the world recently.  I am not aware of any banker in America serving a jail sentence for activities in the money area.</P>
        <P>I hope NAMA will do what it states, namely, put money into the economy and stimulate activity for the next decade.  That is what it should be about.  We have the support of the European Central Bank and if &euro;50 billion is to be spent, it must work and be effective.  I wish NAMA and the Minister, who has done great work on it, well.  It is the first time we have seen anything like this in the country.  I believe it is the first time something of this nature has been put in place in the world.  I say well done to the Minister who has done an excellent job and has generated great discussion about our country and economy.  I am disappointed we do not have the support of all sides of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to add my voice to the debate on NAMA.  As far as I am concerned, this is the most important economic legislation debated in the House in the history of the State.  It is important for the State, business and ordinary citizens.  </P>
        <P>We are living in unprecedented times from an economic point of view.  The people on the street are nervous.  The discussion on NAMA is causing confusion for many people.  They are confused about what it will mean for them and they are caught up in a political debate about whether it will be good for them.  They are looking for positive, well informed leadership to lead them out of this crisis currently being experienced.</P>
        <P>Some of my constituents are angry that we face economic turmoil, some are confused as to how this will improve our situation and some are disillusioned with the issue being clouded in confusion and politicians turning it into a political football.  Many of my constituents recall the 1980s, a time when interest rates were in the region of 20%, emigration was rampant and jobs were non-existent.  They recall much harder times than we are currently experiencing.  However, I do not wish to detract from the seriousness of our current situation.  On the other hand, many of my younger constituents do not recall harder times and have only lived through the boom years.  They too are concerned and do not envisage how they will cope with less disposable income.  On a more positive note, I am a firm believer in our ability as a nation to face this matter and deal with it responsibly.</P>
        <P>NAMA is a credible solution to our problems.  It will not let the banks, the builders or those who have done so much wrong off the hook.  Fianna F&aacute;il is not in the business of letting anyone off the hook.  Those responsible for wrongdoing will be made answerable in due course.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that in recent years our banking system has let the country down badly.  The banks have shown reckless behaviour and I am confident that those responsible will face appropriate consequences in due course.  There has been much discussion about this legislation was a bailout for banks and developers.  It is not about bailing out banks, developers or anyone&rsquo;s friends.  It is about bailing out a country, that is every man, woman and child for generations to come.  Without a properly functioning banking system our country would sink.  We as legislators must take responsibility for eradicating this danger and building a fully functioning banking system to bring our economy back from the brink.</P>
        <P>Some may claim I am being dramatic with such strong words but the situation is that serious.  NAMA is the most creditworthy solution to our banking problems.  It has been thoroughly planned and has the backing of the IMF, the OECD and the ECB.</P>
        <P>Alternative solutions have been proposed by the Opposition, none of which were convincing.  The Opposition has not even managed to cost its supposed solutions.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s <Col N="64" />proposal to establish an asset management agency with a different name would impose a 50% discount on loans being transferred to the agency which would lead to the State having to recapitalise the banks in full, achieving the Labour Party&rsquo;s goal of a State-owned banking system.  It would also be in violation of European Commission regulations.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael wants to follow the Lehman Brothers model with the establishment of a new magic bank that would borrow &euro;30 billion from the ECB.  However, the problem lies in that the ECB would demand collateral, leaving the State to provide the magic bank with &euro;50 billion to &euro;60 billion in bonds, a nonsense.  It appears to be a case of finding any solution rather than supporting the Government&rsquo;s solution.</P>
        <P>This is a very irresponsible Opposition.  It has been in the business of finger-pointing for some years.  When times were good, it wanted spending increased.  It was not that long ago it demanded stamp duty be abolished.  If the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, had acceded to these demands we would be in a fine mess now.  Now the Opposition claims the Government is spending too much.  It does not know whether it is coming or going.</P>
        <P>The Government takes this matter seriously.  It will not walk away from the economic situation in which we currently find ourselves.  The NAMA Bill has been drawn up on the basis of expert advice and counsel available to the Government from the NTMA, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank as well as other financial and legal advisers.  Similar solutions have been applied in other countries and have led to successful outcomes.</P>
        <P>We are endeavouring to introduce legislation which will save our economy from further crises.  This is similar to last year&rsquo;s State bank guarantee for deposits.  That courageous action saved our banks from collapse.  We now have no option but to examine how to rebuild our banking system through NAMA.  Failure to do so would mean many would not be able to get credit from banks.  The current crisis needs to be halted or our economy will never improve.</P>
        <P>We must ensure those businesses and individuals which are surviving and making profits are facilitated for credit.  To do so the banks must be in a position to access credit.  NAMA will clear the balance sheets for these banks to return to basic lending functions.  NAMA proposes to buy land and development loans and certain associated loans from the banks at prices well below the current book value.  They will be managed over time to achieve the best possible return for the taxpayer.  The banks will be smaller, cleaner and better funded and will be in a position to focus their resources on their core function &mdash; that of lending to those who require credit.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate about the valuation of these loans.  The Minister for Finance announced last week that there will be an estimated aggregate discount of 30% but that each individual loan will require a separate valuation once the Act commences.  There is much attention to detail in this proposal and I commend the Minister&rsquo;s diligence on this.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal that any financial institution participating in NAMA will be required to restructure its operations which will lead to a reformed and reinvigorated banking system.  It is vital we learn from mistakes and ensure they never happen again.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister&rsquo;s endeavours to introduce a legislative regime to deal with distressed financial institutions which will ensure deposit holders are protected while maintaining the competence of the international markets.  Aside from the obvious benefits of NAMA to the banking sector and the positive knock-on effects it will have for businesses and households, there is also a noticeable improvement in confidence in our economy.  This has led to a reduction in the cost of borrowing for the State, a welcome development.</P><Col N="65" />
        <P>There is the possibility that NAMA will be in a position to facilitate various Departments for their requirements such as schools, parks and so forth.  In the past they had to pay ludicrous sums for such projects.  Under this Bill they may be afforded first option on the disposal of such properties.</P>
        <P>Over the past year, the Government has at all times taken the necessary tough decisions, many of which were harsh for many to bear.  We have not evaded our responsibilities to be popular.  We have implemented the changes necessary to bring about stability when required and will continue to do so.  There will always be critics who believe things could have been done differently.  However, I have the fullest confidence in the Minister for Finance to ensure the greater good of our citizens is kept at the heart of any decision the Government must take in the next three months.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The first requirement of any economic recovery is a clear and clinical analysis of how and why we got in the mess.  The Government wants us to forget the recent past while the Taoiseach and his Ministers would have us believe our economic problems were caused by foreigners.  Only as late as last week, the Taoiseach blamed the difficulties on the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  This is not true.  Our problems are very much home-grown.</P>
        <P>The economic crisis in Ireland was caused by the Galway tent school of economics.  Central to this ideology was the belief that we could build a sustainable economic future on the back of an unsustainable property bubble.  The property bubble was supported by a raft of tax incentives and tax dodges introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, and kept in place by his successor, Deputy Cowen, for four years.  Its true nature was expressed in Charlie McCreevy&rsquo;s infamous phrase, &ldquo;If you have it, spend it&rdquo;.  Spend they did.</P>
        <P>Now Fianna F&aacute;il wants us to forget about the Galway tent.  We all heard the story about how many claimed to be in the GPO in 1916.  The Galway tent is like the GPO in reverse, with Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers claiming they did not like the Galway tent, that they never spent much time there and it was all a very long time ago.  The biggest cheerleader of all for these reckless days was former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Nobody in Fianna F&aacute;il shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  Those who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes were advised to commit suicide.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Why was this allowed to pertain?  Encouraged, supported and cheered on by the Government, property developers and bankers went on orgy of speculation, borrowing, lending and grossly extended leverage.  The banks themselves became property speculators through special investment vehicles which were kept off balance sheets.  A further risk was added when many senior bankers, across our banking system, became property speculators in their own right in addition to the day job.  Any sense of a conflict of interest was abandoned.  Our bankers lost all sense of proportion, showed little or no understanding of risk and did not seem to realise that the value of the assets they used as collateral was grossly inflated by the easy credit lending of the banks.  In the words of Morgan Kelly, &ldquo;property bubbles are the consequence of abnormal levels of bank lending.  Once the bank lending that fuelled the boom returns to its usual levels, prices return roughly to where they started before the boom&rdquo;.</P>
    
          <P>These incompetent senior bankers believed their own foolishness and convinced themselves that they deserved their huge salaries and bonuses.  Never has failure been so grossly and <Col N="66" />brazenly rewarded.  Across the whole Irish banking sector there was a failure at board level and a failure at senior management level.  The directors of Irish financial institutions turned out to be very expensive mushrooms, fed manure by the senior managers they were supposed to supervise.  It is right and fitting that there be a clear-out of board members in Irish banks.  There will also need to be a clear-out of senior managers who led the banks over the cliff and who are still in denial about the scale of the problems facing the Irish banking system.</P>
        <P>All the while the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator allowed a Frankenstinian monster to grow.  Our banking supervisory system was governed by the principles of &ldquo;hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&rdquo;.  This supervisory system was hatched by the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, and the current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  The current Minister for Finance proposes to radically change the system which has existed for only a few years.</P>
        <P>Banking supervision is not rocket science.  In October 2006 the Bank for International Settlements published a very useful document entitled Core Principles of Effective Banking Supervision.  It is not complicated and is only six pages long.  If these principles had been applied in recent years to the Irish banks we would not be in this mess.  I commend them to the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The collapse of Northern Rock in 2007 should have been a wake-up call for all banks, banking supervisors and the Government.  All of these entities stayed in denial about the situation for another 12 months.  Indeed, the Government and the regulator kept on reassuring us that our banks were well capitalised.  Decisive intervention two years ago would have lessened much of the present damage.  Instead Fianna F&aacute;il focused on itself and its crisis of leadership.</P>
        <P>Many warning signs were flashing regarding the quality of financial supervision in Ireland but senior members of the Government actively supported and encouraged a light touch approach to regulation.  The former Minister and present Commissioner McCreevy boasted on many occasions about the lack of regulation and went on to preach the same stupid message in Europe for several years.  Despite high profile corruption cases involving companies based in the IFSC, neither the Government nor the regulator took any action.  The Government stood idly by while Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for financial probity was trashed in the international economic arena.  Despite the high profile court cases, the loss of reputation and the warning signs the Government sailed on regardless.</P>
        <P>In December 2005 at the annual IFSC lunch Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, assured his audience that he was further weakening the already lax regulations in this area and that the law would be further eased.  He said he would &ldquo;be less prescriptive about methods a company uses to review compliance procedures and in not requiring a review of the compliance statement by an external auditor&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance would have us believe that there is no alternative to NAMA.  This is the same Minister who believes that Anglo Irish Bank is of systemic importance to the Irish economy.  How many economists can he quote to support his opinion?  The newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank does not support his opinion.</P>
        <P>In addition to being a bad bank NAMA will be one of the largest property developers in the world.  It is interesting to briefly look at the other bad bank which the Government owns, Anglo Irish Bank.  The Government has already invested &euro;3.8 billion in it and may have to invest more.  According to newspaper speculation at the weekend that could extend to &euro;10 billion by the time the bank is fully recapitalised.  What are the realistic prospects of getting this money back?  Eight months after nationalisation the bank has been unable to produce a <Col N="67" />business plan.  We learnt from recent court cases that it was prepared to roll over all interest to the Zoe group up to 2014.</P>
        <P>Even more alarming was the willingness of Anglo Irish Bank to lend a further &euro;68 million to the Zoe group to finance the development of a new headquarters for the bank, and all this for a building that does not even have planning permission.  What justification is there for Anglo Irish Bank to build a new headquarters in the present climate?  What justification is there for it to receive further funds from the Irish taxpayer when it is a dead bank walking?  It has no future but the Government is bent on continuing to put taxpayers&rsquo; money into the bank.  This makes no sense.</P>
        <P>How is the public interest being served by these revelations from Anglo Irish Bank?  What is the Minister doing to stop this crazy behaviour in a bank that we now own?  If it is our bank why can he not ensure proper answers to these questions, rather than letting it continue on a course which offers no future for the bank or the taxpayer?</P>
        <P>With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s valuation model for assets being acquired by NAMA, Eoin McDermott, chairman of the valuation division of the Society of Chartered Surveyors, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 1 September, &ldquo;From a chartered surveyor&rsquo;s point of view, it will represent a departure from conventional valuation that has been developed and well tested over a period of 40 years&rdquo;.  <i>The Irish Times </i>last week published a report to the effect that Irish Life had reduced its asking price for three Dublin properties by 50% since May 2008.  That was one year after prices peaked.  Who is likely to have a better understanding of the Irish property market &mdash; Irish Life or NAMA?  No one believes that we have reached the bottom of the market.  Over-valuing these impaired assets at this stage has extraordinary implications for this society.</P>
        <P>Why is the Minister not putting pressure on the banks to sell valuable overseas assets?  AIB and Bank of Ireland have substantial assets which could be sold.  For example, AIB owns almost 25% of M&amp;T Bank in America.  As of yesterday the value of that shareholding was of the order of $1.75 billion, a not insignificant sum of money.  Nobody can say that M&amp;T Bank is part of AIB&rsquo;s core assets.  AIB would be wise to sell its shareholding in its banks in Poland and elsewhere in Europe as a means of stabilising its Irish business.  All the Irish banks have made such a bad job of managing their Irish divisions it is impossible to have any confidence in their management of their overseas divisions.  It is quite likely that landmines lie buried in their overseas operations.</P>
        <P>The Minister has yet to tell us how he will make sure that the banks start lending again when their balance sheets have been cleaned up.  There is nothing in the Bill about that.  The Minister has had months to announce a scheme, which should have been brought before this House, in which moneys which are to be put on to the balance sheets will improve liquidity.  These are not the IOUs to which the Taoiseach referred but real cash that we must pay back.  Unless there is a guarantee that this will lead to some improvement in liquidity why are we taking this gamble?  It is bizarre that the Minister did not set out a scheme, either in his speech to this House last week, or in the accompanying documentation, whereby he can prove to the House that the moneys the banks obtain will improve liquidity for Irish business.  There is no evidence from his statements last week or from any Government announcement that he has a new scheme and can show beyond doubt that the money the banks get will go to small and medium sized enterprises, householders and businesses that want to survive.  Businesses need money now but none of this will come to pass until the middle of next year.  Many thousands of jobs will go to the wall and another opportunity will have been lost.</P>
        <P>I hope the Government will allow the Opposition to tease out the entire Bill on Committee Stage in the plenary session of this House rather than in a committee of the D&aacute;il.  Given the importance of the Bill it is essential that commitment be given.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy on solving the banking crisis is based on doing what is best for this country.  It was formulated long before the draft legislation on NAMA was published and is well thought out.  We believe it will work, unlike the Government&rsquo;s policy.  However, our spokesperson is willing to engage with the Government and put forward amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Even at this late stage, we call on the Government to halt.  We want this because we do not have confidence in the Government&rsquo;s model.  We do not know its potential cost.  A valuation has been put on land that is widely disputed by many experts.  Deputy Hayes outlined how Irish Life decreased its valuation on several properties.  We do not believe we have reached the bottom.  In particular, we do not believe there will be a 10% increase in property prices over the next ten years because there is no evidence to suggest that will be the case.  We also believe it is inherently unfair that the taxpayer, who is suffering as a result of the recession and the bad management of the public finances and the banking crisis, has now been asked to pick up the tab for any potential losses into the future.  We believe the loss should lie with the shareholder and the bondholder.</P>
        <P>Equally important, there is no certainty that money will be loaned back into the economy.  The advantage of the Fine Gael model was to have the good bank, the bad bank, the national recovery bank.  By the end of October we might have had a national recovery bank set up which would have loaned money back into the economy.  We see what is happening across the water.  The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, is urging banks to lend to business.  Banks will not lend into a recession unless there is legislation or regulation included in the policy that will make them do so. Utterances and pleas from Government will not make them lend back into the economy.  Meanwhile, we have several small businesses that are starved of cash, many of which are viable.</P>
        <P>I shall outline again how our policy would have made the shareholder and the bondholder responsible.  It is not a case of reneging on a national debt.  Whether they are from Kiltimagh or Khartoum, people who invest in banks realise they are taking a chance.  If it works out, they get the fruits of their investment; if it fails they pick up the cost.  That is what investment is about.  We cannot see the basis for the valuation of &euro;44 billion, which, when &euro;7 billion is added, comes to &euro;54 billion.  That figure was called an estimate in recent times by the Government.</P>
        <P>There is no mechanism in place to ensure the banks will give back the money, which is one of the biggest flaws in the current system.  The IMF has pointed out how Government-managed asset companies have been largely ineffective due to political and legal constraints.  We all know there will be political and legal restraints regarding the proposal and model the Government is setting up.  The Irish economy needs a functional bank system to assist our economy in recovering.</P>
        <P>When the recapitalisation and investment money is given over to the banks, it will have come from the taxpayers.  They are writing this cheque.  Banks will use that money to pay off their own liabilities to other banks and international money markets and will not lend to Irish business.  Unfortunately, if we go ahead with this legislation without having amended it as we in Fine Gael wish, we will be back in this Chamber time and time again over the coming years, decrying the fact that Irish business has no access to funding.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe mentioned that nobody shouted &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; during the boom.  During the allocation of funding for social housing some years ago I remember pointing out that it was incorrect to be putting money into it because doing so was fuelling the property boom.  I called on the then Minister, Deputy Dick Roche, to put the money into infrastructural projects.  We all bought into the Celtic tiger and got our pound of flesh.  We were happy to spend, spend, spend and not think about tomorrow.  However, there is an onus on the Government to manage <Col N="69" />the economy.  We can blame the bankers and regulators but, ultimately, the Government, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are the guardians of the public purse.</P>
        <P>In his speech, the Minister mentioned the concept of a windfall tax of 80%.  I do not know how he envisages this happening.  Will it apply to currently zoned land or land that may be zoned in the future?  Will it apply only to land that will be newly zoned from here on in, or from a particular date such as the date of the passing of the legislation?  It is my guesstimate that no land will be zoned in Ireland over the next ten to 15 years, other than some in the immediate city centre areas of Dublin and Cork, because there will be no demand for it.  In the next few years we will see bulldozers going into the Leitrims, Longfords and Laoises to knock down houses because there will be no demand for them.  Will NAMA be subject to the windfall tax if it acquires such properties and disposes of them?  Will the Minister outline in his summing up speech the amendments that have been published before Second Stage is finished?  I refer to land that is taken under compulsory purchase order from individuals.  Will this be subject to a windfall tax?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The concept of a community dividend was mentioned.  We all like the idea of parks and land being given to community projects but I am firmly of the view that if it goes ahead in this form or any other, NAMA should not include a community dividend.  Its objectives will be difficult enough to achieve without muddying the waters further.  It would also be an easy opt out for whatever authority is established to recoup the money.  A community dividend would be an opportunity to let the agency or company off the hook.  There should be no community dividend because land will be cheap enough to purchase for community projects.</P>

We cannot have Ministers going around the country cutting ribbons, laying cement blocks, cutting tapes and putting on hard hats while the country is going down the Swanee.  There is only a limited amount we can do to reform the banking system but we can reform the political system and that is what we need to do first, to get our own house in order.  If we do that then we will be able to carry out the changes required in other institutions.</P>

	<P>Does anybody remember what happened on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 1985?  Ireland&rsquo;s largest bank at the time, AIB, disclosed the failure of its subsidiary, Insurance Corporation of Ireland, known as ICI at the time.  That was probably the worst and the biggest financial difficulty the State had ever seen, along with that from two years previously, the failure of the PMPA with liabilities of approximately &pound;223 million.  </P>
        <P>During that time, commentators pointed to the various potential warning signs that were available in advance.

	<P>I was making the point about ICI whose underwriting losses in 1982 went from &pound;0.5 million to &pound;7.3 million.  At the time, ICI was selling insurance premiums in its London office, insuring satellites, bloodstock and fairgrounds.  All of this collapsed and there were hundreds of millions worth of claims against the company.  The Government of the day had two options; it could have stood back and let the liquidation take place when the company was about to go into liquidation or it could have responded appropriately to the consequences.  The Government could either assume the liabilities of ICI from AIB or it could allow a run on AIB&rsquo;s cash which would have been a run on the bank and which would be contagious.  Who saved that company and who made the decision?  None other than Dr. Garret FitzGerald who was the Taoiseach of the country at the time and Mr. Alan Dukes who was the Minister for Finance.  They decided that this company could not be allowed to go into liquidation and that AIB was to be allowed to walk away.  They decided that the reputation of the country was so important that the claims against the company should be honoured and that existing insurance premiums should be fully covered.  This was the decision taken during a very difficult period for the country.  I understand it cost several hundred million to solve that problem and we all remember the 2% insurance levy and the PMPA.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that the administrator of ICI at that time was Mr. Donal O&rsquo;Connor who is now the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank.  I was talking to Mr. Alan Dukes last week and he said that ICI as a company has still not been wound up because there are still claims being dealt with 25 years later.  It is important for the Opposition to remember that this was a decision taken by the Government of the day and it was the correct decision so as not to allow Ireland&rsquo;s reputation to be tarnished by allowing a major company, which had insured a variety of assets all over the world, to fail and not honour the claims.</P>
        <P>This is what the Government is trying to do with NAMA.  The banking system provides vital working capital for Irish business as this is the lifeblood of business.  Every sector from agriculture to manufacturing is suffering from a lack of access to overdrafts and working capital.  They cannot buy stock or trade because they do not have confidence.</P>
        <P>I have been in business since 1 April 1985 &mdash; April fool&rsquo;s day.  I am no different to anybody else.  Our company has suffered, our turnover is down.  We deal in the motor trade, in the motor parts business and car sales are down 60% to 70%.  The message from my employees is that customers and other businesses do not have confidence in themselves, in the country or in the economy.  They are afraid to purchase out of fear they will be unable to pay for the goods when payment is due.  They are not receiving support from the banks because the banks are looking at their business and reducing rather than increasing overdrafts.  Businesses which have never had any difficulty with banks or with trading are the ones who are suffering because of this crisis.  The result has been job losses in the economy.  The live register figures in August were at 428,000 people whereas one year earlier the live register figure was 236,000.  Lack of working capital is a particular problem for small businesses who do not have major reserves and who are dependent on overdrafts to keep their businesses on the go.</P>
        <P>It is important to put in place a firm foundation for the Irish banking system.  This is the first and most immediate issue facing the Government and this nation.  Several Members have also made the point that this is not about rescuing the banks or developers but rather about saving <Col N="71" />the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people who are not greedy, who did not go mad in the boom but now are being thrown out of a job because of the collapse of the banking system and its inability to lend to productive enterprises.</P>
        <P>I have looked at the options put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party and I genuinely believe that the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and the NAMA option is probably the best one at this time.  It is not without fault but it is the best option.  It is neither perfect nor without risk but if we abandon plans to implement it we will destroy international and investment confidence in this economy and the ability of the Irish political system to provide leadership in a time of crisis.  Failure to implement NAMA will turn Ireland into &mdash; I hate to use the term &mdash; a banana republic.  That said, we have a duty to minimise the risks to the taxpayer by ensuring that valuations paid for bank assets are realistic and that an element of risk sharing is put in place, along the lines advocated by the new Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan.  The Minister has set out clearly how the risk will be shared.  Realistic valuations should be based on international experience of property boom and bust.  I read recently that Professor Morgan Kelly of University College Dublin estimated that between 2000 and 2007 while nominal GNP rose by 77%, mortgage lending rose from &euro;24 billion to &euro;115 billion, lending to builders rose from &euro;2.4 billion to &euro;25 billion and lending to developers from &euro;5 billion to &euro;80 billion.  Should the usual post-bubble correction occur in Ireland, this suggests that real prices of residential and commercial property would return to the levels of the mid to late 1990s, two thirds below peak values.  This seems to me to be a realistic and suitable valuation and one for which the Government should aim.</P>
        <P>The tax-paying public are being asked to risk a considerable amount of public money to save the banking system when there are many demands from the old, the sick and disabled which we cannot meet.  The public have a right to demand that bankers and developers, whose greed, arrogance and stupidity precipitated the crisis, pay and are seen to pay for their misdeeds.</P>
        <P>I note that the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the fraud squad are in Anglo Irish Bank.  I understand that as many as 400 witness statements will be taken along with the forensic investigation of all transactions and decisions of the bank.  This bank has done major damage to Ireland&rsquo;s international credibility.  We must show that we are serious and get to the bottom of decisions taken by that bank and other financial institutions.</P>
        <P>We must also show that we are serious about regulation.  The Financial Regulator was asleep at the wheel.  Instead of monitoring the banks and other financial institutions, his staff spent their time hounding mortgage brokers regarding the content of their adverts.  They hounded people who were trying to make a living instead of monitoring what was happening in the banks.</P>
        <P>On 22 January last, I wrote to Deputy Michael Ahern, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, asking for a full investigation into what went wrong with the bank.

When all this is dealt with and if prosecutions are taken against individuals, the Oireachtas should get to the bottom of what went wrong in our financial system so that if we introduce regulatory legislation we will do so having been informed by a proper inquiry.</P>
        <P>I have seen people come before Oireachtas committees whom I do not believe have been truthful.  Much of the information given by witnesses to committees in the past 12 months was evasive and not the truth.  The only way to get at the truth is to use the powers of discovery and compellability which would ensure that witnesses appearing before committees would have to tell the truth and produce documents.</P>
        <P>The National Asset Management Agency will purchase land and development loans from the banks, together with their largest related investment property loans, at a discount to book value.  We are doing this in order to help banks to clean up their balance sheets, reduce uncertainty regarding their bad debts, boost the flow of credit to businesses and households and kick-start the economy.  NAMA will purchase the loans through the issue of Government bonds.  Many people think we will, physically, take money out of the taxpayers&rsquo; purses and give it to the banks.  We are giving a piece of paper which will allow a bank to go the European Central Bank and draw down funds based on the value of that bond.  NAMA will pay 1.5% for the privilege of having that money available to the Irish banking system.</P>
        <P>Of course, the decision to take not only the impaired or non-performing loans but also performing loans and property assets, was correct.  Some 40% of the loans taken are performing loans.  Those performing loans will help pay the running expenses as well as the interest rates on the money drawn down by the banking system.</P>
        <P>This is not a bailout for borrowers who have purchased these properties.  All borrowers, no matter who they are, will be required to pay back all the money they were lent, including rolled-over interest.  If they fail to service their debts, NAMA will call in their loans and take possession of the assets on which the loans are secured.  Until now, the banks were hiding these loans on their balance sheets.  They were rolling over the interest because they could not get it from borrowers.  They could not get blood from a turnip.  They did not want to liquidate people who owed them &euro;1 billion or more because that would reflect badly on the bank.  One bank has done this because it is not an Irish bank and is, obviously, trying to exit Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is important for the people to know that even though we are buying the book debt it will not simply sit there.  NAMA will make firm decisions on what is to be done, whether something is viable, whether it can pay its way or must be liquidated, in full or in part, to repay developers&rsquo; loans.</P>
        <P>The banks have much to answer for.  They competed for business and did not want others to get it.  They took extreme risks.  When the banks deal with smaller business people now, they roast them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is roasting me, but I know several business people who are finding it difficult.  Banks are being aggressive towards businesses that have worked hard to employ people and provide manufacturing goods and services.  They are placing people under pressure at a time when they should not.  It is not the people&rsquo;s fault that there is a slow down in the economy and a fall off in business of 30% to 60%.</P>
        <P>In Athlone recently, I made it clear to the Minister that we need banks to guarantee that, when assets are removed from their balance sheets and they have the ECB&rsquo;s money, money will flow to businesses and house owners and the haranguing and pressuring of decent people who are trying to run their businesses and keep people employed will stop.  For any employer, there is nothing worse than needing to put someone on a three-day week or make employees redundant, particularly where a person might have served for 20 years or longer.  This is distressing for any business person who values employees, and they lose skills and expertise.  Unfortunately, for businesses to survive and to cut costs, difficult decisions must be made.</P>
        <P>I send a clear message to the two major banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, that they should stop what they are doing and try to help businesses and people to survive in these difficult times.  I have great confidence in the country.  We are an open market economy and I do not doubt that we will come out of the recession, do well again and prepare for the upturn over the next 12 months.  That upturn will only come if working capital is available to businesses and confidence is restored in the economy so that people are not afraid to trade or buy goods and services and are not worried that their bank managers are waiting to take them into surgery and dissect them.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeBehan"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Behan</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is unprecedented in its scope and potential impact on our small nation.  In my 25 years as a public representative, few issues have caused me such deep concern.  As a parent, teacher and public representative, I have made decisions that affected the lives of others.  I have always taken this responsibility seriously and it is why I have listened carefully to all sides of the debate on this issue inside and outside the House.</P>
        <P>Those being asked to shoulder the enormous burden proposed by the plan, the people of Ireland, should at the very least be given an opportunity to express their opinion by way of a referendum.  However, as in the past in the House, I am in the minority on this issue.  It is ironic that we cannot trust the people with decisions of this magnitude.  Is it any wonder that they no longer trust politicians?</P>
        <P>Before I detail some of my concerns I ask the people and every Deputy to stop, think and ask themselves one simple question, namely, why are we expected to accept that precious billions of our hard earned euro should be shovelled immediately and without question into discredited and dysfunctional banks that made enormous and obscene profits on the backs of ordinary decent people?  Many do not agree with this plan and are deeply upset by it.  We have a great responsibility to ensure that their voices are heard in this debate.</P>
        <P>I question many aspects of the Bill and the Minister for Finance must deal with them in his reply.  How will a probable rise in the ECB interest rate affect taxpayers&rsquo; exposure?  Will an increased rate affect our ability to repay our debt and how can we quantify the pressure this will put on our already overburdened Exchequer funds?  Why is NAMA paying &euro;9 billion for <Col N="74" />the rolled up interest of developers&rsquo; loans?  It appears that recycled and rolled over debt is a major problem in the global financial crisis and threatens to derail many of the mitigating measures already in place.  Is this the case and, if so, how are we going to deal with this further threat?  Why is the risk-sharing element so pathetically low?  If the banks are to show the gratitude about which the Minister talks, they should accept a higher element of risk for these loans.  However, could I be so bold as to suggest to the Minister not to be so naive as to expect gratitude from institutions, the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of which is the bottom line and which have no concept of the common good?</P>
        <P>I am convinced that we are paying too much for these loans.  Having listened to many commentators, the market value of the assets is less than stated.  The provision for long-term economic value is too generous and forecasts for recovery are too optimistic.</P>
        <P>My other major concern about the introduction of NAMA is that, for the banks, it appears it will be business as usual.  I seriously question whether there is sufficient impetus for reform in our banking institutions.  If we do not insist on radical reform, we will see a return to incentivising quick profits.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;This Government is determined to re-fashion the financial and banking system, and to address and correct all regulatory and governance shortcomings&rdquo;.  These are mere words.  How will this be done and what level of public and Oireachtas accountability will be provided?</P>
        <P>In the large and understandable public outcry about the behaviour of banks, a caveat must be entered.  The vast majority of bank employees are just as much victims of the misdeeds of the senior management in their institutions as we are.  It is wrong to take out our frustrations on ordinary bank staff who are trying to make ends meet like the rest of us and who had no hand, act or part in the disgraceful conduct of their bosses.  What assurances will the Minister provide to those ordinary staff members that they will not be victimised for the actions of others?</P>
        <P>I have deep misgivings about NAMA.  The more I hear about it, the less I like it, but I will hold off on making a final decision until I have heard the Minister&rsquo;s response to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Sean O&rsquo;Casey gave us the lines &ldquo;the whole world&rsquo;s in a terrible state of chassis&rdquo;.  This sums up Ireland, in that we are in a state of chassis.  Why?  It is due to reckless lending on the part of banks and developers chasing profits and increased turnover.  It is due to the minimal and at times non-existent State regulation of the banking and financial sectors.  It is due to what can only be called an orgy of property speculation based on greed and private gain.  It is due to the fact that we seem to lack a vision of the type of country and society in which we want to live.  It is due to the unhealthy relationships between bankers, developers, financiers and politicians.  Above all, it is due to the fact that this State, especially the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments of the past decade, ceased putting the needs of its people above the driving greed of those developers and bankers and, in the process, turned its back on the values of fairness, social justice and equality.</P>
        <P>The crisis is also due to speculation in the price of land and the issue of rezoning.  Land was rezoned by politicians, banks lent money to the speculators and developers and we are left considering the excessive cost of the tribunals trying to unravel this mess.  Why were the recommendations of the Kenny report not implemented, and what do we have to show for this?  Heavy mortgages, negative equity, the price of land allowed to move way beyond its actual value, developments of apartment blocks with gated communities inhospitable to families and built with no regard to the existing culture and environment, unlived in estates in towns and <Col N="75" />villages, rotting hulks of unfinished buildings, massive job losses and, above all, wasted opportunity.</P>
        <P>What do the young people I had been teaching until last June have to look forward to?  They will have few opportunities for jobs, for the realisation of their many talents and for nurturing their confidence in a safe, cleaner, more equal and friendly society.  So much could have been done in the more prosperous years.  So much now remains to be repaired in the wake of this Celtic catastrophe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can examine the Docklands area of Dublin Central as a microcosm of the macrocosm.  Community activists, including the late Mr. Tony Gregory, ceaselessly questioned and opposed the manner of this development because it was based on the greed and profit of developers and bankers, aided by politicians.  There are key prime examples of arrested developments and unfinished buildings.  It is suggested that they should be left in place as a type of museum, a warning to future generations of what happens when dictatorial greed is the motivating and unifying factor among bankers, developers and politicians.</P>
        <P>For me, some of the worst excesses have been the payments, bonuses and expenses of those in high positions in business, banking, finance, development and State agencies, and the easy access to multi-million euro loans, secretively concealed.  It appears that here, bonuses are disaster related and not performance related; the bigger the disaster, the bigger the bonus.  Consider the wages being paid and what we are getting in return.  It is obvious that high wages and bonuses do not necessarily bring the best brains and the most committed to the job.  Shakespeare stated there was something rotten in the state of Denmark but, equally, there is something rotten in the state of Ireland.</P>
        <P>So much money is being provided for NAMA that it is mind boggling, particularly for those who are struggling, whom I meet every day.  I refer to hard-working people losing jobs and homes.  My constituents are living in the shadows of fear over what is yet to come.  The figures are mind boggling for people on community projects and drugs projects that are facing uncertainty.  They are mind boggling for the people living in locations such as O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Croke Villas who were left shattered by the collapse of the public private partnerships, and for those trying to survive on social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>I accept we need a functioning banking system for the efficient operation of the economy but that functioning banking system must be open, transparent, honest, accountable and responsible.  My concern is that we are giving the same people who let us down the task of saving the country.  They were not open, honest or responsible but reckless, greedy, selfish and motivated by private gain.  They just took and gave nothing in return and still refuse to accept responsibility for the economic collapse.  These people have let us down and they must not be allowed to do so again.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach rightly said he wants to return the country to growth for the benefit of all.  Is NAMA the right way to do this?  I wish to believe those proposing and supporting NAMA are doing so with the best interests of the people at heart.  I accept every solution to the current economic crisis involves risk.  A very significant risk associated with NAMA is the fact that the lands bought by developers at excessively high prices, and whose price has now collapsed, will at some time increase in value again.  Will that set in motion the exact cycle that has brought us to the point of economic and social &ldquo;chassis&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>No matter what solution is put forward &mdash; NAMA, nationalising the banks, temporarily or otherwise, or having a good bank-bad bank arrangement &mdash; there must be certain minimum requirements.  These include absolute protection for the taxpayer, who should not have to pay for the blunders of the bankers and the sins of the speculators, as many are now doing; strict <Col N="76" />and independent regulation of the banking and financial sector and accountability in the D&aacute;il; a complete clear-out of directors and senior staff responsible for these disasters; stringent regulation of salaries, bonuses and dividends; and mechanisms to ensure the banks and financial institutions release funds for productive and social purposes and do not use taxpayers&rsquo; money for private investment or as a counterweight on deposit for some other far-flung foreign investments.  Risks must not be shouldered by the taxpayer and those on social welfare, and buildings, sites and assets should be used in a creative and socially beneficial way.  Above all, a responsible, honest functioning banking system with a social conscience is required.  We must get it right and we must be guided by principles of fairness, social justice and equality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill at this important time in the economic crisis.  It is important that all Members deal with the real issues in people&rsquo;s lives and generate important ideas to resolve our problems.  We need leadership and vision to deal with the economic mess we are in.  Leadership is about doing the right thing at the right time in the interest of the people but it is also about taking responsibility for one&rsquo;s actions.  Sadly, this is not happening enough, both in this House or in banking, and among developers, speculators and a section of the business class.</P>
        <P>Although the international economic downturn has affected Ireland, let there be no mistake that we have witnessed economic treason on the part of bankers, speculators and developers.  The people are hurting, angry and fed up with all those who have shafted their own country.  That is the message I want to introduce to the debate before talking about solutions.</P>
        <P>Emotion, sound bites and anger will not get us out of this mess.  Playing politics will not help this country.  My agenda on NAMA will depend on protecting the taxpayers, mortgage holders, small businesses and the weaker sections of society.  I will study all proposals and amendments in the House.  If the final legislation is not people friendly, the House can forget about my vote.  That will be my clear position over the next month.  As with the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, I will pay maximum attention to all sensible proposals and solutions and vote accordingly.  That is where I stand and there will be no fudge when I make my final decision.  I have heard the Government say it is open to new proposals and ideas.  Let us see whether this is so over the next few weeks.  I will judge the Government on its actions.</P>
        <P>The economic meltdown has the potential to tear our country apart socially and at the level of the individual.  A new vengeful generation has seen its prosperity sacrificed upon the altar of voodoo economics.  Bitter divisions are emerging, some of which are being stirred up by irresponsible media elements.  Some public sector workers are being pitted against precariously employed private-sector employees.  Social welfare recipients are pitted against poorly paid immigrant workers.  Behind every statistic lies the human cost in poverty, family breakdown, depression and suicide.</P>
        <P>It is important that we who subscribe to the ideas of an ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann should be to the fore in promoting the measures to which I refer.  It is urgent to reimpose regulation on the whole banking and financial services sector.  Regulation was gradually stripped away by the new right since the 1970s.  There should be a wall separating commercial banking and saving from casino capitalism, high-stakes property speculation and gambling on global stock markets.</P>
        <P>Let me make some proposals.  The NAMA legislation must include a section debarring any former owners, directors or executives of development companies, financial institutions or banks connected with the toxic debts from owning, buying or having any beneficial interest whatever in the assets being sold by NAMA.  The legislation should contain a provision to protect those defaulting mortgage holders who, through no fault of their own, find themselves <Col N="77" />unable to make repayments to those financial institutions we are about to support.  Why is nobody talking about the poor mortgage holders in this debate?  The silence is deafening.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While NAMA and its spending of taxpayers&rsquo; money should kick start the banking system, the legislation should state clearly that the protection of existing bank shareholders or bond holders must not be a consideration.  NAMA legislation should be cleansed of all those provisions that give the Minister for Finance the power to intervene and meddle in its operations.  NAMA should come under the democratic control of and be answerable and accountable constantly and continually to the Oireachtas.  The objectives of the NAMA legislation should include a social dimension.  In this regard, land banks and assets that will come under the control and ownership of NAMA should be used to facilitate the provision of sites for social infrastructure, including schools, health centres, community centres and leisure centres.</P>
        <P>These are all sensible proposals and should be accorded priority in this debate and in the legislation.  I welcome the recent comments of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to the effect that this is part of his agenda also.  I hope he will deliver on these issues.</P>
      
        <P>Let us consider the three options.  The Government&rsquo;s NAMA option would create a bad bank which buys up all the property loans from the banks in return for Government guaranteed bonds of an amount less than the original value of the loan.  The loan would continue to be repaid with the expectation of a bounce by the market.  This is risky and potentially costly.  How does one value property in the current climate and how much will the taxpayer pay?</P>
        <P>I refer to the Fine Gael proposal of a good bank bad bank.  This is a twin-track plan to make credit available by setting up a wholesale good bank with a clear balance sheet funded by the European Central Bank.  The banks would be given until the end of the guarantee in September 2010 to show they have repaired the balance sheets.  However, the weakness is that the plan appears to envisage not paying bondholders and the possibility of banks defaulting.  What would this do for our perception internationally?  These are legitimate questions.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Labour Party proposal on nationalisation.  Normally, I would be in favour of nationalisation but I would rather go after banks when they have money, not when they are bust.  The temporary nationalisation suggested by the Labour Party would extend for the period covered by the bank guarantee and during this limited period of public ownership balance sheets would be cleaned up with substantial State investment before being re-privatised.  However, the weakness in the argument is that corporate depositors do not like nationalised banks.  How will the banks raise capital to lend money if they are State owned?  These are legitimate points to raise in the debate.</P>
        <P>There is much talk of rescued bankers, builders, developers and speculators.  I seek for the agenda in this House to represent those who work with disabilities, drug treatment services and education services.  I put it to all sides of the House that these issues must be priorities in the broader debate also.  I welcome the statements today from SIPTU and IMPACT dealing with the communities sector employers&rsquo; forum and I strongly endorse them.  The community sector employs more than 60,000 people and delivers a wide range of community services and development activities, mostly in areas of disadvantage and such services would otherwise have to be provided by the State.  Significant cuts in funding have been proposed in this sector.  The McCarthy report would have a devastating effect on workers, services and communities.  It is estimated that more than 6,500 jobs in the community sector would be lost if some of these proposals proceed.  I make this point from an investment point of view and I put it to speculators and bankers.  For every euro spent on quality child care the State will save &euro;10 on future services and for every euro spent on drug rehabilitation the State will save &euro;3 on other services.</P><Col N="78" />
        <P>Further, the current crisis of growing unemployment and increased hardship will require the vital contribution of these community development activities and services more than ever before.  I raise this matter in the NAMA debate because it is a very important part of the debate.  I welcome some of the statements from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on windfall taxes &mdash; another issue mentioned which is very important.  If these sensible proposals are put on the table I will keep an open mind in the coming weeks.  I will consider the solutions and make a decision based on those.  However, the bottom line is that any legislation which goes through the House must have the support and the respect of the taxpayer, the weaker sections of society, the people and the mortgage holders of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is the most important Bill to have come before the House on economic matters.  There is no doubt in the minds of anyone in the House or outside that we must resolve the banking crisis because our future economic progress depends on a functioning banking system.  It is clear that at present we do not have a functioning banking system.  Banks are not lending money for the very good reason that they do not have it to lend.  The bottom line in respect of NAMA is to provide a cash injection into the banks such that they can lend to businesses and private citizens alike.  All citizens expect us to resolve the issue and all Deputies agree that the credit crunch is a significant issue.  However, there is disagreement in terms of how we go about resolving the bank credit problem.</P>
        <P>I put on record my abhorrence, as all other Deputies have done, at the reckless behaviour of some of our bankers who almost bankrupted the country.  I wish to see court action come about as soon as possible.  I refer to the four investigations currently being carried out by the fraud squad and we all await eagerly the results because the crazy lending policies carried on for a number of years must never be repeated.  This side of the House states categorically that the bankers who carried out this reckless behaviour have done this country a great disservice and we wish to see the fraud squad bring about their investigations as soon as possible.  Equally, the need for proper and better bank regulation is now more than necessary and I welcome the appointment of Professor Honohan.  He has a very difficult job to do but it is very important and it is a job they must do very quickly.  I offer him my best wishes, as does everyone in the House.</P>
        <P>I back the NAMA proposal as one of sheer necessity.  Inaction by the Government is no longer an option.  We must take action and we must do so now.  We cannot wait as the problems have been compounded by the worldwide problem.  The need for the Government to introduce the legislation to resolve the liquidity problem in banks is vital.  In introducing the proposals the Government has not simply dreamt them up overnight.  It has consulted widely with international advisers and our own best advisers.  All the recognised people involved in economics and finance, including the ECB, the IMF and the ERSI have stated they agree with the NAMA proposals and this point has been missed by the Opposition.  I regret that Fine Gael and the Labour Party seem to oppose this Bill for the sake of opposing it.  The best advice available to them as well as to the Government would inform them there is no other show in town and we must go down this road.  Yesterday, Deputy Joanna Tuffy referred to all the newspapers backing the NAMA proposal.  They back the proposal for one good reason: there is no alternative.  Common sense tells them that doing nothing is not an option.  All the professional advisers at home and abroad clearly state that NAMA is the only way forward.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposal of nationalisation would have major repercussions for the country.  The reputational damage that would be done to us if there were three nationalised banks <Col N="79" />is unthinkable.  The damage such a situation would do to our future funding options and to foreign direct investment in the country is equally unthinkable.  I reckon every Deputy has met representatives of companies that have come to Ireland and employ many Irish people.  One reason they do so is because we are in the eurozone.  Another is because we are a stable country with a stable currency.  It is ridiculous to suggest that we should go down the road of nationalising all our banks, even on a temporary basis.  Furthermore, I am unsure what is meant by &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.  Is it ten years, 15 years or 20 years?  This would put at risk the 200,000 jobs we have in foreign direct investment here.  I have no doubt if we go down the route of nationalisation bank lenders throughout the world would stop funding Ireland.  There is no doubt our credibility as a nation for future borrowing would be at risk.</P>
        <P>We are all aware how much we need to borrow with a budget deficit of some &euro;22 billion this year and borrowing in the region of &euro;60 million per year.  We cannot put at risk the likelihood that lenders, be they foreign or any we have here, would pull the plug on the Government.  Equally, with nationalisation, the cost of borrowing would increase substantially.  When borrowing in the order of &euro;60 million a day, adding extra costs by way of interest payments is hardly an option.</P>
        <P>The overall debt will be approximately &euro;77 billion; it may be a bit less or more.  If nationalisation came about, the banks would have to write off immediate bad debts.  Although I do not know what the figure might be, I suggest it could be a minimum of &euro;10 billion and probably much more.  They would have to do this for good accountancy reasons in the same way any private company would have to write off bad debts.</P>
        <P>This would have immediate implications for us as taxpayers.  The concept of having to pour money in today to prop up nationalisation and writing off those debts does not make sense and I cannot understand how the Labour Party can dream it up.  Quite often it has had ideological reasons for opposing Government proposals and Bills but this does not stack up financially, economically or any other way.</P>
        <P>Privatisation would undoubtedly cause us, as a nation, to struggle even more to get our economic position back to where we want.  If we had three nationalised banks in Ireland, it would undoubtedly lead to branch closures as to have three or at least two different banks trading in every major town, competing against each other, would be ridiculous.  It would do away with competition and there would be branch closures, which would bring about job losses.</P>
        <P>The only European country that has gone down the nationalisation route is Iceland and nobody in this House would suggest that it is a role model for economics anywhere, least of all in the country itself.  It is now endeavouring to join the EU and become part of the eurozone.  Regrettably for Iceland, its interest rate is currently 18% because it is outside the eurozone.  As we are part of the eurozone we are borrowing from the ECB at a rate of 0.5%.  Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s temporary nationalisation arrangement is an absolute folly.</P>
        <P>I will move to the Fine Gael proposals.  In 1983, Fine Gael, in government with Labour, bailed out Allied Irish Banks following the Insurance Corporation of Ireland debacle.  That cost the State over &euro;400 million so Fine Gael should not be afraid of dealing with banking crises.  It experienced such a crisis in 1983 and overnight it introduced emergency legislation so the Insurance Corporation of Ireland would not collapse, and thereby bring down AIB.  Fine Gael should reflect on that.</P>
        <P>With regard to the good bank-bad bank proposal, I do not have difficulty with putting &euro;2 billion into a good bank in order to lend but I have a major difficulty with the suggestion that the &euro;77 billion of debts should remain in the bad part of a bank.  How does Fine Gael think AIB and Bank of Ireland would trade out of those substantial bad debts?  In the current climate, <Col N="80" />I cannot see how it could be done and no financial adviser, international or national, would agree with Fine Gael on that point.</P>
        <P>If those bad debts are left within the banking system, Fine Gael would risk the two banks becoming illiquid and there would be major problems with the balance sheets because of the write-offs.  If anything, the banking system in the past 12 months should indicate that liquid assets are very important to us as a country.</P>
        <P>The retention of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option, although I have heard some Opposition spokespersons suggest this.  We must worry about leaving debts in a bank that clearly does not have the resources to work its way out of the problem.  With regard to the Fine Gael suggestion that it would dump the bad bondholders, how is it possible to choose one bondholder to pay and ignore another and withold payment?  We must think of our international reputation.  Which bank would lend us money in future in that case?  It would not happen.  Everybody knows we cannot renege on our bad debts.  We cannot do it privately as we would get into the black book and we certainly cannot do so internationally.  We must knock that idea on the head.</P>
        <P>The quicker Fine Gael accepts that this is not the way to go, the better.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance offered the party the opportunity to meet the officials in the Department of Finance but for whatever reason this option has not been taken up.  It is not too late to speak to officials and understand the reasons behind NAMA.</P>

	<P>I hope the two Deputies opposite are listening because it is worth noting that in respect of the valuation issue, Moody&rsquo;s has confirmed that the Government&rsquo;s 30% discount is reasonable and accurate.  On the 10% valuation, I do not know if Deputy Breen has had the opportunity to read <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I suspect it is not well read in Clare but I am sure he could borrow a copy from his colleague, Deputy Creighton to read a piece by Bill Nowlan, who has 40 years experience in the property business and who has confirmed that 10% is somewhat conservative.  Mr. Nowlan was speaking in an unbiased manner.</P>
        <P>Our major challenge now is to induce banks to lend.  All Members want them to lend money to businesses small and large, as well as to private citizens.  The Minister should incorporate a clause into the banks&rsquo; contracts to the effect that when they draw down money, 10% of the first tranche must be offered out to businesses and private citizens before they can draw down a second tranche.  A flow of money must be supplied to both the business world and ordinary mortgage business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>He should note <i>The Irish Times</i> and the other broadsheets are widely read in County Clare and the people there are well aware of what is happening.  I listened to Deputy Kennedy&rsquo;s speech over the past 20 minutes and international factors are not the sole reason for the difficulties in which we find ourselves.  Policy failures by the Government involving reckless spending contributed much to the entire banking crisis.  The collapse of Lehman Brothers brought a crisis of tsunami-like proportions to every country.  I read recently that there have been 124 systemic banking crises since the 1970s but the latest occurrence is one of the most severe that Members have witnessed.  A recent analysis of the American banking crisis in <i>The Economist</i>  points out the vital importance played by policy in determining the pace of recovery.  This is the reason it is so important to pursue the right policies as otherwise, future generations of Irish people will be obliged to bear a heavy financial burden.</P>
        <P>As other speakers noted, the majority of people in Ireland are not in favour of NAMA.  A recent MRBI poll published in that famous newspaper, <i>The Irish Times</i>, pointed out that only 26% of people support the NAMA proposal.  The majority of Irish people believe it constitutes a recipe for disaster.  No matter how one tries to dress it up, people are saying it is a bailout for banks and developers.  How can taxpayers have faith that NAMA will work when the administration of the scheme will be conducted by the very people who got us into this mess?  The IMF already has observed that Ireland will pay the highest price of any country to bail out its banks.  The IMF also has stated that although Ireland&rsquo;s financial stabilisation costs will account for 13.9% of its estimated &euro;171 billion in annual gross domestic product, the cost of bailing out banks in the United Kingdom and the United States will be slightly lower at 13.4% and 12.1%, respectively.</P>
        <P>While this debate has raged on in recent months, unfortunately the recession in Ireland has deepened.  The latest ESRI quarterly bulletin predicts the economy will continue to contract well into next year and that a modest rate of growth is only expected to emerge in mid-2010.  Moreover, by the end of 2010, gross national product, GNP, per head is expected to be lower than was the case in 2002.  The recession has taken an enormous toll in every sector of society.  More than 430,000 people were unemployed nationally by the end of August, 10,500 of whom live in my constituency of County Clare.  Moreover, many businesses in County Clare went to the wall during the summer.  Even today, I note the loss of 60 jobs in the manufacturing sector at Beckman Coulter, a company located near O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s Mills, County Clare.  Although the banks are being bailed out, I believe the Government has little to offer to encourage job creation or to assist other sectors within the economy that are under pressure.</P>
        <P>For example, the car industry has experienced great problems in recent months.  There have been several high-profile garage closures, some of which took place in my constituency.  I cannot <Col N="84" />understand the reason the Government has not emulated the actions of the United Kingdom Government by introducing a scrappage plan.  I hope it will do so as part of the budget later this year.  This was done in the United Kingdom and in August, car sales there increased for the second month in a row.  I encourage the Government to consider this proposal.  In addition to many high-profile job losses, many small to medium-sized enterprises have gone to the wall and many others are merely hanging on by a thread.  Every day, people from County Clare ask me whether NAMA will save their businesses and this is the question all Members must ask.  Credit flow is the life blood of any economy and in spite of statements from the banks to the contrary, many small businesses are being squeezed because they are unable to secure credit from their banks.  I refer to the &euro;54 billion being made available by the European Central Bank.  The belief is widespread among Fine Gael members that many commercial banks, which have borrowed money at a rate of 3% and which will now gain access to this money at a rate of 1.5%, will repay their original debts instead of allowing credit flow to customers who badly need it.</P>
        <P>I will cite the example of Parnell Street in Ennis, County Clare, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, also is familiar.  Ten businesses have closed there in the past 12 months with the loss of more than 50 jobs and there are 20 vacant premises on that street now.  The question must be asked whether NAMA will make any difference to the aforementioned traders on Parnell Street or to other traders throughout the county or nationwide.  I concur with Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesperson on finance, Deputy Bruton, and many other economic commentators that NAMA will make no difference to small business people.  Thus far, I believe business people have heard nothing that would restore confidence or give them confidence.  On the other hand, Fine Gael&rsquo;s plan to set up a State wholesale operation to fund recovery and the immediate financing of credit is important because it will take at least six to eight months or more to set up NAMA.  Under Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal, a system would be put in place immediately.  It would be much like an examinership in that were the banks unable to deal with their problems on their own, the State would then in effect nationalise the good elements of the banks but the taxpayer would not carry the burden for the work-out of toxic loans.</P>
        <P>During the summer recess, the reports by an bord snip nua and the Commission on Taxation were published and I hope they will be debated in this House at some stage.  However, according to the T&aacute;naiste this morning, most of the proposals will not be implemented.  Who knows what will happen in this regard?  However, were the reports&rsquo; recommendations to be implemented in full, ordinary people would be obliged to pay a great price for the Government&rsquo;s mismanagement of the economy.  I believe this to be the kernel of the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many young couples who bought homes at inflated prices now are in negative equity.  I recently met a couple who bought a home four years ago when both were employed in Dell, one as an engineer.  Both lost their jobs subsequently and now are on the brink of losing their home.  The couple have pointed out to me that they are treated in a completely different fashion by the banks than are developers.  One cannot blame people for being angry.  It was suggested a few minutes ago that Fine Gael should get real.  Its members are in the real world but the Government is not.  Although the banks failed to establish a true picture regarding many developers when lending funds to them or sanctioning loans, even though major sums were involved, they put young couples under severe scrutiny.  There is one law for young couples setting out to buy their first home and another for developers.</P>
        <P>There is also significant demand for social housing.  There are some 1,978 people on the housing waiting list of Clare County Council.  In the period 2002-06, the council&rsquo;s rental stock increased from 990 to 1306, an increase of 316 houses.  One can see the extent of the problem <Col N="85" />facing the council.  There is no way it can keep up with the demand for housing, even though a fund of &euro;20 million was announced for a new social housing scheme to provide social housing through long-term leasing of unsold, vacant houses in the private market.  Only 2,000 units are available nationally and this will not be enough.  I would like to make several other points but I do not have time.</P>
        <P>Will credit begin to flow?  That is the most important question.  How much will the taxpayer have to pay and what substantial bills must the taxpayer pay?  Will developers be able to buy back property or land and what is the cost of NAMA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this extremely important legislation.  In respect of the gravity of the legislation and its potential implications, it is unprecedented.  Having listened to the remarks of some Government Deputies, I must compliment Fianna F&aacute;il on its innovative and creative rewriting of history without batting an eyelid.  If we were to sit here and listen to some of the contributions, we would believe that Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are white knights riding into town to sort out a crisis that has nothing to do with them.  Unfortunately, that is not the case and we need some reality in this debate.  We need acknowledgement and humility from the Government benches that theirs is the responsibility for the mess this country is in.  The buck needs to stop with those who are responsible for the flawed and failed policies that brought us to this position.  It is an inescapable fact that a property bubble fuelled by Government policies led to the degree of implosion we see in the Irish economy.  I acknowledge international factors and the international recession but there is no doubt that decision making was fundamentally flawed over the past 12 years.  This caused the level and degree of collapse in this country.  We must recognise the unhealthy relationship between certain developers, certain vested interests and certain Ministers.  They were intoxicated by a champagne fuelled relationship in the Galway tent and elsewhere, leading to flawed and dangerous decision making and policy setting at Government level.</P>
        <P>The Opposition benches can agree that we urgently need a solution to the banking crisis.  I will not disagree with any Government Member who says that the Irish economy is inextricably linked to the Irish banking system.  Whether we like or not, we must find a solution to the banking crisis.  We need a plan to restore confidence and to restore international investment in this country.  We have no alternative.  I will not subscribe to some of the catchcries I have heard from the Government benches and the Independent Deputies shouting from the rooftops about bailouts.</P>
        <P>We must also examine the context in which this crisis arose.  We must examine the irresponsible lending of the banks and the loan book of the Irish banks that will be addressed by the proposed legislation.  Some &euro;68 billion was the total sum loaned by the Irish banks involved, 66% of this in Ireland and the remainder in Northern Ireland, the UK and the USA.  Discussions that focus on the conditions in Ireland are relevant only to two thirds of the total loan value, approximately &euro;51 billion.  Anglo Irish Bank, which is now in State ownership, accounts for 30% of the total lending, while AIB and Bank of Ireland account for a further 60%.  This level of lending was reckless and irresponsible.  From the Government&rsquo;s response over the past 12 months, it appears that this behaviour is without consequence or reproach.  That is the crux of why Irish taxpayers and honest to goodness Irish people are so angry.  They do not see any culpability for behaviour in these banks.  This is not good enough.  NAMA provides a safety net for reckless, irresponsible behaviour on the part of these banks, speculators and for certain politicians who facilitated this and turned a blind eye.  In some cases they formulated policies to support these practices.</P>
        <P>We are not here to discuss Fine Gael proposals, we are dealing with the legislation at hand.  I accept that Fine Gael must now deal with the legislation.  I am not afraid to don a green <Col N="86" />jersey in order to find the best solution for Irish taxpayers.  I hope the Minister for Finance, for all his rhetoric, bluff and guff, will be man enough to don the green jersey and accept amendments from this side of the House on Committee Stage.  That opportunity will be presented to him.</P>
        <P>NAMA represents the most significant risk ever taken in legislation in the history of the State.  The most important aspect is the extent to which the taxpayer will be exposed, particularly in respect of the non-Anglo Irish Bank debt because that bank is State-owned.  We cannot know the extent of taxpayer exposure but we can work to minimise it.  That we do not have clarity is a serious indictment of the Government.  The Government should remember that its responsibility is not to bankers who believe they can act with impunity, nor is it to developers who overextended themselves, irrespective of how friendly they are with particular Ministers.  The only responsibility of the Government is a duty of care to the Irish taxpayer who did not take any risks, did not act in a reckless manner and did not put the welfare and future of fellow citizens in peril, as many bankers and developers did.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a 95% level of exposure to taxpayers has been aired in the media in recent weeks.  This is not good enough, representing a 5% risk for bondholders who took a deliberate risk and put their heads above the parapet.  It cannot be conceived of by any right thinking person as just or fair.  It is simply not right and the Government must address this by amending legislation to reflect the risk people took and to reflect the fact that ordinary taxpayers did not voluntarily take any risk and did not stand to gain had the risk worked out.  Taxpayers would not have benefited from it whereas the speculators and the bondholders would.  That is an important point that is not reflected in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The 30% discount on loan value is equally disappointing.  We are still waiting for explanations from the Minister on this.  The rising costs are not factored into the legislation or into any of the explanations offered by the Minister.  Deputy Bruton has pointed out that this is a potential black hole in the financial estimates of &euro;10 billion.  We have no evidence of supporting documentation.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out last week, no risk analysis has been carried out.</P>
        <P>I would like to discuss many other aspects of this but I do not have time.  Whatever scheme forms the basis of a solution to the banking crisis &mdash; and we need a solution to the banking crisis &mdash; it must ensure that the banks start lending again and that must be the key objective.  It must protect the taxpayers and ensure that liquidity is restored to the banks.  I have serious concerns about bailing out an institution such as Anglo Irish Bank which quite clearly will never lend again.  It is inexcusable.</P>

	<P>Some critics of the National Asset Management Agency Bill argue as though the legislation has all of the risks and that no risk whatever attaches to the option of doing nothing.  A positive development in the debate in the House over the past week has been a much clearer focus on the need to take action and on the risk of doing nothing.  However much political parties might disagree &mdash; Fine Gael has put forward its own proposals and the Labour Party has it own ideas on how matters should be addressed &mdash; one consensus is emerging, which is that the risk of doing nothing is the worst of all worlds.  It is possible that if nothing were done the banks would limp along unable to support any commercial activity, which unfortunately to a huge extent is the case at present, or ultimately and perhaps very likely in the case of one institution, collapse entirely.</P>
       <P>One of the improvements in the debate that must be acknowledged is that people have come to realise that the State cannot function properly without a properly functioning banking sector. <Col N="87" /> Even at the level of the ordinary citizen who is not centrally involved in any type of commercial activity, people have come to realise that if matters were to continue as they are it would not be too long until each of us would run the risk of having a plastic card that would not perform when one went to an ATM.  That is putting it at a low level in terms of the ordinary consumer.  In terms of commercial activity, the difficulties which have beset the banking sector here and internationally have made it extraordinarily difficult for businesses, which have no connection to any property transactions or bank shares, to function in any sensible or workable manner.</P>
         <P>This country is small with a free open market economy and it is not always acknowledged that this approach has brought enormous benefits to the country.  In a very short period we went from having approximately 1.1 million people employed to having 2.1 million people employed.  This is very close to a doubling of the number of people employed.  While this has dropped to approximately 1.9 million people, it is still a huge advance on our initial position.  In the midst of all the doom and gloom and very real difficulties which beset the economy and individual families where jobs have been lost and young people have gone through college or apprenticeships and are not in a position to get employment, we forget that as a nation we have a great capacity to manufacture goods and provide services to an extraordinarily high standard.  There are a number of reasons for this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was making the point that is infrequently made in the context of the difficulties internationally and the difficulties we face in this country, namely, that Irish people have a particular capacity to provide goods and services to an extraordinarily high standard.  It is important to remember we export approximately 90% of most of the goods and services manufactured in or provided by this country.  In the case of some agricultural goods, the percentage is in excess of 90%.  In light of the kind of challenges we face in the banking sector and other sectors of the economy, it is good to remember we have that capacity.</P>
        <P>We have an extraordinary record of success in regard to foreign direct investment and international capital flows are clearly very important to that.  There is no doubt NAMA or some such device was necessary to ensure international capital flows could continue and that foreign direct investment, already in the country and accounting for almost 100,000 direct and mostly highly skilled and highly paid jobs, can continue and to ensure we have the capacity to attract further opportunities of that nature.  In terms of job creation and economic stability, the banking sector, regardless of what one might think about the behaviour of some people in it, plays a central role.  The point I made initially was that more people have come to realise that is the case.</P>
        <P>Many speakers rightly referred to the fact that many of our citizens are very angry.  People have a right to be angry.  Some of the things that happened were entirely unacceptable.  A question people ask each one of us &mdash; they certainly ask me &mdash; is: &ldquo;How come the regulatory system was not up to the job?&rdquo;  There are a couple of points to remember in that regard.  It is very clear the regulatory system here performed pretty much on a par with those throughout the world and that regulatory systems were not able to deal with the challenge they faced.</P>
        <P>One of the outcomes of this particular chastening lesson for all of us must be that we put in place a system of regulation which is capable of doing that job.  That is one of the things about which citizens are angry.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="88" />
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens if they do not want to regulate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Deputy for trying to help me with an extraneous matter.</P>
        <P>Another question people frequently ask is how it is possible to invest money in the banks at a time when investment must be cut in many other areas, including services and so on.  Gradually, as the debate has advanced, people have come to realise that while all elements of an economy are interconnected, the provisions being made in the NAMA legislation, specifically to rescue the banking sector and to ensure we have a working banking system, are being done through a system which operates independently of the national finances.  The figures put forward by the Minister for Finance last week show very clearly that NAMA is so designed not to be a burden in that regard.  The question of dealing with services and the national finances is a somewhat separate one and is also very difficult to address.</P>
        <P>It is frequently believed, and not adverted to, that bondholders, for example, suffered no losses in the banking crisis in Ireland up to now.  The reality, which may have been pointed out by the Minister, is that they have lost in excess of &euro;4 billion in very recent times.  They put their money in and there was some risk.  Ultimately, if the Irish banking sector was seen as a complete basket case which could not be depended on, it would be impossible for the banks to attract any kind of finances and bondholders and others who normally lend to the banks would not be prepared to do so.  That is why it is very important at this point that the banking sector is put back on a strong footing.</P>
        <P>Bank shareholders, many of whom purchased their shares for &euro;20 or, in some cases, the high twenties, found them dropping in value to less than &euro;1.  Shares in the two main banks are now worth approximately &euro;2.  It is tempting to say shareholders had much spare cash lying around, that they were taking a punt and that was the risk they took.  Anybody who saw the coverage of the annual general meetings of the main banks cannot but have noticed that the vast majority of shareholders attending were elderly people who had worked hard all their lives and who had put a certain amount of money into bank shares in the belief that their pensions or, in some instances, a top-up for their pensions would come from that source.  The distress caused to those people was certainly very evident.</P>
        <P>Some of the bondholders investing in banks in Ireland are pension funds, including non-Irish pensions, although many are Irish pension funds.  That has had the same impact on elderly people.  Therefore, some of what has been represented in regard to the losers in the banking sector is entirely inaccurate and quite unhelpful in terms of trying to address the situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important the banking sector be able to operate in such a manner that it is capable of lending to business and of generating jobs and activity in the market.  There are some signs of green shoots in the US economy and there are certainly modest signs of recovery in at least two European economies.  There are pretty encouraging signs in regard to Irish export figures.  What we tend to forget in regard to export figures is that regardless of how high a standard to which one may produce one&rsquo;s goods and services, one needs a market into which to sell them and it must be able to pay for them.  When economic depression and difficulties are being experienced pretty much worldwide, it is very difficult to do that and competitiveness and other issues come into play.  However, there are some positive indicators.  A functioning banking sector is vital to ensure we can build on the fairly encouraging export figures.</P>
        <P>It is important to consider the fact the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank support the NAMA plan because if they did not, this legislation could not be considered since most of the borrowing required to sustain the banks over the next ten years or so will come from the European Central Bank.  In the run up to the referendum on the <Col N="89" />Lisbon treaty on 2 October, it is important to remember the ECB is supporting Ireland in its time of need.  There is no doubt that the European Union has been good for Ireland in terms of access to markets and so on.  In a time of difficulty in the economy, it must be acknowledged that the ECB is playing a very central role.</P>
        <P>One of the interesting developments of recent months, even in advance of this legislation, was the response of the market to the willingness of the Government to address the difficulties and the drop of 1.5% in the cost of ten year State borrowing, which is very significant in terms of the kind of challenges we face.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the drop in receipts from taxation from approximately &euro;60 billion per annum to approximately &euro;33 billion or &euro;34 billion will have to be bridged, to a very large extent, by additional borrowing.  It is important we can access that borrowing and get it at the best rate possible.</P>
        <P>We need to reflect on the fact that cheap credit and inadequate regulation were global factors, as was very clearly shown by the collapses of Lehman Brothers.  Some people ask: &ldquo;Why not let several Irish banks collapse?&rdquo;  The collapse of a bank in the US has quite different implications from the collapse of a bank in a small open economy which must do up to 90% of its business abroad.  The kind of message that would send would be devastating for the Irish economy &mdash; even if a bank like Anglo Irish Bank had collapsed.  Many of us deep in our hearts would have liked to have seen that outcome but we knew it was not feasible and that interventions had to be made to ensure it did not.</P>
        <P>The income stream to banks dried up and they were no longer able to lend or function.  That has been a common occurrence pretty much across the western world.  Simultaneously, property values inevitably collapsed.  Even if there were willing purchasers, which there were in some instances, they were unable to access finance.</P>
        <P>I referred to competitiveness.  A substantial element of competitiveness is the capacity to access bank lending and the cost at which it is available.  This element of doing business is very important and can only operate when there is a functioning banking system.</P>
        <P>One element of the Government bank guarantee scheme introduced in September 2008 that was overlooked by many including the media was the charge in excess of &euro;1 billion on the banks for the guarantee.  At the time the one question all Members would have encountered from constituents was whether their savings were secure.  Even though it was only a year ago, that question was exercising the minds of a great many ordinary people.  The bank guarantee got over that difficulty.  At the time the guarantee was seen as a drastic and unusual step because it has not been introduced in other European countries.  Other governments subsequently introduced similar schemes resulting in the dissipation of the inflow of funds into Irish banks which had occurred immediately after the guarantee was introduced.  This is also another reason more long-term action, such as this legislation, needs to be taken.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that several variations of the NAMA model have worked successfully elsewhere.  Variations arose because the problems to be addressed were somewhat different.  In the case of Credit Lyonnais, there was a large insurance element hanging over its problems.  In Sweden&rsquo;s case, slightly different challenges had to be faced.  The basic model, however, worked successfully in all the cases.  NAMA is much more than an issue of bank guarantees.  It is an asset management agency which involves capitalisation and property portfolio management.</P>
        <P>Taxation policy is often blamed for the emergence of the property bubble.  The impact of taxation policy on development was modest compared with the availability of cheap credit, high wages and high rates of employment.  It must be remembered that other countries had <Col N="90" />property bubbles too with similar factors involved.  If any government intervened in the property market place or tried to reduce wages, it would have seen a considerable and immediate drop in employment in the construction industry.  While I accept it occurred eventually, if it had happened earlier in Ireland it would have cost the country a huge amount, particularly when one considers 280,000 people were directly employed in construction.</P>
        <P>Another question which has caused some difficulty and debate is how much should be paid for the assets in question.  We have all been forced to become experts in this in a short time.  Several weeks ago I saw a report from an international economist who claimed it would be better to do nothing rather than pay too little.  He argued the effect of paying the notional amount at which banks are valued would in the first instance cripple the banks, leaving them unable to lend to business.  Such a move would also mean the recapitalisation of the banks would become an immediate charge on the taxpayer.  Such a charge could not be found from the sources from which NAMA could provide and would be a direct debit on the State at a time when it is an enormous challenge to meet the costs of public service provision.</P>
        <P>We tend to forget the Bill contains a provision for a levy on the banks if NAMA happens to be in deficit at the end of its term .  This is an important provision and I expect it to be enabled in the legislation.  It will be the call of the Government of the day as to how it may happen.  Confidence in the legislation is increased if there is a fund from which any losses might be recovered.</P>
        <P>All that is required in the next ten years is an increase of approximately 10% in the current level of property values.  Considering increases in the past ten years have been in excess of 250%, this is a not a large asking.  It is not even a requirement that property values return to the levels they were at in 2006.  If they come to within 45% of 2006 values, they will reach a sufficiently high level to enable NAMA to clear its debts.  There is a reasonable expectation that property prices will do much better than that.</P>
        <P>After the legislation is enacted, we need to follow up quickly to ensure the banks function properly and credit is made available for business.  We must also ensure the regulatory shortcomings discovered are addressed for the future.</P>

	<P>The establishment of NAMA will affect everyone.  If any Member on this side of the House believed it was the right approach, they would back the Government immediately.  However, it is not.</P>
        <P>I joined the workforce, aged 15 years, when we joined the EEC and since then have watched the country slowly progress.  We have stopped going to other countries to build their infrastructure and now build our own.  It is fantastic to see how our cities, towns, roads, education and quality of life have progressed.</P>
        <P>However, two years ago we knew that such accelerated growth rates as we had recently experienced could not be sustained.  Wages and prices were out of control and a crash became inevitable.  What annoys me more than anything is that we allowed ourselves get stuck in a property pyramid selling scheme.  Ludicrous prices were paid for property.  It was not good enough to buy land and build property on it.  It had to be sold on again shortly after it was bought for a profit.  Eventually houses were built on it.  In County Meath I recall land being sold for &euro;11 million which was then dickied up with a bit of planning permission.  Six months later it was sold again for &euro;17 million.</P><Col N="91" />
        <P>I do not mind supporting businesses.  Ireland has some of the best builders but there are cowboys too who will get away with it through the NAMA legislation.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s alternative to NAMA is a good plan.  I have been lobbied more than any other Deputy by people in the building industry to support NAMA.  It is very easy to support 1% of the community but what about the other 99%?</P>
        <P>All Members are receiving the same complaints about the banks.  I heard the case today of a farmer who employs seven people being told recently by his bank&rsquo;s agricultural adviser to plant his brussels sprouts crop for the Christmas market.  When he had it done at a cost of &euro;900,000, the bank informed him it could not provide him with a credit facility.  The day before a constituent from Kells rang me about his situation.  He and his wife were earning &euro;2,500 a week but when they lost both jobs their income went down to &euro;480 while they still had to pay a mortgage of &euro;3,500 a month.  The bank brought them to court and sent the sheriff to collect &euro;6,500 worth of property from the house.  The only things he had were his beds and two ponies for the kids.  That is not the Ireland we were brought up to believe in.  That is where the injustice and immorality is.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is from my area, call it as it is.  Not alone are we taking on the loans, we are taking on the property.  We legislators are buying this property on behalf of the people.  How can anyone justify paying the price the Government is paying for this land and land abroad? The cowboys bucked everyone who took out a mortgage.  It was not good enough to do it to their own people but they had to go to Poland, Bulgaria and America and do the same.  We are left with their mess.  The bankers who gave them the money &mdash; not my local bank manager but those at the top &mdash; creamed it, because for every &euro;1,000 they loaned they received a bonus.  They sold money to others within the banks to buy their own shares to keep the prices up.</P>
        <P>The people will not let us get away with this.  Nobody is doing anything for those who have mortgages for &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000.  One by one small businesses in Duleek, Navan and Drogheda are closing.  They cannot pay rates, VAT or PRSI.  That is what I find disgusting.  We sat back and allowed pyramid selling.  While I appreciate that people do not want to spend money on inquiries there should be a full inquiry.  A plot of land in County Meath was sold one day for &euro;11 million and six months later made &euro;17 million.  Other lands were sold three and four times before a builder put a house on them.  I could not believe it when I heard of one bank, I think it was Irish Nationwide, giving money to a man to buy land in a deal under which it was to get back some of the profit on the land but then gave the money to an unfortunate young married couple who are now stuck with the mortgage.</P>
        <P>There is a theory in this House that Fianna F&aacute;il is backed by builders but Fine Gael is against them.  We are not.  Ninety per cent of builders are great but the cowboy builders and bankers are getting away with this.  That is why I am totally opposed to NAMA. It will not work.  As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, says, we have had 74 years of zoned land.  How can one value land that has been zoned for 74 years in Dundalk?  It is not worth &euro;5,000 an acre.  Thirty per cent of the buildings in the country are lying idle.  This is what we are taking on.  NAMA cannot work because there is far too much money involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was disgusted when we on this side of the House were told that we offered no options.  When Deputy Bruton made his speech last week in which he explained what he wanted done, with a mix of ideas, everybody on the Government side walked out, as if they were programmed to believe that there is only one way, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s way, and no other.  There are other ways.  Everyone has good ideas. The Minister&rsquo;s way will not work because we <Col N="92" />have overstepped the mark in the amount we paid for property.  My children and grandchildren will pay for it.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to have people involved in a business such that land that should have been sold for building was sold three times on at massive profits.  These people were not even builders.  We stood by and let it happen.  We knew it was happening.  Every Deputy in the House hears the same complaints.  If the Green Party backs NAMA it will be extinct, like the dodo.  It cannot back NAMA.  Anyone who lives in the real world knows what has happened.  It was savage, cruel and wrong.  I respect our ex-Taoiseach as a person but his statement in Donegal that people should go and hang themselves was wrong.</P>
        <P>The warning was there.  It took a long time to get this country to where it is today.  Ninety-five per cent of our builders are good builders but the other 5% whom we are backing are cowboys.  It was grand to buck the Irish.  Then they left the country to try to buck the poor Poles and the Latvians and start the game again.  Now we have to buy property in these countries for which we have no regard and we do not even know what will happen.</P>
        <P>If the Green Party wants to be like the dodo it will vote for NAMA.  All the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are hearing the same complaints as me, from small businesses and farmers.  Last week I went to the bank to try to get a loan with my daughter.  The banks will lend only to students now, anyone can check the records.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is right.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This is probably the most important debate we will ever have in this House.  My sense that I am participating, however unwillingly, in the greatest gamble in the history of the State is mind-blowing.  We have all heard of the great confidence trickster immortalised in song as &ldquo;the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo&rdquo;.  We are now seeing the man who broke the Irish economy attempting to hedge his bets in a similar fashion with no guarantee of success or even luck.</P>
        <P>Gambling with other people&rsquo;s money is shocking in any context.  Gambling with the money of 4.3 million people, many of whom exist below or just above the poverty line, is horrifying.  These people would be unwilling participants in what could be the financial disaster to end all disasters if NAMA goes ahead in its present form.  Unless some Government Members come to their senses it will go ahead by sheer weight of numbers and a few will be protected at the expense of many.  I am disappointed that there are no Green Deputies in the Chamber this evening to listen to what people on this side of the House have to say.  They will walk in blindfolded to vote with the Government on this issue and the people will walk them out of office at the next general election.</P>
        <P>While I do not wish to use unparliamentary language, a cartoon in a recent issue of a well-known magazine depicting the Minister for Finance saying &ldquo;Screw the public and save AIB&rdquo; sums up the public&rsquo;s opinion of NAMA which leaves many people feeling disenfranchised and helpless.  Three quarters of the Irish people either reject NAMA or doubt that it can solve our financial difficulties.  For many there is the real fear that their lives will be financially ruined by one tax and levy after another, not to get the country back on its feet but to bolster the position of banks, property speculators and the grasping beast that devoured the wealth of the Celtic tiger.  They fear that those who attacked the foundations of this State for their own gain will be bailed out once again to the detriment of hardworking taxpayers.  They fear a repeat of the cronyism that was and still is rife in Fianna F&aacute;il, and that brought the country to its knees.  This was the cronyism born in the Galway tent where the power and confidence of those same developers and speculators led them to claim they had more influence on Irish politics than <Col N="93" />Ministers have.  Alarm bells are ringing throughout the length and breadth of this country and trust in the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government has declined greatly.</P>
        <P>The frightening signs of the double whammy that is about to be unleashed on the Irish taxpayer represent not only a betrayal of trust but a confidence trick by the Government that exceeds all others.  While taxpayers worry about paying for the crippling debt NAMA will impose on them, the very banks they will assist are, with Government collusion, lining up to stab them in the back by way of higher costs and interest rate hikes in the offing.  This is already happening.  Yesterday one heard reports that interest rates will rise again.  There is no end to the Government&rsquo;s duplicity on this.</P>
        <P>How many Deputies sitting on the Government benches can look their constituents in the eye and assure them that NAMA will be a fair and open solution to the financial mess their Government got them into?  How many can explain why some of the best economic brains have come out against it?  How many will vote for the good of their constituents and their country rather than shore up the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green parties?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must consider how this will bear on our population.  Will the bankers and speculators plough money into repayments to make good their debt to our society?  I think not.  It is an historical fact that Fianna F&aacute;il Governments attempt to make good their losses on the backs of the poor of this country.  This occurs, while those responsible for massive financial meltdown escape to prosper again after a short period.  The poor get poorer and the balance of power remains with the wealthy, the grasping and the corrupt.  I wonder just how many Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies will benefit from NAMA because I know many of their card-carrying members up and down the country will so benefit.  This is scandalous and disgraceful.</P>
        <P>It is shocking to note that figures for 2007, the most recent statistics available for salary scales in this country, show that in that year 33% of employees earned less than &euro;25,000, namely, just under 500,000 workers.  Given the impact of Government mismanagement of our resources, we know that figure has risen dramatically in the two years since these figures were compiled.  The Minister should balance that statistic with the demands now being made on lower earners whose wages are just over the poverty line.  Those earning as little as &euro;15,000 are being asked to give up what they cannot afford to bail out the banks and the dodgy developers, although &ldquo;asked&rdquo; is the wrong word &mdash; &ldquo;forced&rdquo; is more apt.</P>
        <P>This legislation has as many holes in it as a small child&rsquo;s knitting.  It is full of dropped stitches, and is of grubby appearance and sticky texture.  Like the small child who asks us to believe that all will turn out all right in the end, the Government assures us it can be trusted on this and will produce the goods for us.  That trust is noticeably absent across the country.  When over three quarters of the population have no faith in NAMA, where does that leave a Government that still insists on pushing the legislation through by sheer force of numbers?  That is if those numbers are there at the final hurdle.  If the Green Party has any guts it will walk away.</P>
        <P>Speaking of numbers, this legislation is not the product of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet working in conjunction with the best economic brains in the country.  It results, rather, from the extraordinary decision of the Government to rely solely on the judgment of one man.  This is the man who is calculated to send shivers down the spines of every man, woman and child in my own county of Longford.  When he was asked to produce a strategy report on the economic development of the county, Dr. Peter Bacon earnestly assured us that one of the major problems for County Longford was that it was under threat from serious coastal erosion.</P>

	<P>I listened with great interest to the debate on NAMA in recent days.  If there is one continuous theme, on both sides of the House, it is that doing nothing is not an option.  People may cast their minds back &mdash; although we have had much selective memory in recent months &mdash; to as early as last December when the Taoiseach produced a document entitled &ldquo;The Smart Economy&rdquo;, a plan for sustainable recovery.  It contained a great deal of detail about how we must use the assets into which we have invested considerably over recent years.  Those assets are our people.  By investing in the areas where we have experience and expertise we can ensure that we continue to compete and will come out of the current situation.  </P>
        <P>The introduction of NAMA will make a great difference to how people do their business in banking, development and other businesses in this country.  The blame game that is being played by the Opposition and other commentators outside will not solve anything and will not save a single job.</P>

	<P>As a small open economy, we are open to international changes, especially in the globalised environment in which we now find ourselves.  We must ensure we are flexible and tough.  Although this crisis is having a difficult effect on jobs, on business and on the budgetary system, one good thing may come of it.  Even when we suffer because of issues outside our control, because we have invested in education and training in recent years, we will cope and will emerge a stronger and more resilient economy.  Over the past ten to 15 years we invested significantly in training, education, and as the Deputy pointed out, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, played a considerable role in improving our education system in this country.</P>

	<P>The details of NAMA have been discussed thoroughly in this debate.  In my few minutes, I wish to concentrate on how the proposal will affect the everyday life of ordinary people.  As Members on both sides of the House will be aware, parents and schools encourage young people to open savings accounts from a very early age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We could do a whip-round.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In post offices, credit unions, building societies and banks throughout the country, young people put in their few bob every week or month to have access to funds when they need it.  The vast majority continue that practice into their adult years and on into their senior years.  I refer to parents supporting their children by helping them with obtaining a mortgage.  As a result of what has happened, any confidence people had in financial institutions has been damaged, whether those are institutions at home or abroad.  As the incumbent Government, our job is to restore that confidence.  That is the reason NAMA is being proposed. <Col N="96" /> It is not for builders, developers and bankers; it is for the ordinary people of this country.  There are hundreds and thousands of accounts, mortgages, standing orders etc. in banks and building societies around the country where every day ordinary people do their business.  This is what NAMA is protecting.  We are protecting the small, medium and large businesses, shops, factories and offices that depend every week on banks and building societies to do their business, to provide jobs and to provide incomes for people.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance explained the legislation to the House in great detail.  Given the figures announced by the Minister, the key to NAMA is that if property prices increase by just 10% over the next ten years, NAMA will break even.  We will be able to go back to the country in the knowledge that we have produced a system and a programme which has ensured that the taxpayers of this country have not lost any of their resources.  The Minister pointed out that we are now at the bottom of a cycle.  The property market in every country in the world has a cycle of troughs and peaks and this must be accepted.  In my view, we will make a profit from NAMA.  There has already been a sharp increase in the banks&rsquo; share prices since they were recapitalised last year.  Those shares will yield a significant profit for the taxpayer when they are sold.</P>
        <P>I have been out canvassing for the Lisbon treaty referendum over the past couple of weeks.  It is understandable that people are angry and disappointed.  They believe they have been let down by institutions such as banks and building societies.  There has been a breakdown in trust.  Those who have done wrong need to be brought to account but we also need the banks and a financial system in order for the country to function properly.</P>
        <P>I commend the bold move in introducing the State guarantee for deposits.  This measure was opposed by some Members of the House.  This move was made decisively and quickly and it brought us back from the brink of a very serious situation.  Other European countries and other countries around the world have followed suit with their own state guarantees.  The NAMA plan, which has been endorsed by the ECB will, despite what the commentators say, bring liquidity back into the system and will ensure that those people who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance has stated in his contribution that economic recovery is dependent on three factors.  The first is to get the public finances back in order and some progress has been made in this regard.  The second factor is the restoration of our competitiveness and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has introduced a number of different schemes which are aimed solely at increasing our international competitiveness.  The final ingredient is a healthy financial system.  The steps being taken in NAMA are critical to ensure that we continue to function as a country.  There will be tough but necessary decisions.  The Government is trying to repair the damage done to our financial system and to the country&rsquo;s reputation and NAMA will help in this process.  </P>
        <P>NAMA is not about developers or bankers, rather it is about the Irish people and ensuring that those people are guaranteed that their savings, mortgages and standing orders are protected and to provide that Ireland continues to function as a progressive and modern country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  I will speak quickly in case the bells go again.  I note that my colleague from Longford mentioned his county a few times in his contribution so if I mention Tallaght and Dublin South-West the odd time I am sure I will be forgiven.</P>

	<P>I have to say where I am from.</P>
        <P>My seven year old granddaughter, Heather, asked me this morning very seriously: &ldquo;What is NAMA about?&rdquo;  I told her to ask her mother.  Many views have been expressed on all sides of this House during this debate about what NAMA is, what it means and what will be its consequences.  Deputy Cyprian Brady and others have made the valid point that the biggest risk of all would be for the Government to do nothing and for the economy to stagnate even further.</P>
        <P>I notice tonight that the news bulletins are not talking about NAMA because the McCarthy report has suddenly become the news item of the day.  I am sure that in the context of this discussion it is all right for me to refer to this because people are talking about McCarthy and the cuts it recommends.  It is relevant to this debate and everyone, including myself, has a view about what the Government should do.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report was given to the Government and we all have an opportunity to make our views on it known.  The Government is considering all its recommendations.  At every political level, the McCarthy report should be treated with respect.  I have very strong views about what should be touched and what should not.  I am glad the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, is in the House.  I wish her well.  She knows that Fianna F&aacute;il must continue in government to do what it has always done, that is to look after the vulnerable, the elderly and the carers.  Not every Government can say it does that.  The Minister is entitled to all our support, as she rises to that challenge and does her best in that regard.  She will know that people, throughout the country and certainly in Tallaght, are concerned about the situation.</P>
        <P>I am old enough to remember other recessions and what they were like.  Like others I had to emigrate, as did my father and my grandfathers.  I am glad I survived and came back although not everyone in my constituency is happy that I did so.  I have often said &mdash; and I was not looking at George Lee&rsquo;s picture when I did so &mdash; that I emigrated simply because I could not find a job.  I was not aware of the difficult financial situation the Government faced at that time.  Nowadays, through television and other media, we get information almost before the Government releases it.  Maybe that is not a bad thing.  Nevertheless, it adds to people&rsquo;s frustration and concerns.  It certainly adds to their anger.</P>
        <P>I have been out and about in Tallaght talking to people and convincing them, I hope, that the Lisbon treaty is important.  People are sharing with me the same concerns that are being expressed in Galway, Wexford, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Drumcondra  and all over the country.  The issues are the same.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With all the talk about pain and adjustments, it is important to remember the word &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;.  In my constituency, for example, jobless figures have risen by 87% in the past year.  That is a serious challenge for the third largest population centre in the country.  The anger and frustration which has been expressed to colleagues has also been expressed to me.  People are worried about their mortgages.  People have different views about what NAMA will achieve.  The ordinary people are saying they want reassurance from Government that if they get into trouble with their mortgage there will be a light at the end of the tunnel and some kind of <Col N="98" />help.  The standard profile of a social welfare recipient has changed in this recession.  There are people in my community and every other community having to go to their local social welfare office or community welfare officer who never had to do so before.  It is essential that Government show signs of recovery, as far as that issue is concerned, and assures our citizens, whatever their political persuasion, that there is a way forward, that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that every effort will be made to continue to invest and create jobs and confidence.  People have a list of things which they want done but the words &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; and  &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; are high on that list.</P>
        <P>I will listen very carefully to what colleagues are saying.  I will not engage in politics and upset colleagues across the floor, particularly those who are normally amenable to my points of view.  However, some of the remarks made are not in the national interest.  I do not expect everyone to support the Government but surely views can be expressed reasonably.  At a time of recession when there is a need for national recovery, we should all come together in some way and use the good ideas which are coming forward.  Some of the speeches have been unnecessarily over the top politically in a time of national crisis.  I hope that good ideas, whether from Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers or Opposition speakers, will be incorporated in the legislation.  Colleagues have made the point that the debate on Committee Stage will be very important.  The Minister for Finance understands that this is a time of national challenge and that good ideas are coming from both sides of the House.  There are also some crazy ideas but let us concentrate on the good.</P>
        <P>People are deeply concerned about NAMA.  The Taoiseach has said the next 100 days will be critical for the future of the country.  We all hear about the importance of the Lisbon treaty, NAMA, the budget and the negotiation of the Government programme.  The public are confusing those issues.  Maybe we need to calmly take one issue at a time.  There is still a need to get a positive message across about the National Asset Management Agency Bill.  There is still a job to be done in that regard.  There is considerable confusion and this leads to anger.  It is important that this debate send out a positive message that something is being done, that someone is in charge and that there is a way forward.</P>
        <P>I do not need to defend our partners in the Government but I notice they are getting much criticism, some of it snide, from the Opposition benches.  I wonder what that achieves.  The Government is trying to do a job and we all have a responsibility to represent the concerns being expressed to us.  People are saying the same things to me as to Deputies Pat Rabbitte, Brian Hayes or Conor Lenihan.</P>
        <P>I had to go to Tallaght last night and was not present when my colleague and good friend, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, raised the issue of the jobs initiative programme.  We both attended a recent meeting on this issue in Tallaght.  People are very concerned about the threat to the jobs initiative programme.  I see no point in taking people off the programme, putting them on the dole with nothing to do and depriving communities of good works.  I support what Deputy Rabbitte said in that regard.</P>

    <Title>Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to support the remarks made last evening by my colleague, Deputy Higgins, and the modest reforms contained in this Fine Gael Bill.  It is important that we introduce more transparency and accountability into public appointments and into how such public bodies are required to account for the discharge of their functions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When asked to deputise for my colleague, Deputy Penrose, who is at the ploughing championship, it occurred to me that it might not be a bad thing if we started with the Parliament.  It is a matter of regret that the package of reforms submitted by the Oireachtas commission to the Minister for Finance for approval earlier this year has not been implemented in full.  This morning, this matter was addressed by the Chief Whip, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Pat Carey, who made it plain that the Government has no intention of cutting back on the number of Oireachtas committees.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall, the commission proposed that the number of committees be reduced from 23 to 15.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, elegantly sidestepped this issue in his Budget Statement when he implied that the number of committees was a matter for the commission but that he, of course, supported a reduction.  It is not a matter for the commission.  Rather, it is a matter for the Taoiseach and the Minister.  It is plain that neither supports a reduction.</P>
        <P>It is all very well and fair for the Chief Whip to take the opportunity to point out that there have been reforms in this regard.  For example, the stipends for vice chairmen and convenors have been abolished, the stipends for chairmen have been halved and staff levels have been cut.  However, the number of committees remains the same.  A House of 166 Members cannot support a network of 23 committees.  The Government persists with this number for the same reason for which they were designed by Deputy Bertie Ahern in the first instance, that is, they are a convenient reward for disappointed would-be officeholders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for reducing the number is not primarily about financial savings, although that is an issue.  Rather, the reason is to improve the committee system.  There are so many committees that it is not possible for them all to function well.  In larger parliaments, there are usually sufficient non-officeholding parliamentarians with an expertise or specialist knowledge to support a larger committee structure.  Our House of 166 Members does not have that resource.  The legislative committees are usually carried by the Minister and two Opposition spokespersons.  In addition, since chairmen are so disproportionately drawn from the Government side of the House, they usually emerge as another string to the Government&rsquo;s bow.  When it suits, the chairman is a stand-in for the Minister.  When it does not suit, he or she emerges as a media advocate of reform instead of the Opposition.  The Opposition does the heavy lifting and the others sign in to decorate their <i>curricula vitae</i>.</P>
        <P>Like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I remember not so many years ago when the introduction of a committee system in the House was regarded as being at the leading edge of parliamentary reform.  Some of the committees have demonstrated the value and quality of the work done, but we do not need 23 of them because a House of this size cannot support so many.  The <Col N="100" />capacity to confer powers on a particular committee to compel witnesses and to send for persons and papers would enable a smaller committee system to hold public bodies to account, as envisaged in the Fine Gael Bill.  Recent developments in many public bodies have demonstrated the necessity for a functional, informed committee system with the powers required to hold senior executives to account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent days, a Minister of State appeared on RTE and wondered aloud what all of the fuss was about with F&Aacute;S.  Was everything in the public domain not uncovered by F&Aacute;S in the first place, he wondered.  That is true, but what he did not say was that the report of the internal audit system within F&Aacute;S was suppressed by the people running F&Aacute;S.  My good friend, Deputy Conor Lenihan, forgot to say that.  Sometimes, he has a problem in fleshing out his sentences to convey the full truth of a situation.  Television lights have that impact on him.  The internal audit function uncovered the skulduggery occurring, but it was suppressed and, from what I have been told, vindictive action was taken against a small number of staff.</P>
        <P>Therefore, I support the Bill&rsquo;s measures to bring more transparency to public appointments and to provide for public bodies to be properly held to account.  I agree with Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s comments when introducing the Bill, that one ought not be excluded from serving on a public body by virtue of one&rsquo;s political affiliation, but there ought to be criteria other than&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>One would be a fool if one thought that did not count.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;political affiliation.  In recent times, there has been no evidence in some of the cases known to each of us in the House to suggest that the criterion brought to bear was anything but political affiliation.</P>
        <P>The entry of my colleagues in the Green Party who shared my concern has reminded me of the disgraceful happenings in the Equality Authority.  Before the chief executive was forced out, the Minister teed it up by cleaning out the authority&rsquo;s board and bringing in a new board.  He stated that he was worried about the cost, so he appointed four extra directors.  Whereas the previous directors had functioned free, <i>gratis</i> and for nothing and gave of their time and their expertise, he caused a stipend of just under &euro;10,000 to be paid to the enlarged board.  I do not want to be personal about some of the people now on the board, one of whom is the director of elections for an Independent Deputy.  I could comment on some of the others.  The first action was to dismiss the chief executive, who was doing his job as envisaged in law.  Unfortunately, the Green Party did not take a stand on this matter when one would have expected it to, since I do not doubt the bona fides of its Members&rsquo; horror about what occurred.</P>
        <P>There are too many public bodies, some with enormous budgets and, in certain cases, established to obviate the necessity for a Minister to answer questions in the House.  The written reply from the Minister tells one to apply to an bord such and such.  By the time one gets an answer, whatever was the pressing urgency has passed.  There is no adequate mechanism in the House to hold bodies with large budgets of public money to account.  The Bill is a modest step in the right direction and, for that reason, it has our support.</P>

	<P>We will talk to Deputy Ring outside.  I welcome the Fine Gael contribution to the debate on public appointments but I regret that the Bill is limited in its ambitions.</P>
        <P>On a personal note I give credit to Deputy Varadkar for the good work he has done in bringing transparency to the operations of his own office in terms of his role as a Deputy.  I would be delighted if his colleagues within the Fine Gael Party would bring the same level of transparency to their allowances and expenses as he does on his website.  I give him credit for that.</P>
        <P>The problem with the Bill before us is that, in essence, the Fine Gael Bill retains the &ldquo;who one knows&rdquo; aspect of public appointments.  That is the devil in the detail.  It is that very issue we want to move away from.  The Fine Gael Bill only addresses the larger State bodies and agencies.  Under the model it proposes the Oireachtas acts as a rubber stamp for ministerial appointments.  The Fine Gael Bill does not give the power to the Oireachtas to nominate persons to boards, merely to approve them.  It will not remove political patronage and it will not open up membership of State boards to qualified and talented persons from outside the political system, namely those with no connections to political parties or lobby groups.</P>
        <P>The real flaw in the Fine Gael Bill is that it does not address the issue of diversity in our State boards, both of background and of skills.  On the other hand, the Green Party in government has already begun to make fundamental change to how appointments to boards are made.  As part of the Broadcasting Act 2009, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, has ensured that the Oireachtas has an essential role in nominating members to the Broadcasting Authority.  Unlike the proposal in the Fine Gael Bill, the Oireachtas committee will nominate half of the members of the board, and not merely approve them.  The Green Party has already gone far beyond what Fine Gael is proposing in the Bill.  The Green Party in government will build on that innovation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Deputy Cuffe does not really believe that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Among the options under consideration are an extended use of Oireachtas committees in both nominating and auditing board membership; an extended role for the Public Appointments Commission, or similar bodies, in the appointments to lesser boards; and an opening up of appointments to those currently outside of the political elite.  That will ensure we have a transparent system, free from political patronage, which will attract talented and capable people from across the full spectrum of society.</P>
        <P>In the limited time available I wish to stress that what we want to ensure we have is a system based on merit, transparency, equality and diversity of skills and background.  Several models exist.  One model is to have a public appointments unit in the Standards in Public Office Commission or the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  A second model is to use an Oireachtas committee together with ministerial discretion.  A third option is to use the Committee of Public Accounts to regulate and oversee the making of appointments.</P>
        <P>We should continue with the excellent discussion Deputy Varadkar has introduced to the House.  Every model has advantages and disadvantages.  The good work that the TASC think tank has done in this regard is worth considering in detail.  The Green Party has put forward a good model in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  In fairness to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, his appointments to the Dublin Transportation Authority have gone a long way towards creating a better system that is less prone to political patronage.  I commend Deputy <Col N="102" />Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill.  However, if anything, it is limited in ambition.  We can and will go further than he has proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, am delighted to take part in this debate.  I thank Deputy Varadkar for his work on this issue.  While I and my party do not believe his measures go far enough to reform the system of appointments to State boards it does represent a positive contribution, and is another opportunity for the political system to debate this issue, which is important.  This country has, regrettably, a chequered history in terms of political appointments to State boards, with many appointments over the years bringing into the realm of public service people chosen for reasons of acquaintance and loyalty, not competence or suitability.  Those examples amounted to nothing more than political cronyism.</P>
        <P>There are several positive aspects to Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposals.  They bring greater accountability into the realm of State bodies and their work.  We have seen from recent incidents how a lack of accountability from State bodies has led to serious problems.  The proposal includes Oireachtas participation in the ratification of certain appointments, which could be a positive and more democratic way of making appointments.  It also envisages Oireachtas committees playing a more active role in the process of public appointments.  However, I do not believe Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposals go far enough.  The Bill would not remove political patronage and it would not open up membership of State boards to qualified and talented people from outside the political system.  We need to walk a further mile in that regard.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Cuffe indicated, my party has shown its commitment to reform of the public appointments system in recent years.  In 2007 my colleague Senator Boyle produced a fine Bill which would have had positive implications for all appointments to public bodies.  That Bill provided that the Minister would retain responsibility for appointments but a public bodies unit within the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments would take charge of overseeing the appointments.  It would advertise positions openly and transparently and following its selection of candidates a new joint Oireachtas committee on appointments to public bodies would be involved in scrutiny of the system and scrutiny at the end of the terms of office of appointees.  In addition, the commission would have the power to dismiss chairpersons or board members.  Under that Bill special appointments to certain international bodies would be subject to D&aacute;il approval.  Although Senator Boyle&rsquo;s Bill was rejected by the then Government he raised the issue again in frequent Seanad debates.  He most recently initiated a further debate on governance in that House in April of this year.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe referred to the changes introduced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  That was another Green Party initiative to re-shape public appointments.  The Oireachtas, through the relevant committee, will nominate half of the members of the Broadcasting Authority, as well as approve them.  This is the first time nominations and appointments to a State board have been legislated for in such a manner.  The party has also shown a non-partisan approach in some of the appointments it has made to State boards.  It is working in government to produce broad reform of this area of public appointments.</P>
        <P>Any system of public appointments would need to be based on allowing the wider public access to jobs on State boards so that those outside the political elite are able to get involved.  A new system should entail greater use of Oireachtas committees, or perhaps the Seanad, to nominate or audit board membership.  In addition a State body such as the Public Appointments Commission should be used to regulate and administer a fair, transparent and meritocratic system of public appointments.  D&aacute;il inclusion in the ratification of certain appointments to international bodies should also be considered as part of this reform.</P><Col N="103" />
        <P>I once shared a car journey from the North with Deputy Varadkar, where we discussed many things as we negotiated the roundabouts and traffic lights going back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a vote, among them, Oireachtas reform, D&aacute;il reform, and public appointments and other things that shall remain between the two of us.  His sincerity in bringing this Bill before the House is genuine.  I would like it to go further.  It has brought the discussion of the range of appointments to State boards once more into the public domain, which can only be good.  I look forward to further progress on this area of governance in the near future from this side of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion on the Public Appointments Transparency Bill.  We all agree on the need for greater transparency and accountability for State appointments, whether the appointment of the chairperson of a board or the chief executive of any given State agency or authority.  However, I do not agree with Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s statement last night that people should be rewarded for participating in the political process, nor do I believe people should be penalised for it.  In recent months we have seen the appointment of public interest directors to the financial institutions by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  A non-partisan way forward is the best approach.  People from all sides of the House, those with political experience or those outside with no political experience but with the correct commercial experience should be appointed where they are deemed to be appropriate.  Once appointees are in position on a board or acting as chief executives, they are acting on behalf of the State, not on behalf of a political party or the Government.  Therefore, it is fundamentally important for the democratic process that such appointments are properly made and are seen to be properly made.</P>
        <P>I refer to a point made by Deputy Rabbitte, elaborating on another point made by Deputy Frank Feighan last night concerning the accountability of some State bodies to this House.  Deputy Feighan remarked that if a Member poses a question about the National Roads Authority, he or she receives a standard letter that the Minister has no responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the matter raised.  I agree with Deputies Rabbitte and Feighan that this system must be changed because wherever public expenditure decisions are made, whether by a State agency or authority, ultimately, the Minister has political responsibility for those decisions.  Answers should be made available in this House when questions are put.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the system with regard to the HSE and the cumbersome process in place to answer parliamentary questions, which can take up to three, four or even five weeks.  It is symptomatic of the way this House has devolved power away from the political process over many years and it is time we re-assumed that power to the House.  We are the elected public representatives with a mandate and we should not be afraid to take responsibility for decisions or to be accountable for those decisions in this House.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue at the heart of Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill.  There is no question that the traditional system of State appointments to boards and the appointment of chief executives should be reviewed.  The process must be publically transparent and appointments should be above party politics.  The single greatest qualification that a person should demonstrate in securing such an appointment is relevant experience, not a background in a political party nor that he or she is friends of anybody.  This should be the most important criterion.  It is important to draw a distinction in the vetting process between the appointment of a non-executive chairperson of a board and a chief executive because these are completely different roles.  The latter role is an executive position including the role of Accounting Officer before the Committee of Public Accounts, following any report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, whereas the chairperson is an non-executive member of the board in many instances and it is a different <Col N="104" />role.  A one-size-fits-all procedure in the Oireachtas would not necessarily be the most appropriate way forward.</P>
        <P>It is important we do not put in place any barriers to finding the best people.  If a vetting system is in place involving Oireachtas committees, would such hearings be held in public or private?  Does this have the potential to degenerate into a circus?  In fairness, Deputy Varadkar mentioned that personal issues or people&rsquo;s backgrounds should not be the subject of vetting in such an eventuality.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced that the most appropriate way forward is for the Legislature to be directly involved in the vetting of candidates, whether in the appointment to a board or a chief executive, because not only are the appointments by the Minister to the boards important but, through other legislation, the appointment of other directors to boards, whether worker directors or appointments by other nominating bodies, are equally important.  Are we suggesting all such appointments would come before the House?  Everyone on the board is equal and has an equal responsibility.</P>
        <P>Those are some initial comments and I thank Deputy Varadkar for putting forward the Bill.  It is important that we hold a thorough debate and once the task force on public sector reform reports back on this issue we must try to achieve a consensus and improve the current system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to partake in this debate.  I followed it last night and listened to the contributions this evening which have been informative, and credit should be extended to Deputy Varadkar.  His intent is genuine, good and non-political.  There is no doubt that in today&rsquo;s age of openness, transparency and accountability the public demand openness in terms of appointing people to our State boards.  Equally, to maintain a balance, I do not know of any Minister who appointed a person to a board knowing he or she had the intention of doing a bad job.  Also, many people have been appointed to State boards throughout the years who have done very fine work.  Such people have been fine public servants who served the public interest above and beyond the call of duty and we should all acknowledge as much.  Obviously, there have been examples of actions which were not up to standard and they have been discussed, debated, reviewed and investigated by many committees and other agencies.</P>
        <P>In terms of how we vet people, it is worth considering the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which vets the people nominated to Government for appointment to the Judiciary.  Such a model is workable and credible and people&rsquo;s credentials, qualifications and suitability for appointments may be assessed and then processed.  The Standards in Public Office Commission should have a positive role to play in this regard.</P>
        <P>Much enabling legislation which comes before the House disbars Deputies and Senators from sitting on the boards of agencies, which is correct.  We should, however, go one step further.  Local authority members should be also disbarred because local government has become a very busy place.  Those working in the sector are paid public representatives.  A representative may have 12 official local authority meetings in one year but there are many other meetings which take the form of briefing sessions.  The prohibition on Deputies and Members of the Seanad should also apply to local authority members.</P>
        <P>We should consider putting a cap on the number of appointments a person may hold in State agencies.  We all receive the annual reports as they land on our desks via the postman.  There are instances of people who seem to appear on the boards of many State agencies.  We must critically examine this and possibly impose a cap on the number of positions an individual may hold.  We must also appraise the role of civil servants on boards.  There is an increasing trend <Col N="105" />whereby several State agencies have one or a number of civil servants on their boards.  We should flesh out this matter because these people have a responsibility as a member of a given board.  However, when something takes place the role of such people is not to become the eyes and ears of the Department because such people are bound by board confidentiality.  We must examine the role of civil servants because the chief accounting officer reports to the Department and the chairperson of a board reports to the Minister.  Why, therefore, are there so many civil servants on boards?  I am not saying we should not have any in such positions but we should examine the matter.</P>
        <P>We should also examine the age of appointees to boards.  There is a retirement age of 65 years within the civil and public service for a reason.  A Government decision dating from the 1970s precludes people more than 70 years of age from being appointed to State boards.  I am not being ageist and I am not suggesting it is right or wrong, but in the light of equality legislation we should examine the matter.  I refer to the issue of gender.  There is a minimum female gender requirement of 40%.  We should consider moving to a 50-50 requirement, or at least to have the 40% threshold upheld, because it is not upheld in all areas.</P>
        <P>With appointments to State boards where a group structure exists, the original appointee is often a director on subsidiary companies and when the term expires on the parent group company, the member often remains as board director of subsidiary companies <i>ad infinitum</i>.  That should be examined.  There is good intent in this discussion as there are many anomalies that should be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this timely debate.  The introduction of this Bill by Deputy Varadkar highlights the necessity to ensure that whatever public moneys are being spent are spent correctly.  Over the years I have had much interaction with State bodies and other statutory agencies, as well as voluntary boards.  In the majority of those cases, the people involved, from the chairman right through the members of the board, have been excellent and contribute greatly to the sphere of work in which they are involved.  I notice this in particular with statutory boards such as the community policing forums around this city and other agencies.</P>
        <P>I have a problem with Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill in that we should not throw out the baby with the bath water.  There are some relevant and specific points within the Bill but we must ensure not to lose much of the experience and expertise that has been built up in this country in recent years.  When placing people in positions of responsibility, particularly where public money is concerned, there is a need for experience and people who know what they are doing.  Such appointees must be able to work with others, although that has not always been the case.  In the majority of cases, people &mdash; particularly those giving their time voluntarily &mdash; have much expertise to contribute, and we should not make the mistake of ignoring it.</P>
        <P>In the present climate and in recent months our focus has been particularly pointed towards some State agencies which have floundered for whatever reason at board, staff or management level.  Incidents over the past months and years have caused concern for everybody in this House.  No more than members of the Opposition, Members on this side of the House are every day of the week dealing with individuals, families and groups which interact with such agencies on a daily basis.  It is as much in our interest as anybody else&rsquo;s to ensure those agencies deal specifically with the tasks given to them in an efficient and open manner.</P>
        <P>We have had much discussion in recent weeks and months on the Dublin Docklands Authority, for example.  I have personally experienced the significant work done by that body in my constituency and it has been successful in turning what was a derelict part of Dublin into a thriving community, business and otherwise.  We should learn from mistakes which have been made rather than making a blanket contribution, and use expertise built up over years.</P><Col N="106" />
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has thought outside the box and considered alternatives.  He has openly advertised senior posts to people who may have an interest and got the best person for the job in that way.  We should consider such an approach, a prime example of which was used with the Dublin Transport Authority and the appointment of Mr. Gerry Murphy.  He was with the Grangegorman Development Agency and is a man of great experience and a very shrewd operator.  He will be of significant benefit to the city.  We must be careful in how we approach our business but we should proceed in a proper fashion, ensuring all agencies act correctly in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Varadkar for opening the debate on this matter.  Some aspects of the Bill are premature but it is useful to have the debate nonetheless.  I hope that further down the road we will be able to get agreement across the House on the way forward.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Brady indicated, the Government has moved on this issue.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have gone outside their previous remits in dealing with the appointment of CEOs.  Generally speaking, the chairmen appointed by a Minister are of the highest quality.  Reference has been made to the Dublin Transport Authority, to which the former county manager of Fingal, Mr. William Soffe, has been appointed.  He is a man of integrity and vast experience and he is very familiar with the Dublin area from his time as deputy manager of Dublin City Council and subsequently as manager of Fingal County Council.</P>
        <P>The appointment of a chairman by a Minister is not bad, <i>per se</i>.  We must appoint people of quality, probity and integrity.  The Ministers I mentioned publicly advertised positions and fortunately we are getting the right people for positions.  That is the way it should be.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael should wait for the publication of the OECD report on public service appointments and we could then have a completely informed debate.  I hope the combination of the report and the input of the Opposition could bring about a position of transparency, which we all want to see.  Organisations like the HSE and the National Roads Authority should be accountable to the Houses, and that should be the next stage in terms of accountability and transparency.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Deputy for initiating this debate and facilitating the airing of opinions on all sides of the House.  We should also hear professional views such as that of the OECD report.  As a D&aacute;il we should not make decisions without reference to professional bodies; we should listen to professional recruitment firms, for example, which help appoint top executives in the biggest businesses in the country on a daily basis.  They would also have much international experience and, collectively, such ideas could facilitate the publication of a Bill which could be supported by all parties, either by way of Private Members&rsquo; Business or a Government Bill.  I am not concerned about who introduces it as long as we get the right result.</P>
        <P>The reference to the position of chief executive is very important.  It is essential for us to get the right people into position in order to make the important decisions required of all our State bodies, particularly in the current recessionary climate.  I remain to be convinced that the D&aacute;il having powers to sanction appointees is the right way to go.  I would hate to think of us sitting around checking out an individual, asking whether his or her granny beat his or her grandad, for example.  We have seen how in America the gory details can be brought into the public domain.  There are aspects of a person&rsquo;s life which do not impinge on his or her ability to do a job and, whatever way we tackle the issue, I would hate to think of this D&aacute;il engaging in a personal attack on a private individual.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Bill before the House has nothing to do with Irish soccer and is not about the grannies and grandads of new CEOs.  Under its provisions, the questions to be put to candidates would relate to their credentials and expertise and not to their families or what they had for breakfast.  It is important to clarify that point.  If the Deputies opposite read the contributions already made by Members on this side, they might come to realise what we are trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>During the debate on another motion last week, I referred to the desire for a new kind of politics.  This Bill is another step in that direction.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, and others are missing the point in respect of this matter.  Members of the public want a new kind of politics and they want to see changes introduced to the system.  They want accountability, responsibility and action and are fed up with Ministers establishing bodies and committees to carry out research and make decisions.  People no longer want to hear, &ldquo;We will make a decision in six months&rsquo; time when we receive a report&rdquo;.  The people elect politicians and Ministers to lead and make decisions.  We waited approximately eight or nine months for an bord snip nua&rsquo;s report but any Member could have compiled it.  There was no need to employ someone else to write that report.  What are Members doing here?</P>
        <P>The Bill is an attempt to restore accountability in respect of what happens in State bodies and boards.  It suggests that a procedure be put in place in order that the names of all appointees be placed before the Houses and that the chairpersons of boards should present themselves to the relevant committees for a discussion regarding their credentials and their plans for the position in respect of which they have been nominated.  It is quite simple.  We are not blaming anyone or stating that people have done anything wrong.  We are merely stating that a new system which will restore accountability and show the public that we are willing to put in place a proper system.  What is wrong with following the example of the United States or other countries?  We must learn from the political systems in which people believe.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, stated that there is no need for the Bill.  He also stated that everyone wants to promote the public interest.  The issue is that people no longer believe that.  They have lost faith in the House and in how it does its business.  We have a duty to act fast in order to restore that faith.</P>
        <P>Government Ministers do not realise that the election of President Obama in the United States has raised the bar for everyone involved in politics.  The standard set by President Obama is that which people want all politicians to meet.  A few weeks after taking office, President Obama named those who were to serve in the equivalent of our Cabinet.  He indicated that these people were to perform certain jobs, that they would be obliged to discuss with him what they wished to achieve and that he would make the final decision, for which he would be accountable.  I am not stating that we want the Taoiseach to be responsible for everything.  However, President Obama stated that he is accountable and that if something goes wrong, it will be his fault.  That is not the way matters operate in this country but it should be.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill will start us on the road towards having a system of that nature.  It refers to people who are nominated for appointment to top jobs being obliged to come before the relevant committees of the Houses and outlining their qualifications.  This would give Members on all sides the opportunity to pose the relevant questions.  As already stated, such questions would not relate to what sport someone plays but would rather focus on his or her <Col N="108" />qualifications, expertise and plans.  It is not rocket science.  What we are seeking would be easy to implement.</P>
        <P>There are close to 1,000 public bodies in existence.  Earlier today I discovered that in future the NRA will be responsible for filling in potholes on county roads.  I was under the impression that this was the job of the county council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The county councils are not doing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  Rather than being able to approach the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in respect of matters relating to county roads, Members will now be obliged to submit their questions &mdash; in respect of which they will not receive replies &mdash; to the NRA.  If one tables a question relating to road safety to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, one receives a reply which indicates that he no longer has responsibility for the matter and that one should approach someone else in respect of it.  One cannot ask the Minister for Health and Children questions about particular health matters without being informed that one&rsquo;s query has been forwarded to the HSE.  The legislation under which the HSE was established specifically states that its CEO cannot question Government policy; it can only implement it.  However, we are continually informed that the HSE rather than the Minister has responsibility for particular matters.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I have serious misgivings with regard to that matter.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a step in the right direction and relates to the modernisation of politics.  There is absolutely no reason the Government should not accept it.  I suggest that we could add to it by proposing that Deputies should be allowed to serve on State bodies in order that people can see that we are doing our job.  There are many Deputies who do not receive recognition for the work they do on Oireachtas committees.  Such work often goes no further than the relevant Minister&rsquo;s desk.  They should be appointed to the various bodies and boards &mdash; such as, for example, F&Aacute;S &mdash; in order that they might monitor their activities.  This would assist in creating the type of political process of accountability and responsibility the country deserves and needs.  It will obtain such a process if Bills of this nature are accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy English hit the nail on the head in respect of this matter.  Members of the public feel angry, hurt, helpless and, most of all, completely and utterly frustrated.  If we do not get our act together and respond, we will all &mdash; particularly those in government &mdash; receive our answer when the next general election is held.</P>
        <P>Cronyism has completely discredited politics and all politicians.  It is time we dealt with it head on.  People are fed up with the nod-and-wink culture that has developed, like a cancer, in Irish society and public life, particularly during the past 12 years.  Certain individuals have wielded enormous influence and acted with absolute impunity.  The obvious example in this regard relates  to F&Aacute;S.  However, there are many other State and semi-State bodies which have acted in a similar fashion.  The individuals involved in the cases to which I refer were appointed to multiple State boards.  Some of them were continually reappointed to their positions on virtually every State board going during the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
        <P>An incentive has developed for politicians on the Government benches to create more of these bodies.  I do not merely refer to semi-State organisations in this regard.  Rather, I refer to county enterprise boards and similar ancillary bodies which should be part of county councils.  Deputy Hogan introduced proposals to deal with the position in this regard.</P><Col N="109" />
        <P>As already stated, there is an incentive to encourage the proliferation of these organisations in order that those in government might provide their friends and cronies with jobs and thereby keep them happy and ensure they remain on board.  This is simply not satisfactory.  The people have had enough and so have Members on this side of the House.  If the Minister of State opposite, Deputy Barry Andrews, and his colleagues do not deal with this matter, then the public will deal with them.  It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, 207 new State bodies and some 600 new bodies in total have been established.  The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, has made numerous calls to the effect that this matter should be dealt with and during the past two years Deputy Varadkar and many others in the House have highlighted the need for action.  However, nothing of substance has happened.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to put forward and develop a new way of doing things.  At the core of this new way is something simple, straightforward and easy to implement, namely, that public appointments should be made in public.  The Bill suggests that when the Government appoints someone to a State board, this should be done in public and on an accountable basis.  It also suggests that in respect of the most important appointments, the relevant committee should have the power to accept or reject a nomination.</P>
        <P>One does not need to look to the United States for an example in this regard.  One need go no further than the European Commission.  As Deputy English stated, we are not interested in character assassination or in what people had for breakfast.  However, we want to know about their qualifications, character and suitability to hold some of the most important positions in the country.  We deserve to be provided with information relating to nominees&rsquo; qualifications and these should be laid before the relevant Oireachtas committee.  There should be nothing surprising about that.</P>
        <P>Some of the excuses and blather offered by the Government in respect of this matter are, quite simply, ridiculous.  It was stated that the committees are overloaded with work.  They are overloaded in the context of being obliged to listen to Ministers read scripts that have been prepared by civil servants.  As Deputy English asked, what are Members doing here?  We are here to serve the people and to make politics relevant and accountable to them.  Citizens are fed up with the creeping cronyism that has destroyed public life and destroyed people&rsquo;s confidence in the political system.  We all suffer as a result of this.  What is happening is simply unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The real problem arises in the context of the arrogance that exists at the highest level in government, where people feel they can act with impunity and do not have to account to anyone.  These individuals are of the view that they can make appointments and account for them at a later date.  This is ridiculous and unsustainable and the public will not stand for it.  What is the Government afraid of?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Varadkar and compliment him on introducing this Bill.  I wish to raise two points in the brief time at my disposal.  First, what could possibly be wrong with having the relevant Oireachtas committee meet the nominated chief executive officer or whatever to conduct a two-way debate with him or her?  Although Members opposite have suggested this Bill would entail finding out every fiddly-faddly detail about a person&rsquo;s background, that is not what is intended.  As Deputy Creighton has observed, the aim is to ensure the public can buy into this system.  I have often watched how this process works in the United States Congress and ultimately, there is no point in having the proposed chief executive officer of the relevant outfit thinking that he or she must endure a grilling, as that is not the point.  Moreover, to bring this a step further, the Minister of State should imagine the image created if one links transparency regarding the political establishment in the minds of the <Col N="110" />electorate in respect of a person who probably will be responsible for delivering one of the most important services they will receive as individuals.  This is the bottom line because it is the delivery of the service in a transparent manner into which everyone can buy that counts.  However, we are a million miles from that position at present.</P>
        <P>A number of related Oireachtas committees would be suitable in this regard, such as the Committee of Public Accounts.  While I acknowledge this committee deals with matters after they have happened, there would be no difficulty in establishing something similar.  Those Members who have had the good fortune to serve on that committee for a number of years will appreciate it deals in the kind of detail and information that is sought by the public.  The public would at least know who the Government has proposed on its behalf for the job in question.  Moreover, were such a committee to be set up on an all-party basis, can one imagine the mandate that successful nominees would enjoy after coming through it?  They would be much stronger than would be the case had they not undergone such a process.</P>
        <P>I refer to the 6,000 directorships and memberships of boards, etc., of quangos throughout the country.  No matter where they are located, they should be made known publicly to all concerned, both locally and nationally, in order that everyone will understand who represents them, even if it is merely on a prison visiting committee.  Regardless of what it is, it should be open and transparent.</P>

	<P>My next point pertains to a matter about which I continually have a bee in my bonnet.  While it is not specifically related to this Bill, the principle is the same.  National partnership is no such thing when half the elected Members of this House have nothing to do with it.  In other words, only 50% of Members, by way of the Government side, are represented.  Every other so-called pillar of the community is represented but half the membership of this House is disenfranchised for a reason I have never understood.  Finally, on a practical matter, I have never understood the reason I am unable to discuss health issues on the floor of this Chamber on behalf of the constituents I represent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Five years ago, I was deeply involved in a committee hearing process for the approval of the European Commission through the committee system in the European Parliament.  The nominee for whom we had responsibility for questioning and debating with was Charlie McCreevy, because I was a member of the internal market committee of the European Parliament.  It was a good system that was open, accountable and transparent.  Journalists were present, people made their judgments and it worked.  I cannot understand the arguments made by many of the speakers on the other side of the House as to the reason they will not support the Bill proposed by Fine Gael.  They stated that it is because it has not gone far enough or has not been thought out properly or because Members must wait for an OECD report or another task force.  Alternatively, the view expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is that the current system is satisfactory.</P>
        <P>Deputy Barry Andrews is a new and young Minister of State who I assume wishes to try to change and improve politics and to dispel the cynicism, anger and suspicion in which people in this profession now are held by so many members of the public.  The current system of selecting, <Col N="111" />nominating and approving State board positions represents everything that is bad and secretive about politics.  We need to change it and Fine Gael is bringing forward practical suggestions, based on what works elsewhere, as to how that may be done.  Moreover, we do not suggest this is the perfect solution, which is the reason it has been put forward for a Second Stage debate in this Chamber.  However, the Government could accept and then change the Bill.</P>
        <P>Is it too much to ask that the principle be accepted that someone who will lead a State agency and who will work on behalf of the State, supposedly for the people&rsquo;s benefit, should be obliged to explain the reason they seek and are suitable for the job and to take questioning on that basis?  The people who run the State bodies with which I am familiar would be delighted to do so because it would give them a greater mandate to provide the kind of leadership they wish to give.  It would separate them from cosy connections with a Minister or relationships with the senior party in Government.  This Bill is an attempt to move away from this and the Government should at least accept it in the spirit in which it was meant.  It should take on board what Fine Gael Members are trying to suggest in this Bill, namely, an accountable system that enables Members to hold people to account, rather than setting up more State agencies, task forces and new bodies to do that on their behalf.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, on introducing this Bill to the D&aacute;il.  I cannot understand the reason the Government will not accept it.  I have listened to the Green Party Members, who should stop the hypocrisy.  If the Bill is not perfect, it would be simple to have a Committee Stage debate in which the Government could then introduce whatever amendments it wishes.  I am glad that Deputy Varadkar introduced this Bill because an examination of the Official Report for the last ten years would reveal that in common with other Members, I have been clamouring about the issue of lack of accountability to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The people elect Members to this Parliament.  However, I refer to the previous Administration and the former Taoiseach, who has done much to the discredit of this House.  Every time a problem arose, an agency or quango was set up by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in respect of which he had a building constructed in his own constituency.  He told builders that they should build a building and that he would put something into it.  Members should note all the State agencies are located in the former Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency, which is no way to run a Government.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will provide the Minister of State with an example.  A man who was very upset and frustrated once approached me.  This man worked for a company as a carpenter and had many qualifications, including that of electrician, and had been a foreman for a major company.  Having been obliged to be away from his wife and family for many years, he came to an interview process for a job with Mayo County Council.  After three days of interviewing, during which former county secretaries and officials were paid for their attendance, the overseer&rsquo;s son was appointed.  It is somewhat like F&Aacute;S in that the county council should not even have bothered.  It should simply have paid for the advertisement without putting it in.  This is what is wrong and Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s point is quite correct, given the anger and frustration of that man.  While he had the qualifications, he did not mind if someone better got the job but he knew he was better.  The job was only as a general operative and the only reason he sought it was to be home with his wife and family after the birth of their fourth baby.  He did not want to be working away from home in a major company and nor did he wish to be in receipt of social welfare because he had worked all of his life.</P>
     
          <P>Fine Gael wants to get rid of the quangos because there are too many of them.  Deputy Coveney is correct in that regard.  County managers are appointed through the Civil Service system.  Every county manager should appear before the Oireachtas committee with responsibility for the environment every year and should be accountable to the D&aacute;il for what is hap<Col N="112" />pening.  Every time a Bill is being debated in the D&aacute;il, I ask one question, that the agency, the NRA or the quango be accountable to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>If any Member wants to table a parliamentary question it should be answered.  Deputy Connaughton made the point that when one tables a question to the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Transport, the response is that the Minister has no responsibility.  There is responsibility in this House.  The people of this country are elected to the Parliament, the Parliament makes the laws and every agency should be accountable to the Parliament, not to the Minister.  One should not be on a State board because one supports the Minister or because one supports Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or any other party.  It should be because a person has the qualifications required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Varadkar on introducing this Bill, which is progressive and is needed at present.  The country has become complacent and has accepted the rule as laid down. Unfortunately, there has been very little change of Government in the past few years.  As a result, the same people are being appointed again and again, as referred to by previous speakers.  Terms of reference are drawn up by the same people, appointments are made by the same people and, although the appointees may be good people in their own way with excellent qualifications, by virtue of the fact that they are appointed by the same people they feel allegiance to them.  An example is the way one tables questions on the HSE, NTR or any topic under the sun.  The response is that the Minister has no responsibility to the House.  To whom does the Minister have responsibility?  Is it to himself or herself?  No one can ask a question or receive an answer.  Freedom of information queries have now taken precedence over parliamentary questions because one is more likely to get a reply.</P>
        <P>Why is it that Members of the national Parliament are excluded from asking questions on certain areas?  Another example concerns the health repayment scheme.  A Member may ask a question regarding legislation passed by this House concerning someone awaiting payment.  Eventually a general reply will suggest that the body administering the scheme is prevented from replying to the Member because of the Data Protection Act.  This is the last resort.  People fail to recognise that it does not matter about the Data Protection Act because Members are also subject to it.  Collectively, the House is subject to the Data Protection Act.  No one has the right to hide behind the Data Protection Act when asked a question by a Member of this House or by someone outside this House by way of letter.</P>
        <P>Public bodies and quangos are no longer accountable to anyone except privately to the Minister.  Why should that be?  Have we no respect for ourselves?  Is it not time that someone recognises that, in fairness to everyone, people would like to know that they have been treated equally, that they have access to information and that certain procedures are being followed?  Previous speakers have set out instances where matters could be improved.</P>
        <P>The only way to change the system is to have a change of Government through a general election.  I do not think we will achieve a change of Government in the one minute that remains in my contribution.  When the change of Government comes, it will have the effect of ensuring that those appointed to these bodies will not be as secure as they thought they were.  They will no longer be accountable only to one Minister or one party, which is a total corruption of democracy.  It has happened in this country.  I do not have to go into the subject dearest to the Minister&rsquo;s heart at this time, NAMA.  God and heaven protect us.  I cannot believe that, in any other country in the world, what has gone on over the past five for five years in this country would not lead to charges being proffered against the people concerned.  Nothing happens in this country but I cannot understand why.</P><Col N="113" />
        <P>The Bill is progressive and useful.  It has no chance of success because the Government has no intention of introducing transparency or accountability or of taking any steps to reprimand those who may have erred, greatly costing the people, the country and the taxpayers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for introducing the Public Appointments Transparency Bill.  This is important legislation and is timely in view of recent developments such as the resignation of the F&Aacute;S board and the serious questions being asked of all State appointed boards.  The Bill proposes necessary changes in the manner in which individuals are appointed by Ministers to Government bodies by bringing greater transparency and accountability to the appointment process and by bringing greater scrutiny to the operations and activities of various State agencies, boards and quangos.  Recent events have demonstrated that these reforms are urgently needed.  We see the necessity for D&aacute;il reform and the changes to the business that are needed.</P>
        <P>Having nominees for senior positions on such boards appear before the relevant Oireachtas committee to give evidence as to suitability, qualifications and other matters relevant to nomination will bring greater clarity to the appointment process.  It is important that the individuals who take on such roles are seen to have been appointed in an open and transparent manner, and that their qualifications and suitability for such rules are publicly questioned and examined.  The experience to date has shown that ministerial oversight is often insufficient and inadequate.</P>
        <P>Members of boards of State agencies and quangos are often not directors of the activity in that they do not direct any specific function of the organisation.  They have no status or function other than when meeting as members of the board.  Generally they have no authority or right of access to management except through the chief executive officer, who controls everything.  Friends of friends are on boards.  The legal function of board members often covers such areas as remuneration, disclosure and board procedures but generally the legislation establishing the organisation is a vague in respect of the specific duties of direction and control of the business activities of the organisation.  All of these factors make it imperative that persons being appointed to board level positions of State agencies and quangos have the necessary experience to enable them to fulfil the expected role of responsibility for the public interest in all aspects of the operation of the organisation.  This is important legislation if we are to do business differently.  Questions have been asked about the number of Oireachtas committees.  This could be a major role of a committee, bringing in people, checking their capabilities and making them accountable.  The person appointed would feel a greater responsibility.  Putting people on boards because they have the expertise in one area does not mean they have expertise and qualifications to make a difference.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s appointments to the board of NAMA will be critical.  It is important that, in appointments to bank boards, the citizen&rsquo;s viewpoint is represented and that the public interest nomination on these boards reflects the interests of the people.  People see members of State boards appointing relations and appointing people to other boards.  It is a special, elite club like a public members club.  People are frustrated.  There should be a national register of appointees to all boards.  The appointments should be in the public domain.  Appointed members should occasionally make a statement on what they bring to the board.  It is a privilege to be appointed to a board but there is also the responsibility of accountability.  In government, Fine Gael will make appointments through a public, open forum.  Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill is about change.  Change in business is important and, as a businessman, I know that what was right last year might be wrong this year.  One must keep changing and discussing improvements with the management team.  In the 12 years I have been in Leinster House nothing has changed.  We are using the same procedures and little or no D&aacute;il reform has taken place.  A very effective mechanism of D&aacute;il reform would be for the committees in the House to have a real role.  As <Col N="114" />Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Scrutiny I believe that scrutiny of legislation and appointments is very important.  The Minister should seriously recommend this to improve politics and to make this House more accountable to the people who elect us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill with which we are dealing here this evening raises important issues of public interest and I thank Deputy Varadkar for allowing the House the opportunity to discuss them.  While the Government is opposing the Bill on a number of grounds, we acknowledge the concerns that have been voiced by many Deputies.  We agree that the aim to achieve best practice in the corporate governance of State bodies and statutory agencies is paramount.  It is fundamental to the public interest.  However, there are a number of different ways in which that aim can be achieved.</P>
        <P>As already pointed out in the debate, individual Members of the Government have taken a number of initiatives in their own sectors.  The Minister for Transport advertised for expressions of interest for suitable candidates when he was filling vacancies on the board of the Dublin Transportation Authority.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has given the relevant Oireachtas committee a role in the appointment of certain State boards.  In my Department, I have consulted the main Opposition parties about the appointment of public interest directors to the State guaranteed financial institutions.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that in recent years the system of appointments to State boards has been refined and the overall calibre of appointees has improved.  It is increasingly the practice to specify in the governing legislation the attributes required of board members.  The legislation governing the establishment of NAMA is a case in point.  I will consult with the Opposition parties about the chairmanship of the agency and I have written to the Opposition leaders in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Government is anxious to innovate in this area and is keen to bring more accountability into the system of State board appointments.  Having said that, it is not clear that the approach proposed in the Bill is the best way of delivering the improvements we all want to see.  I am not convinced of the case for departing from the well-established corporate governance arrangements for the appointment of chief executives.  The current practice whereby chief executives and other senior executives are appointed by the board is the norm internationally and is often specified in legislation.  These appointments are conducted through a well-tried and independent process involving open competition and sometimes the use of recruitment agencies.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any dissatisfaction with this system and I am not sure that the legislature is the correct body to vet these appointments.  There could be considerable operational difficulty with an Oireachtas committee assessing an appointment to such key positions as chief executives and chairmen in such a wide range of bodies.  It might deter candidates from coming forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It should not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have my doubts that an Oireachtas committee would deliver appointments to a wide variety of State bodies in a timely and efficient manner, a prerequisite to ensuring the continued smooth operation of the bodies in question.  We should study the experience in the United States in that regard.  Last night, Deputy Varadkar acknowledged there could be some difficulties.  However, he was more optimistic than I would be that they could be managed.</P><Col N="115" />
        <P>The proposal contained in his Bill that the D&aacute;il should confirm Executive appointments by resolution would be unprecedented.  The only appointment made in this manner is that of Comptroller and Auditor General who is a constitutional officer.  Looking narrowly at the matter of transparency, it should be noted by the House that the names of directors of State bodies and statutory agencies, as well as their professional activities and qualifications, are publicly available in the annual reports, which must be laid before the Houses prior to publication.  An examination of recent appointments will show that the qualifications of many of those nominated to serve of State boards have been impressive.</P>
        <P>The selection process for senior positions is important but it is not the only means of ensuring best practice in the governance of State bodies.  There are a wide variety of obligations on board members including the corporate governance obligations set out in the recently revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The code is very clear on the matters that are reserved to the board and for which it is responsible and will be held to account.</P>
        <P>This evening, I had the pleasure of conferring certificates and diplomas for training courses for directors at an Institute of Directors function.  We must deepen this area, as the office of director carries serious fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders and legal obligations with regard to creditors, debtors and employees.  It is important that those who undertake such an office understand its responsibilities and I am open to all suggestions for improvement in that regard.</P>
        <P>Proper oversight of State bodies by the parent Department is fundamental.  The Government accepts the recommendations in the OECD&rsquo;s 2008 review that the framework between Ministers and State bodies should be strengthened.  The task force established by the Taoiseach on foot of the review set out a three-year framework, which the Government has adopted, for transformation of the public service.  The Department of Finance will lead the work in the development of models of performance and governance frameworks.  These models will cover the issues raised by the OECD, including the role and function of the boards of State bodies.  Any major change to the system of appointment of the chairmen and CEOs should await the outcome of that work.</P>
        <P>The Government and I share Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s concern to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance of statutory bodies.  We do not accept the Bill as currently drafted will achieve our shared ambition.  Therefore I oppose the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill and I am very disappointed to hear the Minister state that the Government will reject the Bill.  That is a mistake.  The Bill may not be perfect but it could be amended.  It is a very important Bill and the Government should fly a flag to state it is willing to make changes and ensure that openness, transparency and accountability are introduced throughout the public service.  This is particularly so for Members of the Green Party who, when in Opposition, proposed a similar Bill which contained similar structures to what we are discussing this evening.  Now that they are on the other side of the House they are bringing down the shutters and keeping everything under wraps and behind closed doors with appointments made in private.</P>
        <P>The political establishment has lost favour with the electorate.  A series of bad news stories on the abuse of power, or perceived abuse of power, and a failure by some to live up to the standards required of those of us who operate in public service has undermined confidence in the structures of the State.  That is wrong and is unfair to the many individuals who want to serve the electorate and give of their time and expertise to the State.  We can all point to incidents where individuals did not fulfil their obligations to the public, the taxpayers and stakeholders.  The tribunals have been well documented and their published findings have <Col N="116" />shocked many members of the public.  Their findings have been deeply disappointing and the public has become cynical not only of the politicians who represent them but also of those who have served in public office.  The facts have been laid bare and recent reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General into the activities of F&Aacute;S are factual and tangible.</P>
        <P>Another area the Bill proposes to tackle is allegations of cronyism and jobs for the boys and suggestions that it is all about who one knows and that if one supports the Government parties of the day one will receive favours and be appointed to State boards.  This insinuates that it is not about one&rsquo;s knowledge, personal skills or the contribution one can make.  This thinking undermines confidence in many of our State institutions.  Now is the time to put things right and to ensure we put in place a more transparent system of appointment to our State boards for the good of politics and, more importantly, for the good name of our State institutions that have served this country so well in many ways.  They need to have the confidence of those they serve.</P>
        <P>All parties in the House should support a more transparent system that would see those appointed as CEOs and chairmen to State boards come before an Oireachtas committee and give an account of their attributes.  I am sure many people would be glad of the opportunity to come before a committee in a public and open fashion and participate in a question and answer session, give of their time and hear what Members of the Oireachtas have to say about the State board on which they are due to serve.</P>
        <P>It is very important to renew public confidence in our State institutions.  I do not accept what many contributors said that it could amount to a witch-hunt.  That would not be the case.  The qualifications and expertise of the individuals would come into question along with their ability to serve.  Many people serve on State boards and give their very valuable time.  We acknowledge that but in the interests of openness and transparency, a move towards a public appointments system is what is needed.</P>
        <P>I was interested to read a report in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers about yesterday&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting.  I was not in attendance but perhaps the Minister for Finance was.  The report stated that a backbencher questioned the appointment of the chairwoman to the Arts Council.  The T&aacute;naiste is reported to have been upset that the matter was raised at a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting.  I believe she said she said she may as well talk about it on the streets and that the Deputy should have raised it privately with her.  The report also stated there are allegations that there are concerns in Fianna F&aacute;il that too many of the same people are getting the same jobs and that there is fishing from the same pool all the time.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance can clarify that.</P>
        <P>The report to which I have referred sums up exactly what we are about this evening.  Why not have these appointments out in the open?  I am sure the individuals appointed would be willing to discuss their relevant attributes.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reported comments from yesterday&rsquo;s parliamentary party meeting sum up the thinking on the opposite side of the House.</P>

	<P>I did not check the record because I was not at the Deputy&rsquo;s parliamentary party meeting.  It sums up the thinking around public appointments.</P><Col N="117" />
        <P>I heard people say we should wait for the report on public service appointments to come out.  Let us not do that, let us make decisions for ourselves.  Why wait for a report on public service appointments?  Surely the Government has the confidence and ability to make decisions without waiting for yet another report.  We are elected to make decisions and have the power to do so.  Let us use that power and, in some small way, give back politics to the people and take a step towards giving them confidence in the structures of the Oireachtas and the State bodies there to serve them.</P>
        <P>Many very important appointments will be made in the future, including appointments to National Asset Management Agency.  A chief executive officer to the Health Service Executive is due to be appointed and the F&Aacute;S board is to be restructured which is due to be discussed tomorrow.  They are very important positions and as we move from a period in which we have created cynicism and undermined confidence in politics and our State institutions, let us take this small step forward to try to revert to that position.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy Varadkar on bringing forward this Bill.  I hope we will get some support from the Government in the near future on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how many pools in which the Minister for Finance fishes but I am sure after recent weeks, he would prefer if the T&aacute;naiste kept all her comments to herself in that they seem to be endlessly unhelpful to him and the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>I would like to reflect on some of the points made by the many speakers who contributed to the debate, which was a very good one.  We do not often have good debates in this House but this was a very interesting one.  Deputy Frank Feighan suggested that all appointments should be advertised.  That is not in the Bill but is something with which I very much agree.  He also pointed out the extent to which Ministers will not answer parliamentary questions or say they are not responsible for the Health Service Executive or the National Roads Authority and yet they are the first to cut the ribbon to open a new hospital wing or a new motorway.  That shows the hypocrisy of the way Government works in this country, that when asked to assist somebody, Ministers are not responsible but if it comes to a photo shoot or taking credit for something, they are the first people lining up.</P>
        <P>Deputy Andrew Doyle spoke about the extent to which the change in the HSE has undermined services &mdash; first centralising, then decentralising and then centralising again.  Deputy David Stanton pointed out the extent to which parliamentary questions are not answered and when they are answered, it is by way of private correspondence between the agency and the Deputy and therefore, it does not go on the public record.  That, in itself, reduces accountability.  That is a point I had not considered but it is valid.</P>
        <P>Deputy James Bannon focused on the fact so much power is now vested in people who are not elected.  The Government&rsquo;s continuing decision to denude local government of power and to set up new agencies has very much continued that process.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh&rsquo;s, response.  He gave five reasons for not supporting this Bill.  The first was his concern about chief executive officers being subjected to vetting by Oireachtas committees as it cuts across normal corporate governance arguments for boards to appoint chief executive officers.  I take a very different view.  The successor to Professor Brendan Drumm should come before this House.  His appointment should be preliminary and we should interview him.  The same should apply to the new governor of the Central Bank, which is a good appointment, but it would be appropriate for him to meet and testify before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service prior to his appointment.  If the Government has such concern about that provision, there is no reason it cannot support the Bill and delete that section on Committee Stage.</P><Col N="118" />
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that he did not believe there was anything wrong with the current system.  He said Ministers can be questioned and held responsible to the Houses of Oireachtas to justify their appointments.  However, that is not the case.  They can only be held accountable after the fact when the appointment has already been made, and therein lies the problem.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and a number of other speakers, including Deputies Se&aacute;n Ardagh and Michael Ahern, suggested that candidates may be discouraged by the prospect of presenting their credentials in a public forum before a committee.  That is nonsense.  Those who want to be, or who believe they are competent to be, chairmen of State agencies should have no hesitation coming before an Oireachtas committee to make their case.  They are called to do so subsequent to their appointment so why should they not be called to do so prior to, or on, their appointment?</P>
        <P>We could learn much about the kind of people put in charge of State agencies if we did this.  When the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission, the chairman of the Labour Court and so on have appeared before committees, I have asked them if they would be prepared to do this.  They have said they would welcome it and that they would have no difficulty doing so.  They said they would feel they had more authority having received the approval of the Oireachtas and not only the Minister.  I do not know who is afraid.  Is it the potential candidates or, for some reason, Ministers who want to cover up some of the appointments they have made which are most inappropriate?</P>
        <P>Another argument the Minister of State made was that there would be a total overload for Oireachtas committees.  That is nonsense.  Most of what Oireachtas committees do is not relevant.  They should be given a more relevant role beyond select committees and this is one area where this should be done.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and other speakers pointed out that there have been some initiatives, including the Minister for Transport advertising positions on the Dublin Transport Authority and the moves by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in regard to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  They are only two agencies out of 1,000 and in those cases, it is only advertising the appointments.  In the case of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Minister intends to appoint half the members which is exactly the way it is done currently with no transparency whatsoever.  That is very little progress.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, of the other Government speakers, very few spoke substantially against the Bill.  Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke spoke largely in favour it.  She supported the provisions in it with the exception of the chief executive officer provision and spoke about her role as a Senator in proposing that the Seanad should have this sort of role.  Similarly, the principle was accepted by Deputies Se&aacute;n Ardagh and Michael Ahern, except for the chief executive officer section.</P>
        <P>What was most strange was the contribution of the Green Party.  In contrast to his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe said the Bill did not go far enough and that it is limited in its ambitions.  That is a totally contrary view to that of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He said it did not apply to enough bodies and nor did it provide for enough diversity.  Deputy Mary White claimed the Bill did not go far enough.  In contrast to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, she supported explicitly the principle of Oireachtas ratification of public appointments and that Oireachtas committees should review them.  She also said overseas appointments should be confirmed by the D&aacute;il, an approach which the Minister for Finance regards as unprecedented, except in the case of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Again, one wonders how long this coalition will last when the Government parties <Col N="119" />are united in opposition to a Bill but for divergent and contradictory reasons.  This is a bizarre Government.</P>
        <P>I thank the Labour Party, particularly Deputy Higgins, for his contribution.  I took on board his points about the flaws of corporate governance in, and the bad example set by, private sector boards.  We should not think that in trying to change how public sector boards are appointed what goes on in the private sector should be honoured or followed.</P>
        <P>Deputy Creighton summed up the essential thrust of the Bill.  Fine Gael believes public appointments should be public, public bodies should be accountable and government should be transparent.  Any Member who shares these views should have no hesitation in supporting this Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the unusual step of not putting my case myself but of reading a letter from a constituent which says everything.  I will not name the people involved, but I received the letter recently. It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I am writing to you on behalf of my husband and myself as I have also done in the past.  You are probably well aware of the frustration caused to couples like us by Minister Barry Andrews on the lack of information and length of time that lapses between any information he decides to share with us.  I would hope that you would sympathise and be willing to question Mr. Andrews on our behalf as to why he does not find it necessary to keep couples like ourselves or support groups informed of what is happening with the works being carried out to get a new bilateral agreement in place so Vietnam can once again open to people who just want to give loving and happy homes to children in orphanages in Vietnam.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">We will be 17 years married [this year] and the heartache we have experienced as a childless couple has been at times extremely difficult to deal with.  But when we started the road to adopt a child I really thought all the pain and anguish we experienced in the past was finally over.  When Vietnam closed I was not very worried as I believed the Minister would <Col N="121" />sort it quickly.  Never did I think that we would be here grasping at straws for a little bit of information about the ongoing hurdles over four months later.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Can you please, please ask Barry Andrews [I am asking him tonight] to give people an answer on whether Vietnamese officials are definitely coming to Ireland for talks at the end of September?  I would think that at this stage it is either confirmed or not.  Also how long more do people have to wait?  Should people forget about Vietnam as a choice of country or not?</P>
       <P LI="1" el="0">I do not think that the Government understands the difficult process we have to endure to get as far as the Adoption Board passing you as fit to adopt.  When you get that declaration it means everything to couples like myself and my husband.  But though this means we have the right to become a family to some child who needs us as much as we need them Barry Andrews has put a stop to this dream becoming a reality.  It is one thing to have miscarriage after miscarriage and also a stillborn baby, as in our case as these are as far as I am concerned an act of God but Barry Andrews has no right to play God with our lives.  We have proven we are good, honourable people and can give a child a loving, happy and secure family home.  We need answers as it is ridiculous how long this is taking without any real information being shared with us.  Please can you do your best to help us?  The not knowing is agonising and I await your response.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">All I can do is put that letter to the Minister of State tonight and ask him to give as much information as possible and, more important, hope to the people who are undergoing agony and anguish not knowing what is happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I emphasise the need for calm and sensitivity in this debate.  It is a very raw matter for many people and couples.  There is another element in that there are many post-adoptive families and I am acutely aware of the sensitivities in this regard.  </P>
        <P>We need to hear stories.  I have one from the mother of a lady in my constituency who is in this process and finds herself very much in limbo.  On public radio the mother said this should not be a political issue and should be dealt with in a cross-party way as much as possible.  Is there anything the Minister of State feels the Opposition side can do?  There is not much to be gained by shouting across the benches because of the sensitivity around the issue.  From speaking to colleagues about this I wonder if we can sit down calmly and rationally and deal with the future parents who find themselves in this limbo.  It is horrific, a horror story.  I had a connection with parents whose adoption process broke down some years ago.  It is likened to a form of bereavement.</P>
        <P>We must be measured but bold in our ambition concerning what we can and should do.  There are legal parameters &mdash; and I know the Minister of State has a report sitting on his desk since August &mdash; and the legal issues will take time to resolve.  On this side of the bench, and including the former spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, who spoke to the Minister of State prior to this Adjournment motion, we have the legal expertise to find a solution to this.  I do not know how to go forward with this, either singularly or as a politician in Opposition.  The area is raw and emotional and is much too sensitive.  I cannot even begin to understand it.  All politicians can do at the moment is empathise but we must be bold, measured and deliberate in trying to put something together to bring these possible future parents out of limbo.</P>

	<P>I apologise to the House.  My voice has gone and my fellow Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, will speak for me.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="122" />
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of intercountry adoption and, in particular, the negotiation of a new bilateral agreement with Vietnam has been given considerable priority by Department officials over the past year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, has advised the House and parent and prospective adoptive parent representative groups on many occasions regarding the developments in those discussions.  He again emphasises that the Government&rsquo;s objective is to provide a regime in which the child is at the centre of the adoption process, whether it is an intercountry or domestic adoption, and that adoptions are effected in a manner which is legal, safe and secure.</P>
        <P>The most important development in achieving that objective is the development of an appropriate legislative regime which recognises the changing global situation regarding adoption over the past 20 years.  The Adoption Bill, which includes the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was effected in the best interests of the child.  A core principle of the Adoption Bill and the Hague Convention is that the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount.  The Hague Convention, which is given the force of law in this Bill, effectively puts in place an agreement between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.  It is to put in place safeguards that acceptable standards are being applied in other countries, over which we have no jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Over the course of the past six weeks, two significant reports have been received regarding child welfare, protection and adoption in Vietnam.  First, in August 2009, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, with technical assistance from UNICEF in Vietnam, published a report entitled &ldquo;Creating a protective environment for children in Viet Nam: an assessment of child protection laws and policies, especially children in special circumstances in Viet Nam&rdquo;. Some of the issues raised in this report had already been under consideration in ongoing deliberations of the drafting of a new bilateral agreement with the Vietnamese.  However, this report has highlighted significant policy and legal implications and warrants further deliberation.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Minister of State has received in draft form a report of an examination of intercountry adoption in Vietnam carried out by the International Social Services, ISS.  The report was commissioned by UNICEF in coordination with the Ministry of Justice of Vietnam.  It aims<i> </i>to identify and address problems in both domestic and Intercountry adoption processes with a view to assisting Vietnam in its preparations to ratify the Hague Convention.  This report is likely to give rise to further issues that will need to be considered.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State stresses that these two reports, both prepared in co-operation with the Vietnamese Government, and UNICEF, go to the heart of the matter regarding concerns about intercountry adoption in Vietnam.  He states that he would be failing in his duty to protect children if he did not acknowledge and consider the content of these reports extremely carefully before deciding on next steps.  In saying that, these reports also serve to highlight the commitment of the Vietnamese Government to ensuring that the adoption process in Vietnam is in line with the best international standards and its willingness to address issues at the core of that commitment.  The Minister of State is currently awaiting finalisation of the ISS report, which is expected in mid to late October.</P>
        <P>He is fully aware that those involved in the adoptive process are asking for a clear Government indication as to whether a new bilateral agreement will be concluded.  Furthermore, they wish to be informed about a time frame for likely next steps.  In meeting representative adoptive groups this afternoon, the Minister of State indicated that the Government must await receipt of the finalised ISS report before a decision can be made whether to continue with negotiations on a new bilateral agreement with Vietnam.</P><Col N="123" />
        <P>The draft ISS report addresses in some detail the concerns raised in the past regarding intercountry adoption from Vietnam.  Given the sensitivity of matters at hand and the gravity of the decisions to be made, the Minister of State believes it prudent to await the finalisation of the ISS report.  It is his view, however, that even if the decision is made to proceed with the negotiation of a new bilateral agreement, this process will take some time.  It is conceivable that because of the legal complexity involved in safeguarding against the concerns referred to in the reports this process could very well run in to the early part of next year.  It is important to be absolutely honest with prospective adoptive parents, many of whom are trying to plan their lives in the absence of definite timelines.</P>
        <P>This is an extremely sensitive matter and the Minister of State is aware of the likely concerns of the many Irish families who have already adopted children from Vietnam.  He consulted the Adoption Board which advised that all adoptions from Vietnam that have been registered on the register of foreign adoptions are safe and secure.  There should be no doubt about the status of adoptions that have already been effected from Vietnam.  These children have been adopted by loving families in Ireland and there should be no doubt concerning their status.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is acutely conscious of the concerns of prospective adoptive parents.  Over recent months he has regularly met individual prospective adoptive parents and representative groups.  He is deeply aware of the angst, frustration and emotion that prospective adoptive parents continue to experience at this time.  He has communicated at every opportunity updates on these matters and has committed to continuing this process.</P>
        <P>Regarding the processing of 20 applications, the Minister of State<b> </b>made a private visit to Vietnam in June to assess progress and support advancement of the discussions on a new bilateral agreement on adoption with Vietnam.  In the course of discussions held during this visit, the Vietnamese authorities, as a gesture of goodwill, agreed to process the 20 cases that were received by the Department of Adoption before 1 April 2009 but for which no referral had been made prior to 1 May 2009.  Several applications were already being processed under the transitional arrangements put in place by the Vietnamese side.  This request and the Vietnamese accession to it, was made having regard to the very advanced stage of the applications and the very small number of applications involved.  Further applications for adoption will not be considered by the Vietnamese side outside of a bilateral agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Adoption Board has considered the situation of these 20 applications at the request of the Minister of State.  The board and Deputy Andrews are satisfied there is no legal impediment in allowing these adoptions to proceed.  The board has advised that, as always, registration of these adoptions will have regard to the provisions of the Adoption Acts 1952 to 1998 and will also have specific regard to relevant issues raised above.  The need to ensure that appropriate arrangements to safeguard any adoptions are put in place is highlighted by the reports referred to.  The Adoption Board has advised the Minister of State of its decision to seek the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs in processing the 20 applications.  He considers this a prudent approach; staff of his office met with the Department of Foreign Affairs this evening with regard to these matters and he expects the processing of these 20 cases will be advanced shortly.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The granting of a declaration is not a bureaucratic process rather a quasi-judicial one which is a major step in the adoption procedure which is of significance not only to the applicants but to the child whom they will eventually adopt.  The issuing of declarations of eligibility and suitability is a matter for the Adoption Board which is an independent statutory body.  The Adoption Board must comply with the provisions set down in the Adoption Act 1991.  Applications for an extension to the validity of a declaration must be made in the first 12 month <Col N="124" />period of validity of the declaration.  The Adoption Board must also consider whether it is reasonable and proper to grant extensions for a further period.  The office of the Minister of State does not have any function in relation to the matter.  He has raised the matter with the Adoption Board and they have indicated that the board will be as sympathetic to such applicants as is possible within the legal framework.  The Minister of State is also aware that this process has its own implications regarding the role of the Health Service Executive and he will raise the matter directly with the HSE tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, for taking the Adjournment this evening as he has responsibility for housing and I ask him to convey our concerns to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, considering the importance of this issue.</P>
        <P>The Limerick regeneration plan will be nothing but a pipe dream if funding is not made available to commence the planning and design elements this year and to move the projects to construction next year.  It is critical that the Government shows its support for the plan by formally endorsing it at Cabinet and providing the necessary resources.</P>
        <P>This is a crucial time for Limerick regeneration.  Communities that saw very little evidence of Celtic tiger Ireland even before the bubble burst have invested their hopes as well as their time, energy and ideas into these plans.  It would be terrible to let those people down now.  They have had to put up with neglect and intimidation for long enough.  If there is any rowing back on expectations now, these communities will rightly conclude that no one in power really cares about them.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell and myself and other representatives of Limerick met with the regeneration agency during the summer.  The agency made it clear to us the importance of making progress at this time.  The first requirement is approximately &euro;1 million in order to commence the design and planning of a number of key projects, including sheltered housing for older people at each side of the city and small group housing schemes in other parts of the areas.  If design is not commenced in the next couple of months, the projects will be unduly delayed and the intention is to commence the design and planning and then proceed to construction next year.</P>
        <P>The second requirement is an allocation for 2010 which is at least as large as the nearly &euro;25 million provided for in 2009.  This will allow for construction to begin and for some progress to be made on the social and economic elements which in my view are equally important or perhaps more important than the physical element of the regeneration programme.</P>
        <P>Money spent on sporting facilities, environmental improvements, summer camps and youth activities, will make more of an impact, in my opinion, than the bricks and mortar elements.  Support for enterprise and the maintenance of jobs is obviously crucial at this stage.  Construction must begin.  What has happened with regard to houses so far has been nearly all negative from the point of view of people living in these areas.  People in communities such as Moyross, St. Mary&rsquo;s Park, Ballinacurra Weston and Southill have seen some of their best neighbours move out and their houses being boarded up.  This has allowed the criminal elements to hold sway even more.  This is worse than the intimidation many people experience.  It has left people living beside boarded up and derelict houses which attract dumping and sometimes rodents as well as causing dampness and a general feeling of being abandoned.  Anyone here in the House <Col N="125" />would understand that it is not a good experience to have empty houses right beside one or in the same block.</P>
        <P>I refer to one small estate in particular which I will not name because the residents have suffered enough.  It was ravaged by a very small group who felt they could do whatever they liked.  That estate was once one of the most sought-after areas on the housing list of Limerick City Council.  It is very sad to meet people who used to live in that estate or to walk around it today.  In my opinion it would be far worse to stop or slow down regeneration now than to never have initiated it.  I have talked to people living in those estates.  They regard themselves as living in a limbo land.  The community that was there is gradually being moved out to various places and the community of the future has not been put in place yet.  The people do not know what is happening and they want answers.</P>
        <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government during the summer and I received a reply when the D&aacute;il returned last week.  In his reply he stated he will be presenting the master plan with associated implementation plans to the Government this autumn and this is to be welcomed.  The Government must endorse the plan and give its full backing for the implementation of the plan.</P>
        <P>Most people I spoke to were surprised that this had not already been done.  There is a general impression in Limerick that the plan has already been fully endorsed by Government.  The people in those communities need that certainty and that commitment.</P>
        <P>I am looking for confirmation from the Minister of State that the proposals will go to Cabinet within the next month and that funding at least on a par with what was allocated this year will be forthcoming, as well as the &euro;1 million needed for design and planning for next year&rsquo;s projects.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to give these assurances this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan.  We need action on regeneration.  The project is in danger of losing credibility and of stalling.  People were unaware that this is a draft plan which has yet to receive formal Cabinet approval.  I want the Minister of State to give us an indication of the date when it will be approved at Cabinet.  I want an indication from him of when the &euro;1 million will be provided for the planning and design stage.  In the four regeneration areas of Moyross, St. Mary&rsquo;s Park, Southill and Ballinacurra Weston, houses have been knocked and people are waiting to see physical works taking place but they have not started.  They have been given no indication as to when these works will begin.  Their neighbours and friends have moved out so instead of the regeneration areas flourishing, they have been depopulated over a period of time, over the past 18 months.  This draft plan is in place since last October and it is critical that we are given an indication tonight in the House that there is Government commitment to the regeneration project in Limerick.  The only way we can have that is for formal Cabinet approval of the draft master plan.  Once this is put in place it is imperative that the &euro;1 million is provided for planning and design.  The project was well received by people in the regeneration areas and in the wider Limerick community but which has literally sat in limbo.  All we have seen is destruction of certain houses in the regeneration areas and nothing to replace them.  Apart from the fact that the project would improve the quality of life for people in the regeneration areas and restore credibility, it has an enormous job creation potential for the city of Limerick.  Many of the people in the regeneration areas have lost their jobs.  The jobs task force report chaired by Denis Brosnan has stated that there could be up to 3,000 people a year employed during the regeneration process.  It is critical that is put in place.  I would also like the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy <Col N="126" />Gormley, that it is critical that funding be provided in the forthcoming budget to allow projects, such as sheltered housing and group housing schemes, in the four regeneration areas.  </P>
        <P>The time for talking is over.  We hear repeatedly from various Ministers that the matter is being looked at.  People in Limerick were unaware that the plan has not yet been approved by the Cabinet.  This is not good enough. This is a question of political will.  Either the Government has the will to push forward regeneration in Limerick or it has not.  Without the facility to carry the project to the design stage, the Limerick regeneration project will stall.  This will not be the responsibility of the people of Limerick but of the Government.</P>
        <P>I have three questions for the Minister of State.  First, on what date will the draft master plan come before Cabinet for formal approval and be adopted as Government policy, showing true commitment by the Government?  Second, when will the &euro;1 million funding be provided to allow the planning and design stage to proceed?  Only then can the project deal with the local authorities with regard to planning and design.  People will then realise that the regeneration project is fully under way.  Third, there must be a Government commitment that funding, in excess of what was provided in the last year, will be provided in the forthcoming budget for regeneration in Limerick.  We are now approaching the construction phase in terms of housing in the regeneration project areas.</P>
        <P>People in the regeneration areas want to live in those areas.  They are entitled to do so and to have houses and health and education services of a good standard.  The Government sold them a pipe-dream amid fanfare but it has not backed it up with resources or commitment.  The regeneration project is still not formal Government policy.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to give good news to the people of the regeneration areas and to Limerick.  We want to see this plan adopted now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising this item as it affords me an opportunity once again to confirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the regeneration of the most disadvantaged areas of Limerick city, to the communities living there, and to the ongoing viability of the city as a gateway for the mid-west.  I also acknowledge the involvement of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, who met with me and with officials in July and again this week.</P>
        <P>Under our national housing policy statement, Delivering Homes: Sustaining Communities, we strive to create and support sustainable communities.  Our approach to regeneration is not just about investing in the built environment, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned, although this is undoubtedly an important element in the regeneration process.  Rather we take a holistic approach that seeks to address the underlying causes of such social, economic, and educational disadvantage by investing in social inclusion activities, providing educational opportunities and by ensuring strong links with the business community.  In short, by integrating these areas into the wider community and by offering all of the social supports necessary for the communities there, we hope to achieve stable, sustainable communities where previously there was only isolation, hardship and disadvantage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From the outset, my Department has recognised the Limerick Regeneration Agencies&rsquo;, LRA, sterling work in delivering two regeneration vision plans, developing a strong framework for inter-agency and community collaboration and providing the flexible LRA regeneration programme, which proposes a road map for a new Limerick over the next decade.  As is widely acknowledged, this programme will require significant investment of time and resources from <Col N="127" />public and private stakeholders in delivering the mixed use, mixed tenure sustainable communities envisaged over the period of implementation for the project.</P>
        <P>My Department is now finalising its consideration of the proposals in the regeneration programme with a view to its formal presentation to Government this autumn, with associated implementation plans.  Other Departments and State agencies, through their involvement on the boards of the agencies, have also been considering the LRA regeneration programme and further engagement in regard to social regeneration is taking place as part of a high level initiative with relevant Secretaries General and heads of key agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to funding in 2009, my Department is providing almost &euro;26 million to support regeneration activity for the Limerick regeneration areas.  An agreed 2009 joint works programme is underway through the agencies, Limerick City and County Councils and Clare County Council.  This funding includes the specific budget allocation of &euro;8.25 million to cover the agencies&rsquo; specific costs and projects.  The works programme supports the relocation programme for households within and outside the regeneration areas, both in terms of improving community stability and facilitating construction works, as well as proceeding with the extensive planned demolitions.  The investment in social inclusion initiatives in the areas has been significantly increased in 2009.  In addition, funding has been provided for the continuation of estate improvement works, including wide-scale clean-ups in the areas concerned and specific safety initiatives and community intervention projects.  A project team led by the agencies has been established to deliver detailed plans for two new sheltered housing projects in Moyross and Ballinacurra Weston.  Some &euro;1.5 million is set aside to meet these design costs and it is intended that priority projects in the Southill and St. Mary&rsquo;s Park areas will be added to the project team&rsquo;s remit.  On my visit to Limerick earlier this year, I sanctioned those two projects and they are now at design stage.</P>
        <P>Against that background, I can assure the House that significant funding for the regeneration will continue to be provided through my Department in 2010.  The priorities involved are due to be reviewed as part of the respective October housing action plan meetings between my Department, Limerick City and County Councils, Clare County Council and the Limerick Regeneration Agencies.  The funding allocations will be determined in light of these forthcoming meetings, wider Government decisions, the 2010 Estimates process and the level of support available from other key public and private stakeholders.</P>
        <P>With regard to previous investment, the House may wish to note that in addition to the &euro;26 million being provided this year, my Department also provided some &euro;30 million to support the regeneration programme over the two preceding years.  This funding was provided to both the Limerick Regeneration Agencies and Limerick City Council and has supported the establishment and operation of the Limerick Regeneration Agencies, the demolition of some 350 void properties, extensive estate clean-ups, CCTV camera installation, environmental works, support for the local communities through educational and social initiatives, investment in key community facilities like the Galvone youth centre and the development of the vision plans and masterplans.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, the broader economic and employment situation in Limerick and the mid-west region is under consideration in light of the interim report of the mid-west task force.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment published the report on 28 July 2009 and the Government is engaging in a cross-departmental consultation process to evaluate and consider the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, including those relating to the Limerick regeneration programme.</P><Col N="128" />
        <P Just="Left">I would also like to mention the involvement of other Departments, statutory agencies and key stakeholders in the regeneration process.  Joined-up approaches to regeneration are critical as we aim to achieve greater value for money and deliver more co-ordinated, coherent services for local communities in a period of more constrained public finances.  I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and I reiterate my and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the regeneration of Limerick city in 2009 and onwards.</P>

	<P>The total budget for Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance in 2009 will be &euro;696 million, representing at least 0.48% of GNP. Of this, &euro;571 million is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, through Irish Aid. </P>
        <P>Our aid programme provides assistance to over ninety developing countries, nine of which have been designated as Programme Countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance. These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Vietnam and Timor Leste.</P>
        <P>The aid programmes in eight of the Programme Countries are managed by Embassies. The programme in Timor Leste is managed by a representative office, and there is also an aid office in Sierra Leone. Funding for direct programme budgets for the nine Programme Countries will amount this year to &euro;198 million, with a further &euro;23.4 million for significant programmes in other developing countries, including Sierra Leone.</P>
        <P>In general, our offices in Programme Countries are staffed by one or two Irish diplomats, working with a maximum of three specialist technical staff from Ireland. In addition a small number of locally-recruited staff assist with office administration. Additional technical support is provided by contracted temporary staff, as required.</P>
        <P>The administration costs of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme are low by international standards, and we are recognised as playing a leading international role in making aid more effective. Appropriate management structures in our Programme Countries are an essential element in ensuring that our aid delivers results, and value for money, in partnership with local Governments and communities in some of the poorest countries in the world.</P><Col N="130" />
        <P>Staff numbers are kept under close review, in line with the level of resources devoted to our development programmes. In addition, the independent Evaluation and Audit unit within Irish Aid regularly examines the operation of programmes with a view to identifying improvements in implementation and maintaining high standards of accountability.</P>
        <P>In view of the Government&rsquo;s strong continuing commitment to our Programme Countries and the scale of the development programmes being managed by Ireland&rsquo;s missions in those countries, I believe that the staffing levels are appropriate in current circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 74 together. </P>
        <P>The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States.</P>
        <P>We have emphasised our strong support for the undocumented in all our engagements with the US Administration and Congress, including during meetings earlier this year with President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and key Congressional leaders.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, the Government has been actively pursuing a bilateral approach, aimed at facilitating greater legal migration between the two countries. The approach has had three core objectives: a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement (now operational); new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term E3 working visas; and a solution for our undocumented.</P>
        <P>While the inclusion of Ireland in an expanded version of the E3 programme would provide extensive new opportunities for Irish people to work in the United States and help ensure that a new generation of undocumented Irish does not develop, our friends on Capitol Hill have been clear that the status of the undocumented Irish cannot be addressed in isolation from other ethnic groups, including by way of an E3. Their advice is that the best prospect for a solution for the undocumented continues to lie with comprehensive immigration reform.</P>
        <P>In June, President Obama met with a range of key Congressional figures, including supporters and opponents of reform, to discuss this issue and identify how to begin fixing what he has described as a broken immigration system. His statement, following the meeting that his &lsquo;Administration is fully behind an effort to achieve comprehensive immigration reform&rsquo; was welcomed by the Taoiseach in a personal letter he sent to President Obama in July, which outlined the Government&rsquo;s strong support for the undocumented.</P>
        <P>As President Obama has noted, immigration remains &lsquo;a sensitive and politically volatile issue&rsquo; in the United States. Bi-partisan support is considered vital to the success of comprehensive reform and our friends on Capitol Hill have made it clear that progressing legislation will continue to present significant challenges. The challenges the Administration is experiencing <Col N="131" />in progressing its immediate legislative priority of healthcare reform may also delay action on comprehensive reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With the passing of Senator Edward Kennedy, Ireland and Irish-America have lost a great friend and leader. An embodiment of the Irish immigrant story, he was a champion of many causes, including, of course, comprehensive immigration reform. His strong support for the undocumented, his understanding of their plight, was unwavering. While the immediate prospects for immigration reform remain uncertain, the Government is determined to build on Senator Kennedy&rsquo;s legacy by working closely with our many friends in Congress to find a solution for our undocumented.</P>

	<P>I very much support the view that the international community must continue its engagement in Bosnia-Herzegovina and more generally do all possible to achieve lasting stability in the countries of the Western Balkans. </P>
        <P>In relation to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), which monitors the implementation of the Dayton Agreement, last met in Sarajevo on 29 and 30 June 2009.  The PIC&rsquo;s Steering Board noted with concern a deterioration in the country&rsquo;s political situation and concluded that the &ldquo;five plus two&rdquo; conditionality, which it had set down in February 2008, had not been fulfilled.</P>
        <P>It was accordingly not opportune to move, as previously planned, towards the closure of the Office of the High Representative and transfer to a reinforced EU Special Representative.  It was therefore decided that the Office of the High Representative should stay in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the Dayton accord.</P>
        <P>Since then, little progress has been made in the functioning of state institutions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular in the area of the division of state and defence property.  In an attempt to help to advance matters, the High Representative/EU Special Representative, Dr. Valentin Inzko, announced in August 2009 that he would assist with the preparation of an inventory of state property.  The next meeting of the Peace Implementation Council will take place on 18-19 November 2009 and will review and assess any progress on the outstanding issues.  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland, together with its EU colleagues and the UN, will continue to press for the achievement of the necessary conditions before any transition from the Office of the High Representative to a reinforced EU Special Representative occurs.</P>
        <P>There are at present two European Union missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Operation Althea with a military stabilisation role, and the police reform mission EUPM.  The EU Police Mission, established in 2003 to follow on from the UN&rsquo;s International Police Task Force, focuses on capacity-building and professionalising the local law enforcement authorities, in <Col N="132" />particular in relation to the fight against organised crime. Four members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently serve with EUPM.</P>
        <P>Operation Althea was launched in December 2004, with a Security Council mandate, to succeed the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR).  44 members of the Defence Forces serve with Althea.  In May 2009, the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed prospects for a possible evolution of Operation Althea in the event of the conditionality set for transfer of responsibility from the Office of the High Representative to a reinforced EU Special Representative being fulfilled.  The Council confirmed that it would keep the preparatory work for a possible evolution of Althea under regular review, so that a decision on the future of the operation could be taken once the necessary conditions had been met.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland would like to see ongoing support provided for the economic and political development of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 22, 23, 34, 39, 54, 58, 65 and 75 together. </P>
        <P>In 2008, Ireland spent &euro;920 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA).  This represented approximately 0.59% of our Gross National Product (GNP).</P>
        <P>For 2009 the total budget for ODA is expected to reach &euro;696 million.  Based on current projections this will represent at least 0.48% of Gross National Product (GNP).  This means that Ireland will remain one of the most generous donors in the world on a <i>per capita </i>basis.  This is an enormous achievement in the context of the current economic circumstances and one of which I believe we should all be justifiably proud.</P>
        <P>I have stated, on many occasions, that the Government very much regrets having to make the decision to reduce the 2009 development assistance budget.  However, it must be recognised that this necessary decision was taken in the context of the economic situation facing the country.  Its sole objective is to assist in stabilising the public finances.  We are all agreed this is a fundamental prerequisite for the resumption of economic growth, which is the only sustainable way Ireland can meet its future ODA commitments.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that the reduction in the ODA allocation for 2009 was significant.  However it follows a period of unprecedented growth.  The figures speak for themselves.  At the start of this decade, Ireland&rsquo;s ODA stood at &euro;254 million &mdash; by last year it had reached &euro;920 million, more than trebling in volume.  In the same period, our percentage share of GNP spent on development assistance increased from 0.30 % to 0.59% &mdash; effectively doubling.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, our international commitment to development assistance is measured as a percentage of GNP.  This is also the basis for comparison and ranking within the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donor group.  The only sustainable way we can have continued growth in our development assistance programme, and maintain our international ranking, is through returning to a path of economic growth.</P>
        <P>We recognise it will now be more difficult to achieve the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012.  Nonetheless we will continue to work towards that target, and will make a full assessment of our capacity to achieve it in the context of the preparation of the 2010 budget.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will appreciate, budget allocations for 2010 are a matter for the Minister for Finance.  In the current difficult fiscal environment there are many competing demands for scarce resources.  However, as stated in my previous reply, I can assure the House that I and my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will make the best possible case to protect the aid budget.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that Ireland is significantly ahead of all but a few EU member states in making progress towards achieving the broad EU 0.7% target in 2015.  Definitive figures on 2009 ODA flows are not yet available for the OECD DAC.  However as the global economic downturn has affected all EU member states, other donors are likely to face, to greater or lesser degrees, similar fiscal constraints as Ireland.  Given that ODA expenditure is measured in terms of a percentage of GNP, it is likely that many other donors will reduce their ODA volume allocations.  I am aware of the excellent record of Sweden, which currently holds the <Col N="134" />EU Presidency, in regard to ODA.  It is currently ranked in first place within the OECD DAC donors and spends almost 1% of its GNP on development assistance.</P>
        <P>While I am very much aware of the implications of the recent budgetary cuts for our own aid programme, increasing volumes is not the sole measure of a successful development assistance programme.  Spending aid effectively, while meeting the needs of the world&rsquo;s poorest, is an essential characteristic of a quality programme.  The OECD DAC peer review, has described Ireland as &ldquo;champion in making aid more effective&rdquo; and states that &ldquo;Irish Aid is a strong cutting edge development programme&rdquo;.  I will ensure that these high standards are maintained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Conflict Resolution Unit (CRU) was established within the Department in 2007 to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in conflict resolution internationally.  The work of the unit is intended to build on Ireland&rsquo;s tradition of UN peacekeeping, our commitment to overseas development aid, our experience of the peace process in Northern Ireland, and our commitment to international human rights and the rule of law.  It aims to draw from our own experience of peacemaking and peace-building and from the work of Irish Aid and the Anglo-Irish Division.  As part of its work programme the unit currently has two initiatives in the field, one in Timor-Leste and the other a cross-learning exercise with Liberia and Timor-Leste on how best to advance the role of women in conflict resolution and peace-building. </P>
        <P>As one of the most fragile of the nine Irish Aid programme countries, Timor-Leste was identified as an appropriate country for initial engagement.  The CRU engagement there is headed by Dame Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, our Special Envoy to Timor-Leste and on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.</P>
        <P>Our engagement in Timor-Leste, in close co-operation with Irish Aid&rsquo;s development programme there, is designed to address key issues directly related to the risk of renewed internal conflict.  Initiatives taken so far include support for an early warning and response system based in civil society, a programme on peace, remembrance and reconciliation, advice on security sector reform, and support for structured high level dialogue amongst rival leaders.</P>
        <P>The CRU is committed to sharing lessons learned from the Northern Ireland peace process with other regions that experience conflict and lesson sharing visits are a growing area of activity in the CRU work programme.</P>
        <P>In May, a programme was arranged for visiting Afghan Parliamentarians which examined the background to and approach of the Governments to resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland.  In the same spirit of lesson learning, last week at the invitation of my colleague, Minister Martin, a group of Nepalese politicians and senior civil servants, led by the Minister for Peace and Reconstruction, were in Ireland to also learn from the Northern Ireland peace process.  During their visit, the group also met with political and civil society leaders, North and South, that were involved in the peace process.</P>
        <P>As the Minister, Deputy Martin, announced on 9 September, a book has been commissioned to mark the tenth anniversary of the Patten Report on policing in Northern Ireland.  It is hoped that the publication will capture lessons from the Patten process which might be usefully shared with others.</P><Col N="135" />
        <P>As regards working with academic institutions, we have examined a number of models to see how best to make use of the wide range of relevant expertise across all existing institutions and how to encourage collaboration between them.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, is anxious to avoid the creation of unnecessarily elaborate structures.  In this respect he met on 16 July with representatives of the main academic institutions to announce a new academic research scheme for which a request for proposals will be made later this year.  A number of fourth level scholarships have also been awarded.  As the Deputy will appreciate, conflict resolution is complex and sensitive work and can only be carried out effectively in close co-ordination and partnership with other key agencies and governments.</P>

	<P>At present, 37 properties are owned by the State abroad for use as Chanceries and official Residences of Heads of Mission.  The estimated total valuation of all these properties is &euro;146 million.  However, I would caution that this estimate is subject to the price volatility of the current property market across the globe. </P>
        <P>In recent years, and with the support and encouragement of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Government has provided the Department of Foreign Affairs with some modest capital resources to purchase mission properties abroad where that option, rather than rental, made good business sense.  While current resource constraints preclude any further purchases in the near future, it would, in my view, be financially imprudent, not least in the current depressed market situation, to sell existing mission properties abroad and revert to a lease option which would be more costly over the longer term.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 25 together.</P>
        <P>Ms Sharon Commins, a Goal development worker, and her Ugandan colleague, Ms Hilda Kawuki, were abducted by a group of armed men in Darfur on Friday 3 July.  I can assure this House that, in the weeks since, the Irish Government has been making every possible effort to secure their release.</P>
        <P>A strong multi-disciplinary Irish team, led by the Department of Foreign Affairs, went to Sudan within 24 hours of the kidnapping.  Some members of team stayed in Khartoum while others went on for a period to the North Darfur regional centre of Al Fashir.  A team is still present in Khartoum.  Throughout the eleven weeks of the kidnap, the Irish Government has worked closely with the Sudanese Government.  The Sudanese Government has, in turn, been working through the local chiefs and other intermediaries to persuade the kidnappers to release the women.</P><Col N="136" />
        <P>The Department has also closely liaised with the Commins family here in Dublin and I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration for their endurance and strength during what I know has being a most difficult time for them.  We have remained in touch with Ms Kawuki&rsquo;s family in Kampala.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, visited Sudan on 6 and 7 September to discuss the situation with the Sudanese authorities.</P>
        <P>During the Minister&rsquo;s visit, he was briefed by the Irish emergency team in Khartoum and he also met with the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, Dr Gailani, who is co-ordinating the Sudanese efforts, the UN Deputy Special Representative, Ms Amira Haq, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, H.E. Mr. Deng, and the Presidential adviser on Darfur, Dr Ghazi.  The discussions were extremely useful and he impressed on them the importance of bringing about a peaceful and successful resolution of this appalling kidnapping.  The kidnapping targeted development workers whose sole objective was to assist the ordinary people of Darfur, who have suffered so much in the conflict there.</P>
        <P>In turn, the Minister was briefed on the ongoing efforts by the Sudanese authorities to release the hostages.  He was assured that both Sharon and Hilda are safe, are not being harmed in any way, and that every effort is being made at the moment to obtain their release.</P>

	<P>My Department has been engaged in monitoring and assessing the foreign policy commitments contained in the current programme for Government which runs from 2007 until 2012.  Significant resources within the Department have been directed towards achieving these commitments over the past two years. </P>
        <P>A significant number of foreign policy commitments have been delivered, or are close to being delivered, to date.  These include: the Cluster Munitions Convention, the enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s role in UN reform, the development of our rapid response humanitarian capacity and the improvement in the information available to the public about the European Union.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of commitments do not lend themselves to easy empirical measurement but are areas where work is ongoing.  These include work on foreign policy issues such as disarmament, the Middle-East and Burma, bodies of ongoing policy work which are a central part of the Department&rsquo;s core business.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputies to my written answer of 16 September 2009 on this subject:  &ldquo;The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) was ratified by Ireland on 8 December 1989.</P>
        <P>The Optional Protocol to this International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) will set up a mechanism that will make it possible for individuals or groups of individuals to submit a complaint to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in regard to violations of their economic, social and cultural rights by a State Party to that Protocol.

        <P>Following consideration by the UN Human Rights Council, the text of the Optional Protocol was presented to the UN General Assembly last year which adopted the text by consensus on 10 December 2008, the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

	<P>Supporting Irish communities overseas, and in particular the most vulnerable members of these communities, is an important priority for the Government. </P>
        <P>Over the past five years the Government has allocated more than &euro;60 million, under the Emigrant Support Programme, to support our communities abroad.</P>
        <P>The socially sensitive frontline services which this funding supports continue to make a substantive difference to the lives of vulnerable Irish emigrants, reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling access to local statutory entitlements.  In addition, the programme also supports a range of community and heritage projects, fostering a greater sense of Irish identity amongst our diaspora, and a smaller number of strategic capital projects, which are helping to ensure the long term future of Irish community organisations overseas.</P>
        <P>Despite the current challenging budgetary situation, support for emigrant services has this year been maintained at its record 2008 level of &euro;15.183 million.  This is a significant achievement in the current economic climate, one which underlines our strong commitment to our <Col N="139" />overseas communities.  The current allocation is some five times greater than the 2003 equivalent and represents a 15 fold increase on the 1997 figure.</P>
        <P>No decision has been taken on levels of emigrant services funding in 2010.  Given the challenging economic and budgetary situation, the Government is, of course, conscious of the need to ensure value for money is achieved across all areas of public spending.  Officials in my Department, and through our network of missions, work very closely with organisations in receipt of Emigrant Support Programme funding to support the delivery of essential services to our overseas communities.  I am very conscious of the significant efforts Irish community organisations are themselves making to strengthen and develop their capacity, ensuring they can respond effectively to the needs of the vulnerable Irish abroad.</P>
        <P>As I explained to delegates at the recent Global Irish Economic Forum, the Government is committed to shielding the most vulnerable members of our community, at home and overseas, from the effects of the current economic downturn.  In this context, I can assure the Deputy that, through the Emigrant Support Programme, we will continue to prioritise the funding of frontline services, and to work with community organisations overseas, to help ensure the welfare needs of our overseas communities are met.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether Ireland&rsquo;s influence in negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy will be increased by a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon treaty. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Successive Irish Governments have pursued a policy of proactive engagement with the European Union.  This approach has yielded excellent dividends for Ireland over the last three and a half decades.  Indeed, since 1973 we have received &euro;61 billion from the EU budget, while contributing just &euro;19.5 billion to that budget, a net benefit to Ireland of more than &euro;40 billion.  We continue to this day to be net recipients from the EU budget. </P>
        <P>Over the years, we have been active in developing coalitions with other member states around issues on which we have particular concerns, including fisheries and agriculture.  With regard to the future of the Common Fisheries Policy, a yes vote will, I believe, enable us to negotiate on behalf of the Irish fishing industry in the coming years from a position of strength.</P>
        <P>It is important to recall that Irish landings of fish have more than doubled since 1973 (from 85,700 tonnes in 1973 to 185,000 tonnes in 2007) and that the size of the Irish fishing fleet has increased from 1,800 boats in 1997 to more than 1,950 in 2008.  During this same period, the size of other fishing fleets across the EU shrank by 20%.  Between 2000 and 2006, the EU also provided direct assistance to the Irish fishing industry amounting to &euro;65.5 million.  A further &euro;42.5 million is being provided by the EU between 2007 and 2013.</P>
        <P>It is well understood that the evolution of the Common Fisheries Policy will be vital to the maintenance of sustainable livelihoods in coastal communities.  For that reason, it is incumbent on us now to do everything in our power to maintain our position as an influential EU member state with a capacity to shape future EU decisions in a direction favourable to our interests.  While the Lisbon Treaty will not significantly affect the operation of the common fisheries policy, it is my firm view that a yes vote on 2 October will enable us to exert maximum influence over the future evolution of this vital policy.</P>
        <P>In addition to negotiations on fisheries, several other major issues will come to a head in the coming period, including the future of the Common Agricultural Policy and the shape of the EU budget beyond 2013.  In this context, it is vital that we preserve our position at the heart <Col N="140" />of the EU from which we can secure optimal outcomes for Ireland.  A positive result on 2 October will be crucial in that regard.</P>

	<P>I am very concerned about the situation of Roma families in Kosovo and, in particular, continuing reports that residents of the camps around Mitrovica are exposed to high levels of lead contamination.  The Taoiseach raised the conditions of displaced Roma when he met with President Sejdiu and Prime Minister Thaci during his visit to Kosovo on 22 December 2008.  The Deputy will also be aware that the matter was the subject of an adjournment debate on 25 November 2008, when my colleague, Peter Power T.D. emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s support for all efforts to address the plight of the residents in the camps.</P>
        <P>Since then, at my request, officials have raised the issue on a number of occasions.  The Embassy in Budapest, which is accredited to Kosovo, has pursued the matter bilaterally with the authorities in Pristina.  In response to these representations, the Kosovar Government has said that it will make every effort to relocate the residents of the camps and establish arrangements for co-financing such a project.  Officials have also raised the issue, inter alia, at EU Working Group meetings on the Western Balkans and the International Steering Group on Kosovo.  We are also supporting the efforts of the European Liaison Office in Pristina, which is co-ordinating national and international stakeholders to secure a long-term sustainable solution to this and other difficulties facing the Roma community in Kosovo.</P>
        <P>Ireland has supported a broad range of projects targeted at assisting the Roma community in the Western Balkans region, including Kosovo.  For the period 2005-2009, Irish Aid has allocated &euro;850,000 towards development and educational projects with the Roma community in Kosovo.  In addition, Ireland has contributed &euro;200,000 to the World Bank&rsquo;s Roma Education Fund, which works in eleven countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Kosovo.  We will continue to pursue this matter with the responsible authorities and our EU partners with the aim of finding a sustainable solution to the plight of the residents of the camps.</P>

	<P>The situation in Sudan, in particular the resolution of the ongoing conflict in Darfur, progress in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the humanitarian consequences of the expulsion of thirteen international humanitarian agencies from the country, continue to be the focus of considerable international concern.  Recent months have seen considerable engagement on these issues by the United Nations, by Sudan&rsquo;s regional neighbours through the African Union, by the US Government and by the European Union. </P><Col N="141" />
        <P>The Government remains extremely concerned with the kidnapping of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kiwuki and we are making every possible effort to ensure their safe release.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Sudan on the 6th and 7th of September to discuss with the Sudanese authorities the efforts that are being made to ensure safe return of Sharon and that of her colleague to their families and to impress upon the Sudanese authorities the serious concern with which the Irish government views the situation.</P>
        <P>The persistence of the conflict in Darfur despite a number of ceasefires and peace agreements, coupled with the ongoing suffering of the people of the region, is a matter of grave concern.  International efforts to bring an end to the conflict are being led by the joint AU-UN chief mediator, Djibril Bassol&eacute;, whose work Ireland fully supports.  Progress in peace talks has been disappointingly slow.  The &ldquo;Agreement of Good Will and Confidence Building&rdquo; signed in Doha in February by the Sudanese Government and the JEM rebel group falls far short of a full peace deal.  The AU has established a High Level Panel on Darfur, under the chairmanship of former South African President Thabo Mbeki which has undertaken four missions to the region and is due to report by the end of this month.  EU Special Representative Torben Brylle has also been active in efforts to bring peace to the region, including current efforts to expand participation in the next round of talks, which will be convened in Doha on 28 September.  It is imperative and long overdue that all sides demonstrate the political will and commitment needed to resolve this long-running conflict.</P>
        <P>Ireland, in common with the international community, fully supports the complete implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which brought an end to the north-south conflict in Sudan.  There have been some positive developments in implementation in recent months, including the renewed engagement of the US and the ruling on the Abyei region in the Hague. The two unresolved issues that remain are the census and the referendum; however, there is cautious optimism that these issues can be resolved.  Ireland welcomes the recent progress on the CPA and urges the parties involved to fulfil their outstanding commitments.</P>
        <P>The decision by the ICC to issue an arrest warrant against President Bashir did initially heighten tensions in the region and the response of the Sudanese government in expelling 13 humanitarian NGOs, in March 2009, has made the humanitarian situation more precarious.  These NGOs accounted for over 40 per cent of all aid in Sudan and the insistence of the Sudanese government that UN agencies and Sudanese NGOs can take over the work done by those expelled, remains to be proven.</P>
        <P>Ireland has played an important part in the international response to the humanitarian situation in Sudan, providing over &euro;50 million in funding for work in Sudan, including Darfur, since 2006.  Along with our EU partners, we fully support the fundamental role played by the ICC in the promotion of international justice.  Continued progress towards the full implementation of the CPA is imperative to avoid the risk of a destabilizing Sudan and its impact on the wider region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 64 together. </P>
        <P>I am concerned about the situation in Afghanistan.  There has been a deterioration in the security environment marked in particular by frequent insurgent attacks throughout the country prior to and in the course of the elections held on 20 August and by the high number of casualties which these caused.  The number of abductions is reportedly also increasing.  The abduction and subsequent release on 9 September of the New York Times journalist, Stephen Farrell, an Irish citizen, brought this issue to public attention in recent days.  I would like to express my condolences to the families of Sultan Munadi and Corporal John Harrison who were killed in the operation which freed Mr. Farrell.</P>
        <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland remains committed to strengthening the rule of law and good governance in Afghanistan.  I urge the Government of Afghanistan to give the utmost priority to making tangible progress in these areas.  Building Afghan capacity and ownership within the police as well as within the civilian sectors is of the highest importance.  These are key issues which will need to be discussed at the Conference on Afghanistan which the international community proposes will be held after the inauguration of a new Afghan Government in order to review aspects of common objectives, strategies and cooperation.  For our part, we have allocated over &euro;21 million to Afghanistan in reconstruction and humanitarian assistance since 2005.  In addition, we continue to provide 7 members of the Defence Forces to serve in non-combat roles in Kabul with the international security force, ISAF; and we have begun support for the assignment of a small number of experts to serve with the EUPOL police mission.</P>
        <P>Although preliminary results have been announced for the Afghanistan Presidential Elections, some uncertainty remains at the present time regarding the outcome pending the completion of many recounts and audits called for by the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC).  I welcome the fact that it was possible to hold both elections in most parts of Afghanistan on 20 August, despite the very difficult security situation prevailing there.  I am concerned by reports and evidence of large-scale fraud having taken place in the Presidential elections in particular, with over 2,000 complaints received by the ECC, about one third of those classified as &lsquo;Category A&rsquo; claims, which could, if substantiated, affect the outcome of the election.</P>
        <P>It is vital that the election process and outcome are seen to be credible.  The low turn-out and the widespread allegations of fraud raise questions in this respect, but it is too early to pronounce definitively on this issue.  How the ECC and the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) handle the allegations of fraud, and are perceived to handle them, will be of great importance.  This process is currently underway, with some results annulled and some recounting and auditing taking place.</P>
        <P>In a statement on 10 September, the EU expressed concern at the allegations of fraud at a number of polling stations, noting that the ECC has been required to investigate these claims.  In this statement, the EU supported the important work of the ECC in terms of the credibility of the electoral process.  It underlined the need for the ECC&rsquo;s independence to be fully secured and for it to be given sufficient time to fulfil its mandate, in co-operation with the IEC.  The EU statement also expressed the hope that all authorities would refrain from pre-judging the result until it has been properly certified.  I fully endorse this statement.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, Irish Aid, is recognised internationally for the priority it attaches to the reduction of poverty and hunger in the least developed countries, with a strong focus on some of the poorest countries in Africa.  The programme provides assistance to over ninety developing countries.  Nine countries have been designated Programme Countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, based on partnership with Governments and communities.  These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Vietnam and Timor Leste. </P>
        <P>Following the difficult public expenditure decisions which the Government has had to take this year, the total budget for Official Development Assistance in 2009 will be &euro;696 million, which will represent at least 0.48% of GNP.  Of this, &euro;571 million is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the balance of &euro;125 million being accounted for by contributions to development by other Government Departments, and Ireland&rsquo;s allocation to the EU Development Cooperation Budget.  Funding for direct programme budgets for the nine Programme Countries will amount to &euro;198 million, with a further &euro;23.4 million for significant programmes in other countries, including South Africa and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  Additional assistance will be channelled to the Programme Countries through our funding for development NGOs.</P>
        <P>In deciding on the implementation of the budget reductions across the aid programme, priority was given to the need to protect funding to our Programme Countries, to the extent possible.  While adjustments have been made in all Programme Countries, we have ensured that the continuity of our programmes will be maintained.  In some cases, funding timeframes have been extended and disbursement rates modified, but the planned final outputs will be delivered, even if they have to be delayed somewhat.  There will be no reduction in the important technical expertise which Irish officials bring to their work with our partners.</P>
        <P>Decisions on individual programmes have been made in full consultation with the Embassies in our Programme Countries, which have maintained a strong dialogue throughout the process with Government and other local partners.  The Embassies provide regular assessments of the aid programme, with particular reference to the results which are being achieved.  In addition, the independent Evaluation and Audit unit within Irish Aid maintains a rigorous schedule of evaluations and audits in Programme Countries and across the aid programme, with a view to identifying improvements in programme implementation and maintaining high standards of accountability.  This is essential in order to ensure that funding is directed to those areas most in need, is used for the purposes intended and represents the best value for money.</P><Col N="144" />
        <P>The detailed assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme which was published by the OECD in April described Irish Aid as &ldquo;a strong, cutting edge development programme&rdquo; and stated that &ldquo;Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective&rdquo;. It praised the manner in which Ireland&rsquo;s aid is delivered in consultation with local Governments and communities and noted that &ldquo;its attention to local priorities is appreciated by the developing country partners with whom it works&rdquo;.  In the difficult economic environment in which we now have to work, we are determined to redouble our efforts to ensure that the aid programme delivers clear results for the lives of those most in need.</P>

	<P>The purpose of Foreign Service Allowances is to defray certain additional expenses which officers may experience as a consequence of serving abroad at an Irish diplomatic mission.  The extent to which officers require compensation through allowances is dependent on the cost of living differential between Dublin and the post abroad.  Allowances are reviewed regularly to take account of any changes in this respect. </P>
        <P>In 2002, following consultation between my Department, the Department of Finance and the relevant staff associations, a more transparent, accountable and vouched system of Foreign Service Allowances was introduced.  The main components of the Foreign Service Allowance system are: </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), which is designed to estimate and defray costs associated with a higher cost of living at the post abroad.  The Department uses the services of an independent firm to provide cost of living indices for the various locations required. COLA only becomes payable at posts with a higher cost of living index than Dublin.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Local Post Allowance (LPA), which assists mainly with the additional indirect costs arising from the representational role of officers.  This allowance which varies according to marital status and grade is payable at all locations abroad.  Officers serving in designated &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; posts may also be currently entitled to a hardship allowance as part of their LPA.  Where payable, this hardship element takes account of factors such as personal security and political tension, health, environmental factors, climate and isolation.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Children&rsquo;s Foreign Allowance (CFA), which compensates an officer for the additional costs incurred with regard to qualifying children.</P>

	<P>The Government has maintained close contact with the United Nations and UN Agencies in recent months.  Discussions have covered the major international issues, including the effect of the global economic crisis on developing countries and on budgets for development programmes.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs held wide-ranging discussions with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in New York on 8 May 2009.  I participated in the United Nations Conference on the World Economic and Financial Crisis and its impact on Development in New York from 24 to 26 June.  The UN Secretary General paid his first official visit to Ireland on 6-7 July, and held detailed discussions with both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </P>
        <P>During his visit, the Secretary General praised Ireland&rsquo;s consistently strong support for the United Nations.  He welcomed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Official Development Assistance, and Ireland&rsquo;s focus on the eradication of hunger and poverty in working to achieve the UN Millennium Goals.</P>
        <P>In these, and all of our discussions with the UN, the Government has set out the context and nature of the difficult decisions which have had to be taken this year to adjust the budget for the aid programme.  We have outlined the very rapid growth of the programme over the past decade, and pointed out that, after the adjustments, Ireland will spend &euro;696 million on ODA, representing at least 0.48% of GNP.</P>
        <P>In 2009, Ireland is expected to remain the sixth highest of all international aid donors in per capita terms.  We have emphasised that the decisions to reduce the budget have been taken solely in the context of the need to restore the public finances, and that the Government will resume the growth in the aid programme when economic circumstances allow.  The Government continues to work towards the achievement of the 0.7% target by 2012.  We have acknowledged that this will be more difficult to achieve than before the economic downturn, and have stated that a full assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to reach the target by 2012 will be carried out in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Budget.</P>
        <P>The adjustments to the budget for the aid programme in 2009 included a 50% reduction in our planned voluntary contributions to UN Agencies this year.  These budget reductions have been discussed in detail with the UN Agencies involved. Ireland will provide &euro;40.5 million to the UN Agencies for development activities this year.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether the ratification of the Lisbon treaty will improve the economic prospects here and for the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Government firmly believes that ratification of the Lisbon Treaty will significantly aid our economic recovery. By backing the Treaty on 2 October, we will be taking a decisive step in a positive direction for our economy. </P>
        <P>A positive result on 2 October will serve to dispel the uncertainties which have arisen since last year&rsquo;s referendum regarding Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union.  Such a result will reassure existing and potential foreign investors that we intend to remain fully engaged with the European Union, a position from which we have prospered over the last three and a half decades.  This will serve to protect existing jobs here and will maximise our capacity to win future investment projects for Ireland.  One of our prime attractions for foreign investors has been our free and unfettered access to a market of almost 500 million people.</P><Col N="146" />
        <P>The negative perception generated by a second No vote would, I believe, be deeply damaging to our reputation as an attractive investment location within the European Union.  A positive result next month will, as confidence in our economy and its future direction is bolstered, also serve to contribute to an easing in the premium which is currently being paid by Government for its borrowings.</P>
        <P>The stakes on 2 October, in terms of protecting and creating jobs and improving prospects for an early return to economic growth, could not be higher.  That is why all major business bodies, including IBEC, the Irish Exporters Association and the Small Firms Association, are urging a Yes vote.  It is why more than 90% of our economists and 86% of firms in Ireland who were consulted in a recent survey also want a Yes vote.  It is why our biggest trade union, SIPTU, and other major Irish unions have come out in favour of a Yes vote.  In short, in the view of those who best know our economy, those who drive our export effort and those who are responsible for bringing foreign investment into Ireland, a Yes vote will be good for jobs, good for investment, good for our capacity to borrow at competitive rates and good for our economic future.</P>
        <P>The Treaty will also, of course, be good for the economic prospects of the Union as a whole.  The Treaty states that &ldquo;the Union&rsquo;s aim will be to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples.&rdquo;  It will give us the tools we need to tackle the major economic challenges facing Europe in the years ahead.  These challenges include climate change and energy security, which are clearly beyond the capacity of any one Member State to tackle on its own.  The Treaty will also, of course, be good for the economic prospects of the Union as a whole.  The Treaty states that &ldquo;the Union&rsquo;s aim will be to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples.&rdquo;  It will give us the tools we need to tackle the major economic challenges facing Europe in the years ahead.  These challenges include climate change and energy security, which are clearly beyond the capacity of any one Member State to tackle on its own.  In a changing global situation with new economic powers on the rise, it is essential that Europeans be in a position to work together in an effective manner in pursuit of the values and interests we have in common.</P>

	<P>The United Nations Office of the Special Advisor on Africa convened an Expert Group Meeting on Natural Resources and Conflict in Africa in Cairo in June 2006.  A number of cross-cutting recommendations were made to seek to harness Africa&rsquo;s natural resources for peace and development.  The recommendations focused on the areas of knowledge generation, capacity-building, monitoring and enforcement and international cooperation, targeting the relevant actors at the local, national, sub-regional, regional and international levels. </P>
        <P>The UN continues to emphasise the importance of strengthening the capacity of the African Union and sub-regional organisations to address the causes of conflict in Africa while underlining the need to address the negative implication of the illegal exploitation of natural resources in all its aspects for peace, security and development.  In this respect, it welcomes the progress made to date in a number of areas, such as the progress made in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict and in post-conflict peace-building in a number of African countries.  Much more needs to be done in a number of other key areas and a recent resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in August (Resolution 63/304 of 11 August 2009) calls on the international community to continue to support such initiatives.</P><Col N="147" />
        <P>A further Expert Group Meeting is due to be held in Arusha, Tanzania, later this year to follow up on the issues and recommendations made at the 2006 Conference.  As with the Cairo Conference, this meeting will be attended by key experts in the area of resource-based conflict and will not be open to States.  The UN Secretary General is expected to carry out a comprehensive review of the outcome of the Experts meeting and present it at the 65th session of UNGA. Ireland will follow the events and outcomes of this conference with keen interest and support.</P>
        <P>Ireland is doing its part to assist the African people to achieve sustainable development through its bilateral assistance in Country Programmes and multilateral assistance to the UN, International and Regional partners through the Government&rsquo;s Overseas Development Aid programme.  Governance which is seen as key to the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa is also a key cross cutting theme in the Irish Aid programme.  In this respect, Ireland has welcomed and supported the establishment of the African Peer Review Mechanism under the auspices of the African Union&rsquo;s New Partnership for Africa&rsquo;s Development.  This locally owned initiative enables Africans to review the quality of good governance in their own countries and has the potential to make a very real contribution to improving good governance in Africa.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 45, 49 and 55 together.</P><Col N="148" />
        <P>The priority for the EU and the international community in the Middle East right now must be to continue to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to engage in a viable peace process with the vision of a settlement which will result in two sovereign States, Israel and Palestine, co-existing side by side in peace and security. The EU fully supports and is actively cooperating with the current US-led mediation efforts aimed at achieving a settlement freeze and resumption of negotiations.  I very much welcome President Obama&rsquo;s tripartite meeting with President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu held <i>en marge</i> of the UN General Assembly on 22 September aimed at giving renewed impetus to the current efforts to bring about a resumption of negotiations.  In addition, the EU is also considering what specific measures it can take to buttress and support a solution, when and if an agreement is finally reached.  I feel strongly that it is only through the establishment of a viable independent Palestinian State that the root causes of the conflict can be adequately addressed and I will ensure that the Government will contribute in whatever way it can to help achieve this goal.</P>
        <P>In relation to Israeli settlement expansion, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question 784 of 16 September, in which I addressed this issue in detail.  My views on this subject are well known: I consider continued Israeli settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be not only unlawful but an obstacle to peace and a serious impediment to the two-State solution.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the situation in Gaza remains very serious.  On the humanitarian level, insufficient amounts of aid are reaching the people of the territory.  Recent reports have painted a bleak picture of life in Gaza, with critical shortages of basic supplies and an increasing sense of despair amongst its people.  Israel also continues to largely refuse the entry of raw materials into Gaza, preventing any substantial progress being made towards the reconstruction that is so badly needed following the Israeli military offensive in December 2008 and January 2009.  This status quo is simply not sustainable and I am concerned about the potential for a further deterioration in the situation in Gaza and the spectre of a possible resumption of large scale violence.</P>
        <P>Fundamentally, the situation can only be reversed by an immediate and unconditional reopening of the territory&rsquo;s crossing points without restrictions on the normal movement of persons and goods.  This is a point that I and other EU colleagues have made repeatedly to the Israeli authorities.  As I have stated many times, we consider the continued blockade of Gaza by Israel to be both morally unacceptable and politically mistaken.  It serves not only to radicalise the people of the territory, but also inflames tensions across the Occupied Palestinian Territories and indeed the Arab world. It also undermines moderates on both sides while strengthening the hands of extremists.  The blockade of the territory has persisted for too long and must be brought to an end.  I will continue to press this point in any contacts I have with the Israeli authorities.  While the immediate focus on securing progress towards the resumption of peace negotiations is understandable and appropriate, we simply cannot afford to neglect the situation in Gaza and the effect it has on both its people and the wider peace process.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, Israel seems no closer to relaxing its strict blockade of Gaza now than it was a year ago.  The Israeli Government justifies this state of affairs with reference not merely to security concerns but also to the continued captivity in Gaza of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was kidnapped by Palestinian militants in June 2006.  I have repeatedly condemned the kidnapping of Corporal Shalit and I would once again appeal for his release and his return to his family in Israel.  I understand that efforts are currently ongoing behind the scenes, brokered by Egypt along with the assistance of others in the international community, to reach a deal between Israel and Hamas on a prisoner exchange that would allow for Corporal Shalit&rsquo;s over<Col N="149" />due release.  Ireland, together with the EU, firmly supports these efforts.  However, we need to be clear that his captivity is not the responsibility of the people of Gaza and it is completely unacceptable to punish them collectively on account of it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the EU-Israel Association Agreement, I am aware of the legal action that the Deputy refers to, namely proceedings initiated against the EU by the European Campaign to End the Siege of Gaza concerning the human rights provisions of the Agreement.  Officials from my Department have been monitoring this development closely.  I certainly believe that respect for human rights should be the bedrock for the EU&rsquo;s relations with Israel and indeed with the rest of our neighbours. Currently, the EU raises human rights concerns with Israel through a variety of channels, including diplomatic demarches on the ground and directly in meetings with Israeli interlocutors.  I am satisfied to note that agreement has been reached with Israel to replace the informal working group on human rights that operates under the EU-Israel Association Agreement with a fully-fledged subcommittee on human rights that will examine, inter alia, fundamental freedoms, the rights and protection of minorities and the fight against racism and xenophobia.  This strengthening of the human rights dialogue between the EU and Israel will provide the EU with an additional channel through which to convey our views to Israel on crucial human rights issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated on many occasions in this House, I am deeply concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka.  The immediate priority is still the welfare of the 280,000 or so Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) currently being held in IDP camps in the north of the country.  There is urgent need for unimpeded access by humanitarian agencies; for IDPs to be facilitated in returning to their homes as soon as possible; for missing IDPs to be accounted for and reunited with their families; for reconstruction to get underway; and for a process of dialogue and reconciliation to address the underlying causes of the conflict to be initiated. </P>
        <P>Responding to the serious humanitarian crisis in the affected areas, Irish Aid has provided funding of &euro;308,000 for emergency response through NGO partners, including emergency medical and nutrition support, the provision of shelter, and distribution of food and non-food items.  In addition, a member of Irish Aid&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps was deployed to Sri Lanka to assist in the emergency response effort of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).</P>
        <P>More broadly, I remain concerned also by continuing serious shortcomings with regard to freedom of expression in Sri Lanka. I was greatly taken aback by the severe sentence of 20 years hard labour in prison imposed by the Colombo High Court on journalist Mr J.S. Tissainayagam on 31 August.  Together with our partners in the EU, we have called on the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure that Mr Tissainayagam is afforded full access to medical care.  The expulsion of the UNICEF spokesperson, Mr James Elder, earlier this month appears to confirm a hardening attitude on the part of the Sri Lankan Government where criticism directed against it is concerned.</P>
        <P>On the political side, I believe that an independent review should consider the allegations of serious breaches of international humanitarian law in the course of the conflict, including intensive shelling by Government forces in areas in which significant numbers of civilians were trapped, the use of civilians as human shields by the LTTE and the forced conscription of civilians and children into LTTE units.</P><Col N="150" />
        <P>EU Foreign Ministers meeting on 18 May reiterated the need for all parties to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law and called for the alleged violations of these laws to be investigated through an independent inquiry.  Regrettably, although the EU succeeded in securing the convening of a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in Sri Lanka in Geneva on 26/27 May, at which Ireland made a strong statement on the need for an investigation, EU efforts to have a Resolution passed which would endorse a call for an inquiry into breaches of international law were unsuccessful.</P>
        <P>In this connection, the situation in Sri Lanka will be discussed at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting in October. We will discuss how best to engage the Government of Sri Lanka in a meaningful dialogue and how the EU can further support the humanitarian situation, reconstruction and the initiation of political dialogue and an inclusive process of political reconciliation with the Tamil minority.  This must be based on the principles of parity of esteem, consent, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the treatment, and safety, of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Iran; and the measures the international community are taking in order to help alleviate the mistreatment of persons suspected to be followers of this faith. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation of members of the minority Baha&rsquo;i faith in Iran has long been a matter of serious concern to the Government and to members of the Oireachtas.  In recent years, there has been a progressive increase in harassment of individual Baha&rsquo;is and there are worrying indications that these are part of a concerted effort by the Iranian authorities to destroy the Baha&rsquo;i faith and community as a whole.  The situation regarding the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i community has become of even greater concern in recent months, given the deterioration in human rights generally which has been evident since the disputed Presidential elections of 12 June. </P>
        <P>Particular concern has arisen in relation to a group of seven Baha&rsquo;i community leaders, five men and two women, who were detained, one in March 2008 and the others in May 2008, and held for well over a year without any formal charge. We understand that these seven people constitute an informal leadership group, attempting to maintain links among Baha&rsquo;is throughout Iran.  Their arrest gives rise to particular concern because of the fate of the previous Baha&rsquo;i leadership, who in 1980 in the early days of the Islamic Republic were arrested and never seen again.  The successor leadership were also arrested in 1981 and executed.</P>
        <P>The seven Baha&rsquo;i currently in custody have now been charged with a number of serious offences which attract the death penalty.  These include running an illegal organisation, anti-regime propaganda, insulting religious values, and espionage on behalf of Israel.  More recently, the espionage charge was dropped and a new charge of &ldquo;spreading corruption on earth&rdquo; was added.  Worryingly, this new charge also attracts the death penalty.</P>
        <P>Concerns are heightened by the fact that the lawyers for the accused have been unable to see them, have been denied access to the case files, and have themselves been subject to public criticism and harassment.  Family visits for the detainees have also been extremely restricted.  There seems very little prospect of even a semblance of a fair trial in these circumstances and the detainees have never been to court to hear the charges against them.  However, I understand that an October date has now been set for their trial.</P><Col N="151" />
        <P>I have repeatedly raised my concerns regarding the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i with members of the Iranian Government, including with Foreign Minister Mottaki at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2008.  In December 2008, I wrote to Foreign Minister Mottaki on human rights concerns in general, and raised the issue of the Baha&rsquo;i and the case of these seven representatives in particular. In my letter, I stated that: &ldquo;It is difficult in these circumstances to avoid the conclusion that the Government and authorities of Iran are actively trying to suppress a religious faith.  &ldquo; Foreign Minister Mottaki&rsquo;s reply earlier this year did not appear to go beyond previous statements by the Iranian authorities on human rights issues nor did it provide the necessary assurances in relation to the specific treatment of these seven detained Baha&rsquo;i.</P>
        <P>The European Union has repeatedly drawn attention to the oppression perpetrated against the Baha&rsquo;i faith and its members by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  In February this year, the EU issued a statement expressing its deep concern that, after being held for so long without due process, the Baha&rsquo;i leaders may not receive a fair trial.  The statement requested Iran to allow independent observation of the judicial proceedings and to reconsider the charges brought against these individuals.  A further EU Declaration on the increasing violation of religious freedom in Iran, issued on 25 May.  This reiterated concerns about the continued detention without trial of the seven Baha&rsquo;i leaders and called on the Iranian authorities to uphold their international legal undertakings to safeguard religious freedom and stop their persecution of legitimate religious activities.</P>
        <P>Officers of my Department have met with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland on a number of occasions this year to restate our strong concerns in relation to human rights in Iran and the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i.  Officials of my Department also meet regularly with senior representatives of the Baha&rsquo;i community here. The Government, both directly through our Embassy in Tehran and in cooperation with our EU partners, will continue to monitor this particular case closely and to bring our views to the attention of the Iranian authorities.  We will also be taking the opportunity to raise the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in the coming weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme announced in 2003 the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs has decentralised to Limerick. This Division operates externally under the name of Irish Aid. The Headquarters of Irish Aid is situated in the Department&rsquo;s Limerick building.</P>
        <P>120 staff are currently based in the new Headquarters building in Limerick.</P>
        <P>Of the 108 staff assigned to Irish Aid at the time decentralisation was announced, 17.5%, or 19 officials, were transferred to other areas of the Department as they did not wish to decentralise. It is in the nature of the work of the Department that staff transfer between Divisions at <Col N="152" />HQ, and indeed to Embassies abroad, on a regular basis. This routine rotation accounts for the balance of the staff transfers from Irish Aid.</P>
        <P>Following intensive discussions between the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs and the trade union IMPACT, an agreement was reached which resulted in a substantial number of experienced development specialists transferring to Limerick alongside their other Departmental colleagues. There was, therefore, minimal loss of aid policy expertise.</P>
        <P>Decentralisation was completed while the OECD was carrying out a major review of Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation policies and programmes. The report of the OECD peer review was published in April 2009. It represents the most authoritative and impartial international assessment which an aid programme can receive.</P>
        <P>The OECD reported that &ldquo;Irish Aid is a strong, cutting edge, development cooperation programme, fully integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs&rdquo;. It stated that &ldquo;Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective&rdquo;. The report of the peer review is a thorough and detailed document, providing a very positive assessment of the impact, effectiveness and focus of the aid programme.</P>
        <P>In arriving at its assessment of the programme, the OECD directly addressed the issue of decentralisation. It stated that &ldquo;the move of the headquarters from the capital poses challenges&rdquo;. The OECD concluded that &ldquo;the management of the Department of Foreign Affairs, including the Development Cooperation Division (Irish Aid) has worked hard to meet the challenges linked to the relocation. Overall, the full integration of the development programme into the mainstream of DFA is positive.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The principal cost associated with decentralisation is that of accommodation. This is a matter for the Office of Public Works. In addition to such property costs, and excluding staff costs, the Department of Foreign Affairs spent &euro;855,146 in the period from January 2004 to date on the completion of the decentralisation project. The largest elements in these costs related to the purchase of ICT equipment and office machinery, as well as additional telecommunications costs for the interim premises and new permanent Headquarters.</P>
        <P>In addition to the costs associated with the implementation of decentralisation, there are ongoing travel and subsistence costs associated with travel on business by officials between Limerick and Dublin. Since the beginning of the decentralisation programme, these have amounted to a total of &euro;416,024.</P>

	<P>As Minister of State for Overseas Development, I have been leading the implementation of the recommendations of the Hunger Task Force, which have been accepted by the Government. Earlier this year, I gave a commitment that hunger eradication would be a cornerstone of the Irish Aid programme and a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. This is in line with a key recommendation of the Task Force.</P>
        <P>Within Irish Aid, I have established a Hunger Unit. This Unit is working to integrate and support hunger and food security interventions across our development programme. For example, the Unit is working closely with our Embassy in Malawi where Irish Aid&rsquo;s programme there is being shaped by the Hunger Task Force report.</P>
        <P>In Uganda, we have a new focus on the most food-insecure populations of the country. In our other Programme Countries, we are developing strategies to continue and deepen the fight against hunger. We are also supporting world class pro-poor agricultural research, much of it based in Africa, to encourage the development of new and improved seed varieties and resilient food systems.</P>
        <P>I have accepted the recommendation that Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with hunger across the entire range of the ODA programmes and projects will reach 20 percent of our aid programme by 2012. We are working to reach this target. In addition to these activities I have established a specific budget line to support the implementation of the Hunger Task Force recommendations at a global level.</P>
        <P>At the inter-departmental level I have established the Hunger Task Team, which includes participation from my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Finance, to look at all of our international activities though a hunger lens.</P>
        <P>Ireland is positioned as a global advocate for the hungry poor and I have been very active in promoting this global advocacy role, a recommendation of the Hunger Task Force. I have had discussions with partner governments in the UK, Spain and the United States to identify opportunities for us to work together to make us more effective in addressing hunger and food insecurity.</P>
        <P>We are playing an active role in global fora where strategies to strengthen the international response to hunger are being developed and Ireland has been a lead funder of the United Nations High Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis. We will continue to work with our global partners to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal.</P>
        <P>In January a Special Envoy for Hunger, Mr. Kevin Farrell, formerly of the World Food Programme, was appointed in line with the recommendation of the Hunger Task Force. Since taking up his duties, the Special Envoy has been active in national and international fora. The Envoy is working closely with officials in the field and at HQ to determine how best to enhance even further our work on food security.</P><Col N="154" />
        <P>It is simply unacceptable that over a billion people are hungry in the world in this century. This is the reason that we established the Hunger Task Force in 2006, before the current food crisis hit the headlines. I am confident that we are making good progress following the completion of the work of the Hunger Task Force. I can assure Deputies that Ireland will continue to advocate internationally for the hungry poor, and to make a real difference on the ground.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 57 and 71 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland attaches considerable importance to the vital work of trade unionists in Colombia and condemns all acts or threats of violence against organisations and individuals working there. I deplore the fact that the numbers of those killed continues to rise year-on-year.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently raised the issue of anti trade union violence in the appropriate international fora. At the recent Universal Periodic Review of Colombia&rsquo;s implementation of its human rights commitments, held at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in December 2008, Ireland raised a number of issues relating to human rights in Colombia. Specifically, we called on the Colombian Government to implement its existing legislation in full, sanction unsubstantiated allegations against individual activists, strengthen the protection provided to individuals and investigate and punish crimes against them.</P>
        <P>The Government monitors the human rights situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. I have asked the Embassy to follow the issue closely. Issues regarding human rights, human rights abuses and the situation of trade unionists are raised on an ongoing basis with the Colombian authorities through the EU-Colombia dialogue on human rights and in regular contacts at political level.</P>
        <P>The EU recognises that the Colombian Government is trying to restore the authority of the State in the context of significant ongoing terrorist activity in the country. The 2007-2013 EU country strategy paper for Colombia recognises that the &ldquo;situation as regard human rights and democracy in Colombia is still critical&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the most vulnerable groups include indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians, as well as, inter alia, social leaders, trade-union leaders, journalists and human rights defenders&rdquo;.</P><Col N="155" />
        <P>EU relations with Colombia are also conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive Association Agreement between the EU and the Andean Community were formally launched in 2007. This Agreement will govern all facets of relations between the EU and these countries, including political dialogue, cooperation and trade. Due to differing levels of economic development within the Andean Community, free trade agreement negotiations are further advanced with Colombia and Peru within the overall framework of the Association Agreement.</P>
        <P>We fully recognise that there is no one solution for promoting peace in Colombia and that the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict have to be tackled simultaneously. Our approach and that of the European Union is to support the Colombian Government as it emerges from decades of terrorism, and to influence that process in a manner that also results in greater respect for human rights.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made a considerable financial contribution towards the Organization of American States&rsquo; monitoring of the disarmament, demobilization and rehabilitation process in Colombia as well as to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights&rsquo; monitoring of the human rights aspects of this process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 67 together. </P>
        <P>The eight Millennium Development Goals, adopted by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit in 2000, provide the framework for international economic and social development over fifteen years, to 2015. Most importantly, they represent a series of commitments on development by the international community, together with a set of specific targets against which to measure progress in the reduction of global poverty in all its forms.</P>
        <P>In July, the UN Secretary General launched the UN&rsquo;s annual report for 2009 on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. He warned that, despite significant achievements since 2000, progress has been too slow for the achievement in full of the Goals, and the global economic crisis is likely to have a particularly strong impact on the developing countries.</P>
        <P>The UN report highlights progress up to 2008, notably in the reduction of extreme poverty, increased enrolment in primary education, and a steady decline in deaths of children under five. It also provides initial data on the impact of the economic crisis over the past year, suggesting that poverty levels are increasing again, as is the prevalence of hunger in developing countries. It warns that progress may now be eroding in a range of areas, including child nutrition, maternal health and gender equality. The UN has concluded that the achievement of the Goals by 2015 remains within reach, but that accelerated progress must be achieved on provision of employment, on the war against hunger, on primary school enrolment, and on maternal mortality, sanitation, urban poverty and the preservation of natural resources.</P><Col N="156" />
        <P>When I addressed the UN conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis in New York in June, I stated that the scale and unpredictability of the global economic crisis is seriously undermining progress on the Millennium Development Goals. I emphasised that twin challenges of economic crisis and pressure on aid budgets internationally demand that we improve the effectiveness of our aid, and focus more clearly on key priorities.</P>
        <P>The core priority of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in the developing world. In response to the recommendations of the Government&rsquo;s Hunger Task Force, I have established the fight against global hunger as a cornerstone of the aid programme, and of our development policy. Ireland is taking a strong lead internationally on the hunger crisis, highlighting the over-riding importance of the first Millennium Development Goal, to halve the proportion of people living in poverty and hunger.</P>
        <P>It is expected that Ireland will again this year be the sixth most generous aid donor internationally, in per capita terms. We are playing an important role also in shaping the development policy of the European Union, which provides almost 60 per cent of global development assistance. In the current difficult economic environment, I believe it is essential that we work together with our partners in the developing world, and with the UN to give renewed impetus to the fight against global poverty and hunger in line with the Millennium Development Goals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is an international initiative to stem the flow of &ldquo;conflict diamonds&rdquo;. Conflict diamonds are rough diamonds used by rebel movements to finance wars against legitimate governments. The trade in these illicit diamonds has fuelled decades of devastating conflicts in countries such as Angola, Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone.</P>
        <P>The KPCS represents a cooperative effort by government, industry and civil society to impose extensive requirements on its members before allowing them to certify shipments of rough diamonds as &ldquo;conflict-free&rdquo;. The KPCS has 49 members, representing 75 countries. The EU is a member in its own right.</P>
        <P>The Kimberley Process has been confronted by many challenges since its launch in 2002. Concern persists that a number of uncooperative governments are undermining its effectiveness. There has been growing discontent among civil society regarding the credibility of the KPCS, focusing on the political will, particularly on the part of some African governments, to implement the commitments they have signed up to.</P>
        <P>The KPCS has established a Working Group on Monitoring (WGM) which monitors implementation at country level and operates a programme of review visits to producer countries. Currently the WGM is exploring strengthening KPCS vigilance through the development of a diamond footprint and enhancing regional cooperation. Ghana has led the way in both of these initiatives. However serious concern regarding the situation in Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire was highlighted in the UN Group of Experts mid-term report in April 2009. Concern also persists with respect <Col N="157" />to smuggling and fraud in the Mano River basin and in the DRC and to fraudulent certificates emanating from Namibia and Guinea.</P>
        <P>The country which arouses most concern is Zimbabwe, where there are widespread allegations of government-led human rights abuses in the Marange diamond field. As a result of these allegations, the KPCS sent an investigation team to Zimbabwe in late 2008. The findings of the team called on Zimbabwean officials, at a minimum, to suspend mining in the Marange field, demilitarize the operations and investigate the role of the military and the police. The team found substantial indications of non-compliance with the KPCS in a number of areas but primarily arising from the situation at Marange. While the interim report included a recommendation to suspend Zimbabwe from the KPCS, the report has not yet been finalised. Further steps, including meetings with the Zimbabwe government, are required before the suspension could be imposed by the KPCS.</P>
        <P>Increasing the effectiveness of the KPCS will require greater political commitment by governments in producer countries and enhanced regional cooperation. The KPCS has also called for greater efforts at government level to integrate the process into their customs and border controls.</P>
        <P>Signatories restated their commitment to the KPCS at a three-day inter-sessional meeting in Namibia in June, 2009. The next Plenary meeting of the KPCS will take place in Namibia in November 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU is closely following the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as that country recovers from the effects of the brutal 1996-2003 civil war. While much of the country has achieved a degree of stability, several localised conflicts have continued, most notably in the east of the country. These conflicts have in many cases been characterised by an appalling degree of brutality, with large-scale attacks on the civilian population and widespread sexual violence. It is a matter of particular concern that the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources is financing armed groups, thus fuelling these conflicts.</P>
        <P>The east of the DRC is particularly rich in natural resources, with sixty-four percent of the world&rsquo;s reserves of coltan. Rapidly increasing consumption levels in relation to electronic products in developed nations have sent coltan prices soaring in recent years. Coltan is used in cellular phones, computers, jet engines, missiles, ships, and weapons systems. Mining for coltan, therefore, is a highly profitable industry, especially when compared to other opportunities in a region racked by poverty and war. Workers are willing to compromise their human rights for the opportunity to earn a living wage in the mining camps where coltan is extracted.</P>
        <P>The EU has also actively supported efforts to address ongoing instability in the DRC. It fully backs the work of MONUC, the UN mission to the DRC. The EU&rsquo;s Special Representative for the Great Lakes region, Mr. Roeland van de Geer, leads the Union&rsquo;s efforts to promote the stabilisation of eastern DRC. In February 2009 the EU hosted a meeting to establish the Task Force on Illegal Exploitation and Trade of Natural Resources in the Great Lakes Region. <Col N="158" />This Task Force includes representatives and experts from MONUC, the US, the OECD, Canada, Norway and EU member states.</P>
        <P>It has held three meetings to date, with its next meeting scheduled to take place on 6 October in Brussels. To date, its work has focused on (i) encouraging the mapping of the mining areas controlled by the armed groups and the army, (ii) the publication of other relevant data concerning the supply chain of minerals in eastern DRC; (iii) building capacity in the DRC authorities in surveillance and control and (iv) improving due diligence in the DRC.</P>
        <P>The work of the Task Force underlines the EU&rsquo;s commitment to the Congolese people and the importance it attaches to ending the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources and to consolidating the rule of law, security and stability in the DRC.</P>

	<P>At the European Council held in Brussels on 18-19 June, we achieved all of our pre-summit goals, including the permanent retention of an EU Commissioner for Ireland, and a series of legally binding guarantees relating to taxation policy, the right to life, education and the family, and our traditional policy of military neutrality, as well as a solemn declaration on workers&rsquo; rights. This package, the content of which was shaped by the independent research commissioned by the Government in the wake of last year&rsquo;s referendum vote, and by the work of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, is the fruit of more than six months of intense negotiation with our European partners.</P>
        <P>On the basis of this new package, the Government agreed to propose the holding of a referendum so that the people can be asked to agree a set of amendments to the Constitution permitting the State to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon.</P>
        <P>In preparation for the referendum, work has been undertaken on two fronts: legislation and information.</P>
        <P>The wording for next month&rsquo;s referendum is contained in the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009, which was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 July. On the same date, the Houses agreed a Statement for the Information <Col N="159" />of Voters, which includes the wording of the amendment and explains its content. This Statement will be sent to each voter in advance of the referendum and will be available in polling stations on the day of the vote, Friday the 2nd of October.</P>
        <P>In the event of a Yes vote, it is anticipated that further legislation would be required in order to amend the European Communities Acts 1972 to 2007 and the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002.</P>
        <P>The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 was introduced in the House on 6 September.  If there is a Yes vote, it is intended to enact this Bill, which has two main purposes: to enhance Oireachtas control of the State&rsquo;s participation in EDA projects and programmes, and to make any participation by the State in Permanent Structured Co-operation under the Treaty of Lisbon contingent on D&aacute;il approval.</P>
        <P>One of the clear lessons from last year&rsquo;s referendum is that the people wanted better, clearer information about what they were voting on. I have already mentioned that a Statement for the Information of Voters will be sent to every home ahead of referendum day.</P>
        <P>In addition, we have produced a variety of publications explaining the Treaty.  These include a postcard-sized explanation of the legal guarantees secured in June, a comprehensive White Paper, a 30-minute guide, and a leaflet which has been sent to every household in the country during the past week or so. As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; Communicating Europe Initiative, we have launched eumatters.ie, a website which provides factual information about our membership of the European Union.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs also maintains a clear, objective and frequently-updated website at www.lisbontreaty.ie . Staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs are available to answer Treaty-related queries on a low-call number, 1850 211 602. We have advertised these different sources of information nationally, and have noted a growing demand for this information as polling day approaches.</P>
        <P>A positive result on 2 October will represent an important step on the road to national economic recovery.</P>

	<P>The number of staff employed by my Department on 1 September 2009 is 1,575.</P>
        <P>This includes 320 permanent staff who are working in the Passport Offices in Ireland and 17 permanent staff in the Passport Office London. The small number of permanent staff in the Passport Office in London is supplemented by 26 Temporary Clerical Officers who, from 1 January 2009, are included in my Department&rsquo;s core numbers. The total figure of 1,575 also includes approximately 300 local staff currently employed at Missions abroad.</P>
        <P>The equivalent figure as of 1 January 2000 was 1,385. The 13.7% increase (190 staff) over the intervening period was focused on two main areas of business growth: the Passport Offices and Ireland&rsquo;s Development Aid Programme, Irish Aid.</P>
        <P>In the case of the Passport Office, a total of 120 additional staff were recruited since 2006 in response to significant annual increases in the demand for passports over recent years <Col N="160" />(approximately 50% since the beginning of the decade) and the introduction of the new E-passport, featuring a biometric chip. This increase in the permanent staff enabled the Passport Office to maintain a high level of customer service while also significantly reducing the number of temporary clerical staff engaged in the lead up to, and during, the busy summer period, as well as its reliance on overtime during this peak season. In the case of the Passport Office, the cost of additional staff should be offset against the significant increase in revenue from passport receipts.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of additional staff for Irish Aid was directly related to the rapid expansion in the scale and scope of the development assistance programme which has seen the aid budget increase from &euro;255 million in 2000 to &euro;696 million in 2009   These staff increases fall significantly short of levels recommended in a number of independent reports on Irish Aid.</P>

	<P>Ireland and its EU partners continue to have concerns about human rights issues in Pakistan, including instances of intolerance towards the Ahmadiyya community there. Promoting religious tolerance remains a key EU objective in relation to Pakistan. We have urged the Government of Pakistan to make every effort to promote effectively the rights of minorities and to improve their current conditions. EU Council Conclusions on 28 April and 8 December 2008 reaffirmed the importance of human rights in Pakistan as a central priority for the EU.</P>
        <P>Human rights issues are raised with Pakistan both bilaterally and at EU level. A demarche which was carried out in Islamabad by the EU Troika on 28 December 2008 as part of the EU&rsquo;s human rights dialogue with Pakistan highlighted, <i>inter alia</i>, the frequent reports of discrimination and violence against members of minority communities. The EU encouraged the Government of Pakistan to promote tolerance, to protect freedom of belief and freedom of expression effectively and to reform discriminatory legislation, in particular the blasphemy laws. In this context, the EU expressed its hope that the newly appointed Federal Minister for Minority Affairs would find opportunities and means to raise awareness about abuses against minorities and to increase their political representation at all levels.</P>
        <P>Human rights and minority issues were also discussed at the first EU-Pakistan Summit which was held in Brussels on 17 June last. The EU welcomed progress made by Pakistan in its transition to democratic civilian rule following the February 2008 parliamentary elections. It also recognised efforts being made by Pakistan towards the integration of women and minorities in social, economic and political structures, and it encouraged continued efforts in this regard. Both sides recognised the importance of the implementation in Pakistan of relevant international conventions in the human rights field.</P>
        <P>Combating religious intolerance is a traditional priority for Ireland in its international human rights advocacy. Ireland has actively supported resolutions on the elimination of religious intolerance at the UN Human Rights Council and at the UN General Assembly, most recently co-<Col N="161" />sponsoring a resolution on the topic of discrimination based on religion or belief which was adopted at the tenth session of the UN Human Rights Council in March of this year.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on consultancy expenditure. The Department commissions consultancies only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme), where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.</P>

        <QRef>[31680/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has a network of 75 resident diplomatic and consular Missions abroad, as well as the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Secretariat in Belfast and the North-South Ministerial Council Joint Secretariat in Armagh.</P>
        <P>The Irish diplomatic network provides essential consular services, diplomatic representation and commercial services overseas. A number of missions also play a key role in the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme. Our network is modest in scale when compared to other equivalent European States; three quarters of our missions consist of only two or three diplomatic officers.</P>
        <P>In light of the current challenges in the public finances, the Government is examining all areas of expenditure to identify where savings can be made, while minimising the impact on front-line services provided to the public. The decision to close the Consulate General in Cardiff was recently taken in the context of current budgetary constraints and to enable a redeployment of limited resources to maximise potential returns to the State. No further decisions on the closure of specific Embassies have been made to date.</P><Col N="162" />
        <P>The opening and closing of missions abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis, these decisions can, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, only be undertaken having regard to clear national priorities and available resources. For example, any decision to open a new Mission overseas must be on the basis of an anticipated significant return for the State. The United Arab Emirates has been identified as a country where increased diplomatic representation would offer significant potential economic value to Ireland. Accordingly, and in order to take advantage of this potential, the Government decided to establish an Embassy in Abu Dhabi, which will open this Autumn.</P>
        <P>The report from the Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure Programmes made some recommendations relating to my Department, including the reduction in the size of our diplomatic network. However, it did not specify particular missions for possible closure but rather gave a proposed saving of &euro;14 million which the Special Group believe could be achieved through the closure of 20 missions. These recommendations, along with all the recommendations set out by the Special Group, will be considered by Government as part of the Estimates process.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, a consistent theme from invitees to the Global Economic Forum which took place at Farmleigh, last weekend, was the need for Ireland to expand, rather than contract its network of Embassies and Consulates.  Full account will need to be taken, therefore, of both the operational and reputational costs and the potential financial savings of Embassy closures.  I can assure the Deputy that my objective, to the greatest extent possible and within the limits of available resources, is to maintain the capability of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network overseas in order to promote our key objectives abroad, particularly support for our economic recovery.</P>

        <Quest> the position, one year after the conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation, as it pertains between these two nations; and the European Union&rsquo;s role in seeking to foster peace in the area. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31750/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the already difficult relationship between Georgia and the Russian Federation was further exacerbated by the violent conflict which broke out on 7-8 August 2008 and by the decision of the Russian Federation to recognise the break-away regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.</P>
        <P>The efforts of the international community have helped return some stability to the region, and work is continuing with a view to achieving a sustainable resolution. However, the situation remains tense.  On 30 April 2009, agreements were signed between the Russian Federation and South Ossetia and Abkhazia allowing Russian border guards to be stationed along the break-away regions&rsquo; administrative boundaries. Ireland supported the EU Presidency statement noting that the agreements were in contravention of the Medvedev-Sarkozy six point plan of 12 August 2008. The statement also reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia. Tension has also been caused by vessels attempting to access Abkhazia directly via the Black Sea.</P>
        <P>Meetings under the Geneva Talks Process, established in the Medvedev-Sarkozy six-point agreement and co-chaired by the UN, the EU and the OSCE, have taken place on seven occasions. The most recent meeting took place on 17 September 2009 during which the Co-Chairs reviewed the general security situation and the work of the joint incident prevention <Col N="163" />and response mechanisms. Participants at the talks welcomed the regular convening of these mechanisms which provide an important contribution towards improving stability and security on the ground by providing a means for all sides to respond quickly to security incidents. Participants also discussed a non-paper prepared by the Co-Chairs relating to the non-use of force and international security arrangements. In addition, discussions took place on issues such as the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</P>
        <P>Ireland strongly supports the Geneva Talks Process, which remains an essential element in facilitating dialogue between the Russian Federation and Georgia. I am pleased that the recent talks in Geneva were conducted in a positive atmosphere and welcome the continued operation of the incident prevention and response mechanisms, which provide an important forum for addressing security-related matters and preventive measures. I also welcome the continued focus on humanitarian issues at the talks. The next meeting is scheduled for 11 November 2009.</P>
        <P>I regret that it did not prove possible to reach agreement on extending the mandates for the UN and OSCE missions to Georgia. However, the EU Monitoring Mission, which was deployed on 1 October 2008 in accordance with the arrangements set out in the agreement negotiated by the then EU Presidency, continues to play a vital role in monitoring the situation on the ground. Ireland has contributed four personnel to the EU Monitoring Mission. In addition, EU member states, including Ireland, have provided vital humanitarian assistance to those affected by the fighting.</P>
        <P>An EU-backed independent international inquiry into the conflict in Georgia was launched in December 2008 under the leadership of Heidi Tagliavini, a Swiss former UN special representative to Georgia, and is tasked to look into the origins and unfolding of the conflict in Georgia. It is expected that the inquiry will issue a report later this year.</P>
        <P>On the 9 September a Georgian resolution concerning the issue of internally displaced persons was approved by the UN General Assembly by 48 votes to 19, with 78 abstentions. Ireland, together with the vast majority of EU member states, supported the resolution.  Ireland, together with its EU partners, supports the territorial integrity of Georgia and actively engages in efforts to find a lasting and peaceful resolution to this conflict.</P>

	<P>There are currently 6,867 apprentices registered with F&Aacute;S as being without employment.  The Department through the auspices of F&Aacute;S has responded to the increased level of redundant apprentices, especially in construction and related sectors, by facilitating the provision of over 4,000 training places.</P>
        <P>On a practical basis in addition to the immediate referral to F&Aacute;S of redundant apprentices through the social welfare system and the provision of appropriate guidance by F&Aacute;S in relation to preparation for a re-sit of any outstanding off-the-job modular assessments, the rules for off-<Col N="164" />the-job training have been amended by F&Aacute;S to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training at phases 2, 4 and 6. The number of redundant apprentices to be provided with off-the-job training in 2009 is estimated at c. 2,400 compared to 619 in 2008.</P>
        <P>Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses, which are trade-related to enhance their employable skills, and trade-related night courses available in F&Aacute;S Training Centres. F&Aacute;S will provide redundant apprentices with an opportunity to undertake phase 7 assessments where an on-the-job assessment opportunity is not currently available. F&Aacute;S will also be providing a facility for redundant apprentices who have reached the minimum qualifying standard in all phases 1-7 inclusive and who have not completed the minimum duration in employment as an apprentice to make an application for consideration under Recognition of Prior Learning for the Award of an Advanced Craft Certificate.</P>
        <P>My Department has introduced a temporary Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme to facilitate and support employers to provide on-the-job training in trades such as Brick &amp; Stone-laying, Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Plastering, Plumbing, Cabinet Making, Painting &amp; Decorating, Wood Machining and Electrical. This scheme assists an employer to take on a redundant apprentice when their own apprentice has been released to go on scheduled phase 4 or phase 6 off-the-job training in an Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of other organisations have assisted in providing measures aimed at assisting redundant workers. For example, L&eacute;argas is providing funding under the EU Leonardo Da Vinci vocational education and training programme to support the placement of almost 100 redundant apprentices with overseas employers to complete their phase 7 on-the-job training with assessments.</P>
        <P>ESB Networks has agreed a programme with F&Aacute;S to provide on-the-job training to eligible redundant electrical apprentices at phase 5 and phase 7. This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of eighteen months and will be funded by ESB Networks. There are currently 100 previously redundant electrical apprentices in employment with ESB Networks, 25 redundant electrical apprentices have completed their off-the-job training with assessments and a further 75 redundant electrical apprentices will be provided with an opportunity to complete their on-the-job training before the end of December 2009.</P>
        <P>In the higher education sector the Institutes of Technology are providing 700 places per annum on an 11-week certified training programme for those redundant apprentices in the construction and engineering areas who have completed their phase 4 training but where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available to them. This programme commenced in September 2009.</P>

        <Quest> the waiting time, in view of the Redundancy Payment Acts 1967 to 2003, for employers to receive the rebate for redundancies from her Department when her Department has to pay the employers 60% of the redundancies paid out; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The huge increase in the number of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department in the latter part of 2008, and to date in 2009 is unprecedented and is giving rise to delays in the processing of redundancy payments for individuals and companies.</P><Col N="165" />
        <P>Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  However, to put it in perspective, at end August 2009 the number of Redundancy claims paid by my Department relating to applications received in 2009 and earlier years, amounted to 26,405. This equates to payments of around &euro;179 million, both to employers and, in some cases, directly to employees.  This means the Department is issuing an average of around &euro;5 million per week in redundancy payments. The backlog of applications awaiting payment at end August stands at 43,250.  Of this total, an estimated 7,500 claims are the subject of query and requests for further information.</P>
        <P>Regarding rebate payments made to employers which amount to 60% of the amount paid out by employers, claims completed manually, submitted by post and received in January and claims submitted online (to www.entemp.ie) received in February are currently being processed. Claims submitted online because of their nature tend to have a faster processing time.  Regarding statutory lump sum payments to employees whose former employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation and are unable to pay the Department is currently processing claims received in June.</P>
        <P>Naturally, the T&aacute;naiste and I share concerns about current processing times which individuals and employers continue to experience and further initiatives, including that of additional resourcing measures, have been implemented in order to improve the turnaround in the processing of redundancy payments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for enforcement and investigation associated with the illicit trade in cigarettes, that, in addition to the wide range of enforcement measures undertaken at national level, they actively engage on an ongoing basis with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and also with other Customs Administrations in the Member States on the matter of cigarette smuggling. OLAF has set up a special task force titled Task Group Cigarettes for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Cooperation in this field includes: conducting and assisting in international investigations, often co-ordinated and supported by OLAF; undertaking controlled deliveries of commercial consignments of  illicit cigarettes detected, involving one or more Member State; participating in Joint Customs Operations with the Member States, co-ordinated by OLAF.</P>
        <P>In addition, Ireland, along with the other Member States, has ratified two international agreements concluded by OLAF with global cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, with a view to tackling the illicit trade in counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.</P>
        <P>As regards the estimated cost to the Exchequer mentioned, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to confirm the estimate of tax loss from cigarette smuggling in 2008 or to attempt to forecast the tax loss on cigarettes in 2009, as there is no reliable method for determining these figures. However, the figure mentioned of &euro;387m for 2008 is equivalent to approximately 20% of the market and Revenue would tentatively accept that this is a reasonable estimate of the amount of untaxed cigarettes consumed in Ireland during the year. It is however important to note that this estimate includes legal cross-border shopping purchases for personal consumption along with smuggled counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.</P>
        <P>In relation to the estimate for 2009, the only precise information that Revenue can confirm is the volume of cigarettes on which excise duty is charged and the number of cigarettes seized by customs. Cigarette clearances on payment of tax in the first eight-month period ending August 2009 are around 2,892.7m, down 10% on the same period in 2008. Some 60.7m cigarettes with a retail value of approximately &euro;25.6m were seized during the first eight months of 2009. This can be compared to a total number of around 135.2m cigarettes with an estimated average retail value of &euro;54.4m, seized in the twelve months of 2008.</P>

        <P>I indicated that while the banking system can be revived and serve the economy in a proper manner, the existing structures cannot remain the same. Already a number of banks are developing restructuring plans to meet EU requirements arising from recapitalisation. I am confident that this restructuring process will result in a reformed and reinvigorated banking system. While it is too early to define a definitive shape for this new banking system, it will be a focus of my work over the coming weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been brought to my attention that a number of private nursing homes have increased their fees following the introduction of the new system of registration and inspection. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) for inspecting and registering categories of centres, including nursing homes.  HIQA <Col N="170" />commenced the new system of registration and inspection on July 1st, 2009.  This has for the first time, introduced an independent system of inspection of both public and private nursing homes.  It is important that this new inspection regime is effective, robust, independent and properly resourced.</P>
        <P>In this regard the 2007 Act provides for the following fees: applications for registration or renewal of registration under Section 48 &mdash; this section states that the applicant shall include with the application the prescribed application fee; an annual fee payable by the registered provider under Section 99; and a fee for variation or removal of any conditions of the registration under Section 52 &mdash; a registered provider making an application under this section must include the fee with their application.</P>
        <P>Following analysis of the types of centres, numbers of places, etc. it was decided to set a registration fee of &euro;500, payable every 3 years by each nursing home together with an annual fee of &euro;190 per place in each registered centre.  It is estimated that the fee will represent an average weekly cost of &euro;3.73 per registered place.  The fees are payable by the registered provider (or in the case of applications for registration by the applicant, who for existing designated centres would normally be the registered provider).  These fees are not due or payable by the resident or their family.</P>
        <P>Article 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 states that:</P>
        <P el="5">(1) <Miles com="ix" />The registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of the admission of that resident to the designated centre.</P>
        <P el="5">(2) <Miles com="ix" />Such contract shall deal with the care and welfare of the resident in the designated centre and shall include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Therefore, only those fees, including any agreed increases, set out in the contract should be charged by the registered provider to the resident.</P>

	<P>Dementia is a group of symptoms characterized by impairment in a person&rsquo;s memory, intellect, judgement, language, insight and a deterioration in their social skills.</P>
        <P>Frontotemporal dementia (frontotemporal lobar degeneration) is an umbrella term for a diverse group of disorders that primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain &mdash; the areas generally associated with personality, behaviour and language.  Signs and symptoms vary, depending upon the portion of the brain affected.  Typically, during the initial stages of frontotemporal dementia, the person&rsquo;s memory is still intact but their personality and behaviour changes.  It is important to recognise that these symptoms have a physical cause, and cannot usually be controlled or contained by the person.</P>
        <P>There is no specific prevalence data on frontotemporal dementia in Ireland. However it is estimated that frontotemporal dementia constitutes less than 5% of the total cases of dementia (which in Ireland is estimated to be in the region of 40,000 people), with the highest prevalence in those of ages 40-70.</P>
        <P>In Ireland<b> </b>research has been conducted into this condition by Professor Tim Lynch of the Mater Hospital in collaboration with Dr. Robert Coen (neuropsychologist) from St. James Hospital.  The Health Research Board currently funds three research projects which are specifically focused on frontotemporal dementia.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that Government Policy is to support people including those suffering from all forms of dementia to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  Over the last three years over &euro;200 million in additional funding has been provided to develop community-services with particular emphasis in recent years given to developing home care packages, home-help services, meals-on-wheels and day/respite care across the country.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above the HSE undertook a needs assessment of bed capacity requirements in the areas of long-stay, dementia specific and respite care beds.  This assessment has informed proposals to expand capacity through the provision of 860 additional public beds under the Fast Track Bed Initiative over the period 2007-2010.  The latest information provided by HSE indicates that by the end of June 2009, 333 additional long-stay beds had been made available under this initiative.</P><Col N="173" />
        <P>The recently published <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland,</i> approved by the Minister for Health and Children include supplementary criteria for dementia specific residential care units which are to be read in conjunction with the general standards and apply to settings, or units within settings, exclusively for the needs of people with dementia.</P>
        <P>Preliminary work will be carried out by the Department of Health and Children shortly on scoping work for developing a Dementia Policy.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my detailed Reply to his earlier Parliamentary Question, No. 112 of Thursday, 2 July, 2009, in this matter.</P>
        <P>The latest position is that the person concerned is due to &lsquo;present&rsquo; again at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on Tuesday, 29 September 2009. He remains <Col N="178" />the subject of a valid Deportation Order and the enforcement of that Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) provides the Minister with powers to amend or revoke a Deportation Order. An application seeking to revoke a Deportation Order must set out new facts or circumstances which have arisen and which were not capable of being advanced at the time the decision to deport was made. My Department has no record of such an application having been made by, or on behalf of, the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 10 January 2006.  She gave birth to a child in the State in early 2006 and this child was included on her asylum application.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 7 January 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and her child.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against her and her child.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned, and her child, will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the third and fourth named persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in November 2006.

	<P>Ireland has a network of 75 resident diplomatic and consular Missions abroad, as well as the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Secretariat in Belfast and the North-South Ministerial Council Joint Secretariat in Armagh.  This diplomatic network consists of 58 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices. These Missions also have over 80 additional accreditations to other countries and organisations.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic missions and consular offices are dedicated to the pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s interests abroad and to enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international profile.  They are the external offices of the State, promoting Government policies and participating in the work of international organisations.  A number of missions also play a key role in the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme. Diplomatic and consular missions perform a range of representational, promotional and reporting functions.</P>
        <P>Missions accredited to multilateral organisations such as the United Nations present Ireland&rsquo;s views in negotiations and debate within these organisations. The role of the Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels is to represent the State in its interface with the EU institutions and in negotiations at official level in the Council of Ministers.  It also advises on negotiations at political level in the Council of Ministers and at the European Council.</P>
        <P>In addition, there are also 19 Honorary Consuls General and 66 Honorary Consuls who provide consular assistance and services to Irish citizens in 59 countries.</P>
        <P>I have set out below a full list of the locations and accreditations, both primary and secondary, of all Irish Embassies, Consulates and offices abroad, which will be entered into the record of the House.</P>

	<P>My Department, through the Consular Section in Dublin and our Embassy in Madrid, has been providing assist<Col N="184" />ance on the case of the person mentioned by him since her disappearance on 1st January 2008.  We have remained in regular contact with her family during this deeply worrying time for them.</P>
        <P>Extensive physical searches of the area where the person mentioned was last seen have been conducted by specialist teams from the Spanish police.  The Garda&iacute; have also assisted the Spanish police with their investigation. Unfortunately, I understand that no lead or breakthrough in the case has yet occurred.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, Brian Cowen T.D., and his predecessor have both met with the family in Dublin, as have I and senior officials from my Department.  The Taoiseach has also been in contact with Spanish Prime Minister Jos&eacute; Luis Rodr&iacute;quez Zapatero highlighting his interest in the case. Prime Minister Zapatero in turn expressed his concern, solidarity and the commitment of the Spanish authorities to advance the investigation into the person&rsquo;s whereabouts.</P>
        <P>Our Ambassador to Spain has met with high ranking political representatives in M&aacute;laga in relation to the case and senior police officer involved in the investigation on more than one occasion.  The Ambassador and Consul were accompanied to the meetings by family members of the person concerned.  The main purpose of the meetings was to obtain an updated account of the investigation and to keep the case alive in the public consciousness.</P>
        <P>Our Embassy has been in regular contact since with the senior police officer leading this investigation and will continue to do so. He and the Spanish authorities have undertaken to keep the Embassy informed of any developments, which they are treating as a missing persons case, and of course any information received will be passed on immediately to the family both in Spain and in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department, through the Consular Section and the Irish Embassy, will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> her plans to make it a condition of the rent supplement scheme that the property which is the subject of the supplementary payment has been registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board by the landlord. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). The Department is working with the PRTB to ensure that all tenancies where rent supplement is in payment are registered with the PRTB. To that end, the Department provides details of rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary.</P>
        <P>Landlords are legally obliged to register new tenancies with the PRTB within one month from the start date of a tenancy or at a later date on payment of an increased fee. For this reason, it is not practicable for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered with the PRTB before payment of rent supplement can be made. There are also instances where a rent supplemented tenancy need not be registered with the PRTB, for example, in the case of renting a room in a house or where a premises is owner occupied.</P>
        <P>Rent supplemented tenancies which are liable for registration with the PRTB, should be so registered. In that regard, the close working arrangements which the Department has with the PRTB should ensure that over time, all tenancies that come with the area of rent supplementation comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.</P>

        <Quest> the number of defined benefit pension schemes which currently fail the minimum funding standard; and the number of same which are below 25% of the standard, 50% of the standard and 75% of the standard. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Pensions Act 1990, defined benefit pension (DB) schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding, normally within three years. In certain circumstances the Pensions Board can allow additional time for proposals to restore full funding, with maximum periods of more than 10 years allowed as a temporary measure to ease the pressures being felt by many pension schemes.</P>
        <P>Under the Pensions Act and associated regulations, defined benefit schemes are required to assess once every year whether they meet the funding standard. Not all schemes have the same reporting date, but the Pensions Board in its Annual Report for 2008 estimated that approximately 90% of defined benefit schemes did not meet the funding standard. Since that date, as a result of improvements in investment markets, the solvency of most schemes has improved. However, the situation is still a cause for great concern, and I encourage scheme trustees and sponsoring employers to continue to work with the Pensions Board to address these issues as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>The Christmas Bonus payment was introduced in December, 1980, for social welfare pensioners and people who are in receipt of long term social welfare payments. There have been a number of developments in this scheme since its inception, including upwards and downwards adjustments in the level of the bonus payment.  Each year the Government makes a specific decision on the payment of the Christmas bonus having regard to the prevailing economic circumstances. A Temporary Provisions Statutory Instrument is made each year to give effect to the Christmas Bonus payment for that year only.</P>
        <P>This year it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure so as to restore order and stability to the public finances. In this context, the decision was made that the Christmas bonus would not be paid in 2009. The decision was announced in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget to give people advance notice so that they could adjust their finances accordingly. Since there is no legislative basis for continuing entitlement to the bonus it has not been necessary to seek legal advice on the matter.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P><Col N="190" />
        <P>Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;24 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than &euro;24 because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have, over and above the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance, towards their accommodation costs.</P>
        <P>A person participating on a community employment scheme can continue to receive rent supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, including income from a community employment scheme, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>

	<P>The agreement we hope to reach at Copenhagen will commit governments to both mitigating future climate change and adapting to the climate change already in the system.  Even if we reduce global emissions along an ambitious trajectory, we will still experience climate change impacts, which will have far reaching consequences for millions of people.

        <P>Globally this means ensuring that those poorer regions of the world, that contributed least to the problem but are most at risk from climate change, are provided with real financial help to adapt to climate change.  This will require new and additional financial flows from developed to developing countries.</P>

The financial resources that will be required to underpin a new global agreement is one of the fundamental pillars of the Action Plan.  The reference in paragraph 1(e)(i) to &lsquo;new and additional resources&rsquo; is part of that pillar and will be a key consideration in the finalising agreement on a global financial package.  My priority will be focused on ensuring that the decision on the overall financial package, including the new and additional resources are required, is ambitious and fair, and adequate to support an effective global response to climate change.</P>

	<P>In general, planning permission must be obtained for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  Under Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, certain classes of development carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service are, subject to specified conditions, exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.  These include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure;</P><Col N="192" />
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings (other than educational facilities, child care facilities or hospitals).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The above exemptions are conditional on, among other things, the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  In addition, in the case of the exemption for the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, there is a requirement on the statutory undertaker to notify the planning authority, in writing, of the proposed location of any such structure at least 4 weeks before the attachment of the antennae.</P>
        <P>My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures in 1996.  The guidelines are intended to facilitate planning authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the licensed providers of mobile telecommunications services and the public by providing guidance on dealing with these developments within the planning system.</P>
        <P>The guidelines set out a locational hierarchy in relation to the siting of radio masts and advise that free-standing masts should only be located within or in the immediate surrounds of smaller towns or villages as a last resort. If such a location should become necessary, the masts and antennae should be designed and adapted for the specific location. In the vicinity of larger towns and in city suburbs, operators should endeavour to locate in industrial estates or in industrially zoned land.   The guidelines further advise that, only as a last resort, and if all the alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools.  Under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, planning authorities are required to have regard to any Ministerial guidelines, in the performance of their functions.</P>

<P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />a new or extended area of 10 hectares or more, where the drainage of the bog land commenced prior to the coming into force of these Regulations.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Planning and Development Regulations, 2005 amended the 2001 Regulations so that the above-mentioned exemption no longer applies where the peat extraction is likely to have significant effects on the environment.  In such cases a planning application and an environmental impact statement will be required.</P>
        <P>The 2005 amendment also provided that where the peat extraction is on a European Site or a site prescribed under Article 12 of the 2001 Regulations, where such development is regulated by the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, the exemption no longer applies.</P>
        <P>Peat extraction in areas that have been afforded protection either as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) or Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) is subject to a separate control system under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.</P>
        <P>As part of the measures to address the Judgment in Case C-392/96, Ireland undertook an intensive programme to designate raised and blanket bog as NHAs.

	<P>Part X of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, deals with EIA. The corresponding secondary legislation is part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended. </P>
        <P>Pursuant to the provisions of section 176 of the Act and of Part 10 of the Regulations, an environmental impact statement (EIS) and an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is mandatory in respect of the projects specified in Schedule 5 to the Regulations where the thresholds specified are exceeded. The EIS must be submitted with the planning application and is subject to public consultation.</P>
        <P>Under Section 173 of the Act, a planning authority is required to have regard to the EIS in making its decision on an application for planning permission.</P>
        <P>In addition, pursuant to Article 103(1) of the Regulations, where a planning application is submitted in respect of sub-threshold development which is not accompanied by an EIS, the planning authority will require the application for planning permission to submit an EIS if it considers that the development would be likely to have significant effects on the environment.</P>
        <P>Further, where a planning application for sub-threshold development is not accompanied by an EIS and the development would be located on an ecologically sensitive area, Article 103(2) of the Regulations requires the planning authority to decide whether the development would or would not be likely to have significant effects on the environment of the site. In making that decision, the planning authority is required to have regard to criteria specified in Schedule 7 to the Regulations.</P>
        <P>In respect of applications for permission for the retention of unauthorised development, and in light of a ruling by the European Court of Justice in Case C215-06 made in July 2008, where such development should have been subject to mandatory EIA, planning authorities have been advised, through Circular Letter PD6/08 issued in October 2008, to return such applications as invalid, on the basis that there is no jurisdiction to grant retention planning permission in those circumstances.</P><Col N="195" />
        <P>In respect of applications for permission for the retention of unauthorised sub-threshold development, planning authorities were advised to proceed to decide whether the project should have been subject to EIA.

If, conversely, the planning authority decided that an EIA would have been required the Circular advised that the application be returned as invalid.</P>
        <P>I will bring forward Committee stage amendments to the Planning and Development Bill 2009 to give effect to the ECJ judgment. This will withdraw the possibility of making an application for retention permission in relation to a range of projects. The exact scope of the amendments remains to be finalised.</P>

        <Quest> if he has determined if statutory regulations in respect of the drilling of groundwater boreholes are necessary and a firm basis is required for the acquisition of borehole and other records from third parties, in view of the fact that a large number of boreholes are drilled every year here to provide water supplied for private and public water schemes with many of these becoming contaminated during the recent wet summers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Under Article 6 and Schedule 2, Part 1, Class 44, of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, drilling of a borehole for the purpose of providing a domestic water supply, or an approved group water supply scheme, is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission (subject to the exceptions set out in Article 9 of the Regulations).  Development by a local authority does not require planning permission, but drilling for water supplies is one of the categories of works prescribed under Article 80 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 as requiring a public consultation process and submission to the elected members for approval.  The interpretation of the Regulations is a matter for the planning authorities. The onus is on the developer and provider of on-site water supplies to ensure that the provision of such facilities complies, where appropriate, with all the relevant requirements in relation to planning permission.  Many planning authorities have developed groundwater and aquifer protection requirements as part of their statutory development plans. I am unaware of any formal system of recording of existing water bore-holes.</P>
        <P>Under the Water Framework Directive, Member States must have controls for significant surface water and groundwater abstractions and surface water impoundments.  My Department is considering the measures necessary to give effect to this requirement.</P><Col N="196" />
        <P>The European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 set down the parameters with which drinking water supplies should comply. Public drinking water supplies by local authorities are subject to the supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) while group water supplies are supervised by the local authorities. In addition, the owners of private water supplies that are supplying water as part of a public or commercial activity must also comply with the Regulations &mdash; the onus is on the owner to ensure that the supply is compliant.</P>

        <P>In April 2009, following a review of the Serviced Land Initiative in light of developments in the economy at large, and in the housing market in particular during 2008, and having regard to the oversupply of housing in some areas, my Department informed all local authorities that the Initiative was being discontinued.  All existing scheme approvals under the Initiative, for which contracts had not been signed or letters of intent had not issued, were withdrawn.</P>

	<P>The management and conservation of fish stocks is provided for under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  To ensure that the fishing pressure is not higher than the stocks can sustain and taking into account the scientific advice on fish stocks provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas are agreed by the EU Fisheries Council for fish stocks.  In addition, other conservation measures are set down under the CFP including limitation of fishing effort, technical measures (rules in relation to fishing gears and minimum landing sizes), and obligations to record and report catches and landings.</P>
        <P>Four offshore sites to protect cold water corals have already been designated at EU level as Marine Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and given legal effect in the EU TAC and quota Regulation so that bottom trawling and fishing with static gear by all fleets operated in Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are prohibited in the area.  A significant number of other sites have also been designated in inshore waters under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  DAFF is working with DEH&amp;LG, BIM, Marine Institute and stakeholders to provide appropriate management in these sites and to ensure their effective conservation.</P>

        <P>The Bill makes provision for the transfer of responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector. In the existing budgetary situation, resources are not currently available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in the immediate future.  However, it is not possible to say definitively at this point when new administrative arrangements can be put in <Col N="201" />place and I am anxious, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory footing, to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for the intervening period.</P>
        <P>Therefore, I am endeavouring to progress to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date, while further exploring the options for administrative streamlining in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government&rsquo;s overall programme of public service reform, Transforming Public Services.</P>
        <P>This will require further amendments to the Bill and my Department has been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in that regard.

It is not envisaged that the changes which I announced to the student grant application process for the 2010/11 academic year will impact directly on consideration of the matter.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if a 25% cut has taken place in the budget for academic personal assistants for students with disabilities in third level institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Support for full-time students with disabilities in third level institutions, including personal assistants, is provided under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD), which is one of a number of funding programmes which come under the Third Level Access Measure.  There has been no cut in the budget for the FSD.  A gross allocation of &euro;12.5m has been set aside by the Higher Education Authority for the FSD for the period 2009-10 (1 October 2009 to 30 September 2010).  This represents an increase on the gross outturn for the previous year (&euro;11.7m).</P>
        <P>However, it is likely that ongoing increases in the numbers of students applying for support under the FSD will impact on the level of allocation in individual cases.  In the circumstances, institutions have been given greater discretion and flexibility in ensuring that allocations are targeted to best meet the needs of the students involved.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments to the Student Support Bill in relation to legal and policy issues which have arisen since Second Stage are being advanced by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision for the transfer of responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector.  In the existing budgetary situation, resources are not currently available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in the immediate future.  However, it is not possible to say definitively at this point when new administrative arrangements can be put in place and I am anxious, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory footing, to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for the intervening period.  Therefore, I am endeavouring to progress to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date, while further exploring the options for administrative streamlining in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government&rsquo;s overall programme of public service reform, transforming public services.</P>
        <P>This will require further amendments to the Bill and my Department has been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in that regard.  Subject to any technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, I hope to be in a position to have these amendments advanced sufficiently in order to progress to Committee Stage in the autumn session.</P>

	<P>Apart from the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the Student Assistance Fund. The objective of the Fund, is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Information on the Fund is available from the Access Officer at the candidate&rsquo;s College.</P>

	<P>The postgraduate programme referred to by the Deputy is not one of the approved courses under the Labour Market Activisation initiative. </P>
        <P>Places under this initiative were awarded following a competitive Call for Proposals issued by the HEA to the publicly funded third level institutions in June to provide 1,000 part-time postgraduate places in areas identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs as being relevant to the skills needs of the enterprise sector and to the needs of the Smart Economy. Submissions for circa 3,000 places were received and the 1,000 available places were awarded following an evaluation of these proposals by an expert panel.</P>
        <P>The particular course referred to by the Deputy was not included in the proposals received from institutions. However, that course is supported under the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s Graduate Skills Conversion Programme and is available at a greatly reduced fee. The course is offered on both a full-time and part-time basis. Should the prospective student wish to pursue the course on a full-time basis, he may be eligible for support under this Department&rsquo;s Student Maintenance Grant Scheme. Provision of a grant is subject to a means test and other eligibility criteria.  Further information on how to apply for a student maintenance grant is available on the student finance website: www.studentfinance.ie</P>
