	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the fact that the staff of People With Disability in Ireland Limited, an NGO funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have been without pay for the past three weeks due to a dispute between the Minister and the CEO of that organisation.  This is causing great hardship to the staff and is impeding the good work the organisation does on behalf of disabled people.  The Minister should now put in place an interim arrangement to pay the salaries of the staff until the dispute is settled.  I now request an urgent debate to discuss this very serious matter.</P>

	<P>There are no proposals to be put to the House.  I call on Deputy Bruton.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday, a document, which had been refused consistently to the Leaders of the Opposition all day in this House, was leaked to the press.  This was at a time when Members were given the impression that the Oireachtas was being asked to play a role in framing a strategy to recover from the great economic problems we face.  Instead, Members were treated to a scoffing performance by the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  The manner in which this House is being treated does little to the credit of politics at this time of crisis.  In respect of this document, does the T&aacute;naiste still rule out any tax increases in 2009?  Is that the categoric position?  That was the position stated by the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not like to interrupt Deputy Bruton, unfortunately, as he well knows, this matter is not in order at present.  There are other ways of raising it.  The Order of Business is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a document&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The rules governing the Order of Business are framed by Members.  Were Members to change them it would be a different matter, but I must adhere to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Ceann Comhairle listen to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can of course.  However, I am simply stating that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle saw the aforementioned document, it contains commitments by the Government to increase taxes.  That constitutes a promise to introduce a new Finance Bill, does it not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If one is asking it that way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am asking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;one must ask whether something is promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>A document is available that apparently indicates a considerable likelihood of such increases, although, given the sort of weasel words used by the Government, one never can be sure.  I wish to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In truth, Deputy Bruton is improvising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I would like&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter that can be raised during the debate, which will be held today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it cannot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am perfectly entitled to ask whether a document that Members have seen but which has not been presented to the D&aacute;il, which indicates tax increases and does not rule them out in 2009, constitutes an indication there will or will not be additional tax increases in 2009.  That is a legitimate question.</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P>Further, in what format will Members have a debate about these decisions?  I note the social partners have not yet engaged on any of the decisions that are to be taken.  In what format will the Oireachtas have a debate about such decisions?  Will Members be presented with a list of choices, with cost implications and impacts on various people and parts of our community, from which they will make choices?  Will there be analysis or content behind a list of cuts?  Members have been treated like imbeciles in the past by the Government, which simply has listed a row of numbers without analysis.  This practice has got the Government into huge problems.  Will Members, for the first time, be provided next week with some analysis of what underpins the tax and expenditure changes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In short, does the framework document forum constitute promised business?  That is the issue.</P>

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is being totally unfair this morning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle should recall his speech last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not being unfair.  The problem is there are no Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Thursday mornings.  However, that is a problem for the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to facilitate the Ceann Comhairle, the Government is pleased there has been such engagement with the social partners.  In particular, it is now moving on to some highly intensive discussions and negotiations and it is the Government&rsquo;s clear intention that this engagement will have a fruitful outcome.  As for the House, as the Taoiseach noted yesterday, the Government will facilitate a debate on the matter in due course, once finality has been brought to the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>This House is perfectly entitled to ask whether legislation to introduce new taxes will or will not be introduced.  It has been indicated in the public arena that this now is on the agenda.  Members of this House need to know whether that is the case because this House is responsible for that decision.  The Ceann Comhairle should have had enough of this kind of attempt to try to convert Members into alleyways.  The T&aacute;naiste should be allowed to answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the T&aacute;naiste replies, I wish to raise a point of order with the Ceann Comhairle in respect of the protection of the rights of this House.  I refer to those Members who had the opportunity to speak on the business as agreed yesterday and those who remain to speak on the business as proposed today.  I suggest to the Ceann Comhairle, in his role as Ceann Comhairle and as the chair of the body that decides on the rules of the House, that the House must be protected.  How can a document be distributed to the media generally and yet not be distributed to elected Members of this House who remain to contribute on a debate?</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is treating the House with contempt.  While I do not wish to cut across the point being raised by Deputy Bruton, there is a point of order involved.  How can the T&aacute;naiste state there will be a time in the future for elected Deputies to ascertain what is proposed, having arranged for the document to be circulated to the media and people outside this House?  For example, there has not even been a statement that the document will be placed in the Oireachtas Library in order to facilitate those who will participate in the debate later today.  This is treating the House with contempt.  It is an issue of order and I ask the Ceann Comhairle to defend the rights of Members.</P>
        <P>I had an opportunity of exercising my rights, and speaking for ten minutes yesterday.  However, Members are entitled to make their speech taking account of what is available by way of actions by the Government and circulating a document to the media is an action of Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, I made repeated requests that this document would be made available to the Members of this House in advance of the commencement of the statements on the economy yesterday.  The finance spokespersons, those entrusted with the lead positions on these issues in each Opposition parties&rsquo; case, have now made their contributions in advance of any sight of the detail as presented.  Having had the document as presented in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, I cannot for the life of me understand why there was such resistance on the part of the Taoiseach in releasing this to the other parties in this House.  It just defies understanding and, with respect, it indicates a real contempt for other parties and views in this Chamber.  We all have repeatedly indicated a collective responsibility to assist Government to address the current difficulties and we cannot do it with this continual effort on the part of Government to blindfold and to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Government is engaged in a great deal of codology here about this document.  Everybody has the document.  It is in the newspapers.  We know what is in it.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach came in here yesterday and read into the record of the House approximately 60% of what is in the document anyway as his script to this House, but without telling the House that it was much of the text of what was being supplied to the social partners.</P>
        <P>The Government has a choice here and it needs to make up its mind.  On the one hand it comes in and states it wants the co-operation of the House and wants to act by consensus and <Col N="7"/>then it goes on with this kind of nonsensical game playing where it will not level with the House about what is being proposed and what is the status of the document.</P>
        <P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste the following because she has not yet answered the question.  Will the document be laid before the House?  That is only a formality now anyway but it is an important formality because it enables us to refer to the document in order here and would make the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s life much easier.  Second, when will it be laid before the House?</P>
        <P>I want to raise one or two other issues.  I have been asking the Taoiseach for the past two days to tell us what is the total cost to the Exchequer of the additional people who have become unemployed and the additional 100,000 who, the Taoiseach now acknowledges, will be unemployed by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>I accepted on Tuesday that the Taoiseach did not have the exact figures to hand when he was answering my question, but I assume the Government has calculated what this is and I am surprised that two days later I have not been provided with that information.  Will I be provided with that information, the total cost of the additional unemployment, between social welfare payments, secondary benefits and lost tax revenue?</P>
        <P>I also ask the T&aacute;naiste to clarify something the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, stated on radio this morning.  Up until now we had been led to believe, and the figures from the CSO etc. told us, that there were an additional 120,000 unemployed since this time last year.  The Minister stated on radio this morning that it was 140,000.  Perhaps that was a slip of the tongue, which I am prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">On promised legislation, is the T&aacute;naiste aware of the widespread discontent and public unease with sentencing in the criminal courts?  What legislation is promised regarding the establishment of a judicial council?  What legislation is promised with a view to the introduction of sentencing guidelines for judges in the criminal courts?</P>
        <P>Where is the legislation on victims&rsquo; rights and the position of the victim that was promised this time last year when the Government rejected a Fine Gael Bill, as published by Deputy Shatter and me, to enhance those rights?  Do the T&aacute;naiste and her colleagues not realise the considerable public unease and disquiet regarding inconsistencies in judicial sentencing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>It has been there for two years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only give the answer.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s clear intention to introduce victims&rsquo; rights legislation this session.</P>

	<P>One year later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from discussions in the House, I raised a number of matters at the Whips&rsquo; meeting last night.  Referring to them now is in order.  The first relates to management companies and the legislation promised thereon.  According to the Chief Whip, that legislation has been pushed back beyond First Stage.  Seemingly, a specialist group is considering the legislation.  Four years have passed since we first raised this issue, but we are no further along and no decision seems to have been made on whether the legislation should come in one part or three.  I would like clarity from the T&aacute;naiste in this regard, if the Government has any. <Col N="10"/> In every urban and suburban constituency, people are being adversely affected every day of the week and severely exploited because the legislation has not been changed.</P>
        <P>The second matter relates to D&aacute;il reform.  Given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply yesterday morning, the Ceann Comhairle will realise that the Government has given him and the three Whips the wet back of its hand in respect of our proposals, calling them &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo;.  Seemingly, the Government has appointed two people, the Chief Whip and the Green Party Whip, as a specialist group to consider D&aacute;il reform.  However, the statutory D&aacute;il reform committee of the House, which consists of all parties, is meant to address this issue.  I presume that the Fianna F&aacute;il proposals will also be thrown out.  There are also proposals from the Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in parties and the Independents.  The committee was at an advanced stage of putting the proposals together in a D&aacute;il reform package, but all of its work has apparently been thrown out.  The Chief Whip and the Green Party Whip will dictate the format to the rest of us.  Their intention is to steamroll it through the House, but we will resist them strongly.  Any such proposal will simply be in favour of the Government rather than the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Many people will be anxious for reform within the House.  The process has taken a considerable period.  All of the discussions will be brought to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, where a final decision that I cannot pre-empt will be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government involve the social partners?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed they might be.</P>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation from the Department of Health and Children, the Minister of which is seated beside the T&aacute;naiste, 11 Bills are listed, five of which use the wording &ldquo;not possible to indicate&rdquo; to detail when they will be published.  This is just short of 50%.  Only one is to be published this spring and three are expected to be published in 2009, two of which were expected to be published in the previous term.  Although the publication of another two Bills had been set at a specific date, it is now not possible to indicate when that will occur.  The legislative performance of the Department of Health and Children and its Minister is ragged.</P>
        <P>Why have the health (corporate bodies) Bill and the public health (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, both of which were listed in the previous autumn legislative programme as being expected for publication this year, been marked as &ldquo;not possible to indicate&rdquo; in addition to the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill that I raised with the Taoiseach yesterday?  The situation of the Department and promised legislation is serious and cannot be highlighted often enough if greater attention to it is to be encouraged.  Why is it no longer possible to indicate when important promised legislation will be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

        <P>In light of the fact that the T&aacute;naiste announced the farm building grants scheme, will she ensure that funding will be made available?</P>

	<P>The budget contained a proposal on merging the National Consumer Agency, NCA, and the Competition Authority, an important issue in the context of the euro-sterling price differential and shopping in the North versus the South.  I understand that such a merger would require legislation.  Has the legislation&rsquo;s preparation commenced and when is it likely to be before the House?</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste was quoted by newspapers to the effect that she was considering legislation in the context of North-South pricing issues.  Is this the case and, if so, would she care to tell the House what the legislation might be?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Preparations on legislation to amalgamate the NCA and the Competition Authority has commenced.  It will be introduced in conjunction with the amendments to the Competition Act arising from the review of that legislation.  I hope to finalise the Bill as quickly as possible.  As the Deputy can appreciate, other issues must be addressed, particularly those appertaining to people.  The Bill will not detract from the statutory role of either agency.</P>
        <P>Regarding the other legislation, I indicated that my preferred option was to work with the retail trade.  If we cannot achieve an outcome, legislation may need to be considered.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Regarding the industrial relations (amendment) Bill, which is on the list, some 150,000 people have lost their jobs since the T&aacute;naiste took up office.  The framework document, which was not published yesterday, suggests that a further 120,000 people will lose their jobs by 2010.  That is extremely optimistic in that it suggests 6,000 people per month will lose their jobs whereas currently 16,000 people per month are losing their jobs.  Based on those figures, by 2010 a further 300,000 people will have lost their jobs and 600,000 people will be unemployed, which is 20% of the population.  This is particularly relevant in terms of this Bill.</P>
        <P>When will the Bill be brought before the House and will it deal with the issue of employment regulation orders in the hotel and catering industry?  Many hotels, restaurants and caf&eacute;s are closing as they have been unable to meet the terms of the employment regulation order.  When will that legislation be introduced and when will this issue be addressed?  Is the T&aacute;naiste happy to see the entire tourism and catering industry laid to waste under her watch?</P>

        <P>On the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I have previously asked the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach on the Order of Business when this Bill will come before the House.

The relevance of this issue was again brought to light yesterday in terms of the State&rsquo;s hope of obtaining substantial subsidies from the European Commission in respect of the cost of upgrading our electricity grid and our interconnection with Britain.  </P>
        <P>Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will provide the House with an accurate indication of when that legislation is likely to be introduced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before getting into the substance of my contribution to the House this morning, I want to acknowledge the fact that anything I or, indeed any Member of the House, has to say during the course of our statements on the economy this week cannot take from the immediate concern caused to individuals and families by the loss to the household of a job or income in the current economic climate.  While we have put in place a strong matrix of State supports for jobseekers, the loss of a job or income to the household necessitates a significant adjustment to the weekly spend and lifestyle, and for those with mortgages and other financial pressures, can be a stressful and worrying time. This is the human side to the macro-economics discussions we are having this week and I want to take the opportunity to again assure people who find themselves under that type of financial pressure that there are support services available, such as MABS, to help them address their financial problems as and when they arise.  It is essential <Col N="14"/>that such issues are not ignored or left unattended as people strive to find new employment to support themselves and their families.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, in his contribution yesterday, described as distressing the rise in the numbers of people becoming unemployed.  Everyone in the House agrees, particularly given the speed with which numbers have risen.  In my own Department for example, the rise in the number of redundancy notices and the change in our wider economy have been such that in recent weeks I have moved significant staff resources out of the employment permits section and into redundancy payments to compensate for the reversal of trends in both areas.  This is yet another indication that the global economy has changed more rapidly, and more profoundly, than in any time in memory.</P>
        <P>While it is important for us all to understand how, globally, we got to where we are today, in the absence of a co-ordinated global response, it is essential for Ireland, as a small and open economy, to take all necessary action to ensure a sustainable and vibrant Irish economy in the years to come.  We must now prudently assess the fitness of our policies to meet the next phase of challenges, in the shorter and longer term.  The scale of the adjustments now required represent a major political, economic and social challenge.  Everybody will be affected and everybody will have to play their part in overcoming the challenge.</P>
        <P>We all know that we are not alone in this challenge.  Every country in the developed world is facing similar or more serious challenges.  For example, Singapore, one of the most advanced economies in the world and one of our chief competitors for foreign direct investment, last week forecast negative GDP growth and deflation in 2009.  The US, UK, France, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain are also in recession.  This is a truly global crisis.</P>
        <P>That said, in framing any plan to see us through current events, we must be conscious of what we have going for us, namely, our young educated population, which is a key pull factor in Ireland&rsquo;s favour; our comparatively low debt to GDP ratio; our pro-business and pro-employment tax regime; our business regulation that recognises the need for control and certainty without overburdening enterprise; and our continuing commitment to investment in infrastructure, education and, critically, research and development.</P>
        <P>Last December, building on these strengths, we set out our framework for sustainable economic renewal, entitled Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.  This sets out a clear roadmap for Ireland&rsquo;s move back to economic growth and prosperity, with investment focused on those areas where we can build on our existing strengths, address our weaknesses and ensure that we are best positioned to take advantage of the eventual global upturn.  What we need now is to balance our response to the current crisis with, on the one hand, firm measures to restore stability to the public finances and regain confidence in Irish banking and, on the other, measures to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and future prosperity.<b>  </b>There are four elements to this &mdash; continuing our public capital programme; supporting the enterprise and knowledge economy; reducing our cost base, especially energy prices; and assisting those who have lost their jobs.</P>
        <P>Over the past two decades, we captured a significant amount of mobile investment from the US and elsewhere, disproportionate to the size of our economy, and we successfully targeted sectors that were likely to be the sources of future employment, product development and wealth.  Equally, in the modernisation and development of our home grown enterprises we have successfully scaled up many infant industries that are now taking up positions of strength in the global marketplace.  The talent, energy and ingenuity in Irish entrepreneurs and our enterprise base have set a strong foundation for the future of this country.</P><Col N="15"/>
        <P>There has been a significant cultural change in Ireland over the past couple of decades.  Twenty years ago it was widely held that economic growth in Ireland was seriously inhibited by a lack of an entrepreneurial culture.  In recent years, Ireland has been rated by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor as one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the EU.  The success of our pro-enterprise strategies have been reflected in the high level of business start-ups in recent years, the number of small businesses in Ireland having increased by about 50% over the last decade or so.  Ireland is actually in fourth place across the OECD and second in Europe for the number of early stage entrepreneurs.</P>
        <P>A striking fact is that indigenous internationally trading companies supported by Enterprise Ireland employ as many people, if not more, as IDA assisted overseas companies operating in Ireland.  The focus of the majority of these Irish companies is on the high-skill, knowledge intensive sectors necessary for a &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This bodes very well for the direction we want Ireland to take.  Our overarching goal for industrial policy is for Ireland to develop indigenous companies of such range and depth that rather than be net foreign direct investment recipients, we become net foreign direct investors, with the return on those investments supporting world leading research and development activity at home.  The creation, ownership and exploitation of the ideas of tomorrow is at the heart of our smart economy plan.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s path to achieving this goal is still at a vulnerable stage, however.  There are threats to its attainment which we need to address now more than ever, particularly for export orientated companies competing globally.  Our higher cost base is one such issue and it is clear that we need to restore our relative cost competitiveness.  It is for this reason that addressing competitiveness issues is a key task for the Cabinet committee on economic renewal and why we are taking a number of measures across Government to ensure that we identify and address cost issues in our economy.</P>
        <P>For example, the Government has now given a commitment to publishing a whole-of-Government response to recommendations contained in the reports of the Competition Authority.  This, in conjunction with the merging of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, should yield dividends for the economy as a whole, where both the individual and enterprises as consumers will benefit from increasing competition and a reduction in sheltered sectors of the economy.  Other measures, such as consolidating the various inspections programmes to reduce the number of inspection visits to business, will help reduce the compliance burden on business as well as producing efficiencies for the public sector.</P>
        <P>Our reliance on the importation of fossil fuels means that our energy costs are among the highest in Europe, a fact that is of significant concern as we work to attract and grow businesses competing globally.  We are, however, working to ensure that the actions to address the issue are progressed as a priority, including increasing renewable electricity generation to 40% of our overall needs by 2020 in a cost efficient manner, and the necessary upgrading of the grid and provision of backup power generation to make this possible.  We are also working to ensure that a fundamental review of energy prices and tariff methodologies is undertaken, to take account of all energy consumers and conscious of the need to support economic competitiveness.  Energy companies need to keep a very watchful eye on their own operating costs, ensuring maximum efficiency and productivity across their operations, particularly in a climate where high energy costs can cost jobs elsewhere in the economy and act as a disincentive for investment in Ireland.  In effect, I want to let the enterprise community know that we hear what is being said about energy prices and understand the reality enterprises face meeting these costs.  We are now looking closely at how energy prices are set and we will be making sure that customers &mdash; business and consumers &mdash; benefit from the changes on the global markets.</P><Col N="16"/>
        <P>The issue of pay in both the public and private sectors is being addressed by the social partners through the partnership process.  It is a process which has served us well in the past, from the dark days of the 1980s, and is continuing to provide a vital mechanism for the reform needed at the current time.  However, the average rate of wage inflation was 50% above the EU-15 average for the period 2004-08 and this has to be addressed in a meaningful way if we are to recover lost ground.  Labour costs are a significant factor in terms of cost competitiveness and while we still strive to grow and attract more higher skilled and higher wage jobs to our economy, at this vulnerable stage of our economic development, this is a factor which cannot be ignored in the current climate.</P>
        <P>In 1958, acknowledging that Ireland was a small economy which is exposed to the &ldquo;perpetual flux of world economic forces&rdquo;, T. K. Whitaker wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">One must be prepared at all times for fluctuations and upsets.  A readiness to adapt to changing conditions is a <i>sine qua non </i>for economic success.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is as relevant today as it was then.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is today reaffirming this view in Davos, where he is meeting with other world leaders to discuss the shaping of the post-crisis world.  He is also meeting with many key business leaders to confirm to them directly that Ireland Inc. remains open for business and that there are many concrete reasons for companies to invest here.  Our stable, pro-business environment remains in place and we are taking steps to make further improvements towards reducing our cost base and making Ireland a more competitive economy for business.</P>
        <P>It is worth repeating our positive attributes lest they get lost in the sea of bad news reports.  We have a young and well educated workforce and we have a strong entrepreneurial spirit.  We have a free and open economy.  Investment in research and development-related operations, our quality of life, low tax wedge on labour as well as competitive rates of corporate tax, a supportive regulatory environment for the development and expansion of enterprise and increasing levels of educational attainment are all areas where Ireland performs strongly.  Our enterprise support agencies stand ready to assist ideas and nurture business potential.  Information and communications technologies are giving new opportunities to both individuals and economies to reinvent themselves.  Ireland has developed a reputation as an attractive location for high-end, skill-intensive manufacturing operations and we continue to build on this advantage.</P>
        <P>Many nations have pinned their future on building a knowledge economy.  There are many pillars to a knowledge economy.  These range from high levels of educational attainment, a modern industrial base and high investment in research and development to an innovation system that connects up the different parts of the economy to this objective.   Most of all, however, we possess both the ambition and the confidence to build such an economy in Ireland.  We are imaginative, creative and adaptable.  We are innovators and problem solvers.  Irish people have historically left these shores, travelled and helped to build some of the world&rsquo;s leading economies.  We did that here, too, as we built the Celtic tiger economy.  I firmly believe we will do it again and that we will emerge stronger from the current challenges, with an economy firmly back on the path of sustainable growth.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd. </P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech and I welcome the fact that she recognises issues regarding the cost of energy, labour etc.  However, one would almost believe she was talking from the perspective of somebody in Opposition or a person outside Government.</P><Col N="17"/>
        <P>The first job the Government has to do is to convince international observers that a credible plan is in place to get the public finances back in order within a reasonable timeframe.  It is clear that the events and failures in recent months have damaged Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.  The Government must not only take the blame for that, but now take the lead in rectifying the damage.  It is unreal to see how far Ireland has dropped in the view of international commentators, from the days of the Celtic tiger to literally now being seen as a basket economy.  A few weeks ago there was general consensus that tough measures would have to be taken.  Whatever about union leaders being vocal against it, there was general acceptance among ordinary people that these measures were needed and would be accepted.  Unfortunately, Government indecision in this regard does not help.</P>
        <P>Representing a Border constituency where little or no international industry has ever been placed our job losses have not received the same publicity as Dell in Limerick.  Nevertheless, job losses have the same effect on individuals and families whether it is a single job from a retail shop or a massive exodus from factories which will still open but only employ 10% of their previous workforce.  To the Government and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has just left the House, I state that we in the Border areas deserve as much recognition if not more than any other area in that we lost out on so much due to the troubles in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government not only laughed at Fine Gael&rsquo;s logical demand for a 1% decrease in VAT rates to help in some way to improve our competitiveness but it further increased VAT to 21.5%.  This happened at a time when the British Government lowered its VAT rate to 15% thus creating a major exodus to Northern Ireland from not only the Border area but even from the deep south.</P>
        <P>Issues such as this together with a lack of leadership create fear and a lack of confidence even among the well-known entrepreneurs on which counties such as Monaghan relied through the years.  Small businesses are finding it difficult in the marketplace because of the collapse of sterling.  Equally, they are having great difficulties because of the failure of the banking system.  This is caused because the Government has been slow to finalise the capital structures within the banks and get agreement to release the necessary funding for industry.</P>
        <P>In recent years County Monaghan has lost 1,100 jobs in the furniture industry and hundreds in the timber frame sector.  Not only did a mill close some years ago but businesses in the retail sector are also closing after hundreds of years.  It is still difficult to estimate the recent damage done in the food sector.  In blunt terms, increasing charges and indirect taxes together with the increase in the minimum wage has left our industries, including tourism, uncompetitive.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to listen to the T&aacute;naiste blaming the retail sector in the Border regions for not competing and bringing down their prices when she and her Government are the main problem.  She admitted that we have among the highest cost factors in Europe.  No matter how difficult the present proposals are to deal with, it is important to bring them forward and implement them and get on with the job.  The indecision and incoherence of the Government is leading us further into depression while at the same time we watch President Obama move forward at speed with certainty and providing hope.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to hear the T&aacute;naiste speaking about small businesses.  This morning, I was phoned by a small business in Monaghan which must close because of planning regulations.  Some people in positions of power believe they are almighty and this is not acceptable to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is an extremely important debate at a critical time for the national economy and the people.  I agree with the point made by my colleague, Deputy Crawford, on the Border counties coming as I do from County Louth.  We have had a significant <Col N="18"/>loss of jobs, particularly in the retail sector.  Superquinn in Dundalk closed recently and shops are closing every day.  We need a more structured and credible approach from the Government on the cost factors which are driving small businesses out of business.  One aspect of this could be to re-examine the rateable valuations and a reduction in rates.  We should tell local authorities to cut their rates to stimulate business and make it less expensive for people to operate on the main streets of our towns.</P>
        <P>We need to examine the cost of telecommunications and energy.  At present, the price we pay for electricity is based on a price of $146 per barrel of oil when the real price is closer to $40.  There is no reality between what we pay for major contributory cost factors such as energy and the actual price being paid internationally for these products.</P>
        <P>My job is to speak about transport.  A report was commissioned by the Minister and published this week.  It spoke about the problems in Dublin Bus, particularly the lack of services which will occur in Dublin.  Dublin Bus will shed more than 270 jobs and it will cut back on its routes and services.  In 2000, the Government, through the late Seamus Brennan, published proposals for opening the bus market in Dublin to allow competition and competitive pricing on routes.  Nine years later, this has not happened.  The people of Dublin are losing out on services to Dublin Bus which is not able to manage its own funds.</P>
        <P>This report shows that more than &euro;2 million could be saved annually on one of its 14 key routes.  Finglas was examined and it was stated that if services were run differently, more effectively and more cost efficiently they could be increased at a reduced cost.  It is a disgraceful situation that Government policy is held to ransom by antiquated and unacceptable operations in the semi-State sector.  It is time Dublin Bus was opened to competition.  This would mean consumers would have more choice, prices would be lower and taxpayers would pay less for services.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the capital project for roads was cut by more than &euro;280 million.  This year, spending on national primary routes will be &euro;280 million less than what was spent last year.  The document circulated today, to <i>The Irish Times</i> if not to the D&aacute;il, discusses increasing expenditure on capital projects to historic and international high levels.  It does not make sense to cut back on capital projects which are labour intensive, will reduce congestion on our roads and will allow us to plan for the future.</P>
        <P>This recession will end.  There is doom and gloom everywhere but internationally, from time immemorial, economic cycles continue.  While we are at the bottom of this cycle &mdash; perhaps it will get worse than we ever thought it could because of mismanagement by the Government &mdash; it will come around again.  When the recovery does come our infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure, must be in a position to benefit from it.  We should spend on capital projects, cut back on inefficiencies and waste across the public service, and get rid of the 40 quangos as proposed by my colleague Deputy Leo Varadkar.  Savings of almost &euro;200 million could be made by switching to generic drugs.  Many significant changes can be made which would improve our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>There is shock and awe at the mess the Government has made of the economy.  In the 18th century we had was is called the &ldquo;South Sea bubble&rdquo;, and perhaps the Ceann Comhairle has heard of it, where investments were made in a project on the south seas and billions were lost on the Stock Exchange in Britain.  The entire economy collapsed.  The housing bubble was our South Sea bubble.  The Government relied on people selling houses to each other to build a boom that could not last to get money that could not continue to come in to it because it had to end.  The disaster we now have was visited upon the State by an inadequate, arrogant and uncaring Government which did not plan or save in the good times for the bad times we are in.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="19"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to contribute to this debate on the economy.  Rather than squabbling, this House must be united in our purpose of getting the country back on its feet again.  This does not mean there is no role for critical analysis or constructive criticism.  However, we must distinguish between constructive criticism and destructive cynicism.</P>
        <P>In the past 20 years in Ireland we have shown that we have the capacity to win at home and in foreign markets.  We have the capacity to take this country literally from its knees to become one of the most successful countries in the world today.  This remains our position notwithstanding the economic challenges which confront the economy.  Nobody has a greater stake in the country&rsquo;s success and future than our people, regardless of where they work, whether in the public or private sectors, whether they are public servants, politicians or business people, or unfortunately, unemployed, or pensioners.  Nobody has greater capacity than our people to make sure that this country returns as soon as possible to economic growth.</P>
        <P>The results of the latest world competitiveness survey are outlined on page 23 of the Government&rsquo;s smart economy framework document.  Ireland ranks seventh out of 182 countries as a good place to do business, it is fifth out of the same 182 countries as an easy place to establish a business and is the third cheapest location for a business start-up.  It is a member of the eurozone, a stable currency that enables us to sell our goods into a market of almost 500 million people with fewer transaction costs.  We must export 80% of what we produce by way of goods and services which makes this one of the most open and export-led economies in the world.  Ireland&rsquo;s stock of foreign direct investment is five times greater than the OECD average.  Only 11% of the population is over 65 years of age, compared with 18% in the United Kingdom and 16% to 19% in most of the mainland European countries.  Over 85% of those aged between 20 to 24 years have completed at least second level education, the second highest percentage in the European Union, and 40% of those aged between 25 and 34 have a third level qualification.  I could continue to cite extremely favourable statistics for this country.</P>
        <P>We do have to ensure that our public finances are in order.  The solution to the economic problems we face does not lie solely in our hands but unless we deal with the issues within our domestic capacity we will not be able to return to economic growth when the world&rsquo;s economic conditions change.  We can manage our public finances internally in a sustainable way.  It is not sustainable to run budget deficits of 11% to 11.5%.  The Government therefore has identified the need to reduce spending in 2009 by &euro;2 billion.  That will be a challenge because already one month has passed and decisions made within the next week will perhaps take some weeks to effect.  For the rest of this year we will be challenged to find that &euro;2 billion but we must find it.  That gives urgency to the decision making process.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and the Government want to bring those involved in social partnership with us in this collective national effort to return to economic growth as quickly as possible.  In the mid-1980s when we almost went under and Ireland was described on the cover of <i>The <?oasys _ch ?>Economist</i> as the &ldquo;basket case of Europe&rdquo; &mdash; I still have a copy of that edition &mdash; the collective effort of many stakeholders, not least public representatives, helped to bring about national recovery.  In addition to the policies pursued in the intervening period the industrial peace that came from social partnership which is fundamental to our system of government has had significant benefits in making the country an attractive place, not only for outside investment but also local investment.</P>
        <P>We must, however, acknowledge and learn from our mistakes.  We let competitiveness slip not only in wage levels but also the cost of energy.  These are gravely negative factors making Ireland less competitive for indigenous and foreign investment.  There is no doubt that we over-lent and over-invested in property.  We must learn too from what we did in the 1980s when we <Col N="20"/>had high debt, high tax and spending and high unemployment.  We do not want to see a return to the vicious spiral of high unemployment fuelled by those factors.</P>
        <P>Investment is mobile and will go wherever the returns are reasonable.  Among the factors influencing foreign investment in this country was that we gave one of the best returns in the world as the US Department of Trade and Commerce showed.  We know from events in banks and stock exchanges around the world that high risk attaches to investment.  Those who take those risks are entitled to expect a reasonable return.  The manner in which we tax transactions, risk taking and enterprise must focus on delivering a good return while remaining competitive.</P>
        <P>We have seen recently that the failure to enforce appropriate regulation has a negative impact on the performance of our corporations and the image of, and confidence in, our country.  Confidence is essential to winning investment and fundamental to the success of any economy.  We have done a great deal in the past decade to change the regulatory environment but law alone will not achieve this.  We must change the culture.  Maybe because this is a small country we cannot be as dispassionate and tough as we should be.  Most people here are terrified of the Revenue Commissioners.  I have been very impressed with the manner in which they have enforced the tax law in recent years.  People must fear and respect other regulators.  If regulation is not enforced without fear or favour those who invest in our society, as shareholders, citizens, pensioners, employees, those honest business people, are damaged.  That is why when I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with support from the Government, we established the independent office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  We removed from ministerial direction the appointment of inspectors to companies.  That should not be a political function, no more than the prosecution of criminal offences or the granting of planning permission.  The office, headed by a respected public servant, for whom I have high regard, Mr. Paul Appleby, has enforced company law in recent years.  People in this House have often criticised him for being over-zealous.  Now we see the consequences for all our citizens of not enforcing regulation.</P>
        <P>We face a tough challenge.  Many are concerned and worried.  We must inspire confidence and work together with a unity of purpose to get the country back on its feet.  Ideas from wherever they come, whether an individual inside or outside this House or a political party, are important to the Government.  We want to hear good ideas and act on them.</P>
        <P>I wish to end on a positive note.  One of the ways to measure the progress of any country, and particularly its health system, is life expectancy.  In the past ten years we have added over three years to life expectancy.  This is unique in the developed world.  A child born here today has a life expectancy greater than one born in the United Kingdom, Finland or many other countries, and can expect to live as long as a child born in Germany.  According to Professor Walsh this is due in equal part to better health interventions particularly for cardiovascular disease and enhanced prosperity.  There are many good stories about what has been achieved here.  Working together we have the capacity to return to economic growth and to see similar success soon again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach yesterday reverted to his former role as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He had much to say about the global causes and effects of the recession in the big bad world on poor little Ireland.  He set his sights on the distant horizons of New York, Berlin and Tokyo for the sources of all our troubles.  Even when he addressed the banking crisis he set his remarks in a worldwide context.  It was a smokescreen.  The Taoiseach said nothing about the sordid clique of property speculators, bankers and politicians in this country, whose insatiable greed and gross mismanagement have brought the Irish econ<Col N="21"/>omy to its knees.  There was not a mention of Anglo Irish Bank, the property bubble, or the fatal reliance of the Government on revenue from that property bubble.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach told us that &ldquo;there is little point in looking back at how some of this might have been anticipated or avoided&rdquo;.  I believe there is every point in doing so, because the lessons of the past must be learned if further disaster is to be avoided.  We are not asking the Government to wear sackcloth and ashes, but a straightforward acknowledgement of what was done wrong would help to instil some confidence in its ability to give leadership.  More importantly, it would be the first step in rebuilding the economy on more secure foundations and in helping to ensure that it serves all the people and not the privileged.</P>
        <P>We are in the biggest economic crisis in this country since the 1930s.  People are very concerned about the future, but they are also very angry and I do not think this has been stressed enough.  People I meet every day are incensed at what has happened because they know where responsibility lies.  We have to learn the lessons of those failed policies if we are going to find a way out of this crisis.  The Government must prioritise jobs, infrastructure and public services.  We are not seeing a comprehensive strategy for recovery coming from the Government.  We are debating the economy over two days without being given right of access, as elected representatives of the people, to the framework document being discussed between the Government, unions and employers.  We had to wait until it was leaked to the newspapers this morning to see it.  That is an insult to the people who elected us.</P>
        <P>The framework document is aspirational and vague, and all will depend on the details that are filled in over coming weeks and months.  However, I fear we are seeing a book-keeping approach from the Government when what is needed is a job-creating approach.  We urgently require a plan to create jobs in the short and medium term.  Jobs are being lost for the simple reason that people do not have money to spend.  We can see this in the number of companies going into receivership in both the retail and manufacturing sector.  Consumer spending must increase to save these jobs and to start returning revenue to the Exchequer in the form of VAT.  There needs to be a stimulus package that protects the wages of those on low and medium incomes, reduces VAT and ensures that reductions in oil prices are passed on immediately.</P>
        <P>With the unemployment figure currently at 300,000 and thousands of jobs being lost every week, the Government&rsquo;s options for raising revenue will continue to be seriously curtailed unless a strategy is in place to put more people in employment, thereby increasing direct revenue returns and lessening the pressure on public resources through social welfare.  This means developing an export led economy.  Over 90% of current exports are from foreign owned companies here, not indigenous companies.  Enterprise Ireland, the body tasked with improving our export figures, is in desperate need of an overhaul.  The body received over &euro;273 million in funding in 2007, but it sponsors just 624 companies.  To put this in perspective, over 8,000 Irish companies applied for new licences from January to June last year.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a series of proposals before the budget that would have generated up to &euro;2 billion in revenue and would ensure that those who have the most, pay the most.  For example, all discretionary tax reliefs should only be available at the standard rate of tax and the PRSI ceiling should be removed.  Those on higher income have the opportunity to contribute more.  All those on lower incomes are paying PRSI on the entirety of their income.  We should be paying it commensurate with our ability to pay, based on income.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a range of other measures, including a social housing construction programme to meet the needs of those on local authority waiting lists and to address the dramatic fall in construction employment.  We have proposed the fast-tracking of other infrastructure projects.  For example, where is the network of primary health care centres once <Col N="22"/>promised?  Where are the child care facilities?  We need improved public transport if we are to attract jobs.  Instead, we are getting cuts in buses and in jobs.  We have proposed a moratorium on home repossessions and a requirement on the financial institutions to negotiate down unaffordable mortgages.  This would provide relief for hard-pressed families and allow them to participate in the economy again without the fear of losing their homes.  That fear is real and present in every constituency in this State today.  We have proposed a major programme of retraining and reskilling workers, especially those in the construction industry who have seen mass redundancies and many of whom have little or no transferable qualifications.</P>
        <P>The Government stepped in directly to bail out the banks.  Why was there no intervention in flagship Irish industries such as Waterford Crystal?  Such interventions are now urgently required.  The Government should reverse the giveaway of the massive Corrib gas resources off the Mayo coast.  What are the chances that the Government will have the bottle to tackle that?  It is worth billions, yet it has been given away to multinationals which have ridden roughshod over the local community.  These resources belong by right to the Irish people and we need them now more than ever.</P>
        <P>We need to see aid to indigenous small and medium sized industry on a par with what is provided for foreign direct investors.  These industries are anchored in our communities.  They need credit and they need help with research, product development and marketing.  Banking must be first and foremost an essential service for the economy.  When that service is destroyed because of the greed of top bankers and the negligence of the Government, we get the financial crisis in which we now find ourselves.  A State bank should be established to provide credit for economic development, to encourage saving and to utilise capital for productive investment, not speculation.  Anglo Irish Bank is not that bank.  The economy can no longer rely on a banking system which has been corrupted by the grossly inflated profits of top bankers and shareholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In conclusion, I stress the need to defend vital public services in health and education.  Little has been said about the cuts that have already taken place and that have damaged our health and education systems.  These cuts are penalising the less well off, those who are being thrown on the dole queue, the people waiting up to 11 weeks to get jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the families struggling to meet medical bills and the older people existing with minimal services.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will stand by these people and we will work shoulder to shoulder with others, including the Government, to defend the vital services built up over decades, as long as the Government is prepared to ensure that those services remain and are built upon.  Taxes paid by working people in this country represent the essence on which the economy has been built and has thrived.  People deserve the reward of certainty and not the current uncertainty that has instilled such fear and gloom across society.</P>
        <P>The Government should respond to the proposals of all parties presented during this debate.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Health and Children, at the conclusion of her own contribution, that the ideas of all parties should be taken on board by the Government.  I do not want a Thatcherite response of &ldquo;out, out, out&rdquo; across the floor of the Chamber.  We deserve a considered, costed and written response to the ideas we have mooted.  We put these ideas to the Minister prior to the budget on 14 October and we reiterate them today.  We deserve a response.  The people we represent deserve it, and everyone looking for a resolution to the current difficulties deserves to have the Government pay serious attention to the voices, ideas and proposals of all parties in this House.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the issues that confront us.  As we speak, social partners are in detailed discussions based on a framework document entitled Framework Pact for Stabilisation, Social Solidarity and Economic Renewal.  I am delighted they have agreed on a framework document and that they can now engage in detailed discussions to advance proposals put forward by themselves and the Government on how to address the challenges facing us.</P>
        <P>Every Member is aware of the great challenges facing us, some of which were caused by internal problems and others which, it is important to note, were caused by global events over which we have no control.  Some Deputies seem to believe the banking crisis was caused by Anglo Irish Bank alone and some individuals involved with that institution.  Let us be under no illusions that the financial banking crisis is a global one.  I recently read reports from the United States indicating people have made apologies for allowing Lehman Brothers to go to the wall and for necessitating the bailing out of other financial institutions.  The fact of the matter is that the global financial crisis started in the United States in the sub-prime market and filtered into all economies in the world, culminating in a credit crisis.  This, in itself, has compounded the difficulties in the Irish context.</P>
        <P>We are already facing challenging times because of our over-reliance on the construction industry.  However, a view is being circulated by some Members of this House that the construction industry just put money in developers&rsquo; pockets.  For many years, craftspeople and others working on building sites throughout this country enjoyed gainful employment with reasonable remuneration.  It is important to acknowledge that, while there was over-reliance on the building industry, it employed many people for many years.  The number of people who came here from the newly acceded states of the European Union increased dramatically over recent years.  This shows the full extent of employment generated by the building industry.</P>
        <P>We are now running into major difficulties, however, and these difficulties feature across the broader economy.  Nevertheless, we must bear in mind what we have achieved as a nation to date.  It is very disappointing to hear some Members talk as if Ireland has achieved nothing in the past 40 or 50 years, or even since our independence.  The fact is that Members on all sides, along with the social partners and the people, can be very proud of what we they have achieved in recent times.  We made the transition from an agrarian society, whose main export was its people, to a society with full employment, a labour force of over 2 million people, increased public expenditure and considerable investment in capital projects, infrastructure and roads.  All these developments are clear.  We can be slightly cynical in this House at times and dismiss them as never having been achieved in the first place.</P>
        <P>We have come from a very low base and must therefore keep firmly in view what we have achieved and realise where we are when dealing with the challenges.  We can do this collectively.  I genuinely believe the social partners were very responsible in difficult times in the 1980s and also in the good times in the 1990s.  We now face a crossroads but the confluence of events and circumstances internationally is making the challenge greater than ever.  Decisions that will be made by the Government and social partners in the coming days will have a profound impact on the generations that come after us.  The decisions made will be the most difficult this generation of politicians and those involved in social partnership will ever have to make.  I hope they make sensible proposals that are fair and equitable and distribute the burden of pain across all sectors, such that the weak and vulnerable will be protected and that those who can afford to do so will carry a heavier burden.  All political parties would endorse this view.</P>
        <P>We do not want to undermine what is happening in Government Buildings with the social partners.  Obviously people have stated positions and want to negotiate on that basis in the <Col N="24"/>knowledge that those positions will not be in the public domain until such time as there is a final conclusion.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will be well aware of how lengthy and difficult negotiations can be.  People change positions and must be encouraged to do so.  This takes time so we must give them the space and opportunity to make proposals that are fair to their members and that also deal with the crisis we are facing.</P>
        <P>The most immediate impact of the global downturn was the bursting of the construction industry bubble.  This is now affecting the broader economy.  Every day there are job losses and company closures, which comprise the most immediate impact of a global downturn.  For this reason alone, we must increase the number of training programmes and expand F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s capacity to deal with people as they become unemployed.  This will place a great burden on the Exchequer.  I urge all those involved in the State agencies dealing with the unemployed to put in an extra little bit of time and effort.  While we know they are under a lot of pressure, we depend on them fundamentally to create the courses and training programmes for the unemployed.</P>
        <P>The mistakes we made in the 1980s in respect of unemployment, namely, throwing people on the scrapheap, must not be repeated.  We must learn this lesson.  We had large-scale unemployment but did not deal with the unemployed and provide them with training opportunities and educational courses.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will try to determine the programmes necessary to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>We have 2 million people employed.  Those on fixed, secure incomes could enjoy a higher standard of living this year because of a reduction in inflation or potential deflation.  Everybody must recognise that some are in a more privileged position than others, but every effort must be made to deal with those at the coalface who find themselves unemployed.</P>
        <P>The social partners comprise the mechanism for a resolution.  I urge every Member to encourage the social partners, irrespective of who they represent, to make a deal that will meet the challenges confronting us.</P>
        <P>The financial institutions guarantee scheme involved a fundamental decision on the part of the House.  Some Members did not support it but, had we not established the scheme in September, we would be facing a very serious crisis, simply because a stable, financial banking sector is fundamental to any economy.  On the perception that we are bailing out the banks, let us be under no illusions that the banks are owned by shareholders, many of whom are walking these streets.  They either have shares or pension funds in the banks and it is therefore very important to note we are not just bailing out the banks but also trying to ensure we have a stable, viable banking system.  I wish the social partners well and I know the contributions of the Deputies opposite will be taken into account in their discussions.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Deputy Beverley Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing his time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment of the social partners who are engaging with the Government to try to bring about a solution to the very difficult economic crisis in which we find ourselves.  We should recognise that we require a five year recovery programme.  It will be very difficult to achieve an adjustment of &euro;2 billion in 2009.</P>
        <P>I would like to comment on a few main areas in the time available to me, the first of which concerns the banks.  I feel very strongly that the banks must now act very responsibly in their dealings with businesses.  Reference has been made to the fact that the banks have been bailed out.  Some &euro;6 billion has been committed to the two main banks in this country under the recapitalisation programme.  Reduced interest rates are not being passed on to the business community and not enough flexibility is being shown by the banks.</P><Col N="25"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Given that the Government is asking for a five year period in which to bring about economic recovery, it is not unrealistic to ask the banks to consider a five year recovery programme to deal with many businesses that I believe are viable and solvent and which could work through the difficulties if reasonable flexibility were shown to them in the five year period.  I ask that this be done because all anecdotal evidence suggests banks are not lending money.  There are many banks in the Irish economy that are not lending money at all and those that are appear to be doing so on a very restricted basis.  We all know cuts must be made over the next five years but the other half of the equation is that we need to stimulate growth in the economy.  Where will this growth come from if we do not invest in business and all sectors?</P>
        <P>I have heard much criticism in this House of the construction sector and of our over-dependence thereon over recent years.  It is true the sector played a greater role than was economically necessary and desirable but, in seeking to bring about a revival in the economy in the next five years, we cannot afford to ignore any sector.  The construction sector employs thousands of people in every part of the State, including blocklayers, electricians and carpenters, who are in need of support.  It is not all high-flying property developers in the construction industry.  We must protect existing jobs throughout the State.  Investment in infrastructure, particularly the building programme, must support these jobs.</P>
        <P>For those unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, the Government must take action to ensure they receive their social welfare payments without undue delay.  This is vital to the dignity and security of persons who find themselves in that difficult position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Two years ago, there was an Exchequer surplus of &euro;4 billion, even after the Government had squandered as much money as possible on projects such as PPARS and electronic voting.  The list goes on.  The only commitment given by the Government at that time, in the wake of these instances of wastage, was that it would get it right the following year by ensuring it spent all the money available to the Exchequer.  Now, 24 months later, we are going into debt at a rate of &euro;40,000 per minute.  The Government has spent recent months playing jigs and reels with the social partners in its efforts to secure savings of &euro;4,000 per minute.  What about the additional &euro;36,000 per minute we are obliged to borrow?  The Government is engaged in abacus economics.</P>
        <P>A conversation I had last week with a person from a rural village in County Roscommon offered an insight into the current state of our society.  He observed that one cannot get a pint because the pub is closed, one cannot buy a postage stamp because the post office is closed and one cannot buy a newspaper because the newsagent is closed, but there is no difficulty in buying an apartment.  The Government facilitated the unsustainable increase in prices in the commercial and residential sectors.  My colleague, Deputy Bruton, repeatedly warned the Government about this and emphasised the need to save for a rainy day.  However, nothing was done.</P>
        <P>Last Tuesday, I had lunch with Senator Anne McEwen from the Australian Parliament.  Her Government, she told me, announced its second stimulus package this week, the first having been introduced before Christmas.  Both these packages were financed from the reserves built up by the Australian Government during the good years, a concept completely alien to the Government of this State.  We are not even informed of its intentions.</P><Col N="26"/>
        <P>Young families who are mortgaged to the hilt are feeling the brunt of this downturn.  The blame for this lies firmly with the Government.  In 2006, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, was privately advised by economic experts that the property price explosion was unsustainable.  At the same time, he publicly encouraged young people to invest their future in housing.  Why would he not do so given that 35% of the price paid for every house goes directly into the Government coffers?  Banks are now setting unattainable deadlines for the repayments of loans.  Innovative action is required to address this problem.  In return for their recapitalisation, the banks should write off a percentage of property-based loans where it is evident that current repayments cannot realistically be made.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to recognise that the small business sector, which is currently haemorrhaging jobs, is of greater significance to the economy in terms of the employment it provides than multinationals and the State sector combined.  Companies that have been in operation for 50 years are going to the wall.  Fine Gael has proposed that such businesses should be exempted from PRSI where they are creating a new job with no net cost to the Exchequer.  We must also, at the very least, reverse the increase in the VAT rate and allow credit-starved businesses additional time to make their VAT payments and flexibility in regard to tax clearance certificates.  Moreover, the Government and its agencies must pay small businesses within the current 30-day deadline.  The Government, through the banks, must provide small businesses with the essential capital required to operate on a day-to-day basis.</P>
        <P>The Government must also examine the issue of cost savings.  Last year, for example, even though the number of asylum applications had decreased and accommodation costs had declined, there was an increase of &euro;15.5 million in the cost of housing asylum applicants.  We must deal with the bottlenecks within the system.  For example, there is great potential to grow the international education sector, which is currently worth &euro;1 billion.  However, we are still awaiting the finalisation of issues in regard to regulation.  We have a crazy situation where a person from outside the European Union who wishes to set up a small business here cannot do so without obtaining permission from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I will focus mainly on the difficulties being experienced by those in receipt of social welfare or attempting to access social welfare benefits.  Before doing so, I wish to make clear my abhorrence that we are effectively speaking in a vacuum in this debate.  The D&aacute;il is the seat of democracy in this State, or it is supposed to be, but it is being treated like a debating society where we can only speak in generalities about what is happening in the real world.  Despite the absence of any concrete proposals from the Government, other than what we obtained courtesy of the <i>The Irish Times</i> today, I wish to be constructive in my contribution to the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, it must be emphasised that it is time the Government stopped trying to have it both ways.  Last week, we had less than half a day to debate the situation in regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  It is clear the Government wants this House to write it a blank cheque for whatever it wants to do, without offering any engagement with Members.  Given that the Government must have known this information would be leaked, it could at least have pretended to have some respect for the D&aacute;il by leaving the documentation in our pigeon-holes this morning.  It is clear where the Government stands in this regard.</P>
        <P>Nobody underestimates the scale of the difficulties we face.  We on this side of the House certainly do not.  My colleague, Deputy Bruton, has warned time and again of the challenges ahead and offered various solutions to those difficulties.  Fine Gael has made many constructive suggestions on what should be done in particular areas but, unfortunately, the Government has not heeded our advice.</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P>I listened with interest to the points made by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, in a radio interview this morning.  I am relieved that she and her Government finally admit there is a significant problem in terms of the scale of job losses and that she is no longer accusing Members on this side of the House of being alarmist in making this point.  However, I am unconvinced that she is delivering sufficient staff to deal with the crisis.  Members of the Government have taken to using the phrase, &ldquo;We are where we are.&rdquo;  In other words, let us not examine how we have come to be in this situation.</P>
        <P>The reality is that if the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, does not begin to act far more quickly than she has done to date, we will be in a much worse position.  I asked her last October to assign additional staff to social welfare offices throughout the State, describing in detail to her the difficulties faced by both claimants and staff, all of whom are working extremely hard.  Eventually, in December, the provision of an additional 115 staff was announced.  Today, on 29 January, the Minister tells us these 115 persons are &ldquo;coming in&rdquo;.  In other words, they have not yet been appointed.  Moreover, many of them still require to be trained.  The Minister has indicated that she will seek to make an additional 100 appointments, on top of these 115.  However, this will be insufficient to meet demand if 120,000 people join the live register this year.</P>
        <P>If social welfare offices cannot deal with demand, every politician will advise constituents that the next port of call should be the community welfare officer.  Social welfare offices are all dealing with separate schemes but community welfare officers are processing almost everything in the interim, including applications for rent supplement, mortgage interest supplement and exceptional needs payments, assessments for medical cards and exceptional needs payments for electricity, gas and so on.  They handle dozens of claims every day.  Each officer is supposed to deliver three clinics per week on average, but these are currently running way over time because of the numbers of applicants.  Community welfare officers are unable to deal with the scale of demand.  This is something the Minister must address.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest fears people have at the moment &mdash; I am glad it is reflected in this document &mdash; is the fear of losing one&rsquo;s home.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Government is acting to support mortgage holders who get into arrears in their mortgage repayments.  I want to let him and every other Member know that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs does not collate the information on the number of people who have applied for the mortgage interest supplement.  She does not know that figure.  MABS has stated its concern that the increase in the number of applications is resulting in an increase in the number of refusals, which more or less correspond with each other.  The regulatory provisions are being interpreted in an overly restrictive and punitive manner.</P>
        <P>The Government is telling us in the framework document that it will assist those people.  How will it do so?  We raised this matter again with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, many months ago and the Government did nothing about it.  She said on radio this morning that the Government will deal with the issue of apprentices who have lost their jobs.  Last June Fine Gael outlined how those in the IT sector could be brought in to assist in dealing with apprentices who have lost their jobs.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, announced at Christmas a plan to deal with this issue.  Thousands of apprentices have lost their jobs.  To date, the Government has assisted the grand total 97 people.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to accept the scale of this problem and to act, and not only talk about how it will deal with it.  It needs to listen to what is being said on this side of the House because constructive measures have been offered.  The problem is that the Government waits until the issue develops into a political situation.  It does not want to be seen to almost give in <Col N="28"/>to the Opposition.  It is not listening to what is being said and the solutions that have been put forward.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak about an area where the Opposition has played an important role, that of Ireland&rsquo;s role in Europe and how critical it is to our current position.  Modern states were created on the social market economy model, with freedom for private enterprise balanced by the safety net of the welfare state.  That model has served the world, particularly Europe, successfully in the period since the Second World War, but it has failed to keep pace with the changing world around it.  That is the current reality.  The most profound change in the world has been brought about by globalisation and we see that in the financial crisis.  A bank collapses in Washington and its impact is felt in Waterford.  We live in a global village.  The problem is bigger than any one country.  It is systemic and global.</P>
        <P>The under-regulated use of the so-called innovative financial instruments, poor risk management and poor national financial regulations at the heart of the financial system have exposed the international economy to real damage.  All over the world lenders are unwinding credit, causing massive pain to businesses and households.  Consumer spending is shrinking across the developed world.  We see that on every street in Ireland in the destabilising impact of falling liquidity.  Investment cannot be sustained by the private sector in the face of shrinking lending to businesses.  Jobs are being lost across the developed world as credit is being withheld.  We know that this is the case not only in Ireland but elsewhere.  In this regard I would not necessarily include Australia as a model we should be following.</P>
        <P>A small open economy such as Ireland is particularly vulnerable.  The instability which is disrupting the world&rsquo;s largest economies cannot be avoided on this island.  I want to make a simple point.  EU membership represents for Ireland a vital support system at a time of economic turbulence.  We are undoubtedly in a very difficult economic position but our situation would be immensely more difficult if we did not possess the range of advantages that EU membership confers.  Most of the parties in this House have seen that as a fundamental truth.  Most of the parties, Opposition and Government, have worked on that reality.  That is why it is so vital now that we do not allow a shadow of a doubt arise as to our commitment to being at the heart of the European Union.  It is why it is imperative that we dispel the undoubted uncertainty that our rejection last year of the Lisbon treaty has created and why the Government must finalise legal guarantees that last month&rsquo;s European Council agreed to offer to Ireland on taxation, defence and ethical issues and give the people of Ireland the opportunity to ensure that we will retain our position in Europe.  It is why there is a challenge here, not only for the parties in Government but for all of the parties in the House to become part of the crusade to ensure that we stay at the heart of Europe.</P>
        <P>Once issues of guarantees have been resolved and the concerns of the Irish people addressed, it will be in our best economic interest to ratify the Lisbon treaty.  I suggest that we should do so handsomely by ratifying it with the same sort of numbers we ratified the original treaty to join the European Union.  This will not provide the single solution to all of our economic ills but it will represent a clear signal that Ireland wants to remain at the heart of the European Union.  If we are to make progress and if we are to rebuild in particular on the jobs front &mdash; I listened to contributions of the Deputies opposite &mdash; we have to stay at the very heart of the Union.  We have to dispel the clouds that have gathered over this country&rsquo;s position in Europe <Col N="29"/>since 12 June 2008.  We have to be able to say to those people who will be involved in the future in foreign direct investment that Ireland is still open for business as the entry port to Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The only hope of influencing the turn of world events is by working together with European Union colleagues.  We can only ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are represented in the international response to the crisis by being at the heart of the Union.  Even the most deluded Eurosceptics must recognise that at this time.  I cannot understand some of the rhetoric I listened to in recent days, not only in this House but outside it.  People who resolutely have argued for the past 35 years that somehow Europe is inimical to us have blinded themselves to the truth that it is vital to our future.  Those who refuse to see this essential truth put at risk our national well-being.  This is not a time to consider ourselves as <i>&agrave;<b> </b>la carte</i> Europeans.  Ireland needs to be a core member of the Union if it is to have an influence.</P>
        <P>To take one example, the Union is currently working on the area of financial regulatory reform.  I accept the analysis that regulatory reform in this country did not perform well and has not performed well internationally.  The new supervisory arrangements will have to be supranational as well as national in character.  The only way that we can influence the way they are constructed is by being at the heart of the Union.</P>
        <P>Within the European Union finance Ministers and the Commission are currently working intensively to implement reforms that will address some of the problems the financial turmoil has exposed.  We have to be part of that work, we cannot be semi-detached from it.  Eurozone membership is another area of critical importance.  It has been critical to providing the stability and security to the Irish economy at this difficult time.  The single currency has provided a stable foundation in Europe in these times of financial turmoil.  Where would this country be if we were not part of the European Union and of the eurozone?</P>
        <P>We must not let a sense of national hubris cloud our vision.  We saw plenty of examples of hubris last June as we came up to the referendum.  The delusion that we could go it alone and that somehow we in Ireland were impregnable has been blown away by the perfect storm that has ripped through the international financial services.  I am not suggesting that people should be convinced to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for Europe on the basis of fear, but I argue the case that we should be willing to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for Europe on the basis of the logic of the argument.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> reported that more than 80,000 workers lost their jobs across the United States and Europe in just one day.  Some 80,000 families were cast into turmoil.  Irish workers and their families can only be protected if we continue to attract investors.  Members on all sides of the House have seen the misery, fears and concerns that exist about the threat of job losses.</P>
        <P>However, just as currency traders choose safe currencies in troubled times, so too will major investors look for stability and security in making investment decisions.  We have to maintain our position at the heart of Europe if we want to remain an attractive location for investors.  I am fearful, as I believe are people who think about this, that our decision on 12 June last came at a very significant cost.  It raised questions in the minds of people on boards who make investment decisions.  We all know that reality to be the case.  High value technologies are the area that we have to attract into this country because of our cost structures.  Such investments will only be made if those who are making the investment decisions believe that we are going to stay at the heart of the Union.</P>
        <P>Voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; last June was not cost free.  It raised questions about this country and about where Ireland stands.  It did real damage to us in the area where we are pursuing investment decisions.  Admittedly, the so-called employment pipeline is quite full at the moment, but what has been the effect on investors who have not yet come to us?  Goodwill that has taken 35 <Col N="30"/>years to build up was lost among our European partners.  How do we put a value on that?  Goodwill is something that one cannot easily dispose of, yet we have done so.  This all comes at a strategic cost.  Less immediately measurable questions about our place in Europe have been placed in the minds of those who look from outside the EU for a place to invest.  This has a cost in jobs.  I shall offer the House a couple of examples.  We know because we have had contacts from a number of investors in the United States &mdash; a small number of investors &mdash; wondering what are the effects of the decision of 12 June last.  What we do not know, and what we can only surmise, is the impact of the doubts being put in the minds of those who have yet to make their investment decisions.  Are we even in contention for investment?</P>

	<P>We must stop deluding ourselves on this score.  The investment climate for the next few years will be challenging.  If we raise doubts about Ireland&rsquo;s place in Europe, the outlook which is already bleak will turn yet bleaker.  A stable currency, access to a single market, a competitive and well-regulated economy and predictable tax policies &mdash; these are key attributes that international and domestic investors prize and they will provide the pathway to a more prosperous future for our citizens.</P>
        <P>These can be assured only by maintaining and upholding our membership of the European Union and by continuing to play our part in the developments in the European project.  I realise the eyes of the nation are now more upon the immediate decisions that must be taken but we should not allow that reality to cloud us.  We have another decision to make.  As individual citizens, we may not be able to influence the money markets or individual decisions taken by investors but, as individual voters, we can assure our place in Europe and gain the opportunities that will come from being at its heart.  We can do that later this year.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  </P>
        <P>I will take up a theme of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who said we are deluding ourselves.  Listening to the Taoiseach yesterday was deeply dispiriting.  He scoffed at every proposal that came from these benches, saying they were inadequate.  He offered the Oireachtas no role in defining the nature of the framework or the challenges we must meet nor in how we must address them.  He gave no hint that he or any of his Ministers bore any responsibility whatsoever for any of the problems we address.</P>
        <P>The reality out there is seething anger about the way in which we have been driven into this deep recession, unprepared by Government and by those who were supposed to look out as regulators.  They look in at politics and see the sham nature of debate in which the Government is not willing to open up any realistic analysis of what is going on.  People are alarmed at what is going on in this country.  They see gross incompetence and no consequences.  They see golden handshakes for people who displayed incompetence or even worse.  They see auditors marked absent when serious issues were happening.  They see practices condoned that are outrageous: <Col N="31"/>the extravagant set-up of this D&aacute;il, with all its committees and those who are paid retainers to occupy places on them; the unjustified bonuses paid to public servants when the areas for which they have responsibility are manifestly failing; and the repeated refusal by anyone to accept responsibility for catastrophic failures that have occurred in this economy.  That is what people look at and why they lose confidence that we have a Government that is willing or capable to make the changes for which this crisis calls.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach opened his address with one lucid paragraph:</P>
        <P LI="1">In assessing how well we are prepared to confront the crisis it is reasonable to consider how well the nature of the problem is understood, how clear is the strategy that is designed to respond to it and how credible are the measures to be taken and how likely they are to succeed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Having set out that lucid set of three items to be looked at, the Taoiseach totally ignored them in the rest of his contribution.  How well is the nature of these problems understood by the Taoiseach?  It was alarming that there was not a single mention of any public policy failure in the course of his address.  A budget system that comes from the Dark Ages has seen money spent in appallingly inefficient ways.  The undermining of a performance-oriented public service was done knowingly and deliberately by Government in its decisions on benchmarking and decentralisation and in the establishment of the HSE without any restructuring.  These damaged the concept that high performance was important in the public sector.</P>
        <P>The Government did not bother to analyse properly the challenges before it made catastrophic decisions.  These include the fostering of a property bubble that was repeatedly supported by the Taoiseach as based on sound economic fundamentals; the gross failure of regulation right through this period to constrain irresponsible lending practices; and the destruction of competitiveness by the Government.</P>
        <P>The source of our uncompetitiveness is due to factors for which the Government is responsible.  Our over-priced electricity and waste systems and our inefficient telecom system are all areas the Government either manages or regulates.  It has failed.  There was the irresponsible fiscal stimulus that was pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers in every election that occurred.  We have the failed public service management system that saw, in the last year for which we have figures, 40% of set targets not delivered.  There were no consequences for either Ministers or public servants.  We have the failed system of public pay determination which, less than a year ago, had the Taoiseach coming into the House to tell us that he and his colleagues deserved &euro;35,000 extra in public pay.  That, for them, was at a time when they were presiding over catastrophic failures in the system.</P>
        <P>If we want to get real and face up to these issues we must realise that those elements are at the heart of why we, exceptionally, are most unprepared for this challenge.  We must realise why we have seen the greatest decline in jobs, the greatest problems in our public finances and why we see people with houses that will never regain the value of the price paid for them.  People are petrified that they will be next to lose their jobs.  We are most exposed because of policy failures and these were not once mentioned by the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>If we do not understand what got us into this hole, by God, we will not get out of it.  Ministers must get real and face up to their own failures because resolving those failures is part of getting us out of this position.  There is no point in the Government pretending that nobody in Government is responsible, that this is some sort of a once-in-a-lifetime calamity that has broken upon our shores from abroad, that there were great, sensible and sustainable polices here that were ruined by some forces from overseas.  That is just not real and Ministers must <Col N="32"/>know that.  If they do not, they do not deserve to be Ministers.  The Government has been living in a cocoon of its own making and that has done untold damage to our people.</P>
        <P>People will accept pain and they will accept pay cuts but, by God, they require to see that the members of Government are squaring up to the revolution that must occur in the way business is done in this House, in the regulation of monopolies and in the management of partnership.  We must see revolution right through the system and it must start in this House.  We must renew politics.  This sham debate of the past two days is undermining the last shreds of the confidence of people that the political system is aware of the challenges and is willing to square up to them.  The scoffing we have noted from the Taoiseach is contemptible.  It does not do his office justice.  At this time of crisis he should be looking to get support wherever he can, from this House and from the social partners.  People say on that side of the House that I and Fine Gael do not support social partnership.  We do support social partnership and we want to see it facing up to the changes that must be made.  Let us be very clear.  It is not the shaping of an agreement of consensus that will get us out of here.  It is the effectiveness of the measures that will get us out of here.  Consensus and the procedure of getting consensus are not the vital element, rather it is the decisions and the effective change we bring to this country that will make the difference.</P>
        <P>I shall return to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s second point, namely, how clear the strategy is that is designed to respond to this crisis.  Nobody in this House, or on this side of it, can see clarity in the nature of this strategy.  We got a table from a Department of Finance document called &ldquo;Addendum to the Irish Stability Programme: Update&rdquo;.  That makes two addendums and updates in the one.  It contains a mere five figures, namely, &euro;2 billion next year, &euro;4 billion the following year, &euro;4 billion the year following that, &euro;3.5 billion and then &euro;3 billion.  That is the sum total of the strategy.  That is not a plan or a strategy, it is a wish.  They would like to see borrowing dropped by that sum in those years and, lo and behold, with one bound our hero is free.  That is not a plan.  That is not what can be presented to this House to have a serious debate about the choices we face.  It is about time the Government wised up to this fact.</P>
        <P>The framework for a plan is full of platitudes.  It is thin enough gruel so everyone can agree to it and sit down and talk, but let us not delude ourselves into thinking this is a plan either.  The plan for the smart economy, Lord above, is a poorly reheated stew of promises that have peppered almost every document I have seen in the past ten years from the Government.  There are no timelines, no budgets and no responsibility is assigned.  That is not a plan to create a smart economy so do not let us delude ourselves.</P>
        <P>We are long past the time for the ritual dances that are going on here.  We cannot pass off hopes as strategy.  We must get down to serious revolution &mdash; I say this advisedly &mdash; in the way we do our business.  Budget 2009 should be scrapped.  There should be no attempt at running repairs or finding and tacking on &euro;2 billion of savings.  It needs to go right to the heart of budgeting.  We need budgets that are not about the demands of agencies on Government but the needs of people.  That would turn the budget 180&deg;.  The agencies that would get money would be those which are saying &ldquo;I can do this next year&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will commit to deliver this to people next year&rdquo;.  Only then would they get the money.  We would tie performance rigidly to what they committed to, and that would be a revolution.  We should withdraw the budget and begin that process.</P>
        <P>Let us honestly square up to the changes we can make this year, next year and the following year by addressing this issue programme by programme.  Let the D&aacute;il for once be a real Chamber where we can have proper discussions about choices, where the views of committees are taken seriously.  The PAC has long since told us we need to reform our Estimates procedure.  Every party is on that committee &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour and Fine Gael &mdash; but it is <Col N="33"/>contemptuously ignored by the Government.  Let us begin to change the way we do business here and there is some chance we can offer leadership to the people, who are craving it at a time when they are petrified with fear given the way the economy is going.</P>
        <P>If anything, the views of the Department of Finance are highly optimistic about the scale of the challenge we face.  We need to have an honest debate about this and to articulate strategies, not just &euro;2 billion for next year, but how we are going to confront this over a series of years.  That debate has not started in this House and the Government stands condemned for failing to act.</P>

	<P>We are here to debate what is an obvious crisis and also to look for ways out of it, which I believe exist.  We should acknowledge the situation and what got us into it.  We should acknowledge that cheap money and, yes, bad planning led to a property bubble which was one of the worst developments in the history of the State, and left young people with mountainous mortgages they will have to spend their lives paying off.  We must acknowledge there was systematic failure in our banking system, in its basic task of assessing risk and also, it is becoming apparent, in terms of individual abuses which have undermined the confidence of the people of this country and those outside in the working arrangements within that banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I am here today saying exactly that.  There has been a systematic failure in our banking system and also our regulatory system which we need to address.  We are setting the Director of Corporate Enforcement the task of going through with a fine-tooth comb any such practices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the Government going in to rescue bankers.  We need to go in to rescue the banks because those banks and bankers will be needed.  We do not need to create a pariah group in our society but we need bankers who can get back to the business they should be in, which is lending to encourage and support enterprise in our country.  That is a first task in getting us out of the crisis the banking failure, the planning failure and the property bubble failure got us into.</P>
        <P>I meet many people on a daily basis who tell me I am very unlucky to have gone into Government at a time of such difficulties.  I must be honest and say that is not the way I look at it.  In a strange way, it is a time for all of us, on either side of the House, to rise to the task of public service, which is an honourable one whether one is in government or opposition.  However, being in government brings particular responsibilities.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>I entered into government with my Green Party colleagues because I believed the long-term thinking embodied in our party&rsquo;s basic philosophy is exactly what is needed now.  It was due to that long-term analysis that, throughout these recent years as a property bubble evolved and these banking failures became apparent, we saw it for what it was.  We now see the way out of this difficulty.  We are in government to serve the national interest.  I am in government working day in, day out, night and day, because I see a way for this country out of this difficulty, based on the sustainable long-term thinking which we have been working on for 25 years as a party.</P>
        <P>That is the answer I give to people when they tell me it must be shocking.  It is shocking.  The crisis is difficult.  However, when one has a sense of where we have to go, it is not as shocking and helps to overcome the fear and the sense of uncertainty and inaction which comes with the crisis.  Acting is exactly what we are doing now.</P>
        <P>With regard to one of the major news stories today, it is interesting that the US Government has had its stimulus package accepted to get the US out of crisis.  The key details of the package confirmed to me that the actions we are taking are in the right direction and are the right actions to bring economic recovery.</P>
        <P>In considering what is new at the centre of that economic package which has been agreed in the United States, five points stand out.  The first is the development of renewable energy, which will power that country and our country regardless of what happens in Saudi Arabia or Russia.  Crucially, the development of the grid is centre stage.  I seek to ensure that what I am doing day in, day out, is actually delivering such infrastructure and delivering the grid.  We saw yesterday the ability of the Government and our people to get support from the European Union for a &euro;100 million injection, which is important at this time when money is hard to come by, to build one of the crucial parts of that infrastructure, the connection between the north of Dublin city and north Wales, which is a vital and valuable lifeline for this country that will bring down our electricity prices and give us a secure supply.  I look for the support on the other side of the House for EirGrid as we develop this crucial piece of infrastructure for us to move to the new economic energy future, which is the development of Grid 25.  We are doing it.</P>
        <P>I hear the talk about energy efficiency and the retrofitting of homes, which many people are now coming to, but which we have been actually working on for four or five years in opposition and in government.  Last year, we tried and tested a working model of the best way to deliver these new energy efficiency packages for the home, and we found they work.  In this cold winter, we will be able to go out to every single home, in every single county, and offer an investment that is better than any other and gives a better return than any other, to insulate each home and save hundreds of euros this year, next year and every year thereafter because it is an investment that is true, wise and risk-free.</P>
        <P>The third big element of the package in the United States concerns the development of schools broadband.  I have just come from a meeting with the Minister for Education and Science where we were tying down the details of how we roll out to our secondary schools the sort of high-speed broadband I believe is central to any new education system.  We need to give our students the chance to learn how to learn, rather than to learn off.  We can get access to information via the new broadband network.  We need to give them the confidence and the ability, which they surely have, to use it in an innovative and flexible way.  We are not talking about it, we are doing it.  We are targeting schools, learning from there and going on across the country.</P>
        <P>In terms of the package in the US, the US Administration is talking about ways in which it will try to cover those rural areas that currently do not have broadband.  We are not talking about it; we are already doing it.  Last week we launched a &euro;223 million broadband programme <Col N="35"/>which will cover every parish in the country that cannot get broadband currently.  This will be delivered in conjunction with the private sector and will start in April.  This is the action necessary to restore confidence and generate economic renewal.  The fundamental message of the package in the US is that investment in science, research and development is its cornerstone.  It is, similarly, the cornerstone of the economic plan this Government has set.  The design for a smart, sustainable and renewable economy is based on two sound foundations.  First, investment in research which is already under way.  Science Foundation Ireland is leading the country into the future in this regard and this is the correct way to proceed.  This is backed up and it is one and the same as the development of a green economy.  A digital economy based on a clean power supply will be secure forever and a day, because it is our own.  This is such a clear and clever direction in which to go that it may seem too simple.  However, this is the plan and the actions emerging from it are substantial.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The plan will provide economic recovery and it can provide hope for our people.  The green economy will provide real jobs, such as those for the people who insulate homes and the lawyers who sign the contracts for wind turbines.  Factories and data centres will be able to work off cheaper power sourced from the energy future we are plotting.  This economic plan will save money.  As every kilowatt of electricity is generated, it will save money as well as creating jobs.  Every house and school retrofitted is saving money as well as keeping people warm.</P>
        <P>The plan is based on a vision which can raise people&rsquo;s spirits, which is perhaps more important than anything else in these dark and difficult days.  A sense of direction and clarity about where we are going is vital.  In this regard Ireland can be the silicon valley of Europe.  We can set ourselves a bold vision of a green island with a green economy which fits into the broader direction in which the world is moving.  We have a real-world plan which can save the country.  We are not discussing the plan, we are implementing it every day.  This action supports the people and provides a sense of courage for what will be difficult times, but not times which we cannot overcome.  I look forward to the task and to continuing to work with my colleagues in Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This morning on the RTE news I heard that the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, is jetting off to the once-a-year schmooze-fest for the ultra-rich in Davos, Switzerland.  It was interesting to note that during the week the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> and <i>The New York Times</i> have put this fundamental question in the context of Davos: could the much-maligned social welfare systems in Europe end up being the model of the 21st century?  This has been suggested because of the extent of the bank failures and job losses, the wiping out of retirement savings and the loss of health cover.  This has taken place in the US economy in particular, but also more generally in the private sector in countries throughout the globe.  The conclusion in the editorials of these newspapers yesterday was that support is growing for what they call a European-style safety net and that Mr. Keynes&rsquo;s economics is back in fashion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the officials in the Department of Finance will note that the US President, Mr. Barack Obama, and his team are busy studying the Swedish solution to the banking crisis of the 1990s, along with the Dutch and Swiss health care models based on universal health provision.  I am certain they will do so.  These are the objectives of Mr. Obama.  I refer to a quote from Mr. Kenneth Rogoff, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  I am certain those in the Department of Finance will recognise him as a credible authority.  He made an interesting point yesterday, stating that when the world&rsquo;s biggest economy, namely, the US, and the world&rsquo;s biggest emerging economy, namely, China, look for lessons in the same place, <Col N="36"/>namely, Europe and the European social model, at the same time, it is clear that something is up.  We are witnessing a paradigm shift towards a more European social state.</P>
        <P>While the Taoiseach is up in the clear mountain air in Davos with its extraordinarily rich parties and its festivities for the super-rich, I hope he will be able to open his mind to the fact that Ireland needs a third way, that is, a mixed economy.  This is inevitable with the collapse of the banking industry and I will discuss the blame for that presently.  However, given the collapse of our banking and financial industries in the past five months, there should be a bigger role for the State in financial and banking affairs.  That is inevitable and there is no point in the right-wing people in Fianna F&aacute;il gnashing their teeth.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, we saw a display of childish antics by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  It is clear the management of the banking crisis is beyond the capacity of the officials in the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, who only recently held the position of Minister for Finance, and the Merrill Lynch advisors.  As we know, the Merrill Lynch advisors are not without their own problems.</P>
        <P>We must have a framework comprising an individual or a group of people with serious national and international credibility to oversee the stabilisation of the banking system.  It is possible we will need to create an Irish version of the Resolution Trust Corporation, RCT, established in the US to help solve the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s.  By way of parallel, Sweden set up the Bank Support Authority with a similar function in the early 1990s during its crisis.  This idea has a good deal of merit, because once we get beyond the very immediate banking crisis, or once a clear strategy for doing so becomes apparent, the Minister for Finance and his officials will have a great many more pressing issues in their in-boxes than micro-managing the entire Irish banking sector.  Furthermore, they do not have the expertise or the experience to do so.  In any case, we are not there yet as we have seen from the Government contributions to the debate.</P>
        <P>My proposal should be realised on a genuinely bipartisan basis rather than the usual old boys club of the Fianna F&aacute;il golden circle.  Last week, in contrast to the remarks of the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, Mr. Barack Obama stated that what we need is a clean break from business as usual.  There are many difficulties involved, including the fair value price for assets.  I will not elaborate on this, but it is the heart of the matter.  If fair values are not calculated, there could be gross corruption in the system I propose.</P>
        <P>There is a systemic problem requiring a systemic answer.  In proposing such a resolution for the banking and finance sector, there should be a parallel mortgage protection agency framework.  I realise there are proposals in the Government&rsquo;s framework document, but they are very tepid.  A mortgage protection agency framework could sit within the National Treasury Management Agency and it could help people aged between 30 to 45 years who are married or in a relationship with two or three small children and living in large houses.  It is possible in such cases that one parent has lost his or her job or perhaps both are working reduced time.  Such people will not lose their house this month or next month, but nevertheless they are terrified of the consequences.  We should say to these people, who represent the bedrock of the Celtic tiger, that there could be a mortgage protection agency framework.  If the banks repossess houses they can do nothing with them.  The Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, might buy them cheaply, but that is not a solution either.  We need such a framework.  The Labour Party suggests these two very workable and practical proposals, but they must be created on a bipartisan <Col N="37"/>basis.  We already have a start-up vehicle and resources available in the form of the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
        <P>The Irish economy needs a reformed banking sector and hopefully we will end up with at least two Irish-owned banks based in Ireland.  While that certainly is a highly desirable objective, there must be a searching evaluation of the economic trade-offs between what is desirable in Irish banking and what should be the maximum cost to the Irish taxpayer and the maximum financial risk exposure to the Irish public finances.  There is no doubt that last September the Government made one appalling mistake in the manner in which it structured the guarantee.  Only history will tell whether this will turn out to be the most expensive decision by any Irish Government, which has put the fundamental finances of the State at some risk.  Moreover, no solution is guaranteed as yet as we are not out of the woods in respect of the banking crisis.</P>
        <P>As for Anglo Irish Bank, while I do not have time to go into that issue in detail, the abuses there must be addressed.  An inspector must be appointed to recover Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and to send out a message that we are clearing out and cleaning out wrongdoing.  That is important and will help in the restoration of our reputation in places such as the United Kingdom and the United States where, unfortunately, it has been shredded by the Government and its actions.  However, the most important solution is to get investment going again in the trading sectors of the economy, namely industry, tourism and export services.  Our small economy cannot prosper without getting investment and credit flows going again.  The question is whether Ireland should adopt a strategy that belatedly will encourage higher-productivity indigenous industry.  This issue must be considered.</P>
        <P>Finally, the public sector did not cause this economic crisis.  Fianna F&aacute;il mismanagement did, particularly that of Charlie McCreevy, Deputy Bertie Ahern and, unfortunately, Deputy Brian Cowen, who inherited their policies on becoming Minister for Finance.  Nevertheless, the public sector reform issue will form part of the solution.  Members must stand back and be fair when evaluating the strengths and failures of the public sector in Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s facilitation, through benchmarking, of the creation of what is called in the United States a muffin ring or spare tyre of unnecessary administration in the Irish public service must be addressed.  This applies to public administration in many areas, including local authorities, in which binmen and park workers have been sacked without preventing an increase in the numbers in middle management or the amount of reporting.  This dilemma, which we have created for ourselves, must be addressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I recognise this is the most serious issue to be dealt with by Members since I entered this House.  At the outset, I wish to express my disagreement with the previous speaker, Deputy Burton, who stated that Fianna F&aacute;il mismanagement caused this crisis.  For too long, Members have listened to arguments to the effect that events in Ireland differ from those in most of the rest of the developed world.  If one reads the financial newspapers or considers what is happening in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, where this has been called Black Thursday, Russia or China, Ireland does not appear to have a particular issue.  A global situation exists and due recognition must be given to that point.  I agree with Deputy Burton on one point, namely, that the banking sector has been the catalyst for some problems and I refer to sub-prime lending in the United States in particular.  However it is neither right nor fair to portray events in Ireland as being different from what is happening globally as that is not the position.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>Confidence certainly has been undermined in the banking system both in Ireland and internationally and this issue must be addressed.  At some point, a genuine debate must be held on whether we should establish what is loosely referred to as a bad bank, to absorb some of the debt or distressed or doubtful assets of such banks.  However, doing so independently as a nation will not address this issue, which will require international support.  As for the position regarding banking, Deputy Burton referred to Anglo Irish Bank.  While I do not wish to pick on any individual bank, I question the policies and strategies of directors of banks in general, in which short-term profit on a year by year basis was advanced ahead of security and longer-term strategic decisions.  Moreover, the existence of more immediate aims to address should not mean that the Government will neglect to consider these issues.  If there was wrongdoing, those involved should be taken to task and there should be no place to hide.</P>
        <P>In addition, regardless of whether one agreed with the guarantee system that has been provided, the State has a highly influential role in the banking system.  One of the first things we should do, irrespective of whether any other supports are established, is that every bank that granted domestic residential mortgages that are less than five years old should conduct health checks on such mortgages.  In other words, the recipients of such loans should be brought in and met by the banks.  As a public representative, people visit my constituency clinic whose financial circumstances have changed.  While such people may still be working, they may no longer enjoy bonuses or a partner may either have lost his or her job or been given reduced hours.  While it would be prudent to so do, it should be obligatory to review, as a matter of urgency, any mortgage issued in the past five years, while adopting a flexible approach to rescheduling and so forth.</P>
        <P>As for the economy, I was self-employed for a long time before entering this House and started a business at a time of recession.  However there is one fundamental difference at present, in that well in excess of 2.1 million people are working.  The challenge facing the Government is to try to maximise and maintain as many of those jobs as possible.  While this will be a difficult task, that is the job at hand.  In that regard, I have heard Members of the Opposition assert the Government has no strategy.  It does have a strategy, which is to narrow the gap between revenue and expenditure, and the specific strategy for the current year pertains to the sum of &euro;2 billion that has been mentioned.  The difference is that the implementation of the strategy is being discussed with the social partners.  Members on this side of the House fundamentally believe in social partnership.  It has worked well for Ireland in the past during good times and as we now face more challenging times, where better to sit to implement the strategy than with the social partners?  The strategy has been articulated clearly and repeatedly in this House by the Taoiseach.  The figure of &euro;2 billion for the current year has been given and the detail and implementation of that strategy is being discussed with the social partners.  This marks the difference between Members on this side of the House and those on the other side, who do not necessarily agree with such an approach.  While the Taoiseach has been the subject of criticism in this regard, the Government fundamentally believes that social partnership has worked in good times and the challenges now facing Ireland will best be faced through that mechanism.  However, the strategy has been articulated clearly by the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good that this debate is occurring against a background in which, literally within the past 48 hours, we have been inching towards a framework agreement with the social partners.  As the previous speaker stated clearly, it is hugely important that our commitment to the partnership process be worked on and renewed.  That process was born not of success, <Col N="39"/>but of relative economic failure in 1987, when many people believed the outcomes for Ireland in respect of jobs and opportunities were rather hopeless.  It was against such a background that the then Government, led by Mr. Haughey, engaged with the social partners with a view to stabilising our situation and putting us on a trajectory of growth.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Today, Ireland is a radically different place in which 2 million people are in employment, 600,000 more than was the case a decade ago in 1997.  The social partners are willing to play their part in the financial and expenditure adjustments that must be made.  This will not be an easy process merely because we are inching towards an agreement pertaining to a framework for decisions to be made in this regard.  This will not make it easy because there will be intense negotiations and discussions through the coming year, 18 months or two years or for as long as it takes to ensure that whatever adjustments are made will be accompanied by broad consensus and agreement between the social partners and the Government.  It is a great sign of leadership by Deputy Brian Cowen as Taoiseach to have stuck with this process, despite the negative voices from the Opposition and other sources from outside this parliamentary arena who, towards the end of last year, tried to urge him to abandon this entire process and throw it aside in favour of draconian cuts.  Ultimately, it would have been done without consensus and agreement being formed, and would have led to a difficult situation in this country not unlike that which we can observe clearly in one of our EU partner countries, namely France, where widespread industrial disputes, strikes and unrest have been occasioned by a similar effort on the part of President Sarkozy.  We wish him well, nonetheless, but we note that Ireland is quite different in its approach and wishes to proceed by way of consensus where that is possible.  Consensus may not be possible in the year or two years ahead, but at least a framework has been established against which we can benchmark and look at what we are doing in a timely and proper fashion, consistent with our country&rsquo;s history and traditions of proceeding by way of consensus.</P>
        <P>It is also important to recognise what the view of those observers who were urging us to abandon partnership at the back end of last year would have been if we faced into a deep winter of discontent featuring industrial relations disputes with large public utilities literally shutting down the lights and power supply.  A much different form of criticism then would have been directed at the Taoiseach as to why he had not stuck it out.  The Taoiseach and the Government have stuck it out with the social partnership experiment, which has been good since 1987.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know from my experience in business working with a number of companies such as Radio 2000, Digifone, O2 and Radio Bohemia, and, indeed, as a company adviser, that the most important action to take in such crises as that which have assailed this economy and the world economy is to get costs down.  That is the simple business response to a challenge of the kind we now face.  We must get our costs down, both in the public and private realms.  Often people like myself who have had experience in business can be rather glib about suggesting similar solutions to the public sector.  However, we must be aware that in a private sector setting, as I often saw in those companies in which I worked, it is easy for management to click the finger and achieve the cost savings and, because it is a private sector employment setting, employees are often far more willing there to accept cutbacks because they know their jobs are on the line than those, for instance, in the public sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For that reason the Taoiseach has again been proved correct, that to negotiate and achieve savings in a public setting requires considerable patience and negotiation skills, in all of which, incidentally, I believe he is uniquely capable of as a former Minister for Finance and Foreign Affairs and Minister with responsibility for labour at the critical time when this partnership process was beginning.  I applaud his decision to stick this out.  We will all look back in a year or two and say how right he was to proceed in that way.</P><Col N="40"/>
        <P>As I stated, it is easy to click the fingers in a private sector company as a senior executive and achieve savings across the board.  It is much harder in the public sector, precisely because it is taxpayers&rsquo; money and there is a more secure form of employment available to those who work in the public sector.</P>
        <P>However, let nobody be under any illusions.  The public sector, including the political class, will have to make sacrifices.  The Cabinet and members of the Government have already done their bit in that direction by taking a 10% pay cut.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to note that cut and to proceed accordingly to other realms and parts of the public sector to achieve similar savings, if possible.</P>
        <P>There was a hint of criticism in the previous speakers comments on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s presence in Davos.  We should not make any apology for his presence there.  He is meeting senior executives from global companies who could potentially invest in this country.</P>

        <P>This has probably been the worst Government since the foundation of the State.  I suppose it has been the most reckless Government.  Not alone has it cost thousands of jobs, but it nearly has the country in serious difficulty.</P>
        <P>When the economy was going well the Government was great for taking full credit for it.  On many occasions at budget time the Fianna F&aacute;il choir clapped the Minister for Finance on issues such as decentralisation and all that was going on in this country and many senior Ministers told me on many occasions it was the work of the great Fianna F&aacute;il Party with the Progressive Democrats.  The Progressive Democrats were to break the mould, but they broke the country.  They were the ones who were telling us how wonderful they were and by God, they have brought this country into disrepair.</P>
        <P>The people want an adjudication on this Government.  What is really needed is a general election because they want to get rid of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ring did not accept the result of the last one.  Why would he want another?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The people are just sick and tired of them.</P>
        <P>There are two laws in this country, one for the rich and one for the poor.  The poor go to jail when they break the law and the rich get big bonuses.  For example, we were paying people such as the Financial Regulator, to whom we were giving a big bonus and who is now retiring, <Col N="41"/>who did not do his job.  He came in to committees, and he certainly did not do his job.  Neither did the governor of the Central Bank, and what do we do with him?  We reappoint him.</P>
        <P>The banks are in total disarray.  They have let down the Government, they have let down the people and they have let down the country, and what has happened?  The small men and women of this country, the taxpayers, must pick up the tab again for the banks.  That is not right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We warned the people of this country.  We warned them about the Galway tent which was dictating policy.  The Government was telling us that it did not need us, that it would get this country moving and was creating employment.  I can tell the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, that they have created chaos in this country.  What if somebody does not pay a price?  The governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator should have been sacked when we saw what was unfolding.  Instead we are giving them bonuses and rewards.</P>
        <P>I want to make a few positive suggestions.  Currently there are 70,000 houses unoccupied.  If, tomorrow morning, the Government was to get the 13% VAT on them, it would amount to approximately &euro;2.7 billion.  The Minister and the Government should immediately speak to the Construction Industry Federation about these houses at their present prices and give young couples and first-time buyers a &euro;10,000 grant because the Government must act like the supermarkets and other outlets, and hold a sale as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ring would accuse us of supporting developers again if we did that.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is supporting them because it is after bringing the Galway tent down to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green with Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Bullshit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has supported and protected them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, knows the Government has protected them and should not aggravate me now.  It is the Government, the developers and Fianna F&aacute;il who have this country the way it is.  They looked after them long enough.  Do not give me that rubbish now.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il and the developers and the builders were side-by-side in the Galway tent, and one can see what they did to us.  With them and Anglo Irish Bank, the taxpayer must bail them out and nobody has been prosecuted for it.</P>
        <P>Deputy Power ought not vex me because it is the small person out there who has lost his or her job.  These are people who are paying large mortgages.  It is the taxpayer who must bail them out.</P>
        <P>I want to finish my suggestion.  Give &euro;10,000 to the first-time buyers.  At least some of that &euro;2.7 billion would come into the coffers of the Government and the Government would be doing something good for young people and first-time buyers.</P>
        <P>For the past ten years we had Ministers out there creating jobs in the public sector in every quango one could think of.  In the case of the chairman and members of every quango, we should be told &mdash; there should be a record &mdash; of their salaries, expenses and what they are drawing down.  The quangos have been the greatest scandal since the foundation of the State, and they continue.  We should be closing the quangos and taking out these chief executives for the kind of money that they are getting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Deputy Ring and my party leader, Deputy Kenny, who stated on Tuesday that the Government was bereft of ideas, decisions, direction and the courage to govern.  No one denies the extent of the problems facing the economy.  With a hole in our finances worth &euro;15 billion, we must find a further &euro;2 billion this year.  The ESRI forecasted that another 120,000 people will be unemployed by the end of this year.  Compared to our last recession, which occurred in the 1980s, this recession is ten or 20 times worse.  The most jobs lost in a single year in the 1980s was 25,000 and, unlike then, our banks have serious problems.</P>
        <P>Every day, streams of people attend my constituency office, the latest victims of the Government&rsquo;s inability to grapple with the enormity of the crisis.  They come from all walks of life, including engineering professionals, the self-employed in particular, and manufacturing and shop workers.  They never believed that they could find themselves in this serious situation.  In the past 12 months, the number on the live register in my constituency of County Clare has increased by 59.8%.  I could name all of the companies that have closed.  For example, Molex Limited in Shannon will shed 150 jobs, but Dell was the largest case in the mid-west, involving 1,900 job losses, of which 400 people came from County Clare.</P>
        <P>In these changed economic times, we also have a problem with the separation of the airports.  Today, rumours tell of how Ryanair is about to reduce from six to four its number of aircraft based at Shannon Airport.  This would result in routes from the airport being axed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning to small and medium enterprises, small shops close every day in my constituency, resulting in four, six or ten people losing their jobs.  Such closures are going unnoticed for a number of reasons.  The Government must address our VAT rates, which are driving hundreds and thousands of people across the Border because they are less favourable than the United Kingdom&rsquo;s.  There is a crisis in the farming community. Many farmers took on bridging loans because they wanted to undertake projects under the farm waste management scheme.  Last night, the House was told that, more or less, there is no money to pay the farmers because the Government cannot do its sums.  These factors exist against a backdrop of a Government that has shown no leadership and a Taoiseach who told the House that he intends to do it his way.  The fear is that, by doing it his way, he might be biting off more than he can chew.</P>
        <P>I understand that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will establish a task force on the mid-west in the next day or so and that its members will be announced shortly.  However, Fine Gael has made proposals and taken the lead throughout the crisis.  In fact, most of the ideas tabled by Deputy Bruton have been taken on by the Government.  We in the mid-west also have ideas.  Our party leader will be there next week to announce our initiative.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, our region has no ministerial clout and no one is prepared to stand up and be counted.  Our former Ministers, people such as Deputy Noonan and Des O&rsquo;Malley, were great, but no Minister is fighting for us now.  If a task force is to be established, it must have the clout, teeth and resources to do the job instead of simply being a talking shop.</P>
        <P>Leadership is about action, not position.  Last night, the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, announced a $825 billion economic stimulus package.  Already, the markets have reacted positively.  People will accept pain, but only if it is shared equitably.  As Deputy Ring stated, the most vulnerable in society should not pay a price because of those bankers who have brought us to our knees by bankrolling their developer friends.  People like Mr. Se&aacute;n Fitzpatrick must be held to account for their actions.</P>
        <P>We can no longer afford to go without actions or plans.  We can recover, but leadership, which is absent on the other side of the House, will be required.</P>

	<P>It is nice to have some agreement.  When the Minister for Finance introduced his budget in October, there was little appreciation of the enormous task facing the country.  As we head into the end of January, there is a much better understanding of the challenges that lie ahead.  We are experiencing a sharp economic downturn.  As other Deputies have mentioned, it is occurring in most countries and is not confined to Ireland.</P>

	<P>They are dealing with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Several factors have contributed to the situation, many of which were external but some of which were of our own making and from which we must learn lessons.  At this stage, the country needs a prescription, not a post mortem.  The Taoiseach and his Government colleagues have entered negotiations with the social partners with a view to agreeing on the necessary medicine, not just for 2009, but up to 2013.  While agreement has not yet been reached, we are hopeful and I would like to acknowledge the maturity shown by all sides involved in the talks.  No easy solutions are available, difficult decisions must be taken and there will be much pain.  However, it is in the national interest that everyone make the necessary sacrifices.  The more people who make those sacrifices, the quicker will be our recovery.</P>
        <P>Retaining a good credit rating is vital.  In light of demands placed on other countries and their borrowing requirements, it is important that we demonstrate a strategy to address our situation.  I hope it will become clearer next week.  We are a small country that depends on exports.  It is important that we display our attractiveness for investment and as a good place in which to do business.  The importance of our membership of the euro has not been emphasised enough, nor the protection it lent us during the recent turbulence in the money markets.  Were we outside the eurozone, we could have experienced something similar to the Icelandic situation.</P>
        <P>In recent days, much emphasis has been placed on the Government&rsquo;s plan to reduce expenditure, to which we are committed, but we must also be aware of the need to continue investing in infrastructure.  Given yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of an investment of &euro;1.44 billion in the national roads programme for this year, it is clear we are placing considerable importance on capital expenditure.  It makes a great deal of sense because it improves our infrastructure, provides important employment and creates a certain amount of economic activity.</P>
        <P>Several measures taken by my Department will be beneficial in terms of improving competitiveness and providing employment.  The energy sector is pivotal to national competitiveness and continued economic and social prosperity.  A key element of the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal is the investment in renewable energy, the promotion of the green enterprise sector and the creation of &ldquo;green collar&rdquo; jobs.  Funding of &euro;20 million was provided in October&rsquo;s budget for the home energy savings scheme, which operated on a pilot basis in 2008.  This level of investment will support energy efficiency measures in more than 12,000 homes.  Some &euro;5 million was also provided for the warmer homes scheme and is to be supplemented by funds from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  This investment will underpin the delivery of greater energy efficiency in the homes of disadvantaged persons through insulation and upgrading work, necessary parts of the scheme.</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P>These and other schemes operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland provide an example of how the targeted use of public funding can help address Ireland&rsquo;s energy efficiency issues and deliver employment and enterprise opportunities while helping to meet carbon reduction targets.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s ocean energy resources offer significant potential to add to our renewable energy capacity.  Ocean energy is in its early stages of development worldwide, but Ireland is one of the best placed countries to capitalise on this resource and to develop a viable industry.  The overall objective is to provide the infrastructure so that Ireland will be a world leader in harnessing ocean energy.  While spend was below target in 2008, as it took time to get the new scheme in place, it is expected that some &euro;7 million will be expended under this heading in 2009.</P>
        <P>A world class communications infrastructure is critical to our continued economic and social prosperity.  The Government is setting the development of a knowledge society at the heart of our economic and social policies.  If it is to be effective, Ireland requires a national broadband infrastructure of world class standards.  This will attract the cutting edge knowledge-based industries needed to secure Ireland&rsquo;s future economic prosperity and competitiveness.  Equally, this will benefit society and the consumer by delivering greater broadband coverage, lower costs and higher speeds.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that broadband is now available in almost all parts of Ireland through a combination of digital subscriber line, fixed wireless, cable, mobile and satellite technologies.  The Government announced last week its intention to ensure the availability of broadband throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Many difficult decisions need to and will be made.  There has been much doom and gloom in recent times, which is understandable.  However, it is the Government&rsquo;s job to replace that with hope.  We have shown in the past that we have the capacity to make this country great, not alone in economic terms but from a business and sporting point of view.  Many sporting people have given great leadership to this country and have shown we can compete with the best.  The situation need be no different when it comes to governing and tough decision-making.</P>
        <P>I am delighted with the support of the social partners and wish them well in the negotiations.  It is hoped that next week they will provide the agreement that will be the springboard for economic recovery of the country.</P>

	<P>I am reminded, on hearing Members opposite speak about Shannon, of the remarks of a famous former leader of Fine Gael, the late Deputy Dillon, in regard to rabbits and hares hopping around the tarmac in Shannon.  He was, of course, wrong.  All pronouncements since then by Fine Gael in regard to such projects have been wrong.</P>
        <P>Similarly, another former Member of the House, the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, spoke about a foggy boggy hill in Knock.  Knock has been a tremendous success and a catalyst for growth and development in the economies of the north-west region of our country.</P>

	<P>He had amazing influence on Shannon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I forecast that the predictions from the opposite side of the House will again prove to be wrong, as they always have been.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that every Member of this House sets out the facts in respect of the economic crisis facing this country.  This crisis is not the result of internal matters alone.  It is often said that the construction industry and the bust in that regard is responsible for what happened in terms of the projected growth in our economy.  The construction industry is responsible for approximately 4% to 5% of the reduction in GDP.  What happened in the US and to the banking system worldwide could not have been predicted by anybody in the world, let alone anyone in Ireland.  Economic forecasting is changing week on week.  Geniuses in the economic field rather than politicians, are changing their forecasts week on week and we are not immune to this.</P>
        <P>Also, we have been affected by differences in respect of the euro and pound and the euro and the dollar.  We export 40% of our goods to Britain and the United States.  Changes in currencies have dramatically affected our export value.  The Government has taken action.  It has been stated that the Government has been doing nothing for the past couple of months.  The Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and other Ministers have been working with experts in their Departments and with other experts to address what has been happening in the banking world, a situation that has been shifting like the sands.  I believe the decision in respect of the bank guarantee scheme brought about certainty in our financial system.  The decisions in respect of the takeover of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of the other banks will succeed in due course in returning to the market the liquidity necessary to refuel our economic and business world.</P>
        <P>I regret I do not have time to address other issues.  I have confidence in the Government ensuring that we return during the next couple of years to where we were one year ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies English and McGinley.</P>
        <P>We are living in unprecedented times and in a new economic era.  Also, we are living through social change brought about by economic turmoil.  The seriousness of this situation does not need to be assessed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We, as politicians, have a serious role to play in terms of assisting people to work through this difficult time.  The world economy has caused us huge problems.  However, we have a duty to do things that are good for our economy.  Many of us lived through tough times in the 1980s, when interest rates were as high as 21% and 22% and inflation stood at approximately 18%.  People were vulnerable and many had their lands taken from them when the ACC sent in assessors to farms.</P>
        <P>The current situation, in terms of people&rsquo;s homes, is similar.  People are in enormous debt.  People in their 30s have debts of up to &euro;300,000-&euro;400,000 and many of them are losing their jobs.  What can be done?  We, as politicians, have a duty to stand up to the banks.  Some weeks ago, we bailed out the banks.  Anyone in their right mind will acknowledge that one&rsquo;s home is one&rsquo;s castle.  People must be allowed to retain their homes, whatever it takes.  Many friends of mine were in financial difficulties in the 1980s.  At that time, a moratorium was placed on mortgage interest and capital sums were set aside for a while, thus allowing people to retain their land.  The banks and the Government have a responsibility to help young people now in difficulty through no fault of their own.  We must force the banks to allow people to keep their homes.</P><Col N="46"/>
        <P Just="Left">Another section of society forgotten about in this debate on the economy are elderly people in the community.  Local authorities in my constituency do not have the resources to meet applications under the housing aid for the elderly scheme or the home improvement scheme, much lauded here week in and week out.  Skilled tradesmen are joining the dole queues in every town and village throughout the country.  We must challenge the social partners to ensure that skilled people who cannot get work are employed to assist older people by way of installation of windows, doors and so on in their homes.  These people want to work; they do not want to be unemployed.  There has been much talk about cutbacks.  The reality is that we must get people working and keep the cycle going.  The opportunity exists to ensure that skilled people such as plumbers, plasterers and so on obtain employment, perhaps through the introduction of a scheme that would allow them to assist older people with work in their homes.  I ask that the Government consider this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much I would like to say but, unfortunately, I only have time to touch on a few issues.  I want first to follow on from what my colleague, Deputy Hayes, had to say in respect of utilising the skills of unemployed people, an issue I have spoken on many times in this House since last January during which time Members opposite chose to ignore the problems that were looming.</P>
        <P>Many skilled people are now unemployed.  The country cannot sustain unemployment levels of 400,000 people.  We were told on budget day that unemployment levels might reach 8%.  I said on that occasion they could reach as high as 15%, which is where we are rapidly heading.  I regret our unemployment levels will reach 15%, which we cannot afford.  This is wrong socially, financially and for so many other reasons.</P>
        <P>We must use our imagination to match new employment initiatives and skills where jobs need to be done.  The housing stock throughout the country needs to be totally refurbished, windows, doors, plumbing and so on.  There are schools which need to be made energy efficient and so on.  There is plenty of work the State could borrow capital to fund, to match up with the current cost of the dole to get things done with the money rather than have it go down the drain.  Also, it is better for people to work, but I have detected no movement from the Government with regard to that area of activity.  I hope it will be addressed in the plan next Tuesday because that is a practical area which would facilitate the better use of State money to get us through the current difficulties and leave us in an improved position thereafter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a serious problem when people lose jobs and must face massive debt repayments, mainly mortgages.  In some cases the State pays interest to cover some of the mortgage repayments.  That is a good system but again, it is under pressure and perhaps will not continue.  In other cases people lose a house and avail of rent allowance.  Either way, there is a massive cost involved for the State which needs to be addressed.  It might be worthwhile for the State to buy up some of those mortgages on a 50-50 basis, say, similar to the shared ownership schemes being administered by local authorities.  Perhaps the State could buy a share of the house or do a deal with the banks, either the one it now owns or those it will buy in the future, to put a stay on such mortgages for two or three years to give people a breather.  Then we can attempt to tackle the high wage costs and other areas.</P>
        <P>We have to tackle the cost of business.  Ireland has the highest costs in most categories, for example, energy, property debt, rents, water rates, fuel charges, council charges, contribution levies and so on.  These are, in effect, all Government charges.  While we cannot get rid of them all we can work on particular areas to try to make a difference and get business competitive.</P>
        <P>We also need a job protection plan.  I am fed up listening to talk about all those fancy tax incentives for research and development, future job creation and so on.  That is lovely and it is <Col N="47"/>needed, but we also need protection plans to keep the jobs we have.  That means helping out existing businesses, should that be needed, perhaps with finance.  As I have said on numerous occasions over the last six months, they might be given the services of professional people who are trained in finance, legal matters, debt collecting and so on, to help them reorganise so that they can come up with better business plans and therefore get credit from the banks.  Let us help business.  It needs help.  It is not the big initiatives that will matter so much as the little ones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>We all realise the seriousness of the situation.  The latest report this morning from the Central Bank is more pessimistic that anything that has emerged in the past year, with its announcement that GNP will decrease by a further 5% this year.  That is very serious. </P>
        <P>We on this side of the House realised how serious it was long before Members on the Government side.  Only a few weeks ago they were saying that these are not the 1980s.  I was here in the 1980s and I know how serious it was, but there is no comparison with the situation now.  In the limited time I have, I want to demonstrate how serious the impact is on my constituency in Donegal, where most of the indigenous industries are in very big trouble.  The fishing industry, agriculture, construction and tourism are gone in every part of the country, and in Donegal.  This time last year in Donegal there were 9,000 on the live register.  The last figure published for the month of December was 15,264, an increase in one year of more than 70%.  That is a concrete indicator of how serious is the situation in our county.</P>
        <P>Donegal is a Border county, in the front trenches when it comes to the effect of exchange rate changes on the local economy.  At present, there is almost parity between the euro and sterling and this presents a major incentive for people from my county and further south to avail of cheaper goods in Northern Ireland.  I do not know how this may be addressed.  Small businesses, many of which would have accounted for the 7,000 jobs lost in the last year, are hanging on by their fingertips.  When the banks are being recapitalised, I would appeal for consideration to be given to the plight of such small businesses and at-risk mortgage holders, so that people may have some incentive towards economic survival.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are opportunities in the shape of work that needs to be done.  There are schools to be built in our county and roads to be built too.  Yesterday the National Roads Authority revealed that the budget allocation for our county was to be reduced to &euro;9 million, while last year we got &euro;20 million and the year before &euro;32 million.  We wanted &euro;30 million this year and met the NRA, but we are now down to &euro;9 million.  There is great scope for action in the shape of the slack that needs to be taken up.  If we concentrate on improving infrastructure, schools, roads, bridges, and so on, at least it would re-employ some of these skilled people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to correct a mistake, as uttered at the time by the incumbent of the Chair in which the Acting Chair, Deputy Ardagh, is sitting.  This morning somebody said the next spot was to be taken by Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, but there was what was described as a &ldquo;no show&rdquo;.  I have never done a &ldquo;no show&rdquo;, as it is not my scene.  There was a mistake in the arrangements.  This is my time, and I should like that to be on the record.  Such a thing to say, that I made a &ldquo;no show&rdquo;.  I could not make a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; as it was not my time.  However, I am wasting time now.  My ten minutes is divided, with the permission of the House, as follows: four to me, four to Deputy Thomas Byrne and two to Deputy Michael Kennedy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I have come into the House today the Opposition Deputies have been speaking about practical matters, such as schools and roads, of which I heartily approve.  However, I was listening to them both earlier this morning and yesterday, and I never <Col N="48"/>heard such a crowd of whingers in all my life as appeared on the Fine Gael benches.  It was a big moan.  I do not mean Deputy McGinley, but his cohorts.  They do not seem to want a national agreement because they did their very best on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to ensure that if they kicked up sufficient fuss, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian  Cowen, would give in and give them the document ahead of the people with whom he was in consultation.  That would lead to some outcome, I can tell them. </P>
        <P>The partnership process is one for which there  must be respect.  Equally, of course there is respect for the people of the House.  I have lived through social partnership since 1987 and it works.  It is one of main reasons why, economically, this country did well.  I was so disappointed with the whingeing this morning.  I listened to the Fine Gael spokesman on finance but it was nothing but a big whinge.  I cannot believe he was as bad as he was.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;members of the public realise he is the best economist in this House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>If he was sitting there as long as Deputy McGinley he would not be as good at it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to continue, if I am allowed.  At times Fine Gael Members are fascinating.  They have no plan.  They say what we do wrong, but never indicate what they would do if they got into office.  That would expose them in a very meaningful way. </P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy McGinley concerning any possible fiscal stimulus in this package.  I made a strong plea at our parliamentary party meeting last Monday, as I do now, for extra money to be given to the Department of Education and Science so that repairs to primary and secondary schools can be put in train.  In a rural environment, when one sees a big sign for a new school, with the builder&rsquo;s name and men at work, one knows that it is good.  It means that local children will get a new school, parents will be satisfied and men and women are at work.</P>
        <P>Equally, there is need for a streamlined comprehensive and understandable scheme for eco-improvements to houses, whether it is solar panels or whatever, to enable skilled people to be employed in such work, leading to a cheaper heating environment for people.  I fully agree with Deputy McGinley that it is a pity not to use such resources.  The package to be concluded with the social partners will enable these matters to be dealt with.  We are lucky that we have a Taoiseach of the strength of character&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael would want to get a grip.  I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke that for Fine Gael, yesterday was all about insults.  It is all Fine Gael seemed to be worried about.  What is keeping me awake at night is the jobs situation in this country, not insults or not being involved in the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The process we are going through at present is the correct one to keep all sectors of the economy and society involved.  I am delighted to see the builders involved in it because I am sure they will have many ideas on how to spend capital money and create jobs.  We had many jobs in construction and we need more construction work to be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year, we saw a 2% reduction in national wealth.  As Deputy McGinley stated we expect it to decrease more this year and probably next year.  The impact on workers and their families is all too real.  Unemployment is rising and people are having difficulties paying their debts, particularly mortgages.  My constituency has the second-highest number of mortgaged families in the country after Deputy Michael Kennedy&rsquo;s constituency of Dublin North.  Many of these people with mortgages are suffering and cannot pay them.</P>
        <P>The Government and the social partners are discussing this crucial issue.  Not only is it important for the families who are suffering but it is also important for the wider economy.  At present, people&rsquo;s homes are not being repossessed in the same numbers as in the UK or the United States.  However, if repossessions happen here on a large scale it will have devastating effects for the wider economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Through its public expenditure programme, the Government is responsible for a large number of jobs including public sector jobs, jobs which feed off these jobs and jobs created through the capital investment programme.  Therefore, at the very least the capital investment programme should be maintained and restructured so it creates jobs.  All aspects of the programme are designed to create jobs.  If we can put money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund into bank recapitalisation, which is necessary, we should also be able to put a substantial amount of billions of euro from the fund into capital expenditure to create jobs and build roads, schools and sports and community facilities.</P>
        <P>Getting the public finances into shape is crucial, as is maintaining our triple A credit rating at international level.  This is the main background to what is happening at present in terms of a reduction in expenditure which the other parties do not seem to want.  They want it in principle but when we get down to the practicalities we will have a motion in this House criticising it.  Deputies Joe Behan and Finian McGrath will speak on such motions criticising cuts, as will the Opposition.  However, this would not be to consider the reality of the situation.  If the money is not there it cannot be spent.  The Government&rsquo;s responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.  There are other ways.  I will put forward my proposals and Deputy Byrne should listen to my speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is to spend that money as best it can.  There will be cuts, as &euro;2 billion must be cut from public expenditure this year.  Private Members&rsquo; motions will be tabled assailing the Government for doing what the Opposition has called on us to do, but in principle rather than practically.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>We must maintain our credit rating.  Fitch Ratings affirmed it last week but other agencies are keeping it under review.  It would be extremely bad for this economy to lose our triple A credit rating and if we lost it the Opposition would table a motion on it.  We have maintained it so far.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, one of my constituents telephoned me and suggested a bond for economic recovery.  I informed her that one can already invest in Government bonds, An Post savings accounts and prize bonds.  However, perhaps these are not well publicised and that what is required is to publicise and attract money through a Government bond or a bond for national recovery with a tracker rate below the rate which the Government pays on the international markets.  Many people would be prepared to put their savings into such a bond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies O&rsquo;Rourke and Thomas Byrne for sharing time.  I was supposed to speak during the slot mentioned by Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke but there was some confusion.</P>
        <P>I echo the same thought on the negativity emanating from the far side of the House which is bordering on the ridiculous.  We have not heard one proposal on how to deal with the &euro;2 billion savings needed in the public finances.  Like the Acting Chairman, in my previous business life I was taught to believe that one can only make real criticism by having a viable alternative to put in place.  I do not see any such alternatives coming from the Opposition.  Having listened to Deputy Joan Burton again this morning, I believe she is becoming the queen of gloom and doom.  This Parliament, along with business leaders, unions, farmers and all communities must play a positive role.  We need to instill confidence in the public for the sake of our future generations.</P>
        <P>We need to balance out the bad news and recognise that the glass is half full and not half empty.  We should recognise that we have 2 million people at work, most of them with good disposable incomes.  The negativity emanating from this House discourages people from spending.  Yes, we need to cut out extravagance but we must encourage people who have disposable income to avail of the good value now pertaining in goods and services.  Why not have the odd meal out in a restaurant?  Why not have the odd break in an Irish hotel?  Why not carry out that renovation to the house?  Likewise, to any person who had planned to change the family car &mdash; why not do so?  The economy needs it.  We must make money go around and there is exceptional value to be had at present.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was an exceptionally good news day.  Did we hear much about it in the media?  We had agreement by the social partners to engage in talks which we hope will be successful.  The Intel CEO confirmed that Ireland is an ideal fast-track smart economy.</P>
        <P>I wish all the participants in the discussions well.  The country is depending upon them.  I admire the philosophy of the Taoiseach and Government in continuing to engage the social partners to bring about the agreement which is badly needed.  I hope the unions, business people, farmers and the Government will conclude their negotiations satisfactorily next week and will be able to state that they did it their way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this major debate on delivering economic renewal and securing our public finances.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for listening to the concerns of Independent Deputies with regard to speaking <Col N="51"/>rights in the D&aacute;il.  I commend his efforts in asserting his authority in the D&aacute;il and protecting the rights of the Independent Deputies elected to the Oireachtas.  Inclusive politics always works and it is a marker for the future.</P>
        <P>It is a pity Deputy Thomas Byrne is not in the House because I have always stated that I will support any sensible policy which will get the country out of this economic mess.  This is not a time for playing party politics.  We have a global situation as well as a local one, particularly with regard to banking.  All Members of the Oireachtas have a national and civic duty to put their country first.  We must put on the jersey, give our views and our best ideas, roll up our sleeves and get on with it.  This is how I see my role as an Independent Member of this House.</P>
        <P>It is time for patriotism and tough decisions in the national interest.  However, tough decisions and patriotism do not include hammering senior citizens, the disabled, the sick and young children.  We could have 120,000 more job losses by 2010.  National income could fall by 10% in the same period while the tax deficit will soar to &euro;8 billion this year and will rise further in 2010.  We must ensure also that Exchequer borrowing falls below 3% by 2013.  This is the economic reality and it is not good enough to come in to this House and whinge and moan.</P>
        <P>I will support and propose the following ideas to resolve this issue.  An employer PRSI exemption should apply to businesses which take on extra staff in 2009.  We should introduce a freeze on commercial rates and other State charges for small businesses.  Recently, Dublin City Council blinked on this issue.  We should seriously consider making a major investment in training schemes for the unemployed.  We should also provide a guarantee that during the recession nobody will lose his or her home.  I welcome some of the proposals from the Department of Finance and sections of the financial industry.  A temporary cut in VAT would boost incomes and shift the expectation of a fall in prices.  We can also provide additional investment in building projects such as schools and urban regeneration, which has the potential to increase employment.  We could provide incentives to kick start an industry worth maybe &euro;25 billion, insulating homes.  We should be brave and consider renationalising the telecommunications network.  We should go for that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I offer those ideas to show that Independent Deputies do not whinge.  We may take stands but we also provide options.  I  have three sensible proposals in the construction industry.  The national centre for the visually impaired in Drumcondra has a proposal for a &euro;30 million project to develop services.  This would be a good investment with local advantages and provide jobs.  I understand that the Minister for Education and Science, and the Department are open to this.  Belgrove national school in Clontarf needs major renovation.  I strongly support the idea of creating a national team of economic experts who would meet to solve this problem.  I always supported the 10% cut in Members&rsquo; salaries but would also cut 50% of our junior Ministries.</P>
        <P>People have walked away from the tax debate.  We must accept that during the days of the Celtic tiger we did not broaden the tax base sufficiently.</P>
        <P>I strongly defend the public sector.  It did not cause the economic crisis yet every day in the newspapers the public sector is hammered.  The PAYE workers have done a great deal of work for the past 11 years yet they are being blamed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the partnership talks are going well because that assists the country in a bad time.  The Government must think of the unemployed and the weak sections of society, roll up its sleeves and get on with the job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeBehan"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Behan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman and the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important issue in a challenging time for us and for the country.  The people are anxiously awaiting the results of the negotiations with the social partners.  I support <Col N="52"/>the Government&rsquo;s intention to agree the necessary savings for the next few years with the social partners.  It is essential to have solidarity throughout society and support for the measures that must be taken.  Some people assume that everyone earning a wage is willing to take a pay cut or to make sacrifices.  I am not sure that is the case because many feel they have not earned excessive money as wage earners and PAYE workers.  They look at those who have made large fortunes in the past ten or 15 years, during the life of the Celtic tiger and would like to see the most wealthy contribute before they do.</P>
        <P>We should also be aware of events in other European countries.  The trouble started in Iceland but there is widespread civil disturbance, protests, major strikes in France and other EU countries.  We have to be concerned that governments around the world are not getting support from their people for the measures they must take.  That is why it is important that this Government stick with the partnership process.  We are relying on the success of the talks and wish the participants well.</P>
        <P>The Conference of Religious in Ireland, CORI, expressed concern yesterday that the framework document does not adequately cater for the vulnerable sections of society.  I will not accept or support actions that will affect the most vulnerable people, young, old or otherwise vulnerable.  I would not have supported it within Fianna F&aacute;il and will not support it outside the party.  If the measures are fair and most people see them as such they will deserve support.  We hope that will happen.</P>
        <P>There has been mention of a national recovery bond and an opportunity for citizens to invest some of their pay in the State and its economic recovery, by way of a return similar to the special savings incentive account scheme in better times.  I hope the Minister for Finance might consider that.  The tax base must be widened.  We relied on one-off taxes based on the construction industry and it is clear that while some enjoyed the fruits of that money we cannot rely on that.  The tax commission and its yield will be important to ensure sustainable financing of the economy.</P>
        <P>Many years ago I worked for a year for an American corporation based in Ireland.  The company had a bonus suggestion scheme whereby employees who suggested savings in the workplace received a percentage of those savings as a bonus.  Is there room for such an initiative in the public sector?  People working at the coal face might be able to suggest savings and share in their benefits.</P>
        <P>I wish the Government and all the social partners well in the negotiations.  For all our sakes I hope they are successful.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Finneran.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue.  This is not the first time we have experienced a recession.  Many Members recall previous ones but each one is different.  In the 1980s there were high interest rates, and rates of taxation whereas there was a balance of payments problem in the terrible recession that blighted the country in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>The circumstances that obtain now are very different.  Arguably we are well positioned to recover quickly from this recession.  This is an open economy as everyone knows, with a high level of exports.  It is, therefore, like a weather vane in a gale having a pronounced reaction to a tough global climate but being well-positioned to be at the forefront of a recovery when it occurs.  The steps the Government has been taking reflect the anxiety to be well prepared for a recovery in the global economy.  The launch last December of the smart economy idea was forward thinking for the medium and long term.   It tried to ensure that we would lay the plans <Col N="53"/>for the development of corporate growth in areas that everybody knows will lead economies into the future.  That is only one piece of the jigsaw.  Our actions on bank guarantees and recapitalisation is another piece, as is the work on social partnership to deliver fiscal change.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are other things to be done over the coming months, but we need to recognise at all times that much of the development of our economy is related to the sentiment, mood and atmosphere that is created.  In this regard, I advise all commentators to measure their words when they are referring to the performance of the economy.  At one stage we all said that we should not talk down the economy, and that was at a time when we did not anticipate how bad things were going to get.  Now it is more important than ever that we do not talk down the economy, that we encourage people not to postpone expenditure to the degree that it is happening at the moment, and that we allow retailers an opportunity to get back into business, because many of them are suffering.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael was telling us in October that we should follow the Spanish economic model.  We were told that the Spanish Government was providing superb leadership at that time.  We know now that Spain is in a much worse recession than Ireland.  We were told to follow the UK model of recapitalisation and told to follow the UK policy of dropping VAT rates.  None of these policies has worked.  By taking a more cautious approach, while at the same time adopting the radical policy of the bank guarantee and a smart economy, we have charted a careful course that will stand to our benefit in the months and years ahead.  If we had taken the drastic steps that had been suggested by other people in the last few months, we would have created more difficulties for ourselves.</P>
        <P>The fact that we are sticking with the capital budget is a crucial element in the preparation for recovery.  In Germany, Angela Merkel rejected the idea of a stimulus package as recently as January.  It is a field day for opposition parties across the world, because this is a developing area, circumstances are changing all the time and governments are reacting accordingly.  Angela Merkel is now proposing a capital stimulus package of 1.5% of GDP in Germany.  We have a capital stimulus package, called the national development plan, which consists of 5% of GDP.  That is not a knee-jerk reaction, but something for which we planned.  Credit has to be given for sticking to this at a time when other Governments are providing stimulus packages that are far less ambitious.</P>
        <P>I support the partnership process.  We cannot get everybody in the country into the room.  I know that the partnership process has flaws, but being unable to get everybody into a room is not an excuse to do nothing.  Bringing the partnership process with us will restore faith in the economy, and will help us towards recovery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, for sharing time with me.</P>
        <P>The Government is on the right path to steer this country successfully through the national and international financial crisis.  I have previously outlined to the House the Government&rsquo;s intentions in the various strands of the housing programme.  I would like to focus today on the new proposal I announced recently on the long-term leasing of social housing units.  Local authorities can and must be used as the real generator of economic recovery within the State.  One of the ways that local authorities can do this is through long-term leasing of housing.  I want to encourage local authorities to enter into long-term leasing arrangements, from ten to 20 years, to obtain properties to meet social housing need.  I will provide moneys under the social housing investment programme for this purpose.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>I intend to allocate &euro;20 million to local authorities to enter into long-term leases in 2009.  This &euro;20 million would allow local authorities to provide at least 2,000 units and perhaps up to 4,000 units, through leasing arrangements this year.  The same moneys would allow us to purchase something of the order of 100 properties.  There is, therefore, a major difference between what we can provide in the leasing programme, as opposed to a building programme.  This will obviously help meet housing needs, which rose by over 30% between 2005 and 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This approach has been considered for some time in the context of providing a flexible response to changing housing needs, as part of the Government&rsquo;s policy of sustainable communities.  The rental accommodation scheme, which is proving very successful and which has contributed to transferring over 18,000 households with long-term housing needs from rent supplement over the past three years, already uses availability agreements with private landlords to provide social housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the general idea of meeting social housing need through leasing has been around for some time, then the current situation, in which there are a considerable number of unsold vacant and unfinished houses around the country, provides the opportunity for local authorities to obtain a sizeable volume of housing units at very good value for the State.  Local authorities will be directed to seek properties that are compliant with current sustainable housing policies.  In other words, the only properties used will be those in the right places, with the correct tenure mix and of the right design and quality to meet the housing needs concerned.  I reject any suggestions that long-term leasing arrangements are a quick fix solution and I expect that the State will get very good value for accommodation in the current market.  There has been an increase in housing need and this initiative will help housing authorities get more households off their housing waiting lists.</P>
        <P>The local authority is the landlord under leasing, though sometimes it may enter into an agreement with a voluntary body to manage and maintain the house.  It is a long-term lease only and the property owner will not be responsible for dealing with the tenant or maintaining the property.  The private owner is the landlord under the rental accommodation scheme, which is generally under a short to medium-term agreement, while the housing authority makes the property available for social housing.</P>
        <P>From the tenant&rsquo;s point of view, there will be little difference from the current situation.  The local authority, or possibly a voluntary body, will be the landlord.  The differential rents scheme will apply as normal, the house or apartment will be of good quality and meet all the necessary standards.  The housing authority will assume responsibility for meeting the social housing needs of the household as is the case at the moment.  The only difference is that the tenant will not be in a position to buy the dwelling concerned.</P>
        <P>The move to avail of long-term leasing to provide social housing should not be viewed in isolation.  The recently announced incremental purchase scheme will provide the opportunity for the household in the leased property to move house and purchase a dwelling, availing of the relevant subsidies and discounts.  Under the incremental purchase scheme, the State will build social housing as normal but will set aside an amount for purchase.  This is a very attractive scheme and will provide good opportunities for all social housing tenants, including those in leased properties, to purchase a new property at substantial discounts.  The State will continue to build and purchase social housing as at present but over time the composition of the housing stock will change to allow for a greater number of leased units.</P>
        <P>The State will be able to achieve genuine value for money through this initiative.  This is because of the supply of vacant properties on the market, and because the State is able to take more than one unit and get even better value for money.  The State can also take the risk and <Col N="55"/>responsibility for ensuring that the property does not become vacant for long periods.  In other words, it has a flow of households with housing needs to use up the supply.</P>
        <P>The affordable homes partnership and the relevant local authorities are now about to engage in a significant marketing campaign to sell available homes.  Consideration is also being given to alternative mechanisms for deploying, for other housing purposes, any affordable houses or apartments that ultimately remain unsold, including the possibility of introducing a deferred purchase scheme.  This is being considered in order to ensure that unsold units are deployed in the most efficient and effective way.</P>
        <P>Through the local authorities, my Department and the Government are facing up to the financial realities in which we now find ourselves, and are responding in creative ways which still allow us to make significant progress in meeting housing needs.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Carey and Deputy Connaughton.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that this is a critical national issue, but I question the value of the time being used to make statements on it.  We are being asked to play a game of football, but the person who asked us to play wants to keep the ball stuck up his jersey like a kid with a new ball.  I have heard good contributions from both sides of the House.  If Deputy Byrne spent less time anticipating the Private Members&rsquo; Bill we were going to produce and came up with a few more ideas, he would better serve the House.</P>
        <P>We are lacking both confidence and credit.  We are talking about encouraging people to spend but one cannot spend if one does not have the money to do so.  There is value to be had but we are not able to avail of it.  There will never be value like it.  I welcome what the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, said about the initiative pertaining to the leasing of houses.  There is value to be had and it is on this initiative that his resources should be spent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy McGrath referred to the renationalisation of Eircom.  There is an historical deficit with regard to broadband.  When Eircom was being privatised, no provision was made to ensure broadband would be rolled out everywhere.  People in the business tell me the initiative announced last week will be out of date before the installation.  There is not much point in proceeding if it involves throwing good money after bad.</P>
        <P>This country should go back to basics.  We can do certain things very well.  For instance, we can produce food in a more carbon-efficient manner than any other country and we have great potential in terms of renewable energy.  With regard to ocean energy, we have the potential to become what has been described as the &ldquo;Saudi Arabia of ocean energy&rdquo;.  We have always been good at producing pharmaceutical goods and at pharmaceutical research and we should return to this.</P>
        <P>When one hears that Google could not recruit 20 high-end engineers and had to go elsewhere, one must ask whether our education system is losing its edge.  We were always able to anticipate the new wave.  When Ford and Dunlop jobs were being lost in Cork, there was no Dell or Google, yet we were able to position ourselves such that we could invite such companies to replace the lost jobs.  The companies that located here provided better jobs.  We must return to basics and be in a position to anticipate the next wave.</P>
        <P>Ireland has its foot in both camps in that it speaks English, is in the eurozone and is better connected to the United States than most other countries.  It is able to trade with some of the countries that will not trade with the United States.  We have a foot in Boston and Berlin, as somebody said.  It is not rocket science to get 2 million people working.</P>
        <P>Partnership talks, occurring by force rather than anything else, imply we are readjusting to become a more cost-competitive country.  We need a kick start.  I agree with Deputy McGrath <Col N="56"/>that we should have a national recovery team and gather together the best brains in education, science and enterprise.  We should set up a forum and pay its members nothing &mdash; they should be patriots.  If the two Houses cannot do so, or will not be allowed to do so, the process should be part and parcel of all our thoughts.  We can do this if we are genuinely interested in playing the team game.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The State faces a massive and stark challenge it has never faced before.  If urgent action is not taken now to face this challenge, the country will end up bankrupt.  It is time to be honest with the people and time that the Government that led us into this black hole put up its hands and accepted responsibility.  Successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments failed to fix the roof while the sun shone, and now we find ourselves drenched to the bone because the Taoiseach ignored the fact that our economy was so dependent on the construction sector.  He was the chief architect in the construction of the housing bubble.</P>
        <P>We are now forced to borrow &euro;55 million every day, which is simply unsustainable.  Our banking system is in dire straits and our competitive edge is gone.  There has been a total collapse in consumer spending and confidence.  Some 22,500 people lost their jobs last month and joined the dole queues.  This month in the mid-west, Dell announced the loss of 1,900 jobs, and Molex in Shannon and Element 6, formerly De Beers, also announced job losses.  There was a 60% increase in unemployment in County Clare last year.  Every day in my constituency office I meet individuals from every walk of life who have lost their jobs, including people who worked in the retail sector and the self-employed.</P>
        <P>We need to lower the cost base and improve our competitiveness.  Why do we have an energy regulator who is talking about lowering the cost of petrol, fuel and electricity next October?  This is a whole year away; we should be stepping in now.  The Government should be insisting that costs be lowered.  Since 2001 the cost of electricity in Ireland has increased by 70%, yet it has only increased by 6% in France.</P>
        <P>We need to deal with the potential for long-term unemployment because it is an economic disaster.  It damages individuals because they lose their self-respect, and potential employers lose interest in them.  Those who have been unemployed for a short time have a good chance of regaining employment while those who have been unemployed for a long time have a very slim chance of doing so.  The Government needs to acknowledge the potential for long-term unemployment and tackle it now rather than retrospectively.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to consider the immediate introduction of a public works scheme, administrated by F&Aacute;S and our national voluntary sector, which already sponsor community employment schemes.  A scheme such as this would have two strengths; it would use the vast set of skills of tradesmen and it would benefit the community and voluntary sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish well those involved in the social partnership talks.  For obvious reasons, we hope there will be a good outcome.</P>
        <P>In the 30 years during which I have been a Member of the Oireachtas, I have never seen such mishandling of an economy as I have seen this year.  The social unrest we notice throughout the country today emanated from this House when the budget was brought forward to October.  If ever the seeds of unrest were sown, it was on that day.  I do not want to go over old ground; suffice it to say that on the announcement of the budget the Government believed a 1% levy should apply to a person earning &euro;18,000 as much as it should apply to a person earning &euro;99,000.  We discovered the proposals for medical cards and found out the elderly just would not accept that carry-on.  This unrest has permeated throughout society and people are now woefully frightened as to their futures.  This is bad news for the Government and for us all. <Col N="57"/> The Government took the credit for the good times and is now trying to place responsibility for the bad times on everybody else except itself.</P>
        <P>The bank culture in Ireland is nothing short of disgraceful.  When the Government recapitalises the banks and when &euro;5 billion of hardworking taxpayers&rsquo; money is pumped into them, the sort of carry-on we had to accept on the part of corporate bankers must come to an end.  They must not be allowed to carry on as they were doing, as if they were gods.  How dare any bank or bank manager not give every opportunity to those who are finding it hard to pay their mortgages to work their way out of their difficulties?  There is no sign of a change in the banking culture.  I know of several people who still had to approach banks on bended knees.  I can only hope the people the Minister puts into the boardrooms will show, for once in our lives, that democracy, rather than the banks, runs the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>We all acknowledge that we are coming through a tough period as the impacts of the international recession begin to manifest themselves as daily occurrences.  As we face the biggest economic challenge for some time, it is no consolation to know that we are not alone and that we share these difficult times with most developed western economies.  If anything, this compounds our problems.</P>
        <P>However, we must weather the storm of negative international economic factors by facing our problems realistically, keeping cool heads, adopting prudent responses and rebuilding well grounded hope and confidence in the Irish people and the economy.  Guiding our thinking and actions will be the belief that we will come through this period of upheaval.  We should not lose sight of the fact that we have confronted challenging economic circumstances before and have won through.  There are factors we can and must influence and control, and we must lose no time in getting to grips with this task.</P>
        <P>The challenge before us is to achieve a transformation of the economy in the current difficult circumstances.  We must play to our strengths in so doing.  We must have the right people, in the right place, doing the right jobs.  As an open economy, Ireland must establish a positive enterprise environment, one which promotes the development of indigenous companies as well as being attractive for foreign direct investment.  We must be an entrepreneurial economy with tangible competitive advantages, an economy which focuses on utilisation of the knowledge, skills and creativity of its people and their ability in translating ideas into useful processes, products and services.  In achieving this vision, innovation<b> </b>must be the watchword.</P>
        <P>In the course of this debate, my Government colleagues have identified that the key elements of recovery will be secured by stabilising the public finances, improving competitiveness, supporting both Irish businesses and multinational companies and assisting those who have become unemployed.  In delivering these objectives, we must keep faith with our investment in Irish enterprise and continue to support high-value innovation in products and services that will create thriving companies and support significant numbers of dependable jobs.</P>
        <P>We must build for the future by continuing our strategy of supporting research and development, incentivising multinational companies to locate high-value activity such as research and development capacity in Ireland, and ensuring the commercialisation and retention of ideas that flow from that investment.  In the last two years, the Government has been implementing a strategy for science, technology and innovation, the key objective of which is to ensure that Ireland is to the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress within an innovation-driven culture.</P>
        <P>We must hold fast to our plan in the conviction that we are on the right strategic path by investing in world-class research of the highest quality.  We must maintain this investment, <Col N="58"/>even in these economically difficult times.  Countries that have taken this road have achieved sustainable competitiveness.  Investment in science, technology and innovation is not a luxury.  Rather, it is an essential part of building our international competitiveness and our future.  It is not an easy road.  It is built on turning the hard slog of our brightest minds into knowledge, ideas and technologies we can bring to the marketplace.</P>
        <P>This State has trebled research and development expenditure in the past ten years from a very low base, reaching an intensity ratio of 1.56% of gross national product, GNP.  However, we are nowhere near the leading countries in terms of such investment, including Sweden, Finland, Japan and Korea whose intensity ratio is more than double our own.  In the last decade, China has more than doubled its intensity from a low base and now spends more than Ireland on research and development as a percentage of GDP.  This is an indication of the competition we are facing and the urgency with which we must act.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am responsible for the development, promotion and co-ordination of Ireland&rsquo;s science, technology and innovation policy.  Fundamentally, this strategy seeks to create a competitive edge for Ireland on the global market by building a new competitive advantage based on an increased capacity to generate, protect and use new knowledge by developing mechanisms to translate knowledge into jobs, exports and growth.  The enterprises that will survive and grow are those that deliver innovation, quality and value, whether in goods or services.</P>
        <P>To this end, the Government&rsquo;s strategy provides a co-ordinated suite of interrelated programmes.  My Department funds investments through the enterprise agencies, Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Agency, IDA.  IDA and Enterprise Ireland promote the use of research in enterprises and use this strong research base to commercialise the outputs of research through intellectual property licences and start-up companies.  These two agencies are working closely with companies to strengthen the research and technological base of the enterprise sector in order to drive productivity, competitiveness, exports and jobs.  Enterprise Ireland has developed a range of schemes to ensure that we have the capacity to capture and transform the ideas and advances coming from higher education research into commercial reality.  Backed by this support, companies are opening up new markets with innovative products and services.</P>
        <P>In order to tap into the capacity and talent available in our third level educational institutions, Enterprise Ireland has funded strong technology transfer to ensure the commercial outputs of publicly funded research are realised and to help industry collaborate with the third level sector to find solutions to the research problems it faces.  We are growing our higher education research base through Science Foundation Ireland investments linked to industry needs and to the activity of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  Taking advantage of the physical infrastructure provided by the Higher Education Authority on third level campuses, Science Foundation Ireland is providing world-class researchers working in strategic areas allied to the needs of industry.  Science Foundation Ireland is also building large-scale research centres, known as centres for science, engineering and technology, and strategic research clusters with various industry partners.  Thus, we are building a strong research base which is directly aligned to industry needs, while maintaining a strong connection with higher education in order to produce top-quality graduates armed with the skills the economy requires.</P>
        <P>The success of this connected approach is clear.  In 2008, some 56 IDA research, development and innovation investments, valued at &euro;420 million, were won, almost one third of which involved collaboration with Irish third level institutions and research institutes.  Enterprise Ireland client companies are opening up new markets with innovative products and services that are directly linked to advancements in innovation, research and productivity.  Payback will <Col N="59"/>come in helping Enterprise Ireland companies meet a target of securing &euro;4 billion new exports in the next three years.</P>
        <P>Delivering on its mandate to transform research and development activity in Irish enterprise, during 2008, Enterprise Ireland assisted 757 companies to undertake research and development investment.  These include top companies such as the Kerry Group, lona Technologies, Trinity Biotech, Glanbia, Kingspan, Greencore and Datalex.  New high-potential start-up companies yielded sales of &euro;638 million and exports of &euro;344 million and generated employment of 5,500 over a six-year period.  The campus incubation programme, which funds centres for the incubation of emerging business ideas and enterprises, has put in place business incubation centres on every institute of technology campus in addition to six business incubation facilities in the universities.  At the end of 2008, there were 240 companies located in such centres, employing more than 1,000 people.</P>
        <P>During the last eight years, Science Foundation Ireland has focused on building a high-quality research environment in an effort to establish Ireland as an international location renowned for the excellence of its scientific research.  The agency has been successful in this ambitious objective, with the number of research teams working in strategic areas having grown to 336 at the end of 2008.  Science Foundation Ireland-funded projects involve interactions with more than 300 companies, both indigenous and multinational.  In addition, 103 companies are involved in formal, cost-sharing collaborations.  There is a degree of overlap between Enterprise Ireland research and development clients attracted to Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland investment such as IBM, Boston Scientific and Beckman Coulter.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s investments in research and development through the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland are central to its science strategy.  In any period of change, there are opportunities for those who are alert and visionary.  It will challenge us to innovate, change and to reinvent what we do and how we do it.  We must hold fast to our aim to be among the leading locations for business innovation and to be a country where there will be a critical mass of companies creating the products and services of tomorrow.  We must provide the best environment for the commercialisation of innovative, leading-edge products and services.  Despite the current circumstances, we will face up to the challenge of funding the necessary increased investment in this area in the difficult years ahead to ensure a secure future.</P>

	<P>I have been perplexed as I listened to the debate on the economy yesterday and today.  Calls have been made by Members on the Government benches for co-operation from the Opposition parties and many Members only fell short of calling for some sort of a national Government.  However, any move towards any type of national Government to deal with the current economic crisis is utterly impossible for the simple reason that this Government has been paralysed by indecision during the past six months, ever since the effects of the credit crunch were felt domestically.  Ever since the extent of the recession and the rise in unemployment became apparent, it has been clear the Government has been bereft of any solutions and has been incapable of taking any decisive action.  The Opposition would be abdicating its responsibility, to a grave extent, if it was to support the inaction and blubbering we have seen from this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in recent months.</P>
        <P>We have a duty to hold the Government to account, which is what we have been doing and will continue to do.  If the Government comes forward with positive solutions to the current financial crisis and, as Deputy Kenny, our party leader, said here yesterday, if the Government is prepared to take on board some of the proposals put forward by our party for us to work <Col N="60"/>together in a constructive fashion to find a solution to issue, we will be more than happy to work with all partners across the House to achieve a solution that is in the interests of the Irish economy and particularly of the Irish people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, this economic crisis is a direct result of years of inflationary budgets, particularly and coincidentally those budgets leading into general elections, dire regulation of the banking sector and a property boom that was unsustainable.  We reached a point where more than 25% of revenue into the Government coffers in recent years was represented by property related taxes.  That is what has led us to this financial crisis.  Deputies, particularly those at the Cabinet table, need to step up to the plate and accept responsibility for the role they played in leading us to this position.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, mentioned that commentators should measure their words in regard to the economy.  We were told in recent months and years that we should not talk down the economy.  We were accused of being unpatriotic and trying to undermine the glorious boom that was prevailing in the country at the time.  Had Cabinet Ministers taken the time out to listen to some of the economic commentators and Opposition spokespeople who highlighted the problems and deficiencies within the system, perhaps the current economic crisis could have been avoided.</P>
        <P>Given the level of public concern, fear, worry and anger, it is extraordinary that the Government is dealing with the current economic crisis in a decidedly anti-democratic way.  It is important to consult the social partners and to try to reach consensus but it is completely unacceptable that the only discussions of any worth are taking place behind closed doors.  We on the Opposition benches are not privy to any of the detail.  We read about it, if we are lucky, through the pages of the national press media or leaked memos to the national broadcaster and so on.  This is not acceptable and not what parliamentary democracy is about.  If the Government wants co-operation from the Opposition benches, it needs to start co-operating with the political parties on this side of the House because we represent people.  We have a direct mandate and we are here to represent the interests of those people in all the constituencies throughout the country who voted for us.  We are accountable to the people and expect to be treated by the Government in a fashion that takes account of that.</P>
        <P>I am worried the Government will make decisions which will be designed only to appease the social partners and which will not necessarily be in the long-term interests of the country.  Raising taxes, and I stress this point, will not kick-start this economy.  It is dangerous and detrimental to believe that raising taxes and imposing further burdens on businesses will assist in addressing the economic crisis or help us to get out of the mess we are in.</P>

	<P>As a wise man in my parish once said, any man can notice and can spot somebody else&rsquo;s weaknesses, but it takes a great man to acknowledge his own weaknesses.  The speculative demand for housing was pointed out to the Government in the Bacon report of June 2000.  This is what has brought our economy and our country to its knees, namely the activities of the builders,  bankers and the Government.  In June 2000 Mr. Bacon said: </P>
        <P LI="1">These various kinds of speculative demand forestall the movement of the housing market to stability.  As this happens, there is a tendency to stimulate further speculative demand and in this way a &lsquo;bubble&rsquo; can develop.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He said that nearly nine years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are having this debate because of the way the banks carried out their business and the development that took place that created the bubble.  Irish banks loan money primarily to Irish builders and property developers to construct commercial developments and housing in <Col N="61"/>Ireland.  The types of housing projects or commercial developments entered into were hugely influenced by Government tax policy.  Too many holiday homes, hotels and retail developments were constructed and many of these had a negative impact on the communities in which they were built.  The property bubble which this created prevented many low and middle income families from acquiring a house.  If the bankers were wrong to lend much of this money, the Government must share the blame, as it created the conditions which made it possible.</P>
        <P>The question is what we do next.  This is not a time to look for someone to blame.  If there was wrongdoing in the banking system, those responsible should be brought to account, but that will not solve the problem we now face.  The solution must benefit as many ordinary citizens as possible and it cannot be allowed to benefit only the banks and large property developers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Currently people are afraid to purchase houses because of the negative sentiment being portrayed in the media.  I want to make one point, which could help us to move forward from the current position.  I would rather not knock everything.  The Government should consider giving mortgage interest relief at the top rate for first-time house buyers on loans of up to &euro;400,000.  This figure should enable people throughout the country, even in Dublin, to locate a suitable property.  This cost would be more than covered by the VAT and other taxes generated.</P>

	<P>Does Deputy Sheahan wish to continue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I will.  The Government should provide &euro;2 billion for the shared ownership scheme.  This would make the purchase of a house under the shared ownership scheme conditional on the current price being, say, 30% below the peak price, thus ensuring value for money.  If the average purchase price of a house was &euro;300,000 and the owner was to provide 50% of the purchase price, &euro;2 billion would fund the assisted purchase of 13,500 houses, thus significantly reducing the housing waiting lists.  The total spend would be approximately &euro;4 billion and, therefore, the VAT generated would be approximately &euro;475 million.  This would not solve all our problems but would ensure that the man in the street would derive some benefit from the current low property prices.</P>
        <P>Leadership on the economy must be given.  Unpleasant decisions must be taken and the people of Ireland are ready and willing to take them if the benefits are explained clearly to them.  I am looking for honesty from the Government.  It should come out, tell the people what the state of the country is and lay it before them.  It should tell them we must take steps A, B, C and D and then we will be out of this mess in three years.</P>
        <P>Decisions must be taken quickly to reassure the people and those who might wish to do business with us.  Each decision must be explained to the people.  Those who are to be targeted in any savings to be made in the running of the country must not be the weak or the vulnerable.  The Government must lead, and must be seen to lead, with authority but, most of all, it must be honest with its people.</P>

	<P>Last evening, a framework for a pact for stabilisation, social solidarity and economic renewal was agreed with the social partners.  It was a very significant step in uplifting this country and renewing the economy.  That is what all of us are concerned with in the House today.  It is not merely about looking back and seeing how we got here, but about listening to the people who are working, to those who are employing and giving leadership.  It is about listening to Members of the Oireachtas, yesterday and today, who had any valuable suggestions.  Such suggestions can be taken on board in preparing our policies and plans and in the difficult decisions we must take.</P>
        <P>Talking about stabilisation, social solidarity and economic renewal might sound very grand but it is really about keeping the almost two million people who are in employment in the jobs they have.  It is about helping the more than 300,000 people who have lost their jobs to be able to return to work and do that quickly.  It is about ensuring that we support those people who are dependent on social welfare to be able to continue and that we give them the hope and optimism they need.  It is about ensuring that people who are in business and enterprise can get credit and loans and can benefit from the upturn when it comes but allowing them, in the interim, to be able to continue to employ people and continue to be able to work, to manufacture or to provide any of the good work they are doing around the country.  It is about renewing and regenerating this economy and about ensuring that we can have those small businesses doing well.  We have 250,000 small businesses in this country that employ over 800,000 people.  They deserve to be supported because they are the backbone of our economy.</P>
        <P>It is also about regenerating to ensure that when the major multi-nationals, the Intels, the Dells and the Microsofts, are looking for places to invest we have the relevant skills for them so that they will wish to come here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>A lot of them are not investing in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also about ensuring that we train and educate and are ready for the upturn.</P>
        <P>There are many very good news stories out there.  When one thinks that Intel and Microsoft let 11,000 people go throughout the world, out of that number only 17 jobs were lost in this country.  That says a great deal about us having the right skills for those companies.  No jobs are to be lost in Ireland in Intel.  That is a great commitment by Intel to this country.  Only a small number will be lost in Microsoft which also employs thousands in this country.  There is a real message for us in this.  Using this time to upskill, educate and train, and to do so in the skills that are needed by these companies, can help us to benefit from future investment.  We have all the other assets, such as the young workforce, our corporation tax rate and our involvement in Europe.  This is a good opportunity.</P>
        <P>There is much hope and I believe that is why people sat around the table yesterday and agreed to, at least, a framework for the pact.  A question was asked about who are the people who are agreeing this.  Obviously, the Government is the leader, in addition to the political leaders of this country.  The social partners represent employers, employees, community groups and voluntary groups.  Every interest is at heart, including every other leader in the Oireachtas who has a contribution to make.  In particular, there is every person out there today who is willing to make a sacrifice to help others.  Everybody one meets these days says &ldquo;yes, we are willing to do it&rdquo;.  They are willing to take the pain.</P>
        <P>It is in that spirit of renewal that new hope can come with the beginning of this new year albeit that things are very difficult for many people.  They are particularly difficult for the over 300,000 people who have come onto the live register, having lost their jobs across a range of areas, particularly during the past year.  We talk very often about the people who worked in <Col N="63"/>the construction industry because it is more visible than others.  However, there are those who worked in associated areas, such as furniture making or hardware, people who were architects, solicitors or engineers.  For these people and their families it is very difficult.  I am conscious that many of them have never had to access social welfare in the past and would never have had any contact with social welfare offices.  We have changed many of our processes and have brought in 115 extra staff.  I have requested more staff and I am very anxious to ensure that we deal with these people and treat them with the dignity and speed they deserve.  I know there are delays in some offices.  In very many others we are ensuring that the processing times are kept low.  Two and a half weeks is now the average processing time for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There are delays of ten or 11 weeks in some places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and five and a half weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  I know the staff in all our offices throughout the country are working flat out to try to help these people and support them.  None of them wants to be on the live register or unemployed.  They want the opportunity to get back into work.  One of the key ways of achieving that is to ensure that the economy beyond the employment sector is kept strong.  By that, I mean our expenditure &mdash; ensuring that our income is right and that we have a strong banking sector.  We have made many decisions about the banking sector in this House over the past few months but now we must see that these decisions feed into ordinary people&rsquo;s lives and into ordinary businesses so that they can get loans and credit and can help to regenerate their own areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the very big gap between income and expenditure, we must implement very hard measures this year.  It was not easy for anybody to sit around the table and say, &ldquo;yes, we agree&rdquo;, to &euro;2 billion coming out of the economy.  For that sum to come out, this year, is a lot to ask.  We must look at those areas that are a significant element of our expenditure and our budget.  The commitment that people are showing and their willingness to engage with this is a sign of real leadership.</P>
        <P>As a Minister, of course it is easier to be able to spend.  It is much more difficult for a Government to say that it must take money out of this sector or that.  Leadership has been shown right across the different groups and the unions and also by individuals out there, in the making and supporting of those decisions in order to regenerate the economy.</P>
        <P>What about the individual, the person who is 18 or 19 years of age, who comes in to sign on?  The last thing we want is for him or her to become dependent on social welfare and to become long-term unemployed.  We have two pilot projects that are working very well.  They are in only two areas at present, although I look forward to expanding them.  The aim is to ensure that when an 18 or 19 year old comes to sign on to the live register, he or she is immediately referred to a course that is relevant to his or her needs.  Some of these people still have literacy problems.  Some are more capable and are better able to take up other skills but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Two miserable projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at least by doing that immediately we ensure that these people are not merely signing on and getting welfare and perhaps becoming dependent on it at a very early age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is for a tiny number of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other groups that we can ensure will benefit from the same approach.  We are making a prudent move and ensuring that it works properly in the first place. <Col N="64"/> We will see what the needs are and how the project works in the pilot areas and then expand it elsewhere.</P>
        <P>There are many other sectors we can look at and we are doing so.  Some employers are struggling to hold onto their companies and are forced to put their employees on three-day weeks.  There are very good opportunities for those people who have two days to be able to upskill, use F&Aacute;S training and use the capacity that is in the institutes of technology and VECs through PLC courses.  Apprentices who have not been able to finish their on-the-job work element can come back in and finish the education element of their training.  The co-operation we are seeing between all the different agencies is something that will benefit those individuals.  The Cabinet sub-committee and the working together of the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Education and Science and myself will ensure that we see a flexibility in Departments that, dare I say, we have not seen before.  People are willing to make changes to ensure we target all of these individual groups.</P>
        <P>Ensuring that people have the skills needed for the future is another key element.  It is not just about giving people a course for the sake of it, although all education is valuable.  However, the future skills group has in the past been very good at identifying for us that we need skilled people in the areas of pharmaceuticals, medicare devices, life sciences and maths.  That group is at present reviewing what will be the needs for the future.  There is a constant message about the value of science so we can lead into research and development, which is at the core of the smart economy and the core of our future plans for this country.</P>
        <P>For students filling in CAO forms this weekend, my first advice is always to do what they would like to do.  However, there is key advice for young people, which is not to be influenced by the recession economy they see today, because when they finish their education, we will be out of this recession and those young people will be coming into a workforce that will need their skills.  The second piece of advice is that the skills they will need are in the sciences and maths, which is where the investment is and where the training will be available.  I ask them to seriously consider those areas for their futures.</P>
        <P>In agreeing the framework, I know that in the next few days, with all of the leaders and the willingness of a public who always had a real fighting spirit and great drive and determination, we can agree a process that will help us to make serious savings in expenditure but at the same time to regenerate an economy and give back to the Irish people the hope and optimism they have always had.  It has been sliding in the recent past but I know we can do that over the next few weeks because of the willingness of the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has left the House so quickly after speaking because I want to highlight the absolute hypocrisy of what the Government is discussing with the social partners.  I have a copy of the draft framework document, which I managed to get last night.  It talks of reducing public expenditure while showing &ldquo;solidarity with those now losing their jobs&rdquo;.  This is from a Government that has just cancelled three months of payments for all jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claimants and that just yesterday laid before the House new regulations cutting the entitlement of part-time workers to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  What hope is there for the country if this is what they mean by solidarity?</P>
        <P>The draft framework document also talks about reviewing the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  Just before Christmas, however, the Minister who has just left the House awarded <Col N="65"/>herself new powers to curtail the amount of assistance provided.  Is that what they mean by solidarity?</P>
        <P>True solidarity would target cutbacks at the top and work down from there.  True solidarity would target cuts at wasted expenditure and the scandalous tax breaks that are available for the better off.  Why should anyone take a pay cut when they see top banking officials and businessmen engaging in dodgy dealing, threatening the very basis of our economy and getting away with it?  Why should anyone take a pay cut when they see top public servants getting large bonuses and others receiving golden handshakes and plum pensions after they have been forced to resign their positions?  Why should anyone take a pay cut when they see every cent invested in the National Pensions Reserve Fund last year, all &euro;1.69 billion of it, lost on the stock markets while the fund managers take over &euro;20 million in fees?  In fact, in the past year almost &euro;5 billion of taxpayers money has been lost from this fund.  Why should anyone take a pay cut when they see that many landlords do not pay tax on their rental income, when rich artists do not pay tax on their book or record deals and when high earners continue to get massive tax relief on their pensions?  Why should anyone take a pay cut when our Ministers remain among the best paid in the world despite the absolute failure of their developer-led policies?</P>
        <P>Do not get me wrong.  The country is in an economic mess and pay cuts and tax increases have to be part of sorting out that mess.  However, it strikes at the very legitimacy of government to start that process by targeting those who have been prudent and responsible, who bear no responsibility for the mess and in many cases are least able to afford it.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the leader of the Labour Party said in this House that &ldquo;the nucleus of a modern economy is trust&rdquo; and that this requires trust in the political system.  If the country is to recover, there is a need for the Government to show a sea-change in its thinking in this regard.  It must target those who can best afford to contribute to the economic recovery.  Its failure to do so will mean this recovery plan has no chance of succeeding.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 8,000 people on the dole in County Wicklow, which is unprecedented, with almost 2,500 of those in Arklow.  There is an emergency meeting tonight about the crisis, particularly in Arklow.  People will be asking what the Government will do to ensure job creation and the retention of jobs.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, will not be at that meeting because following her speech, frankly, she would be torn apart.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people are entitled to an answer to their question.  I do not believe the Government is meeting the crisis with any kind of coherence or conviction.  We all know we face stark choices and that we need strong, innovative leadership.  The Government says the economy will shrink by 4% and the likelihood is that 420,000 people will be unemployed.  Getting people back to work should be a priority yet the policy is all about cutting back on our potential to increase jobs.</P>
        <P>The recent budget was supposed to provide the solution to our difficulties, taking &euro;4 billion out of the economy.  Now, the Taoiseach is again obsessing about public finances, cutting them back by another &euro;2 billion.  Cutbacks lead to fewer jobs, so people are justifiably asking how such massive reductions in spending can possibly help to restore prosperity and protect jobs.  It does not make sense.  That is at the heart of the issue in terms of good Government.</P>
        <P>There is a place for savings and cutbacks but only within an overall economic recovery plan that harnesses every resource to keep people at work.  What is most disturbing about the framework document that <i>The Irish Times</i> kindly published for us is that it is full of vague aspirations.  Other countries are getting their act together.  We need only consider the record of President Obama to see our Government&rsquo;s performance is quite dismal in comparison.  Last <Col N="66"/>week in his inauguration speech, President Obama talked about the greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, and he also referred to the collective failure to make hard choices and prepare for a new age.  Within a week of taking office, he has succeeded in getting his national stimulus plan, involving $819 billion, approved by the US House of Representatives.</P>
        <P>There is no such honesty or self reflection from the Government, and no such action.  Instead, the Government has been scrambling around in the dark.  After creating a culture of greed and excess, it is hoping to blame it all on others.  Yet, this is the time when a way needs to be charted out of the tough times.  We can save jobs and we can get the economy moving again.  As Deputy Eamon Gilmore said, we need to see the opportunities instead of the obstacles.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">For example, thousands of people are losing their jobs in the construction area.  The idea of having a national insulation program is a no-brainer in that it saves on fuel costs and helps to meet our climate change commitments.  However, it is not in place yet.  This morning, I tried to ascertain if there was any substance to the scheme in terms of a recognition that this work could be set out and done immediately.  As usual, all we here is rhetoric and promises.  We were promised that the money has been put by for the roll out of the national insulation scheme, but it has not yet taken place.  If one inquires when the scheme will commence, one is told it will be next April, which is not good enough.  There are people who could be working on the scheme but who are not because the Government is lethargic and drifting and it does not understand the sense of urgency in securing people&rsquo;s jobs.  People are expressing a sense of anger because their jobs are under threat, or because they have lost their jobs.  The Government should wake up and listen to what people are saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully agree with the remarks of Deputy Shortall.  There is no evidence that those who can afford to take the cutbacks in our society are doing so.  Unfortunately, the opposite appears to be the case.  I believe we must have a base line for the protection of front line services, otherwise we will store up sizable problems for the future.  I argue for protecting programmes, especially those relating to children, whether in public health or education, to ensure we do not create problems in future by cutting back on basic services, especially those in the health service.</P>
        <P>This morning I attended the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  We were told there is not enough money for the basic school dental programmes, for basic immunisation programmes and other such programmes which protect children.  If we do not protect front line services there will be serious problems as we work through the present difficulties.  I strongly argue in favour of certain levels below which we should not go and for certain front line services which we should protect.</P>
        <P>I refer to a matter in my constituency, but the point could be applied elsewhere.  The Limerick region is about to lose approximately 2,000 jobs at Dell, along with a substantial number of ancillary jobs in other companies.  There are other job losses in small businesses and so on affecting other parts of the country.  There is a regeneration programme for Limerick, but apparently there is no money for the roll-out of the programme.  It seems a local stimulus package such as the Limerick regeneration programme is a way in which we can match people who are about to lose their jobs with opportunities in the community.  A plan is already in place in Limerick which will provide jobs and training for a large number of people.  It makes good sense to implement this regeneration programme and to provide jobs and opportunities for those who are about to lose their jobs, instead of those people signing on and causing a drain on the resources of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin.</P><Col N="67"/>
        <P Just="Left">I support the model to be implemented in Limerick.  There is a regeneration plan and a task force set up as a result of the Dell job losses.  This model could be replicated in other communities throughout the country.  If we do not provide such stimulus packages then the economy will continue to contract and increasing numbers of people will be on  the dole.  It seems any sense of a plan for the future to generate employment is absent in all of the Government&rsquo;s plans.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As we are aware, there has been a significant deterioration in economic conditions, and especially in the public finances in the past twelve months.  This deterioration in economic conditions has had a significant impact on the economy.  The economy contracted in 2008 and will continue to do so this year.  A major factor weighing on activity is the correction in the property sector and this has exerted a negative drag on overall economic activity.  This has spread to other sectors of the economy with retail sales falling sharply.  This, in turn, has had negative implications for employment levels, and the pace at which numbers on the live register had increased is especially worrying.  The substantial loss in economic output has resulted in a steep fall in tax revenue.  The tax shortfall in 2008 alone was &euro;8.1 billion.</P>
        <P>Compounding our domestic economic problems, there has been a major deterioration in the global economic environment.  The origins of this can be traced back to developments in the market for USA sub-prime mortgage debt, in which difficulties began to emerge during 2007.  What started as a major disruption to the operation of a specific credit market has spread to global financial markets, intensifying over time, and culminating in severe global financial problems.  Internationally, the impact of financial market turmoil has been to reduce access to credit and to weigh on confidence, pushing the major world economies into recession.  The eurozone countries, the United Kingdom, the USA and Japan are all at the verge of, or are in, recession.</P>
        <P>The deterioration in the international climate has weighed on our ability to achieve a suitable rate of economic growth.  Exports are the life-blood of a small, open economy such as ours.  The record appreciation of the euro against sterling has had a major negative impact in this regard.  While our exposure to the United Kingdom economy is not as intense as it once was, I recognise the pain experienced by Irish exporters, especially food exporters, at this time.  The Government is implementing a range of policies to support our competitiveness objectives, aimed at improving competition in product markets.  These include major investment in research and development.  In addition, the Government is maintaining capital investment at twice the EU average.  This policy has both short-term and long-term benefits, supporting jobs and improving competitiveness and productivity in the longer term.</P>
        <P>As a result of the dramatic changes in the international economic situation, the Irish fiscal outlook in the coming years will be considerably more difficult than anyone could have envisaged.  Restoring sustainability to the public finances can only realistically be done over a period of adjustment of up to five years.  Given the scale of the emerging position, taking action over a shorter period of time would impose substantial economic and social costs and would be neither sensible nor appropriate.  The Government has agreed to put in place a five-year plan to restore balance to the public finances by 2013.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To achieve this plan, we must work together.  The farming pillar has been part of the social partnership process since its inception in 1987.  It has been through good and bad times during the course of the seven agreements put in place in the past 22 years.  A return to the spirit of agreement that prevailed in the first partnership agreement, namely, the Programme for <Col N="68"/>National Recovery, is now called for.  That agreement was put in place at one of the most difficult economic times for the country with high taxation, record levels of unemployment, punitive interest rates and poor public finances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I believe that the agriculture, food and fishery sectors can play a crucial role in the revitalisation of our economy.  The agri-food sector is our pre-eminent indigenous manufacturing sector.  It is strongly export oriented, with exports amounting to more than &euro;8 billion, and has a very low import content in its inputs.  It is also labour intensive.  This is precisely the type of industry that we need at this time.  However, to thrive in a very difficult environment it is vital that the sector is as efficient and competitive as possible at every step in the chain from farm to fork.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the Government has supported a range of measures designed to assist the sector in meeting the demands for sustainable and competitive production.  Although finances are more limited now, the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy will be to continue to focus resources on measures to enhance the productive capacity of the sector.  Despite necessary reductions in public expenditure, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will spend &euro;3.4 billion <Col N="69"/>in support of Irish agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry during the year.  This significant transfer of public funds is tangible evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector.  All public expenditure will be under close scrutiny to ensure it is used to the best possible effect, and this will include expenditure by my Department.</P>
        <P>For more than 30 years the Common Agricultural Policy has played a major role in supporting the Irish agri-food sector, through both direct budget transfers, supported by EU taxpayers, and access to high-value European markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot even get his sums right.  The amount in question is &euro;400 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The completion of the negotiations on the CAP health check late last year was an important development for the sector.  My main aims in the negotiations were to achieve an increase in milk quotas while maintaining the market management mechanisms in the milk sector and to gain access to unspent single payment funds.</P>
        <P>I was happy to have succeeded in achieving those aims, while at the same time managing to reduce considerably the proposed level of modulation to ensure modulated funds remained with Irish farmers and in Ireland. We now must consider the longer-term situation and focus on the upcoming review of the EU budget and the shape of the CAP beyond 2013.  This should be done within the context of the broader outlook for farming and the food industry in the future.  While that future clearly is marked by many uncertainties, particularly in light of the current international economic situation, there will be significant opportunities arising from growing world demand for food and bio-fuel.  It also is known that there will be major challenges from climate change, increased competition on world and EU markets, the financial crunch and other factors.  We must ensure Ireland has the capacity to cope with the challenges and to exploit fully the opportunities as they emerge.  As I stated, to do so, the entire sector must be highly efficient and competitive.  It also must be innovative, produce the products that consumers demand and focus relentlessly on quality and safety.  If this is done, I strongly believe our export-led and labour-intensive agrifood sector can contribute significantly to our economic renewal in these difficult times, and to our long-term growth in the future.</P>
        <P>In common with virtually all the world&rsquo;s advanced economies, we face substantial economic and fiscal challenges in the immediate future.  For its part, the Government is making the type of decisions that will help lay the foundations for recovery.  For a small open economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s, sustainable increases in living standards can only be achieved through supplying goods and services to the wider global economy.  Therefore, we must ensure the economy is in a position to take advantage of the global recovery, when this emerges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for sharing time.  Life is short and three minutes is short but I am glad of the opportunity to speak in this debate.  We must prioritise the stabilisation of the public finances.  As everyone is aware, we are spending &euro;55 million per day at present.  In a matter of only four months, incredible statistics have been produced for an incredible time.  Confidence in the economy can only come about through the basic notion that Ireland Incorporated has its financial house in order.  The Green Party has been highly critical of the practices and culture in the banking world and to retrieve that confidence in Ireland, both at home and abroad, we must send out the strongest signal that financial regulation is implemented and no fraudulent practices are left untackled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Deputy propose to do that?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="70"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This is all just rhetoric.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, we also must look to the positives, by focusing on the knowledge economy and the green economy.  We must consolidate our prospects in the knowledge economy through investment in third level education, support for research and development and investment in infrastructure and public services to make Ireland an attractive location for skilled workers and this is being done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must build a green economy.  Government supports and schemes, as well as the current work on identifying areas in which the green economy needs greater support from State agencies, are vital.  As a small country, Ireland can adapt quickly and make the most of the foresight of some of our European colleagues such as Germany, which has created more than 200,000 jobs in renewable energy, as well as the potential for indigenously-produced biomass to provide 10% of its fuel needs by 2020.  The framework for sustainable economic renewal is an important blueprint to help us.  In addition, the forthcoming Commission on Taxation provides us with an opportunity to create a more equitable and environmentally conscious tax base.  The ESRI has stated that a shift from labour taxation to environmental taxation has a positive impact on employment and a more progressive taxation regime regarding wealth must accompany such a shift.</P>
        <P>Finally, as a nation, we are a gutsy people who often are at our best when our backs are to the wall.  We can turn this situation around, while being mindful of the opportunities.  Seneca, who observed that life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present and fear the future, is a man for our times.  Were we to learn from the past, be mindful of the present and fearlessly plan a way forward for the future, the old Stoic might approve of our actions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate that has taken place in the House over the last two days.  It is clear from the contributions by Deputies from all sides that there is a recognition of the scale of the difficulties we face.  That is encouraging because the manner in which we respond to our current economic difficulties will have a crucial bearing on the length and severity of the downturn.</P>
        <P>The agreement the Government has reached with the social partners on a framework for stabilising the public finances means we can move forward on the basis of a shared analysis of the economic crisis we face.  I welcome in particular the acceptance by the social partners of the need for immediate expenditure savings of up to &euro;2 billion this year as a credible response to our parlous fiscal position and their commitment to work with the Government over the next five years to bring the general Government deficit below 3%.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy could try making a suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should try being honest about the situation.  What attempt will she make to look after the unemployed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has had its discussions on the matter and has identified clearly the need to make reductions in our payroll costs.  It also shares a determination that all sectors of our country should contribute in accordance with their ability to so do and conversely, that the most vulnerable are insulated from the worst effects of this recession.  The importance and value of agreement at a time when many other countries are experiencing industrial unrest and social unrest should not be underestimated.  It sends out a powerful signal to international investors and to the markets that we are capable of managing our way out of the most serious economic downturn in 80 years.</P>
        <P>However, time is of the essence. The latest figures confirm that economic activity has gone into reverse, with gross domestic product, GDP, declining by an estimated 1.4% last year, which constitutes the first decline in a quarter of a century.  This year, GDP is projected to contract by 4%, which would be the sharpest decline in activity ever recorded.  Looking towards next year, a further albeit more modest reduction in activity is forecast.  In other words, successive years of contracting activity are in prospect, something which has never happened before.</P>
        <P>Ireland faces an extremely difficult set of economic circumstances and it is clear we are in for a difficult number of years.  The reversal of our economic fortunes stems, in the first instance, from the correction in the new house building sector.  This year, completions of new housing will amount to approximately 20,000 units, compared with approximately 90,000 units completed in 2006.  Because of its importance to the economy, lower levels of activity in this sector exert a major drag on overall activity and the effects of the housing market correction now have spread to other sectors of the economy.  However, there is no point in believing this is the sole cause of our current difficulties.</P>
        <P>Internationally, an economic slowdown has been under way for some time, reflecting the impact of financial market turmoil which first surfaced following the collapse of the market for sub-prime mortgages in the United States.  The effect of this has been to restrict access to credit and to weigh on confidence in our main export markets.  The global financial crisis intensified dramatically last autumn, reinforcing the global economic downturn.  As a result, the outlook for the global economy has deteriorated significantly in the space of just a few months and international forecasting agencies are revising downwards their projections for world growth.  The European Commission published revised forecasts last week showing that growth in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area will decline significantly this year.  In fact, this will be the first year since 1945 in which activity in the world&rsquo;s advanced economies, as a group, will decline.  This is not something which is unique to this country.  While we have unique and distinctive problems, they form part of a wider international pattern, which we must recognise and learn from.  We are in a truly global recession, the scale of which has not been seen for a very long time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From our perspective, the deterioration in the international economic environment will affect our export performance, which is the life blood of a small open economy such as ours.  Exchange rate developments, especially recent movements in the euro-sterling rate, have been most unhelpful.  Most exposed are small and medium-sized firms, whose competitiveness position has been adversely affected by the weakness of sterling.  Given our land border with the <Col N="72"/>sterling area, movements in the sterling rate have elevated cross-Border shopping to levels not seen for a long time, with adverse implications for our Exchequer position.  Contrary to some of the suggestions made in the House yesterday, changes in the VAT regime in both jurisdictions have had little, if any, impact on cross-Border shopping decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It simply is that more people are travelling north.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of speakers referred to a loss of confidence among the international investment community.  I am acutely aware of this and the need to restore that confidence is a top priority.  I will put into context the deterioration in the public finances.  Tax revenues last year were nearly 14% below 2007 levels with those tax heads most closely aligned to the housing and international financial markets being worst affected.  Lower levels of tax revenue mean we are not collecting enough revenue to finance the level of public expenditure we have seen in recent years.  As a result we are borrowing significantly to fund for day-to-day spending, as well as totally funding our capital expenditure through borrowing.  In the absence of further policy action, a Government deficit in the range of 11% to 12% of GDP is in prospect for each of the years to 2013.  That position is untenable.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, we must eliminate borrowing for day-to-day spending.  The first step towards that goal is the &euro;2 billion savings, the details of which will be announced next week.  Next year, we need to make a further adjustment of &euro;4 billion and a proportion of that must come from tax.  The Commission on Taxation will report in the early autumn and that report will inform our deliberations on next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P>We need to broaden our tax base.  The most recent projected Revenue data covering approximately 2.4 million income earners on their records shows that 38% are entirely exempt from income tax, and the top 20% of income earners pay 77% of all income tax.  Of these the top 2.5% of income earners pay one third of all income tax, the top 6.5% of income earners pay a half of all income tax and the top 12.5% of income earners pay almost two thirds of all income tax.  For the information of Deputy Shortall, that data shows how progressive the income tax system in the State is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What about all the high earners who are not paying any?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Those paying that tax are public servants, by and large, married to other public servants.  We have had that discussion previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and, in budget 2009, I re-affirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and to maintaining and enhancing our pro-business tax policies.  In addition, the recently passed Finance Act introduces a number of very significant changes to the research and development tax credit scheme as well as a number of other pro-business tax measures.  It is important that we maintain that element of our tax system so that we can continue to attract investment into this country and nurture our indigenous sector.</P>
        <P>We have agreed with the social partners that whatever taxation measures are to be introduced will be informed by the principles of fairness with a higher proportion falling on higher incomes and that they will support the productive sector of our economy so that we can keep Ireland competitive.</P>

	<P>Capital investment, in particular, provides a significant fiscal stimulus while at the same time boosting the productive capacity of the economy and thereby providing the basis for future gains in living standards.  We are also continuing to invest heavily in education, skills and training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Productive investment in infrastructure and in the skills of the population will help us to restructure the economy to target the next wave of economic growth.  The Framework for Economic Renewal launched by the Taoiseach last December sets out our agenda over the next few years of how we will re-orientate and re-prioritise the business of Government to achieve the goal of building a smart economy which will help underpin our economic future.  The Government is working to reposition the economy to be able to achieve sustainable, export-led growth when the global economic climate improves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a more positive note, the recent interest rate reductions by the ECB &mdash; 2.25% since October &mdash; will provide some timely support to the economy.  In addition, weak global demand has resulted in a sharp fall in commodity prices.  Oil prices, for example, have recently fallen below $50 per barrel from their peak of nearly $150 per barrel in July last.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>These and other developments have resulted in an easing of inflationary pressures.  This is to be welcomed as it supports the real income of consumers.  Most analysts expect inflation to turn negative in the first quarter of this year, and for the year as a whole CPI inflation will decline by approximately 1.75%.  In the short term, declining prices are for the most part a positive development, although it would not be desirable to see the emergence of a position where declining prices began to feed into expectations of further price reductions.</P>
        <P>Turning now to the issue of competitiveness, many of the contributions focused on the need for improvement in this regard.  The Government is well aware of the importance of competitiveness for our economic well-being and our goal must be to maintain our position as an attractive destination for inward investment and to position the economy to be able to take advantage of the global recovery when this emerges.  We must be cognisant that national competitiveness is a shared responsibility, not only of Government but of all society and the social partners.  Becoming more competitive will require each of us to play our part and work together to this end.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the need to underpin the sustainability of the public finances, the Government will continue to take steps to support competitiveness.  In addition, the Government is prioritising productivity enhancing investment under the national development plan.  Capital investment spending is being maintained at 5% of national income, which is very high by international standards.  That is the real stimulus package that was maintained in the budget last year and it will assist the economy in a difficult year.  Investment in education, skills and training is also being maintained at high levels in line with the Government&rsquo;s strategy of re-positioning the economy further along the value-added chain.</P>
        <P>A well functioning financial system is a fundamental element for any economy and the Government has provided decisive action in this regard.  The guarantee scheme, which the Government put in place on 30 September last year, continues for a period of two years.  The scheme was put in place to remove any uncertainty on the part of counterparties and customers of the systemically important credit institutions.  Our objective was to maintain financial stability for the benefit of depositors and businesses and in the best interests of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is generally accepted that international capital market expectations on capital levels in the banking sector have altered.  Though Irish banks are capitalised above minimum European regulatory requirements, high loan provisions or write-offs, whether already acknowledged or expected in the next few years, mean that the markets expect banks to have a higher level of quality capital.  This expectation was reinforced when the UK carried out its recapitalisation scheme, targeting this higher level.  Other European countries have followed suit.</P>
        <P>Significant falls in the share prices of Irish banks pointed to the belief by the capital markets that the Irish banks were undercapitalised.  The Government&rsquo;s plan to recapitalise is intended to stabilise the Irish financial system and secure its funding base.  The recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland announced in December last included a credit package under which the banks committed to, <i>inter alia</i>, providing at least an additional 10% capacity for lending to small to medium enterprises in 2009, an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009, assist householders who are in arrears on their mortgages, and introduce a &euro;100 million fund to support environment-friendly investments in terms of reducing energy usage facilitating switching to renewable energies with a view to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s carbon footprint.  Discussions are ongoing with the two banks on the recapitalisation, the details of which remain to be finalised.  Discussions are also continuing on the capital requirements of our other financial institutions.</P><Col N="75"/>
        <P>Everybody in this House is aware of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the reasons for this, and I do not need to elaborate on them today.  Suffice it to say that the immediate impact of the legislation, which was signed into law on Wednesday last, is to provide certainty to all of the bank&rsquo;s depositors and other customers, across all of its operations in Ireland and internationally, that the bank is secure and stable and will continue to conduct its business on normal terms.  The day-to-day running of Anglo Irish Bank will continue as normal and all employees remain employed by the company.  All borrowers from the bank remain subject to the same terms and the new board of Anglo Irish Bank will place a particular focus on ensuring that all debts are fully pursued by the bank in a commercial way, as any other bank would.  The Government is committed to providing a platform for a well regulated, profitable banking industry of high repute in Ireland that operates in a national and international financial services environment.</P>
        <P>We are in the midst of a sharp global recession the likes of which has not been seen for a very long time.  The turmoil internationally has been exacerbated by a correction in the construction sector and we have seen an increase in joblessness as a result.  All of this has placed significant strains on the public finances but it is also important to remember that notwithstanding current difficulties, our medium-term economic prospects remain positive and our economy has the capacity to grow once the current difficulties are overcome.</P>
        <P>To overcome these difficulties will require a collective act of will on the part of all of us to tackle certain fundamental matters.  First, we must &mdash; I pledge myself to &mdash; continue to redouble efforts to stabilise our banking and financial system in the great world financial turmoil in which it now operates.  It is fundamental that we stabilise the banking system and that we ensure that it is restored as a system that provides credit to consumers and small and medium sized businesses throughout the economy.</P>
        <P>Second, it is essential we improve our competitiveness and, as part of that, we must address the question of the public finances, the shortfall in revenue and the need to economise to ensure that Ireland can pay its way and that we as a State do not live beyond our means &mdash; that is fundamental.</P>
        <P>While the plan submitted to the European Commission in Brussels envisages a five-year timescale, the reality is that the decisive action must be taken now, this year and in 2010 so that a credible signal is given to the international community that Ireland will sort out its problems.  Ireland can sort out its problems and as a Government, we are determined that we will do so.</P>
        <P>The announcement that will be made next week is simply an initial announcement, a clear demonstration of intent on our part.  It will be followed up by the work of the expenditure control board who will advise me, and in consultation with the social partners and the Government decisions will be taken.</P>
        <P>The Government will take firm decisions on further controls on public expenditure in the balance of this calendar year.  They will lead to a better opening position on next year&rsquo;s Estimates.  It will be essential to review both day-to-day and capital spending in that context.</P>
        <P>When we receive the report of the Commission on Taxation, the Government and, I hope, the public generally will reflect on the nature of our tax system, note its highly progressive character and understand that the burden must be fairly shared by all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <Quest> the level of funding received to date by the 36 local action groups approved for funding under the Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007-13; the number of local action group projects which have commenced; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2809/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that, on 4 November, I announced the local action groups selected to deliver the programme, along with their individual funding allocations.  The signing of contracts is under way &mdash; indeed, I handled many of them today &mdash; and the programme will be open to applications for grant assistance in the near future.</P>
        <P>With the signing of contracts, funding to local action groups will commence under the programme shortly.  The selection and development of projects and the arrangements for payments to individual project promoters is primarily a matter for the groups.  However, I anticipate that project activity will be occurring on the ground in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask two or three questions.  The Leader programme was to run from 2007 to 2014, but it was announced last year that many office amalgamations did not occur.  People were sitting around in rented offices.  From where did that funding coming?  Did it come from the 2007-13 programme?</P>
        <P>Turning to the most important issue, the Minister amalgamated a number of companies, some of which were to bring all of their offices, equipment and resources with them.  What has occurred in this regard?  Have all of the amalgamated Leader programmes brought their assets with them?  It has been brought to my attention that some companies were not prepared to do so despite the fact that many of their assets were provided using taxpayers&rsquo; money.  What is the up-to-date position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, funding was provided by the Exchequer.  Eventually, I told companies that, unless the cohesion process was completed, I would withdraw that funding. <Col N="77"/> None of the 2007-13 programme&rsquo;s money was used last year.  A new programme is being rolled out, the advantage of which is that, despite starting in 2009, it will still finish in 2013.  There could not be a better time for launching a large, positive programme, as it is needed more urgently than ever.  I hope it encourages people to consider unexplored possibilities.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Ring&rsquo;s second question, we are aware of some companies that will not continue.  There was vested ownership-management of the assets that they acquired.  It is fair to say that, in most cases, those assets were acquired with some element of State funding.  Often, the maintenance of the assets also involved Exchequer funding.  We are taking appropriate steps to ensure the State&rsquo;s interests in the assets are protected.</P>
        <P>A number of companies do not intend to wind up, but to continue outside the Leader programme.  We must ensure the Exchequer&rsquo;s interests in their assets are protected.  A process is under way and will be followed to the nth degree to ensure that, as the Deputy will agree, anything paid for by the State is accounted for fully.  If staff move, the appropriate assets should transfer with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I will revert to the matter of assets in a later question.  Given the Leader programme&rsquo;s value of &euro;425 million, has the Minister conducted a value for money audit of the previous Leader programme to determine whether we learned from any mistakes and whether funds were spent wisely?  I hope that such an audit was conducted and that the Minister learned from it.  He was correct when he stated that we need the money now more than ever.  We must encourage people, particularly those in rural areas, to set up companies that offer employment and to aid them with grants.  No public money should be wasted, given its new value in these times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>An external pre-report on the new Leader programme report also examined what occurred under previous programmes.  Sometimes, I wonder about the worth of so many evaluations.  I have yet to see an evaluation that states something is rubbish.  The evaluation groups always ask for additional processes.</P>
        <P>While I may have the wrong attitude, I am impressed when the ordinary people of an area and not the people promoting the programme tell me that it is delivering on the ground and has made a difference.  I am impressed by visible effects.  Today, many of those involved in the rural social schemes and RAPID communities visited Dublin.  The external evaluators that I rely on in my heart and soul are the ordinary people for whom this is all meant.  If they say that a programme makes a difference, I believe them.  If they say it is not affecting their lives, I will listen carefully irrespective of how favourable any report that I receive might be.  As well as conducting professional reports, it is important we ask a simple question of those living in the areas.  If they say a programme does not make a difference, hard, extra analysis is warranted.  I do not know whether the Deputy agrees with my homespun approach, but I often find it gives me more truth than many of the thick, professionally produced documents I receive.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if he has plans to increase the number of local drugs task forces; if there were calls for a county-based task force during the recent public meetings; his views on such a strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2820/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 14 local drugs task forces, LDTFs, are in operation, 12 of which are <Col N="78"/>located in Dublin while the others are in Bray and Cork.  The rest of the country is covered by ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs.  I have no plans to increase the number of LDTFs.</P>
        <P>From time to time during the extensive public consultation process undertaken in connection with the preparation of the new national drugs strategy, reference was made to the extent of the areas covered by various RDTFs.  However, the issue of county-based drug task forces was not raised to any significant degree at the public consultation meetings I attended.  I am informed this was also the case at other such meetings.  As the House might remember, I was not a Minister of State during all of the consultation process.  The regional structures, which are still relatively new, are starting to make a real impact on the ground and should be given the opportunity to fulfil their potential in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The development of a new strategy presents an important opportunity to examine the structures through which it is delivered and to consider whether there are different and more effective ways of achieving our goals.  Should the steering group, which is developing proposals in this regard, recommend any changes to the geographic areas covered by the drugs task forces as part of its deliberations, I will consider them at that stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, from which I am to understand that no extension of the drugs task forces is intended in the new national drugs strategy.  Initially, the task forces were set up in areas where there was a prevalence of heroin misuse.  Unfortunately, hard drugs have spread across the country.  A viewpoint exists in certain counties at least that this requires a much more intensive approach and that the regional structures are too large.  Something is needed that reaches out more effectively to towns and villages outside the large urban areas. </P>
        <P>I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that this was not raised to any great extent at the consultative meetings.  However, the trends are very worrying.  Does he agree that the structure that currently exists for dealing with reductions in supply and, more importantly, demand is just not adequate and we are losing the battle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>To reiterate, I inherited the situation and the public consultation was half over before I took up my position.  I checked and it did not arise as a significant issue. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that while we have regional task forces, in some cases there are sub-committees on a county by county basis.  If there were to be more task forces, we might lose sight of what we are trying to deliver.  In other words, our administrative capacity could grow and the channelling of funds and resources to front line services would be diminished.  When one looks at the various components and partners within a task force, it could mean meeting after meeting without achieving real objectives.</P>
        <P>That issue did not arise, but I have an open mind on it although it has not been brought to the steering group as a significant issue.  The structures that were in place were thought to be relatively new.  They were only bedding in and it was generally believed that they should be afforded the opportunity to achieve their full potential.  Given the current economic environment, where we are seeking to streamline organisations while ensuring that resources are delivered to front line services as much as possible, the creation of other agencies and boards is, I believe, unlikely at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding attendances at these consultative meetings, how representative were they?  Would many of the people involved have a stake in the current set up and, <Col N="79"/>perhaps, not be disposed towards considering that proposal?  The fact that it was not raised widely might not signify that it does not have wider support. </P>
        <P>I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point about not setting up more structures or talking shops, etc.  However, we are talking about a hands-on approach that effectively delivers services.  In my view, this needs to spread beyond the existing structures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is right.  At the public consultation meetings, the average number present was about 100, although I do not have the precise figures.  Many of those attending obviously had an interest.  They were either involved in providing the services, had family links or there was an area of particular interest for them.  However, the process went further than just public consultation.  We met with all the other providers, statutory and otherwise, and that did not arise as an issue.  If it was to be on a county by county basis, as has been suggested, there would be many meetings in some and perhaps very little delivery of service.  At this time, it is felt that the regional structures, which are relatively new, are bedding in and they allow for local sub-committees to operate on a county by county basis under the remit of a regional structure.  In the case of Limerick, for example, there is a specific sub-committee for that particular area.  I do not believe we should restrict the activities of the regional task forces.  They can organise internally as they see fit, at county by county sub-committee level, but no proposal to establish independent local drugs task forces, as suggested, has arisen during the consultation and is not being considered at this stage.</P>

	<P>In line with the commitment given in the Agreed Programme for Government, and on foot of the cohesion process recently completed by my Department, there is now one integrated local development company in any given area of the country and fewer local development companies overall.  These new, more coherent delivery arrangements provide full county coverage and enable rural businesses and community groups to readily access services, including information and advice, and to make maximum use of the funding available for rural development.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Leader element of the new rural development programme includes particular measures in support of business creation and development.  There is specific funding provided to foster awareness of and animate the programme and this supports rural community groups and enterprises in taking advantage of the opportunities under the programme.  This major funding programme, which is now being rolled out across the country, will also be implemented by the new integrated companies.</P>
        <P>Information is available to prospective businesses wishing to start up in Gaeltacht regions from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, a body that comes under the ambit of my Department.  In addition, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s provides information and advice to assist community groups and co-operatives to set up local enterprise projects and put together community development plans.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s enterprise fund for non-Gaeltacht islands, assistance is made available to entrepreneurs wishing to establish new or expand existing enterprises on the islands outside the Gaeltacht.  The scheme is administered locally by the relevant county enterprise <Col N="80"/>boards, from whom information and advice is readily available to the communities concerned.  An integrated company, which is dedicated exclusively to the islands, has also been set up, in fulfilment of a further programme for Government commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister is aware, these concerns have been raised by elected members of his party.  There is great concern at present about the number of State agencies and, in the Agreed Programme for Government, Fianna F&aacute;il gave a commitment to the effect that there would be one-stop shops in the county.  The Minister said that he has set up mechanisms, but there is a great worry about the clutter of State agencies, such as the Leader programme, Enterprise Ireland, the county and city enterprise boards, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Western Development Commission, Shannon Development and F&Aacute;S.  People are concerned that one agency may be subsidising another to keep people in jobs. </P>
        <P>The people who really need money and want help in setting up businesses still do not know where they have to go to get the grant aid they need.  There is total confusion.  Those in Fianna F&aacute;il as well as Fine Gael and people in the community are concerned about this and believe there is too much duplication.  I want to know what the Minister can do to stop this wastage of taxpayers&rsquo; money so that we may have a one-stop shop.  If someone is coming into the Gaeltacht or a town in any county, there should be a one-stop shop where he or she can submit proposals and ask for help.  Instead, people are being told they have to go hither and thither, and it is taxpayers&rsquo; money that has to pay for all these agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Deputy  had a question, but well said anyway.  I could agree with him more. </P>
        <P>On becoming Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, one of the first things I did was to say I would cut down on the number of people giving out grants in the Gaeltacht.  At that time people could go to Leader, the partnership companies, the enterprise board and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I said there was no need for enterprise boards operating in the Gaeltacht as we already had &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, Leader and the partnerships.  Then I amalgamated Leader and the partnership companies, so I started with four agencies and reduced the number to two.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy McGinley, has listened with interest to the great debate on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, where I said that my vision was that by 2013 we should have one community-based agency in the Gaeltacht.  I do not see why we have to have two and I agree fully with Deputy Ring in this regard.</P>
        <P>Obviously, we are committed to the current rural development programme in the Gaeltacht.  I do not see why we need two organisations in the Gaeltacht to operate the rural social scheme and the social economy and so on.  In relation to areas outside the Gaeltacht, as the Deputy is aware, we have now brought the Leader and partnership companies together, which I believe is reasonable.  That was a fairly tortuous effort and I thank Deputy Ring and all the other members of his party for their support in that process, both in principle and at an individual level.  It was most helpful.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, is looking at the whole relationship between partnerships and community development projects.  They need to be aligned and cannot operate as if they are all independent empires.  I am fully with the Deputy on this point.</P>
        <P>He mentioned the Western Development Commission.  It is not one of the more expensive commissions, with 16 employees and costs of around &euro;1 million in administration annually.  That said, we need to have a mature debate about the structures and the overlaps.  Unfortunately, sometimes when decisions are made there is a natural knee-jerk reaction on the ground <Col N="81"/>and everyone takes their cue from this, rather than analysing the initiative taken in the first place.  I would be more than willing to engage, at committee level, in teasing out these issues.  As I stated in a television interview today when I was asked about the Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s issue, the only thing that counts is delivery to the people on the ground.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister offered to come to committee and it is the place to discuss this.  However, the Minister should do a cost analysis on these groups.  The main concern is that one State agency is paying the other to keep the offices open.  This is not why the Minister established them.  His intent was to help create employment in the regions and this is not happening.  We need an investigation to examine what agencies exist, what are their functions and with whom have they dealt.  The reaction I get from people in my community and throughout the country is that they want this rationalised and done so quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Ring.  It is true that if I ask an average partnership how much it is getting from my Department, and for example the answer is &euro;1 million and I then ask how much the turnover is I will probably be told it is &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million and that it is great to have leveraged out this extra &euro;3 million.  The disappointing aspect is that it was leveraged out from other State agencies.  The obvious question is whether it would be better to issue one cheque for &euro;4 million and be done with it.  Some of this can be rationalised and some cannot; I do not have a problem if it involves a community employment scheme.</P>
        <P>I have been trying to simplify it step by step and eliminate duplication.  In practice I have found that often it is easy to figure out where one would like to be and where one would have it if one were to start again.  The problem is to find a path from where we are to where we want to go taking into account human issues.  We have been proactive in examining this issue.  Perhaps we can do more and I am open to suggestions.</P>
        <P>The problem with an outside report is that sometimes when one receives it one finds that one does not agree with it.  To a certain extent, we in this House should use our collective wisdom more.  There was a big debate about what was stated about the first D&aacute;il.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department co-ordinated the Irish input into the development of the EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012 which was finalised late last year.  Problem drug use is a global phenomenon and, in this context, it is important that we take an international perspec<Col N="82"/>tive.  Engagement at EU level is important and various Departments and agencies, as well as representatives of civil society in more recent times, are involved in this.  Overall, I feel that we have a lot to offer, as well as a lot to gain, through the various fora involved.</P>
        <P>A steering group, chaired by my Department is developing proposals on the new national drugs strategy covering the period 2009-16.  As part of its terms of reference, the group will be examining developments in drugs policies and in dealing with problem drug use generally, at EU and international levels.  I expect to receive its proposals and recommendations by the end of March and I will then consider them before seeking Government approval for the new strategy.</P>
        <P>I envisage that the new strategy will incorporate a four year action plan for 2009-12, to coincide with the EU policy period, bringing us into line with the EU timeframe.  I further envisage that it will fulfil the objectives of the EU action plan across its five main priorities areas, namely, co-ordination, demand reduction, supply reduction, international co-operation and information, research and evaluation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what the Minister stated about streamlining in answer to the previous question.  Perhaps today is the first time I have sat in this Chamber and heard people who want to sing from the same hymn sheet.  The Minister made an important point, namely that we need to listen to the people on the ground because they can tell one whether a project is working.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to this question, action plans are full of objectives and actions.  However, they do not amount to a great deal.  I do not believe the most recent national drugs strategy was a great success.  I would state the opposite in that it has failed.  The 5% cutbacks announced mean that while matters were improving slightly there is a danger that they are going backwards.</P>
        <P>Recently, I read a report from the local garda&iacute; showing that last year the amount of drugs seized increased from the previous amount of &euro;167 million.  The garda&iacute; are doing their best and I agree with what the Commissioner stated yesterday about the necessity for more community policing.  We must ensure that what is on paper is not only on paper and that the actions are put into place.  This was a failure of the previous national drugs strategy and I hope it changes.</P>
        <P>Due to the difficult economic times my fears turn to those who are homeless.  Last week I read a report which stated that 80% of people who are homeless are prone to drug use.  This is a major increase over the past five years.</P>
        <P>Last week, we visited the Liberties Recycling centre where the Minister of State presented awards and saw the impact which the project is having on people&rsquo;s lives.  What is the commitment, even with the cuts, to supporting projects such as this?  It is the way we should consider helping communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>To refer to the particular project we visited, it shows the inter-agency approach and the effectiveness of a number of agencies where 40 out of 50 people recovering from addiction and in rehabilitation are learning a skill with the real prospect of going to employment.</P>
        <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the cuts and I will be as direct as I can.  For the five year period from 2003 to 2008, the allocation in my Department doubled.  Deputy Byrne is correct that in this year&rsquo;s budget the subhead for the drugs strategy was cut by 5%.  However, internally we added a couple of million to this.  Effectively, the allocation of funding to task forces in 2009 is <Col N="83"/>the same as it was in 2008.  I know Deputy Byrne will make the argument that programmes were developing which needed more money.  However, in real terms the allocation in 2009 is what it was in 2008.</P>
        <P>When we discuss a drugs strategy, and Liberties Recycling was mentioned, it is not only about funding allocated through the Department, our partners such as the HSE, F&Aacute;S and the Department of Education and Science are also involved.  In this regard approximately &euro;230 million was spent in 2008 on a national strategy.  Our partners in various Departments are finalising their spending for the current year in line with output.  We are committed to preserving front line services.  We will make cuts wherever we can elsewhere but my aim is to ensure front line services are preserved at all times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, I met a group of parents of children availing of methadone services.  They asked me what will be in the national drugs strategy to help their children to be weaned off the drug rather than being left on it for another five or six years.  At present, they are caught in a vicious circle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Depending on who one speaks to there are 8,000 or 9,000 people on methadone treatments of one type or another.  In recent weeks I met with the HSE to examine this issue.  I am no different from the Deputy in that I meet families of people on methadone and I am concerned that people are on methadone for too long.  For some people there might be no alternative but I am not satisfied that we have an aggressive enough methadone reduction programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 25 together.</P>
        <P>In many rural areas there are no public transport services at night.  While in the more developed rural areas there may be hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers and do not always provide a guaranteed service to rural people.</P>
        <P>Against this background in May 2007 I introduced a new evening transport service, on a pilot basis, to allow rural people to fully participate in the community, sporting and social activities that take place in their areas.  Thirty-four groups deliver the rural transport programme, which is operated by the Department of Transport, and seven of these are delivering the pilot evening transport service.  The pilot scheme is widely used in the areas in which it is in operation.  Funding of &euro;665,000 was provided to run the pilot scheme to the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>A review of the pilot scheme is under way and it is anticipated that it will be completed in the coming weeks.  Decisions regarding the future of the scheme will be made following the completion of the review process.  In the interim, additional funding of &euro;150,000 has been pledged to run the scheme for the first quarter of 2009.  This funding has been allocated to the seven participating groups as follows:</P>

	<P>The Minister told me during his last session of parliamentary questions that he would have that report early in January.  I hope we have it soon.  Has the Minister provided funding in each Department to continue that pilot scheme for the year?  It is important that it should continue.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs so that a voucher system can be put in place and people in rural Ireland, who can avail of the free schemes but have no access to the public transport, can use the vouchers for taxis and other forms of transport?  Some people in rural areas have got the free schemes, but they cannot use them because they have no access to public transport.  The people who can avail of the free schemes should be given the option to avail of public transport or to obtain vouchers to use taxis and so on.</P>

	<P>People with free travel will travel free on this scheme.  Therefore, they are not being charged.  We have not got the report, but I understand we will have it shortly and we will make it available.  We have made money available for January, February and March this year.  From what I hear anecdotally, my argument is the opposite.  It would appear from what is happening on the night-time scheme that the vast majority of people are travelling for free because they are eligible for free travel.  Before we set up this scheme, we were told there was a major problem with people under the age of 66 who tried to go out and socialise, because of the laws on drinking and driving.  I wonder whether some of the services were structured correctly to attract a younger clientele that would have paid, which would have made these services more economic and would have allowed us to provide more services for our money.</P>
        <P>Many of these services operated on fixed bus routes, with a fixed time and a fixed place and so on.  People might be picked up at their houses, but the bus would go to one destination.  We should look at the model whereby a hackney could be on a retainer in a fixed geographic area over a fixed time, such between as 7 p.m. on a Friday night and 2 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  For a fixed fee, the hackney would always be available to go anywhere in that area.  That would attract much more young people to use the service.  It would make it more viable and when those who can afford to pay do so it facilitates us in providing more services.</P>
        <P>When we get the report, we will make it available.  We could then have a debate on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is carrying out the review of the night time rural transport scheme?  What are the terms of reference given to the review group?  Why is it that only seven of the 34 groups provided service?  Has the Minister any statistical breakdown on usage?  I am referring to the percentage of the population, the number of people using the service, the cost per head and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that the information being sought by the Deputy will be in the report.  I will watch very carefully for that.  I am only going on the anecdotal evidence that I have, but it seems to be mainly older people using the service.  That may not be borne out in the report, but I will have to wait and see.  All these statistics are being ascertained.  I have not got the name of the person or the group carrying out the review, but I will arrange for the person who is carrying out the review to inform the Deputy.  I understand that the review is more or less completed, but I do not have the name here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the new terms of reference?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I approved the terms of reference and I will arrange for them to be sent to the Deputy.  I made one amendment to the terms of reference, so I remember them quite clearly.  I believe they were adequate for the purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>If that scheme was to be extended to the end of this year, will the funding be there for it?  This issue is about money.  If the Department does not have the money, then an extension of the pilot scheme will not happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It could be tempting fate for any Minister to say before Tuesday that he has the funding for anything.  We should do the evaluation here.  I believe the concept is right.  When one compares what is spent by the State on urban transport with rural transport, one finds that the money spent <i>per capita</i> on rural transport is minuscule.  Despite the impression that is often given, it costs much less to provide transport to rural Ireland.  One could also say that the services are inferior as well.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="88"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>One of my findings from the committee report is that Dublin Bus, Luas and so on are costing much more.  The schemes in rural Ireland cost only small amounts of money when compared to what is happening in the cities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I am sure he appreciates it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>A publican in a rural area outside a town in my constituency bought a mini-bus to bring people to and from his premises.  When he applied for tax relief against his business, he was refused as he needed a taxi licence.  We should provide incentives for people who will provide transport in situations like that.  This issue should be kept in mind when the Minister analyses the review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very good idea.  We will publish the report, and with the blessing of the committee chairperson and the Deputy, I will come in to the House and debate it.  We must try to see if we can extend the services.  I would give it a priority if I could prove that I could go further with similar money and serve more people.  I am willing to debate creative ideas like that proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea.  I have been told on the ground that the scheme was successful, but if I was doing it again, I would look for more money.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the amount of funding he will allocate to the RAPID areas for 2009; if there will be a reduction in funding for these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2574/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The RAPID programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas across the country.  It is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.   Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Departments and local State agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal&rsquo;s website under the RAPID section, which is <i>http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID</i> and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information.</P>
        <P>I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the area implementation teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  In 2007, I agreed to co-fund the provision of facilities in schools located in, or mainly servicing children from, RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;6.5 million has been allocated in the budget for the RAPID leverage schemes in 2009.  While this is a reduction on the amount allocated in 2008, my primary concern will continue to be to make every effort to ensure the front-line services provided by my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities.  I am satisfied that this year&rsquo;s allocation will be sufficient to enable further good progress to be made with small-scale co-funded projects in RAPID areas in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the RAPID programme began, it has been very difficult to identify the projects that were completed as a consequence.  Perhaps they would have been <Col N="89"/>completed in any case.  How many were completed earlier than anticipated because of the programme?  Did the programme really concentrate resources in the 46 RAPID areas?  Has anyone determined what exactly the programme has achieved?  Claims have been made on the Government side that many projects were completed as a result of the RAPID programme.  One would be sceptical about this and ask whether they might have been completed in any case.  Is there any way of telling what the programme really delivered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>To give the Deputy a very straight answer, I am not sure.  It is a valid question and I have often asked it myself.  It is very hard to determine.  Consider, for example, the case of a community council that keeps asking a local council to fix the pavement.  When it gets fixed, it is impossible to prove whether it would have happened anyway or whether the community council was an agent in making it happen.  Therefore, it would be unreasonable for me to claim all the projects in RAPID areas and all the projects associated with work programmes were carried out solely because of the RAPID programme.  I do not believe this is true.</P>
        <P>We had a RAPID conference today.  If I were asked to state the real nub of RAPID, I would say it is that, through the area implementation teams, the people living in the areas concerned for the first time sit at the table as equals.  When facilities are needed in an area, the team is present to represent that area and have an input.  Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s theory is probably correct that some projects would be carried out in any case.  Let us consider the case of a health centre in this category.  The difference RAPID could make is that, when such a centre is being built, the area implementation team, because it would sit as an equal at the table with the HSE, or because there would be some RAPID leverage money available, would be able to determine the type of centre to be constructed and the services provided.  This, in itself, could make a considerable qualitative, rather than a quantitative, difference.</P>
        <P>I stated publicly today that the defining difference between living in a local authority housing estate and elsewhere, be it in an urban or rural area, is that in the former case most decisions have been made for one by others.  I refer to the size of the house, the shape of the rooms and the community facilities.  Local authority housing residents have had very little input into any decision affecting their area.  On the other extreme, the main characteristic of small rural communities is the considerable input they have into what happens, for better or for worse.  Under the RAPID programme, I wanted to give that kind of input to the public through the area implementation teams.  It is a question of having the community representative sit at the table with the Department&rsquo;s leverage money saying, &ldquo;If we do not agree, there is no deal&rdquo;.  For the first time, the representatives have cash when talking to officials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his frankness.  To some extent, he shares my scepticism and concerns.  Consider the allocation for this year in terms of the initiation of projects.  The Minister stated what would be provided would not be affected by the cutback.  How much is the shortfall?  Can the Minister stand over a statement to the effect that a cutback in resources will not diminish service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the figure was &euro;7.8 million and is now &euro;6.5 million, indicating a shortfall of &euro;1.3 million.  That fund was not very big in the beginning.  I still believe we can have a very good programme this year.  The leverage fund only covers the small projects as the big projects are covered by the Departments from their own funding.  It is not within the scope of the RAPID leverage fund to provide schools and major health facilities, etc.</P>
        <P>I have said that, in everything I have done in the Department, I have tried to keep the front line money in place, particularly on the current side.  I have cut all the administration funds, <Col N="90"/>thus affecting bodies such as Pobal and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  They are all complaining but I have still done it.  In fairness, some of the agencies have been very helpful and understanding in respect of why it had to be done.  The leverage fund, small as it is, involves the communities having a veto over money that the local authority, for example, would have to match.  Normally, if the local authority grants money, it totally determines what happens, but now the communities have a say.</P>
        <P>We allocate some money from the dormant accounts fund for discretionary spending.  It amounts to approximately &euro;100,000 for RAPID areas.  This still remains a top priority for me, although the dormant accounts fund is beginning to become depleted after five years.</P>
        <P>Today we invited a good selection of the sports organisations to the conference at Croke Park, including the FAI, IRFU, the camogie representatives, the GAA, and Swim Ireland.  Many of these bodies have considerable resources and we were telling them to match the resources the area implementation teams receive through the dormant accounts fund and to increase activity in sport in the RAPID areas.  For every euro we give, I hope we would get &euro;2 or &euro;3 from the sports organisations.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to providing essential public services in rural areas to secure a proper environment for economic development, promote social inclusion and support dispersed, viable rural communities.  To this end, the programme for Government contains a series of commitments to strengthen and underpin public service provision in rural areas across a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>One of the challenges faced by rural communities relates to accessing services from Departments and agencies.  In line with a commitment given in the programme for Government, new integrated local development companies have been established in rural areas that will enable local communities to more readily access services in regard to a wide range of schemes and programmes operated by my Department.  These schemes and programmes aim to strengthen the provision of services in rural areas, regenerate rural communities and support the diversification of the rural economy.  Relevant schemes include the CL&Aacute;R schemes, the community services programme, the rural development programme, the rural social scheme and the pilot rural transport night scheme.</P>
        <P>The CL&Aacute;R programme, which aims to tackle deficits in physical, economic and social infrastructure in peripheral rural areas affected by population decline, has a pivotal role in strengthening public service provision in rural areas.  CL&Aacute;R schemes cover a wide variety of developments such as housing and schools enhancement, electricity conversion, roads, water supply, sewerage schemes, and health, coastal, sports and community projects.</P>
        <P>The community services programme is of particular relevance.  This programme supports voluntary and community groups to provide essential services, which otherwise would not normally be available within local communities, such as social care, services for older persons, youth support and recycling.</P>
        <P>The Leader element of the rural development programme 2007&ndash;13 aims to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy.  The new programme is being rolled out this year and a sum of &euro;27 million has been allocated for 2009. <Col N="91"/> &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission, which come within the ambit of my Department, also promote economic and social development in rural areas.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above measures, the rural transport programme, which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport, seeks to address social exclusion in rural areas arising from unmet public transport needs.  This scheme is complemented by the pilot rural transport night scheme, which is operated directly by my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has a policy of decentralisation, yet Eircom announced last week it is to remove half of its public telephone boxes.  At one stage it had 8,500 and now the number has decreased to 4,500.  With the next cull, there may be fewer than 2,000.  Likewise, post offices are closing in rural areas throughout the State.  There are currently some 1,200 in total and they are unevenly spread across the country.  The Minister referred to rural transport.  If it were not for the Minister and the communities themselves, there would be no transport in rural areas.</P>
        <P>We now have a situation where one of the largest retail groups in the country, Superquinn, has had to pull out of Dundalk.  In rural areas, small shops are closing because they can no longer compete with larger operators and because rural populations are declining.  The Minister must seek to bring as many Government agency services as possible into rural areas.  It is important that he have discussions with companies such as Eircom in this regard.  It was taxpayers&rsquo; money that put Eircom&rsquo;s infrastructure in place and it is obliged under law, as overseen by the Commission for Communications Regulation, to provide a certain element of public service.  It is public service that is missing in this country.  What does the Minister intend to do in this regard?  Semi-State companies have a public service obligation.</P>
        <P>The Minister has eliminated the hub towns from the Leader programme with the result that they cannot draw down any funding.  This is causing a significant problem in many rural towns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have agreed with much of what Deputy Ring has said today.  However, sometimes we make a song and dance in defending services which are not used by anybody.  Some years ago, for example, Eircom announced that it was removing a public telephone box in my constituency.  In response to a telephone call from a local resident, I made a representation for its retention.  The Eircom representatives I dealt with were very helpful and the telephone box was kept in place.  However, I must admit that I was informed at the time that the average number of calls being made from this telephone box was three per week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The telephone was probably broken and had not been fixed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was working perfectly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of a case in Mayo where it took Eircom a week to fix a telephone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that few people in rural areas use public telephones because most of them have a mobile telephone.  From speaking to people in these areas, I am aware that this is not the service with which they are most concerned.  What people are shouting about is the provision of broadband.  With the announcement of the rural broadband scheme, I have no doubt that companies such as Eircom will now provide broadband at a rate of knots where they would not have done so before.  The difference now is that we have engendered competition in the market.  I am confident that nine out of ten people in rural areas would gladly swap a public telephone box for the availability of broadband.  In the modern world, the <Col N="92"/>latter is 100 times more important.  People will fight for that rather than for the retention of telephone boxes which are no longer used.</P>
        <P>Likewise, I am of the view that there is no viable future for post offices in which all the processing is still done manually and where there is a turnover of only &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 per year.  There is no livelihood to be had from such an enterprise.  To oppose any consolidation in this age of the car, mobile telephone and other modern technology is to destroy the viability of the remaining post offices.  There must be a balanced approach in this.  We cannot defend services whose day has gone.  I would much rather seek out those services whose future is coming.  I have always been greatly supportive of the credit unions, for example, because they can provide a five-day or seven-day per week service.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that small retail businesses in rural areas are in trouble.  However, there is another side to it, as the Deputy will know from his own constituency.  I am sure very little passes him by in his constituency.  It is significant that the first Tesco store in Ballinrobe opened recently, while another huge supermarket is being built on the other side of town by a person who previously had a smaller supermarket in the town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>However, all the smaller shops are closing.  That is Government policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>My attitude when I see Aldi and Lidl stores opening in Clifden, and a Tesco store opening in Ballinrobe, is that, in their absence, the people who shop there would instead travel to supermarkets in Galway and other large towns.  One can view it either as the multiples coming to the people or the people going to the multiples.  The reality is that most people tend to go to the multiples when they have a large quantity of purchases to make.  It is a positive development that the large chains are willing to set up in rural areas and create employment.  I have an opposite view to that of Deputy Ring in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to public services in rural areas, there is a problem in the Gaeltacht area in my own constituency, where it seems we are set to lose the &aacute;isitheoir poibl&iacute;.  I understand this is also happening in two other areas, R&aacute;th Chairn and U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach, and it is a damaging development.  Will the Minister intervene to ensure this important public service, which comes within the remit of his Department, is retained?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have expressed publicly my surprise at learning that these three &aacute;isitheoir poibl&iacute; positions are being removed.  Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta must explain why, out of its 60 staff, this particular position is being targeted.  There are no other staff in these small Gaeltachta&iacute; but they are the first positions to go.  I do not understand it.</P>
        <P>However, we must recognise that the entire basis of partnership under the Leader programme is bottom-up development.  Therefore, it is not in my position to dictate how&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the difficulty that Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s funding has been reduced?  Is there another element from within the Minister&rsquo;s Department, such as Coiste na Gaeilge, from which these posts could be financed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot continue to provide additional finance to administrators simply because they inevitably make decisions to cut the post that is based in the most remote place.  I understand Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta has funding for some 60 jobs.  It is a matter for that body to ensure it configures that staff complement so as to provide effective services to these outlying areas.  If I were to do what the Deputy is proposing, I would have to take money from front line services merely to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  I said the day after the <Col N="93"/>budget that I had a policy in my Department, under the local development social inclusion programme, Pobal and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, to reduce administrative costs in order to protect front line services.  I will not be deflected from that.  Those who must make decisions devolved from me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We have gone way over time on this question but I will allow Deputy Ring to put a final supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to have time to respond to Deputy Ring&rsquo;s question on the hub towns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s views in regard to post offices and telephone boxes.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is to decentralise State services, yet State agencies are withdrawing services from rural areas.  The Minister referred to broadband provision.  The Government gave a commitment last week to roll out broadband throughout the State, with a particular emphasis on rural areas.  There was uproar in my constituency because many of the rural areas there are exempt from it.  I challenge the Minister to accompany me to several areas in my constituency where he will find it is impossible to get a mobile telephone signal.  Eircom and O2 will not be able to deliver broadband if they cannot even deliver mobile telephone coverage.  They must improve the level of their service.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that broadband provision is essential.  The Minister is aware of a business in Blacksod where employees have to go into a corner to get a signal.  I would sacrifice much for broadband.  Without it, we will not attract jobs to rural areas.  The Minister must work with his colleagues, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to ensure it is rolled out.  The Green Party wants birds in rural Ireland but I want people there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am so much in agreement with Deputy Ring today that I am beginning to be worried.  The Deputy is aware of my passion for keeping people in rural areas, I have devoted a lifetime to it.  He and I see eye to eye on this issue.  All I want is modern services.  My point, however, is that it is not conducive to the best interests of rural areas to seek always to protect services which are no longer used by anybody.</P>
        <P>I note the Deputy&rsquo;s points regarding broadband.  The national broadband scheme is being rolled out.  I understand that in one area of the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency, the maps do not cover one area where there is adequate broadband cover.  I have no doubt that my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, will look into that issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ring asked me about hub towns.  I had two choices in this respect, to proceed the way I did or to proceed another way based on OECD statistics on population density.  The option I chose has by far the less negative impact of the two.  If I had taken the other option, it would have resulted in a worse position.  I had to take this option because of consideration of what is covered by the definition of rural.</P>
        <P>If I worked in a Leader company or lived in a rural community, I do not know if I would be happy if a large proportion of the allocation for rural development was being invested in hub towns such as Castlebar, Ballina, Drogheda and so on.  If the allocation is for rural development, let us ensure it is invested in real rural development, which will benefit quite sizeable towns.  I am not sure whether the major county towns should be the big beneficiaries of rural development moneys.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 22 together.         </P>
        <P>A steering group, chaired by my Department, is currently developing proposals on a new national drugs strategy covering the period 2009 to 2016.  I expect to receive its proposals and recommendations by the end of March and I will then consider them before seeking Government approval for a new strategy.</P>
        <P>An extensive consultation process was undertaken last year on the new strategy.  This involved meetings with Government Departments and agencies, the community and voluntary sectors, various interested parties and focus groups as well as an extensive schedule of public consultation meetings at 15 locations across the country.  The outcomes of these discussions are being used by the steering group as the basis for much of its deliberations.  I anticipate I will be in a position to seek Government approval for the new national drugs strategy in April, with publication to follow shortly thereafter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are nearing the end of the first month in 2009 and I intended to ask the Minister of State when he expected the strategy to be published, but he answered that in his reply. </P>
        <P>I refer to a point raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea concerning widespread access to services under the national drugs strategy among communities in rural areas.  I hope such access to services will be highlighted in the new strategy.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State concerned about the &euro;2 billion cost-saving measures to be agreed by the Government?  Does he consider this will result in a cut in funding for the strategy?  Will the Government ensure the new national drugs strategy also addresses the issue of alcohol abuse?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take a brief supplementary from Deputy O&rsquo;Shea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The last point Deputy Byrne raised was the one on which I wanted to focus.  Will the national drugs strategy focus on polydrug use and, in particular, alcohol use?  There have been varying views in the Department about that, but drug abuse and alcohol use are so interlinked that there is no escaping that they must be dealt with together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will first address the alcohol issue as it has provoked a great deal of discussion.  The reality is that alcohol and drug use are closely linked.  In terms of the services provided by the statutory agencies, the HSE, clinics and so forth and education programmes, many of them already focus on drug and alcohol use.  The exact relationship between the two and how it will be defined in the new strategy has not been clearly identified because the process is not complete.  Regardless of that process and the end strategy, there will be a recognition of the role both substances play and there will be syngeries between how we deal with them as that process will have to reflect the treatments currently being provided.</P>
        <P>Regarding the budgetary position, there was a reduction in the allocation in this respect under this year&rsquo;s budget.  Our Department prioritised the drugs budget.  We transferred funds <Col N="95"/>from other subheadings because we recognise the importance of the drugs budget.  The allocation of funding to the community initiatives through the task forces in 2009 will be the same as that allocated to them in 2008.  That will present difficulties for task forces.  I have met many of the chairpersons and co-ordinators and each task force should strategically identify the most important front line services and preserve them in each local area.  The funding allocation for 2009 has been notified to them and it will the same as the allocation for 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomMcEllistrimFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas McEllistrim</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the need for laboratory technicians in our secondary schools.  The Irish Science Teachers&rsquo; Association has overwhelmingly endorsed the proposal that all second level schools be provided with laboratory technicians in an effort to gain greater efficiencies within school science departments and to maximise the use of existing resources.  It has also published a policy document on the matter spelling out the reasons it believes that these support personnel are needed.  The provision of high quality science education is acknowledged by all as a key requisite for our student population.  The promotion of science as a subject at second level, its introduction as part of the new curriculum in our primary schools and the promotion of third and even fourth level science underlines the belief that science as a subject is central to the continuing development of the knowledge economy and to the future of employment in this country.</P>
        <P>The Irish Science Teachers Association believes that to maximise the quality of learning, understanding and value of science in schools, the provision of laboratory technicians would allow teachers to focus on the necessary concepts, namely the teaching of science.</P>
        <P>The three main science subjects at junior and senior cycle levels have all been revised in recent years.  There is a much greater emphasis on practical work, with students being required to complete mandatory experiments in all subjects.  This has resulted in between 24 and 30 mandatory experiments for students at various levels.  There are course work assignments as well as the integration and use of technology by students in their learning.  All this adds up to a considerable amount of practical work and rightly so as science is a practical and hands-on subject.</P>
        <P>Approximately 26, or 4%, of the 720 schools, currently have laboratory technicians on their staff.  However, in Northern Ireland all second level schools employ technicians and may have <Col N="96"/>a technician specifically for each main science discipline.  Valuable time can be lost by students as teachers have to prepare the science laboratory for the varied series of experiments and investigations conducted there.  This can take up to 20 minutes in a single or double class period.</P>
        <P>A survey of schools has shown that principals of schools who already have laboratory technicians believe their presence has led to greater efficiencies within the science departments in terms of planning, maximising use of laboratory time and resources.  They believe that having a technician will provide greater opportunity for students to participate fully and capably in investigative work.</P>
        <P>It is well known that discovery learning is not only more stimulating but also more beneficial for students and it has been observed in schools that have laboratory technicians that a greater number of students participate in extra project work such as the BT Young Scientist exhibition and SciFest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our universities have stated that poor uptake of senior level science subjects, particularly chemistry and physics, is having an impact on the intake of students to science courses at third level and hence the follow-on numbers available for research and development.  A poor quality experience of practical work can be a significant factor in turning students off science.  The existing resources and facilities are not being utilised effectively because of the time pressures on science teachers to both teach and act as science technicians.</P>
        <P>The pharmaceutical industry in Ireland has stated that it believes that there is an urgent need to invest in laboratories and to provide technicians support to run these laboratories, as is the case in third level or in industry.  IBEC has stated that there is an urgent need for the Department of Education and Science to fund the appointment of laboratory assistants in schools.  A laboratory technician can release the teacher from a significant amount of non-teaching duties such as the preparation and distribution of equipment, co-ordination of the laboratories and preparation rooms, stock control of equipment, chemicals and resources and the organisation and day to day running of laboratories by developing an effective routine for all necessary activities and ensuring provision of essential equipment and chemicals for the science classes in addition to all necessary health and safety equipment.</P>
        <P>The provision of technical assistants was one of the 39 recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences.  Such provision would involve a cost, but the importance of science in a modern school curriculum cannot be underestimated.  It should be pointed out that principals want people with a knowledge of science and the relevant qualifications as science technicians.  Laboratory technicians should be able to maintain a safe working environment and support the increased emphasis on practical work in schools.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that there is a crucial role for the institutes of technology in the training of technicians.  The ITs are dispersed geographically throughout the country and the heads of their science departments have shown some interest in this.  Institutes of technology in Tralee or Limerick, for example, could work with their local feeder schools to develop a cost-effective and beneficial system whereby laboratory technicians could be trained and co-ordinated.  The introduction of a practical examination for junior certificate science this year led to increased numbers and better results.  We are making progress.</P>
        <P>I believe the sensible and phased development of a support system of laboratory technicians for secondary schools would further the development of science in our schools and, in so doing, would strengthen our hand with regard to the future of employment in this country.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that the task force on the physical sciences recommended in 2002 the provision of laboratory assistants to schools as part of a strategy to strengthen the implementation of the physical sciences in schools.  At the time this was costed at &euro;18.8 million per annum.  The costs of such a development are now estimated at &euro;25.4 million per annum, for the science subjects only.</P>
        <P>Provision of assistants in this area would undoubtedly lead to demands for similar assistance across other areas of the curriculum where there is a strong practical component.  This would cost an estimated  &euro;122 million per annum for all subjects with a practical component, including IT.  It is understood that the availability of laboratory technicians has not been a universal feature of support for science teaching in second-level schools.  In some countries that provide this type of resource, it is confined to certain types of schools.  It is worth noting that student practical work has been a major feature of science syllabi at both junior and senior cycle levels for many years and science teachers have long experience of carrying out programmes of practical work with their students.  Until recently, this practical work has been assessed through the medium of written papers in the certificate examinations only.  The revised junior certificate science syllabus introduced in 2003 differs from the previous syllabus in a number of ways that are intended to make the subject more relevant to students&rsquo; needs in the 21st century and to provide the students with a richer educational experience.  One of the major changes is that the students&rsquo; practical work is now directly assessed as part of the junior certificate examination.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that the strategy for science, technology and innovation, 2006-2013, contains a commitment that the issue of technical assistance for schools will be re-visited.  However, the budgetary situation is markedly different to that existing when the strategy was first published.  In a context where the Minister has found it necessary to make significant changes in educational expenditure, including increasing the pupil-teacher ratio, he is afraid there is no prospect of providing new services such as laboratory assistants for schools.</P>
        <P>The Minister wishes to add that the demands which arise in science regarding the preparation of materials, etc.,  arise also in other areas of the curriculum, such as home economics, materials technology in wood, construction studies, engineering, art, craft and design, technology, design and communication, graphics and ICT.</P>
        <P>The call here is for a pilot laboratory assistance service in schools in north Kerry and west Limerick.  The Minister is aware that the strategy for science, technology and innovation report indicated that a range of models would be explored.  However, it would not be appropriate to initiate a pilot of this nature at present, given the expectations it would raise within the system, and the fact that there is no prospect of mainstreaming such a development in the current climate.</P>
        <P>There is a wide range of competing needs to be met within the education system, and a rigorous prioritisation process is essential.  The Minister considers it more important that priority is given to meeting the system demands which arise as a result of increasing enrolment; ensuring the provision of school buildings in developing areas; providing for greater inclusion of pupils with special needs; addressing educational disadvantage; promoting enhanced basic skills; ensuring our system prepares young people for a competitive labour market, for lifelong learning and effective social participation; and that the development of education and science strengthen research, development and innovation capacity at the third and fourth levels of the system.</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is fully aware of the importance of science, technology and engineering to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and future competitiveness, and a range of measures has been, and is being taken to promote increased quality and relevance and greater student participation in these important areas.  The Government is investing some &euro;5 million in the Discover Science and Engineering programme funded by Forf&aacute;s, to ensure that teachers are supported in meeting the challenges of change, that there are opportunities to promote school-industry and school-college links, and that there is effective co-operation between the primary professional development service and the second-level support service and the Discover Science and Engineering programme in providing training and supports for teachers.  The innovation and professionalism of teachers, and the enthusiasm, skills and knowledge of students are amply demonstrated in the level and calibre of participation in the BT Young Scientist and Technology exhibition.  We can be proud that last year&rsquo;s Irish winner, Emer Jones, scooped second prize in the EU contest for Young Scientists in 2008.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, resources do not allow for the provision of laboratory assistance for schools at this time.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible for a range of schemes, which provide assistance, including financial assistance, to the youth work sector.   The relevant schemes that support youth work and youth club activity at local level are the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, the Youth Service Grant Scheme, Special Projects for Youth and the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund.  Funding in 2008 for the various grant-in-aid funding programmes amounted to some &euro;52 million.</P>
        <P>While my Department does not operate a specific scheme or programme to support youth clubs in rural areas, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to some measures that have a positive impact on the provision of services and facilities for rural youth.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is responsible for the delivery of Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the Rural Development Programme, 2007-2013.  These elements of the Programme aim to address the needs of a range of groups in rural society, including young people. The measures under which support is available include the Basic Services for the Economy and Rural Population measure (&euro;49.61m over the lifetime of the Programme).  Under this measure, Local Action Groups will identify and provide appropriate cultural and leisure activities to their rural local communities that are not otherwise available to them.  Initiatives in this measure will broadly address the provision of amenity and leisure facilities, general community and recreational infrastructure and certain arts facilities.</P>
        <P>Under the Premises Initiative Fund, which addresses the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects in Drugs Task Force areas, capital funding may also be provided for youth focused projects.  In addition, I should mention that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta provides <Col N="100"/>annual funding of &euro;300,000 to &Oacute;ige na Gaeltachta Teo. to support youth activities throughout the Gaeltacht.  &Oacute;ige na Gaeltachta Teo. aims to improve community-based youth services in the Gaeltacht and to promote and increase the use of Irish within these services.  The organisation provides a broad range of support services to youth clubs, community groups and voluntary organisations in the Gaeltacht, including assistance with insurance costs, funding for equipment and other club activities including educational programmes.  There are currently 55 registered youth clubs with a combined membership of approximately 2,000 young people operating in the Gaeltacht.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 37 together.</P>
        <P>This Government is firmly committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse in our society.  This is evidenced by the fact that the funding targeted at community-based initiatives funded through my Department&rsquo;s Vote doubled from 2003 to 2008 &mdash; from &euro;31.5m over &euro;64m. The relative reduction in the 2009 funding allocation to my Department for the drugs initiatives must, therefore, be viewed in that context.  In 2008, the budget for community-based initiatives in the Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas was nearly &euro;34.8m.  Funding for 2009 will be approx &euro;34.6m, of which over &euro;23m is being allocated to the Local Drugs Task Forces while over &euro;11m is being earmarked for the Regionals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Projects have been approved funding for the first six months of 2009 and the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST) will be reviewing this expenditure before allocating the remaining six months funding. The NDST and the Task Forces will work to ensure that this funding is targeted in the most appropriate manner. Details of the provisional 2009 allocations by Task Force are shown in the following table. All Drugs Task Forces have been asked to identify savings across their area of responsibility.  While I appreciate that there may have been some difficult choices to be make, it was a matter for the Drugs Task Forces to identify measures to enable them to work within their allocated budgets.  In the current economic environment, there is a critical need to ensure that resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that the maximum benefit is achieved. I would like to assure the Deputies that my primary concern has been &mdash; and continues to be &mdash; the protection of front-line services provided through the drugs initiative funding.</P>
        <P>As the Deputes are aware, the Drugs Strategy is based on a co-ordinated effort across many Government Departments and Agencies and my Department&rsquo;s allocation is only part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.  In 2007, it was estimated that expenditure on drugs programmes across all the bodies was in the region of &euro;230m.  The figures for 2008 are currently being compiled.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 21 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s Statement on the Irish Language includes a commitment to develop a 20-year Strategy for the Irish language, which is intended to be the foundation for practical action for supporting and promoting the language, based on a modern, integrated approach.  During the last year, my Department, in conjunction with Fiontar DCU, the independent consultants that are assisting in the formulation of the Strategy, have undertaken a wide-scale public consultation process in relation to the various elements that will be in the Strategy.  In addition to the public consultation, Fiontar DCU consulted with key stake<Col N="103"/>holders in both the public and voluntary sectors as to their recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy.  Fiontar were also assisted by a number of international experts in language policy issues.</P>
        <P>A draft Strategy has now been submitted for my consideration.  I anticipate that my proposals in relation to the 20-year Strategy will be submitted to Government in the near future.  With regard to the consultancy service for the 20 year Strategy, Fiontar DCU were appointed through a public procurement process to advise in relation to the Strategy and the cost of their service is &euro;299,281.  With regard to the Linguistic Study of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht, Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge, National University of Ireland, Galway, were engaged through a public procurement process to carry out this research at a cost of &euro;525,039.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which he will increase or reduce expenditure under the RAPID and CL&Aacute;R programmes in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The CL&Aacute;R Programme provides funding and co-funding to Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities to accelerate investment in selected priority developments in areas that have suffered significant depopulation. These investments support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures. The measures introduced under the Programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas. </P>
        <P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 46 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, the RAPID leverage schemes support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.</P>
        <P>The provisional 2009 budgets for CL&Aacute;R at &euro;18m and RAPID at &euro;7.9m represent a reduction on the 2008 allocations. However, the finalisation of allocations across Departments remains under discussion at Government and it is not possible to say at this stage what the final outcome of those discussions will be.  The Minister for Finance will be publishing the Revised Estimates Volume in due course.</P>
        <P>I would emphasise, however, that one of the strengths of both the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID Programmes has always been the ability to focus on priority needs in those areas.  As Minister, I believe that we need to be constantly addressing the new challenges faced by both small rural communities and the most deprived urban communities.  The CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes will be continuously refocused to deal with the priorities for those areas, especially in the current difficult economic climate.  Furthermore, in the case of RAPID, the Programme works to ensure, now more than ever, that local service providers work together efficiently to ensure effective results within the constraints of reduced budgets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I want to put on record that I do not accept that there has been a deterioration of the partnership process under the National Drugs Strategy. Co-operation across the statutory, community and voluntary sectors has been a constant feature throughout the lifetime of the current Strategy.  This is illustrated through many formal structures, such as inter-sectoral representation on the 24 Drug Task Forces, the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST), the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs (IDG), and also through the informal links and contacts around the drugs area.</P>
        <P>The community and voluntary sectors are well represented on each of the 14 Local and 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces.  They also have a total of 4 representatives on the NDST.   All of these organisations also include broad statutory representation, facilitating a partnership approach to all aspects of their work.  Meanwhile, the IDG, which I chair, provides a forum for the consideration of policy issues around drugs and the monitoring of progress across the Strategy.  Agenda items of the IDG regularly include updates from agencies with responsibility for implementing major actions of the Strategy and all members are free to pursue issues of interest to them in the subsequent discussions.</P>
        <P>An extensive consultation process was undertaken last year in regard to the formulation of a new National Drugs Strategy for 2009-2016.  This involved meetings with Government Departments and agencies, the community and voluntary sectors, various interested parties and focus groups, as well as an extensive schedule of public consultation meetings at 15 locations across the country.  The outcomes of these discussions are being used by the Steering Group, who are working on the development of proposals for a new Strategy, as the basis for much of their deliberations.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously, the overall collaborative and partnership approach of the statutory, voluntary &amp; community sectors has made a significant contribution to the roll-out and effective implementation of drugs programmes.  I see a continuation of this partnership approach as being critical for the future success of our efforts to deal effectively with the drugs problem in Ireland.  Meanwhile, the development of a new Strategy presents an important opportunity to look at the structures through which it is delivered and to consider whether there are different and more effective ways of achieving our goals.  Should the Steering Group make any proposals in the context of the new Strategy, in regard to enhancing the current level of partnership, I will be happy to consider them.</P>

	<P>The Government has made significant progress in advancing measures in support of objectives on Volunteering and Active Citizenship.  The Task Force on Active Citizenship recommended that a network of volunteer centres be funded across the country. My Department now provides annual funding of over &euro;2.5m to twenty such centres.  In 2008, these centres registered over 7,500 volunteers and over 950 volunteer-involving organisations. It should also be noted that 56% of registered volunteers had never volunteered before and 70% were aged 35 years and under.  My Department also provides core funding for Volunteering Centres Ireland which acts as a national organisation and plays a proactive central role in facilitating and supporting the development of the network of local volunteer centres.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>In addition, a range of other activities are being supported.  In this context, the Deputy should note that last Wednesday, in Downpatrick, Minister Margaret Ritchie, the Minister for Social Development in Northern Ireland, and I jointly  launched a cross-border volunteering initiative, involving three groups &mdash; the GAA, Voluntary Arts Ireland and the Church of Ireland. The rationale behind the project is that these organisations, which have a strong network of local volunteers across Ireland, can use this network for the benefit of the whole community, and especially marginalised and disadvantaged groups on both sides of the border.</P>
        <P>Other relevant activities supported by my Department include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Young Social Innovators Initiative &mdash; this involves transition year students at secondary school level from all over Ireland identifying social needs and developing strategies to address them, requiring their engagement with local, community and statutory organisations. The key objective is to develop volunteering among young people and grow a cadre of volunteers for the future;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For the past three years, my Department has supported the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) Community Learning Programme. This programme, promotes community based learning by integrating classroom theory with practical application in projects for community and voluntary bodies. Examples of projects include computing science students designing web pages for voluntary bodies, or food science students providing health and safety audits in community kitchens;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Funding for Focus Ireland to support the placement of social science graduates, within the organisation, who wish to gain experience and to develop skills in working with people who are marginalised; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for Boardmatch, an organisation which aims to support the development of the voluntary and community sector in Ireland by strengthening boards of management and management committees of non-profit organisations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 121 and 123 together.</P>
        <P>The Dormant Accounts Fund Acts provides for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).  Since its establishment in May 2003 to the end of December 2008, the net transfers to the DAF have totalled some &euro;306m.  It is estimated that for 2009 approx &euro;50m <Col N="106"/>will be spent across various Departments to meet the commitments made to beneficiaries from the Fund.  In the case of my own Department, &euro;13m is provided for in 2009 to meet the commitments due to beneficiaries under the various measures within the remit of my department.</P>
        <P>With respect to the priorities to be supported from the DAF in 2009, the Government agreed in 2008 to provide &euro;30m for a range of initiatives covering persons with a disability, to support projects in RAPID areas, to tackle homelessness, and for measures in the areas of suicide prevention and substances misuse.  Processes are currently underway to seek and assess applications for these funds, with beneficiaries already approved for funding for some measures.</P>
        <P>The level of funds transferring to the DAF is declining and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me to give a more accurate indication of the level of resources that might be available for disbursal in 2009 until the level of transfers become clearer during the year.  The value of the Fund at end December 2008, net of liabilities, was some &euro;21.7m. This excludes the amount of some &euro;46m currently maintained in a Reserve Account to meet reclaims and to cover expenses.  The reserve is currently set at 15% of the total moneys received by the Fund and not yet reclaimed.  Further allocations to specific measures must await information on the value of funds liable to transfer from financial institutions later this year.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the number of meetings he has had with senior garda&iacute; in the past two years on the availability of drugs here; his views on the concern that availability is on the increase in almost every county here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2595/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I regularly meet with senior Garda&iacute; to keep up to-date with developments in respect of their drug-related operations.  Reports on their progress are also made, on a quarterly basis, to the Inter Departmental Group on Drugs, which I chair.  Garda&iacute; are also represented on Local and Regional Drugs Tasks Forces.  There has been significant success in relation to the supply reduction pillar of the National Drugs Strategy and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are playing a key role in this regard.  Their levels of drugs seizures have been well in excess of the targets set out in the current Strategy and they include a number of significant operations.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU) is the primary unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na charged with responsibility for drug supply law enforcement.  The GNDU is supported in its work by officers in the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  In fact, the current chairperson of the National Drugs Strategy Team is a member of GNDU and I liaise with him, as necessary, on a number of issues, including drug supply law enforcement.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will appreciate, Garda&iacute; generally deal with drug-related issues as they arise.</P>
        <P>At the same time, it must be acknowledged that trade in illicit drugs is a global phenomenon.  There has been a sharp increase in the production of heroin in Afghanistan and this has resulted in an increasing supply in Europe.  Similarly, production of cocaine continues strongly, with the resultant implications for supply in Europe. Among the recent initiatives at international level is the establishment in May 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operational Centre &mdash; Narcotics (MAOC-N), based in Lisbon.  It is expected that this Centre which involves seven EU countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Netherlands and Ireland), will provide significant benefits in the gathering of intelligence about air and sea routes for drug trafficking via West Africa. The U.S. also has a number of liaison officers attached to the Centre.  In fulfilling its role, Ireland is deploying both Garda and Customs personnel to Lisbon.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy should note that in the context of the consultation process for the new National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, my officials and I met with senior officers from the Garda&iacute;. In these discussions, they confirmed their commitment that supply reduction of illicit drugs will remain a priority for them over the coming years and that they will be key players in the roll-out of the relevant actions in the new Strategy.  The Deputy should also note that the Garda&iacute; have two representatives on the Steering Group established to oversee the development of the <Col N="108"/>new Strategy.   The representatives &mdash; along with the others on the Group &mdash; will be playing a significant role in the development of the new Strategy over the coming months.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the recent report which showed that Irish 15 year olds demonstrate rates of drunkenness which are well above the international average; the action he will take to tackle this problem within the new national drugs strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2006 Health Behaviour in School aged Children (HBSC) report, to which the Deputy refers, indicated that 29% of Irish 15-year-olds had reported that they had been drunk at least once in the last 30 days. This placed us second among the 9 countries that reported on this item in the survey.   I accept that this figure, and the international comparison involved, is a cause for concern.</P>
        <P>However, the 2007 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) will give us a much more comprehensive view of alcohol and drug activity among our school children and of where we stand internationally in that regard.  This Survey, which is due to be published in March, will also allow us to assess what progress has been made since 2003 when the previous such survey was carried out.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a Steering Group chaired by my Department, is currently developing proposals on a new National Drugs Strategy, covering the period 2009-2016.  The Group is conscious of the need to target alcohol in the context of developing a broader prevention strategy to tackle substance misuse, particularly in relation to under 18 year olds.  They are also aware of the potential synergies in the areas of treatment and rehabilitation, especially given the growing evidence of polydrug use and the role of alcohol as a potential &ldquo;gateway drug&rdquo;.  I expect that the Group will finalise its proposals by the end of March and the best approach to bringing greater coherence and co-ordination to alcohol and drugs issues at a policy, planning and operational levels will be among the issues that I will consider in detail at that stage.</P>

        <P FLI="0">While expenditure under these programme areas takes place countrywide, it is not possible to give a constituency-by-constituency breakdown of this expenditure. For example, a number of my Department&rsquo;s programmes are delivered through agencies and other intermediary bodies that operate across county boundaries and in respect of which there is no comphrensive or detailed breakdown on either a county or constituency basis held by my Department. In addition, groups and organisations that receive grants directly from my Department are not necessarily constituted on a single-county/constituency basis.</P>
        <P>In view of the wide range of my Department&rsquo;s schemes and programmes and the large volumes of applications received thereunder on an ongoing basis, I am not satisfied that the work involved in compiling and collating a full county-by-county (or indeed constituency-by-constituency) breakdown of expenditure would be feasible or justified. However, if the Deputy has any specific queries relating to a particular scheme, I would be glad to seek to provide him with relevant information in that regard.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Waterways Ireland, in conjunction with Dublin City Council, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is undertaking a study with a view to identifying the future recreational, tourism and commercial potential of the Dublin City Canals &mdash; the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal &mdash; within the city limits.</P>
        <P>Consultation is an essential element of the study in terms of collecting information and views on the current and potential level of usage, types of usage in and adjacent to the canals, as well as the views and issues of non-users. A simple on-line consultation questionnaire has been created to help with the consultation process and can be accessed through the Waterways Ireland website at www.waterwaysireland.org  It is expected that the study will be completed and a draft report received by the end of March 2009.</P>
        <P>The Royal and Grand Canals are important recreation and tourism amenities, supporting a myriad of activities, providing employment and generating revenues for the hinterland through which they traverse. The current restoration of the Royal Canal is nearing completion and Waterways Ireland has continued to invest in waterway infrastructure along both the Royal and Grand Canals.  While Waterways Ireland has had contacts with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and a number of local authorities, no decision has yet been taken on undertaking further such studies in relation to other parts of the inland navigation. 	</P>

This information will then be forwarded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It should be noted that each local campaign has been tailored to the requirements of each area &mdash; as identified by the Drugs Task Force &mdash; working closely with local communities. The input and co-operation of local communities is essential to maximise the effect of the campaign in their areas.</P>
        <P>All Task Forces were canvassed in 2007 and again in 2008 to gauge their interest in running a campaign.  The NDST then assessed applications based on readiness and willingness to proceed, the capacity of the Task Force to deliver and the potential impact of the campaigns in the Task Force areas.  The Task Forces to which the Deputy refers did not meet these criteria.</P>
        <P>Overall, I believe that the campaign to date has proved to be successful.  According to the latest information on it, there have been approximately 1,100 calls to the phone-line which has generated 306 information reports to the Garda&iacute;.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have confirmed that, to date, information gathered as a result of the Dial-to-Stop Drug Dealing campaign has proved useful to their enquiries and has yielded one significant seizure.  The first phase of the campaign ran across five Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces areas. In all areas where the campaign has rolled out, the local Garda&iacute; are following strong lines of enquiry resulting from the information arising from the free phone number.</P>
        <P>It is planned that campaigns in the remaining Task Force areas that opted to run a campaign will be rolled out this year. In addition to providing further information that will aid the Garda&iacute;&rsquo;s efforts in tackling drug dealing in local areas, it is expected that campaigns will have significant added value in promoting greater links between the community and the Garda&iacute; and in promoting drug awareness at community level.</P>
        <P>The next phases of the campaign will be funded with Dormant Accounts support.  Approval is currently being sought for these proposals and a decision is expected in the coming weeks.  Following approval, it is planned to run the campaigns in the following Drugs Task Force areas: Cork City LDTF &amp; Southern RDTF area; Mid West RDTF including Limerick City; North <Col N="112"/>Dublin City &amp; County RDTF; and South East RDTF; Bray, Dun Laoghaire and Finglas Cabra LDTFs; and East Coast and Midlands RDTFs.</P>
        <P>Public Communications Centre, the agency tasked with co-ordinating the campaign, has conducted an evaluation of its first phase and the recommendations made will serve to improve the subsequent campaigns.  These recommendations have been circulated to all Task Forces to be taken on board, in so far as practicable, when developing future campaigns.  However, each campaign will continue to be planned and launched by the Task Force, in conjunction with local communities.</P>

	<P>A Forum which consists of representatives of IBEC and the Irish Hotels Federation, on behalf of employers in the industry, and SIPTU was established in December 2008.  The principle objective of the Forum is to contribute to the development of a sustainable industry providing high quality employment.  I understand that the Forum held its first meeting on the 4th of December, 2008.</P>
        <P>I was greatly encouraged by the decision to establish the Forum. Together with the good work being done on the amalgamation of the two Catering Joint labour Committees, I saw it as a timely initiative by representatives of employers and trade unions in the hospitality sector to tackle current competitiveness challenges facing that sector and to contribute to the development of a sustainable industry providing high quality employment. I understand that, while the Forum would have regard to a wide range of employment and industrial relations issues arising from the current challenges facing the hotels sector, priority attention would be given to the current difficulties in the sector as a result of the operation of the JLC system, with particular reference to the issue of the Sunday Premium.</P><Col N="113"/>
        <P>The decision to establish the Forum was made by the employer and worker representatives in the sector and the Forum&rsquo;s role and functions are a matter for agreement between those bodies.   While I welcome the initiative of the Social Partners in establishing this Forum, I have no function with regard to its operation.</P>

        <P>My Department has provided funding, both directly and through Government agencies, to the organisation in question for the management and delivery of programmes and activities and the organisation is therefore accountable to my Department in this regard. In the normal course of events, issues with regard to the delivery of such programmes and activities have at times arisen and have in the majority of cases been resolved to the satisfaction of the relevant Government agencies and my Department.</P>
        <P>However, my Department is currently engaged in seeking to resolve an issue relating to the provision of ESF co-financing to the organisation in question. My Department is responsible for the management and implementation of the European Social Fund co-financed EQUAL Community Initiative 2000-2006 through the EQUAL Managing Authority. The organisation in question was the Designate Lead Partner for a project that received EU funding under the EQUAL Community Initiative. Following an ESF Financial Control Unit audit (based in my Department) in 2006 a number of issues arose regarding the administration of the project.</P>
        <P>Following legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General, my Department has issued proceedings in the High Court by way of Summary Summons against the organisation concerned seeking the recovery of funding relating to this project. As this matter is currently before the court, my Department is not in a position to comment further as to do so might encroach upon the functions of the court.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 43 together.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Callows are prone to annual winter flooding and to periodic summer flooding, affecting both farming and environmental interests  in the area, including EU protected species. The exceptional rainfall in 2008 exacerbated the flooding, which is caused mainly by the extremely flat gradient of the river. This makes it very difficult to devise a cost-effective solution.  I personally visited the area with my officials on 12 September last, in the company of the IFA President, P&aacute;dr&aacute;ig Walsh, and local farmers and public representatives to see the problems for myself.  The Office of Public Works carried out some clearance of vegetation in the area, which, although not sufficient to prevent the flooding last year, has improved the situation. This work was carried out with the agreement of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and in consultation with other stakeholders.</P>
        <P>There is a proposal to remove silt from the Shannon Cut to try to improve the situation further. Although OPW has some reservations as to how effective this will be, it is prepared to undertake a pilot project to test the efficacy of the measure, provided it is possible to do so in a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable manner. Preliminary discussions with the National Parks and Wildlife Service raised a number of issues, and OPW will meet with the stakeholders during February with a view to securing agreement to proceed with the pilot project.</P>
        <P>The long-term management of summer flooding of the Callows will have to have regard to the availability of resources in addition to environmental constraints. and these issues will be considered in the course of the development of a Flood Risk Management Plan for the Shannon River Basin, which will be prepared in accordance with the EU Floods Directive.</P>

	<P>The introduction of the car parking levy is designed to reduce congestion.  The levy will apply to employer-provided parking facilities in the major urban centres of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The specific areas in which the levy will apply will be designated by Order of the Minister for Finance following consultation with the five city councils concerned.  An employee will be liable to the levy where: he or she has an entitlement to use a parking space for the parking of a vehicle covered by the levy, the parking space is provided directly or indirectly by the employer, and the parking space is located in an area designated by me as Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The amount of the levy is reduced in the case of shift workers. Anyone starting or finishing work after 9 o&rsquo;clock in the evening or before 7 o&rsquo;clock in the morning will have the part of the year during which they are on shift work involving those hours disregarded for the purposes of calculating the levy. For example, someone doing such shift work for 3 months of the year would be liable to pay &euro;150 (i.e. &euro;200 less &frac14; excluded because of shift work).</P><Col N="115"/>
        <P>I have already stated that,  in deciding the parts of the cities in question that should be designated, I will have regard to the availability of public transport, the relative value of the car parking spaces and the level of congestion in the relevant parts of those cities.  My approach reflects the reality of the problem which the levy seeks to address, while avoiding its imposition on a disproportionate basis on those who avail of car parking facilities in areas without excessive congestion problems.</P>

        <Quest> the taxation which applies to the owners and operators of car parks; the tax exemptions applicable; if changes in taxation are intended in relation to car parks; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2861/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Tax Acts apply different rules to the computation of taxable income depending on the source of the income. Where a person operates a car park he or she is treated as carrying on a trade and is taxed accordingly. Where the owner of a car park leases the car park to an operator the income received from the operator is treated as rental income and different rules apply to the taxation of such income. While the computation of the tax liability is broadly similar for both types of income, there are some differences. For example, where a trade is being carried on, the general position is that expenses of a revenue nature that are wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the trade can be deducted in computing the taxable income.  Tax relief is also available where expenditure is incurred on certain capital assets that qualify as plant and machinery and that are used for the purposes of a trade. In the case of rental income, expenses are deductible on a more restrictive basis.</P>
        <P>Where a business generates losses instead of profits the losses are treated differently for both types of activity. In a rental situation where expenses exceed rents, the loss can only be used to reduce taxable rental income in years subsequent to that in which the loss arises whereas trading losses can be used to reduce other non-trading taxable income in the same year as that in which the loss arises, but can only be used to reduce taxable income from the same trade where it continues to be carried on in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>In so far as value-added tax (VAT) is concerned, the position is that traders providing car-parking facilities are obliged to charge VAT at the standard rate of 21.5% in respect of the provision of such facilities.  There are currently no specific tax exemptions or incentives available for the construction or operation of car parks.  A scheme of tax relief for multi-storey car parks that applied on a countrywide basis came into operation from 1 July 1995. Tax relief was also available for car parks (not necessarily multi-storey) where they met the qualifying conditions for the urban, rural and town renewal schemes. Following a review of these schemes carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants in 2005, my predecessor announced the termination of the schemes in Budget 2006. The effect of the termination was that only expenditure that was incurred on the construction of car parks up to 31 July 2008 can qualify for tax relief.</P>
        <P>Any proposals for changes in taxation in relation to car parks,  like all proposals for new tax or expenditure  measures, will fall to be considered in the context of the ongoing development of budgetary and economic policy.</P>

	<P>The position is that the incapacitated child tax credit can be claimed by a parent for a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education.  Once a child qualifies for the incapacitated child tax credit the credit continues to be available in respect of that child without regard to the child&rsquo;s age.  The incapacitated child tax credit can be claimed regardless of whether the parent or child is in receipt of disability allowance.</P>

I have been informed by the Financial Regulator that it met Friends of Banking Ireland on 13 November 2008 and that a number of issues relating to the role of the Financial Regulator, the reach of the consumer protection code, the complaints process for individual redress and the confidentiality obligations under which it operates were clarified.  Further contact was to be maintained between the two organisations to pursue outstanding matters.</P>
        <P>Complaints from individual consumers (which includes incorporated bodies with a turnover of up to &euro;3 million) are referred to and determined by the Financial Services Ombudsman.

	<P>The position is that, on the basis of the legislation as enacted, the employer is legally obliged to deduct income levy from all payments of emoluments (which would include salary, bonus payments and other payments in the nature of pay) made to his or her employees where payment of those emoluments takes place on any date on or after 1 January 2009 irrespective of the period to which the payments relate.

        <P>PAYE income tax, Pay Related Social Insurance Contributions and Health Contributions are all similarly deducted on arrears of pay, bonuses, and other payments in the nature of pay at the rates in force at the date of payment, notwithstanding that the payments relate to a year <Col N="117"/>other than that in which the payment is made.

	<P>The decision on whether an institution operating in Ireland passes on ECB interest rate cuts to customers is a commercial decision for the institution concerned.  While my Department monitors the impact of changes in mortgage interest rates on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), it has no direct function in relation to the individual institution&rsquo;s decisions on the matter.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, I have publicly indicated that I expect institutions to pass on funding cost reductions to their customers, including in particular to those purchasing properties on variable mortgages and to small and medium-sized enterprises. This is important to help support sustainable growth and employment along with the maintenance of price stability.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Financial Regulator that all of the covered institutions, including the institution concerned, have fully passed on each ECB interest rate cut since the bank guarantee scheme was introduced. I understand that the institution concerned will pass on the most recent cut from February 6, 2009.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Financial Regulator to ensure that those institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme do not pass on the costs of the bank guarantee to their customers in an unwarranted manner. However, it must be borne in mind that credit institutions are not primarily funded from the ECB but from a variety of sources and the cost of much of their funding has been significantly above ECB rates over the last year.</P>

        <Quest> when it is proposed to introduce legislation providing for country of origin labelling; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>General labelling is currently governed by Directive 2000/13/EC, which makes compulsory the indication of particulars of the place of origin or provenance only where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff. During 2008, the Department of Health &amp; Children, on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, proposed to introduce national legislation making mandatory country of origin labelling on poultry meat, pigmeat and sheepmeat and on processed foods containing at least 70% of these meats. This received a negative response from the European Commission, on the grounds that it was contrary to the principle of harmonisation and would create a disproportionate obstacle to the free movement of goods within the EU if implemented.</P>
        <P>In the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on the provision of food information to the consumer, issued in January 2008, similar provisions to those outlined in Directive 2000/13/EC are proposed.  In addition, however, allowance is made for a voluntary national measure, with mandatory requirements. Where a Food Business Operator chooses to use country of origin labelling, Article 35 of the proposal states that &ldquo;where the country of origin or the place of provenance of the food is not the same as the one of its primary ingredient(s), the country of origin or place of provenance of those ingredient(s) shall also be given&rdquo;. It adds that, &ldquo;for meat, other than beef and veal, the indication on the country of origin or place of provenance may be given as a single place only where animals have been born, reared and slaughtered in the same country or place. In other cases information on each of the different places of birth, rearing and slaughter shall be given.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Ireland submitted its position paper on the Food Information proposal on 5th November 2008. In this proposal, Ireland pressed for mandatory country of origin labelling for all foodstuffs. Ireland suggested that, for meat, information be also given regarding the country of birth, rearing and slaughter (where different from the country of origin). The Department of Health &amp; Children will continue to pursue this issue through the EU Working Group charged with developing the proposal.  It is expected that the proposal will not be finalised until at least late 2009.</P>

	<P>Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over ceased on 31st December 2008, and with effect from 1st January 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 or over is &euro;700 (gross) per week (&euro;36,500 per year) for a single person and &euro;1,400 (gross) per week (&euro;73,000 per year) for a couple.  Where the spouse/partner is under 70 years of age, he/she can qualify under the over 70s medical card scheme if the combined gross incomes of the applicant and dependant spouse/partner are within the income threshold limit of &euro;1,400 (gross) per week.  The Act does not provide for individual assessment for couples.</P>
        <P>Under the over 70s medical card scheme, from 1st January 2009 any savings and similar investments up to &euro;36,000 (single)/&euro;72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings or similar investments above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes.  The remainder of savings and similar investments will be assessed on the income calculated at a notional interest rate, based on the prevailing interest rates at the time of application.  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE) Central Application Unit will review the notional rate (currently 3%) on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, where an applicant wishes to have the actual interest from savings/investments considered, then the HSE will apply this approach and use the most beneficial option in favour of the applicant, subject to submission of the appropriate certificates from the relevant institutions.  In the case of &ldquo;longer term&rdquo; investment accounts, where the interest is only applied at <Col N="122"/>the end of a fixed period, if the applicant so wishes, the HSE will only take account of the interest earned on the date the investment matures.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71 deals with the coordination of social security schemes, including healthcare, for those moving within <Col N="123"/>the European Union. Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state are entitled to receive healthcare services in Ireland at the cost of the member state with which they are affiliated. This is in accordance with Annex VI of the Regulation (text relating to Ireland), which states that such persons &ldquo;are entitled free of charge to all medical treatment provided for by Irish legislation where the cost of this treatment is payable by the institution of a Member State other than Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Persons covered by the above Regulation include persons in receipt of a qualifying UK pension, or UK employed persons who are resident in Ireland and not also in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment or pension from Ireland and who are not employed in Ireland, and their dependants.  Such persons receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement under the provisions of Regulation 1408/71. Being a British National does not, of itself, guarantee entitlement.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Governments ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

However, as the existing legislative framework for the regulation of the travel trade has been in existence since 1982 in May last year I asked the Commissioner, Mr. Cathal Guiomard, to undertake a comprehensive review of the travel trade legislation.  The purpose of the review was to assess the operation of the current regulatory arrangements and to recommend any reforms that may be warranted.</P>
        <P>Following an extensive consultation process, the Commissioner submitted his report to me on 30 December 2008 which I have published on my Department&rsquo;s website www.transport.ie.  I am currently examining the Commissioner&rsquo;s findings and recommendations and I will also consult with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, on the report&rsquo;s findings in the context of consumer protection policy generally.</P>

Decisions in regard to service rationalisations necessary to restore balance in the company&rsquo;s finances are matters for the company.  I published, on Tuesday last, the report by Deloittes on a Cost and Efficiency Review of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus and I have asked the Chairman of both companies to bring forward at an early date a programme to implement the recommendations in the report.  The implementation of the report provides the opportunity to review and adjust the network and services to secure efficiencies and to re-focus on the needs of the customers and on increasing passenger numbers.</P>

The primary purpose of the Authority is to control and supervise those who are providing private security services in the State, to establish <Col N="126"/>standards in the provision of those services, and to investigate complaints against providers of such services.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Authority that it investigates all reports and information it receives concerning unlicensed providers of security services which require such action.  The Authority has already demonstrated its preparedness to bring cases to Court where there is sufficient evidence to support a prosecution for non-compliance with the Act.  The Authority has informed me that, to date, 24 cases of non-compliance with the legislation in this regard have gone through the Courts and 19 providers and 1 user of an unlicensed contractor have been prosecuted.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases but I can say that more cases involving the illegal provision of security services are currently before the Courts.</P>
        <P>The Authority informs me that it continues to work closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue Commissioners, other statutory bodies and the private security industry in developing operational frameworks to support its responsibilities. It aims to ensure that all contractors in the country operate within the law and where there is sufficient evidence, a prosecution will be pursued against those operating outside the legislation.</P>

More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deportation Orders are made by the Department&rsquo;s officials and signed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform pursuant to Section 3, Subsection 2 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. The aforementioned Act has itself been subsequently amended by Section 10 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000. There are two types of Deportation Order as follows: (i) A consent Order and (ii) An enforcement Order.</P>
        <P>(i) A consent Order is made in accordance with Section 3(8) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and is made on foot of a signed consent in writing from the person concerned. <Col N="128"/>Said Order has a limited lifespan of 3 months duration. This means that if the person the subject of the Order has not removed himself/herself from the State within the specified period, the Order lapses and ceases to have any effect.</P>
        <P>(ii) An enforcement Order, however, has no such limitation and exists in perpetuity unless it is revoked by the Minister. The revocation of a Deportation Order may be sought pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However such an application would require substantial and compelling  new grounds in order to be successful.  My Department does not keep statistics on the number of Section 3(11) applications where leave to remain is subsequently granted on humanitarian grounds.</P>
        <P>Deportation Orders will usually quote one of two subsections of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. Subsection 2(f) refers to persons who have been refused refugee status in the State while Subsection 2(i) refers to persons whose removal would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good. The latter category covers persons who for reasons other than refusal of refugee status have nonetheless  become illegally present in the State. The effect of a Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>The onus is on a person served with a Deportation Order, to remove himself/herself from the State thereby complying with the provisions of the Order. When a person fails to comply with his/her obligations under a validly served Deportation Order, that person is deemed to be evading his/her Deportation Order and is classified as such. In the event of non-compliance with a Deportation Order, the State, specifically the Garda National Immigration Bureau, may proceed to enforce the Order. This may involve arrest and detention in accordance with Immigration law.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum in the State on 17 November 2004.  Her two children were included in her application.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The person concerned then lodged Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court challenging the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that she not be declared to be a refugee.  Following the resolution of these Proceedings, the person concerned was afforded a fresh consideration of her asylum claim by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. This further consideration took place but again the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  The person concerned appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal who affirmed the earlier recommendation.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 13 February 2008, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in <Col N="129"/>accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 2 June 2005.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The person concerned was notified of his entitlement to appeal this determination to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but chose to not do so.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 13 January 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.  The person concerned later submitted an application to be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  Following consideration of this application, a decision was made to refuse the application.</P>
        <P>On 10 October 2006, regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) came into force. The person concerned was notified of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations. The person concerned submitted an application for Sub<Col N="131"/>sidiary Protection in the State and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 21 August 2008.</P>
        <P>His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 13 January 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post which obliges the person concerned to leave the State. The person concerned is required to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 5 February 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for Subsidiary Protection and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person referred to by the Deputy entered the State on a C-Visit Visa.  A C-Visit Visa is granted for visits of 90 days or less and it is the general policy not to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted on a C-Visit Visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.  A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form.  That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.</P>
        <P>The daughter of the person referred to by the Deputy wrote to the Immigration Division of my Department on 7 October 2008 seeking an extension of permission on behalf of her father to remain in the State.  Following consideration of the request, my Department decided that the position of her father did not warrant an extension of his C-Visit Visa period and his daughter was informed accordingly on 12 January 2009.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in November 2007.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months.  The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.</P>
        <P>There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee and in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.  I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person in question has not made a Family Reunification application on behalf of her mother.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in July 2008.  On examination of the application it was determined that the person in question did not meet the residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended.  The applicant was informed on this in a letter issued on 9 October, 2008.  It is open to the person concerned to lodge a new application if and when he is in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at that time.</P>
        <P>I am informed that there is a discrepancy between the address the Deputy has provided and the address my Department holds on file.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to keep the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) informed of any change of address in writing.  I have been informed by the Repatriation Unit of my Department that the person concerned was granted permission to reside and to take up employment in this State for three years up to 10 January, 2011.  His case will be reviewed at the end of that period.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 19 December 2003.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in the United Kingdom and, as such, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, for the purposes of having his asylum application examined there.  This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>Consequently, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 1 March 2004.  This Order was served on the person concerned, by letter dated 2 July 2004, which placed a legal obligation on the person concerned to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Monday, 12 July 2004, to make arrangements for his formal transfer to the United Kingdom.  The person concerned failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; on this occasion and was therefore classified as having &lsquo;evaded&rsquo; his transfer.  The person concerned became illegally resident in this State at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned continued to evade his transfer with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired leaving Ireland responsible for processing the asylum application of the person concerned.  At this point the case of the person concerned was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having his asylum claims investigated.  Subsequently, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status.  This recommendation was upheld by the Refugee Appeal Tribunal.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 23 June 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation <Col N="136"/>Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban men, known as the Miami Five, who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder.  On 4 June 2008, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, issued its judgement on appeals lodged on behalf of the five. </P>
        <P>The Circuit Court concluded that the appellants&rsquo; arguments, which centred on the suppression of evidence, sovereign immunity, discovery, jury selection, and the trial itself, were without merit and that there was sufficient evidence to support each conviction.  The sentences of two of the defendants were affirmed, while the remaining three men have been sent for re-sentencing.  It is my understanding that the defendants&rsquo; legal counsel intends to appeal to the US Supreme Court on 30 January.  As I have previously stated, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I do not intend to pursue this matter during my forthcoming visit to Cuba.</P>

	<P>With a view to developing Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Cuba at this time of transition, and to assist me in contributing to the development of policy at EU level, I am planning to visit Cuba next month.  While there, I expect to meet with Foreign Minister P&eacute;rez Roque.  I would see this as an important step in developing dialogue between Ireland and Cuba. </P>
        <P>The European Union&rsquo;s 1996 Common Position on Cuba, adopted under the Irish Presidency, remains the basis of both the European Union&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s approach to relations with that country.  The aims of the EU Common Position include encouraging a process of peaceful transition towards a pluralist democracy, promoting human rights and improving the living conditions of the Cuban people.  In the Conclusions on Cuba adopted unanimously by the Council on 23 June 2008, the Council, noting the changes undertaken to date by the Cuban Government, re-iterated the Union&rsquo;s desire for a constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities.  The Conclusions re-stated the Union&rsquo;s human rights concerns, and urged the Cuban authorities to release all remaining political prisoners unconditionally and to facilitate access by international humanitarian organisations to Cuban prisons.  The Council further decided formally to lift EU diplomatic measures, which had been suspended since 2005, in order to encourage and facilitate the political dialogue process and enable the full use of the instruments of the 1996 Common Position.</P><Col N="138"/>
        <P>Following this move, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba Mr. Felipe Perez Roque travelled to Paris, where on 16 October 2008 the first EU-Cuba dialogue in troika format at Ministerial level took place.  The EU was represented by Foreign Minister Kouchner of France, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Karel Schwarzenberg and the Commissioner for Development, Mr. Louis Michel. Topics discussed included human rights, cooperation on preventing and responding to natural disasters, food security and the global financial crisis.  Later that month, from 22-24 October 2008, Commissioner Michel visited Cuba, where he signed a joint declaration with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, providing a framework to guide the re-launching of cooperation between the European Commission and Cuba.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2009, my Department is committed to the   ongoing development of supports to strengthen and underpin the work of the community and voluntary sector in Ireland. Indeed, the growth of the sector in recent years has been accompanied by a significant expansion of supports by Government. My Department alone provides funding in excess of &euro;400m annually to the groups and measures across the sector.</P>
        <P>Policy initiatives are underpinned by the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; Partnership Agreement, which recognises the valuable role of the community &amp; voluntary sector. The agreement notes that the great strength of voluntary activity is that it emerges organically from communities and points out that while the Government should not seek to control and be involved in every aspect of voluntary activity, it does have a responsibility to provide an enabling framework to help the sector.</P>
        <P>A key area of support being advanced this year is in relation to Charities legislation. The Charities Bill, which I anticipate will progress to its final Stage prior to enactment in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the current session, provides for a new Charities Regulatory Authority to be established, which will assume a broad regulatory role for charities operating in Ireland.  This will secure improved accountability and protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud, thus enhancing public confidence in the charities sector. The Bill has been re-shaped considerably in recent Stages to ensure that a proportionate regulatory burden will be placed on smaller charities, in recognition of the fact that the vast majority of charities operating in Ireland are small, and have limited resources. These changes have been welcomed across the sector.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department provides funding to the community and voluntary sector for training in relation to capacity building in governance and compliance, strategic development, and service to communities. The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme also provides training and education grants for community development capacity building, IT training, or any other training priorities identified by local voluntary groups.</P>
        <P>In addition, some 180 projects are being supported under the Community Development Programme.  These projects play a significant role in building community infrastructure and enhancing the capacity of the voluntary groups within the communities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the extensive range of services now being provided by volunteer-led groups and organisations with the support of the Community Services Programme.  At the end of 2008, over 420 groups and organisations were approved for funding, with nearly 360 of them operational.  The remaining groups are due to get up and running during 2009.  Based on information from the groups, my Department estimates that around 2,100 people are employed in delivering quality services across the country.  This Programme plays an increasingly important role in delivering services &mdash; which would not otherwise be provided &mdash; by harnessing the capacity and resources of the voluntary sector and using these in partnership with the resources available from the State.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that the Task Force on Active Citizenship recommended that a network of volunteer centres be funded across the country. The Department is now supporting twenty such centres which support, promote and co-ordinate voluntary activities around <Col N="140"/>Ireland. For example, the &lsquo;Give it a Swirl Day&rsquo; which recently took place in many locations helped to highlight local volunteering opportunities.</P>
        <P>Further details in relation to all of the schemes and programmes operated by my Department that support the wider community &amp; voluntary sector are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; www.pobail.ie</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>This Government is firmly committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse in our society.  This is evidenced by the fact that the funding targeted at community-based initiatives funded through my Department&rsquo;s Vote doubled from 2003 to 2008 &mdash; from &euro;31.5m over &euro;64m. These amounts included funding for the Young Peoples Facilities and Services, which has transferred to the Office of the Minister for Children since the beginning of the year.</P>
        <P>Funding for Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas in 2009 will be approximately &euro;34.6m. Of this amount, over &euro;23m is being allocated to the Local Drugs Task Forces while over &euro;11m is being earmarked for the Regional Task Forces.  Over 440 LDTF projects and in the region of 200 RDTF projects are receiving funding from my Department.</P>
        <P>In relation to Co. Kildare which is part of the South West RDTF area, the following allocations have been made:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Abbey Project &mdash; funding of &euro;150,000 has been allocated to provide a number of services such as drop-in, family support, referral, counselling, holistic therapies and advice and information on housing to drug users and their families from Celbridge and the surrounding areas;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Community Drug Team for Kildare and West Wicklow &mdash; in 2008, funding of &euro;340,112 was approved for this service which will expand and complement existing treatment services along with family support and early responses to young people at the early stage of drug misuse; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Newbridge Family Resource Centre  &mdash; in 2007, an amount of &euro;22,354 was approved under the Premises Initiative in respect of the purchase and installation of a semi-permanent structure for the Centre to provide a dedicated drop-in facility for &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youth.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Some of the other funding provided to that Drugs Task Force also provides benefit broadly across their region of operation, including Co. Kildare.   In addition, a sum in the region of &euro;170,000 has been made available to Teen Challenge, a rehabilitation project at Shechem <Col N="141"/>House, Richardstown, Co. Kildare, arising from applications through the South Inner City LDTF in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Finally, as the Deputy is aware, the National Drugs Strategy is based on a co-ordinated effort across many Government Departments and Agencies and my Department&rsquo;s allocation is only part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.  In 2007, it was estimated that expenditure on drugs programmes across all the bodies was in the region of &euro;230m.  The figures for 2008 are currently being compiled. 	</P>

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas nationally.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal&rsquo;s website under the RAPID section &mdash; http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID &mdash; and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information.</P>
        <P>I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  In 2007 I agreed to co-fund the provision of facilities in schools located in, or mainly servicing children from, RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>&euro;6.5m has been allocated in Budget 2009 for the RAPID leverage schemes.  While this is a reduction on the amount allocated in 2008, my primary concern will continue to be to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department &mdash; especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities &mdash; are protected. Given that the RAPID Leverage Scheme is a demand-led, bottom-up funding programme, it is not possible to predict accurately the extent of claims that will be lodged during 2009. However, I am satisfied that this year&rsquo;s allocation will be sufficient to enable further good progress to be made with small-scale co-funded projects in RAPID areas in 2009.</P>

	<P>The CL&Aacute;R Programme was set up as an innovative programme to deal with infrastructural deficits in the most peripheral communities in Ireland that had suffered significant population loss. As the Deputy will be aware, measures for roads, water, sewerage, schools, health services, community, and electricity are amongst the many successful initiatives run under the CL&Aacute;R Programme.</P>
        <P>In a context where funding approved under CL&Aacute;R and the level of outstanding commitments increased significantly in 2008, a number of measures were temporarily closed and new applications are not currently being accepted. I am currently reviewing the CL&Aacute;R programme as a <Col N="143"/>whole, having regard to demand, the funding available and the level of outstanding commitments.  Most payments in 2009 will relate to projects sanctioned in 2008 and previous years.</P>
        <P>While the provisional 2009 budget for CL&Aacute;R at &euro;18m represents a reduction on the 2008 allocation, the finalisation of allocations across Departments remains under discussion at Government and it is not possible to say at this stage what the outcome of those discussions will be.  The Minister for Finance will be publishing the Revised Estimates Volume in due course.</P>
        <P>I would emphasise, however, that one of the strengths of the CL&Aacute;R Programme has always been the ability to focus on priority needs in those areas.  As Minister, I believe that we need to be constantly addressing the new challenges faced by rural communities.  The CL&Aacute;R programme will be continuously refocused to deal with the priorities for those areas, especially in the current difficult economic climate and I am confident that the CL&Aacute;R programme will continue to make a significant, positive, impact.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under age 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year. The allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.  The person concerned is in receipt of a reduced rate of Disability Allowance of &euro;87.40 and a Child Dependant Allowance of &euro;26.00. The person&rsquo;s file is currently with a Social Welfare Inspector with a view to reviewing the Disability Allowance payment.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Inspector wrote to the person concerned on 19 January 2009 to request confirmation of certain legal and financial matters.

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  The Executive has advised that the person concerned has been awarded mortgage interest <Col N="144"/>supplement. The Executive has further advised that payment of mortgage interest supplement will issue to the person concerned shortly.</P>
        <P>One of the statutory conditions for receipt of mortgage interest supplement is that, in the opinion of the Executive, the person must have been in a position, at the time the loan agreement was entered into, to meet the repayments under that agreement. Accordingly, in determining entitlement to mortgage interest supplement, a community welfare officer may examine the original loan application, supporting documentation, including any documentation in relation to a guarantor, and records of repayments in order to assess the capacity of the person to make a long-term commitment to repayment of the loan in question.  It is a matter for the community welfare officer to a make a decision on entitlement based on all of the facts of the case.</P>
        <P>I do not consider that any changes in the application process are required at this time.  However the operational guidelines of the scheme are kept under review to ensure that it meets the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis.</P>

	<P>The Department delivers a frontline service through a network of 61 local offices and 62 branch offices countrywide.  The main services provided from these offices include jobseeker supports, one-parent family payment and an information service. </P>
        <P>Each office provides Social Welfare services to people living in specified catchment areas.  People living in or around Ashbourne making a claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s payment are required to attend their nearest local office at Finglas and people living in or around Ratoath or Dunshaughlin areas are required to attend the local office at Navan.  Thereafter, they are only required to attend the office once every four weeks to prove unemployment.</P>
        <P>Local and branch offices are under considerable pressure at present because of the increasing level of claims.  Every effort is being made to process claims as quickly as possible.  This includes the prioritisation of work, assignment of additional resources including staffing and overtime.  Following the latest review of the staffing levels in local offices, an additional 115 staff are being assigned.  This includes an additional 4 staff for the Navan Local Office and an additional 3 staff for Finglas Local Office. The Department has no plans at present to set up a local office in Ashbourne.</P>

	<P>In assessing means derived from payments received from EU Member States (including U.K.) which do not form part of the EMU currencies, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers.  The exchange rates for converting Sterling and other non-EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union. </P>
        <P>Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter.  This rate is then used in all conversions during the course of the succeeding quarter.  Alternatively the conversion rate applicable to the next succeeding quarter is used if it is more beneficial to the customer.  When reviewing customers who are in receipt of British pensions the exchange rate used to convert Sterling is the rate applicable to the second quarter (i.e. the quarter in which the British pension increase occurred) or the third quarter if that is more beneficial.  The Department does not generally review claims specifically because of movements in exchange rates.  However, it is open to any pensioner who believes they may be entitled to an increase in the rate of their State Pension (Non Contributory) payment to seek to have their means reviewed.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that changes in the value of a British pension, due to currency fluctuation, may well be offset by annual increases in the rate of those pensions and consequently the customer&rsquo;s State Pension (Non Contributory) payment may be unchanged or even reduced as a result of a review.  The exchange rate for Sterling to Euro currently being applied by the Department is &pound;1= &euro;1.27116.</P>

	<P>It is a matter for each local authority to administer house purchase loans having regard to housing needs, local market conditions and individual circumstances. In approving a shared ownership transaction, local authorities must consider, inter alia, the ability of applicants to make the necessary mortgage and rent payments and satisfy themselves that the borrower&rsquo;s income is sufficient to meet the financial commitments involved under the scheme. As a guide, outgoings should not exceed 35% of a household&rsquo;s net income.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made to assist borrowers who encounter difficulties in meeting their commitments. For example, Article 10 of the Housing Regulations 1980 (Amendment) Regulations 1996 provides that, in cases of hardship, the loan repayment period may be extended and arrears capitalised so as to make repayments more manageable for the borrower.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Scheme, under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is also payable, subject to the qualifying conditions of that scheme, in respect of mortgages under shared ownership transactions, in the same way as in the case of mortgages generally. An annual subsidy towards rent payments under the Shared Ownership Scheme is available through the Rental Subsidy Scheme, to households with a gross household income of up to &euro;28,000 per annum in the preceding tax year.   The level of subsidy ranges between &euro;2,550 for incomes up to &euro;13,000 and &euro;1,050 for incomes up to &euro;28,000.</P>

	<P>I met with representatives from the Irish Waste Management Association (IWMA) on 19 December 2008 to discuss a number of issues the industry were having with regard to recyclates.  An update was provided to the IWMA in relation to the following matters.  The Association was informed that I raised the issue at the Environment Council in Brussels on 4 December.  A total of 12 Member States intervened to support Ireland in raising the issue.  The European <Col N="148"/>Commission has undertaken to carry out a review of the situation and to revert with options for action.  The incoming Czech Presidency has also undertaken to table the issue as a substantive item at the next Council following completion of the Commission&rsquo;s review.</P>
        <P>I informed the IWMA that Ireland had also raised the issue at the December meeting of the Article 21 Committee on Packaging Waste.  The Commission responded and noted that it was supported by many at the Council who raised issues such as the structuring of markets, how they can be influenced and what measures can be proposed.  I also outlined my initial decisions following the report of the Action Group on Recyclate Markets which included the proposal to establish a number of sub-groups to drive action on the following issues:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Markets &mdash; including quality and development of best practice;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Licensing and Enforcement;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Public Infrastructure.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I advised them that a circular (WPRR 10/08) issued to all local authorities emphasising the importance of enforcement on 4 December 2008 arising from the report.  I have not made any proposals to use material collected for recycling as fuel. The issue of part funding the diversion of carbon low grade recyclates to the waste-to-energy markets mentioned in the question was raised by the IWMA at the meeting. However, it was clarified that such funding will not be provided.</P>

	<P>A study led by the North/South Market Development Steering Group to determine the feasibility of establishing a paper mill on the island of Ireland was initiated in 2004 and the Phase 1 Study Report was published in August 2006.  The feasibility study is the first of two phases and the project was funded jointly by the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland through Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and my Department.  The project was managed by WRAP.</P>
        <P>Provisional findings from the first stage of an interim phase &mdash; taking soundings from individual businesses in the sector &mdash; indicate that the paper manufacturing/ converting and waste management sectors show favourable interest in exploring the establishment of a tissue mill on the island.  Consequently a more formal sectoral group meeting was convened in March 2008 to test this level of interest amongst the key industrial players.  Valuable feedback was gained at this meeting and the stakeholders were advised by officials that both jurisdictions along with WRAP would continue to assist.  The North/South Market Development Steering Group met on 22 January and the project will be kept under review in light of market conditions.</P>

	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of energy costs on vulnerable members of society.  While I have no function in setting or regulating prices, I welcome the fact that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) announced on 1 December 2008 that there would be no further increase in the price of gas from January 2009 and that there would be a small average decrease from this month of just less than 1% in the price of electricity supplied by ESB Customer Supply.  This decision is reflective of recent easing in international fossil fuel prices, which follows a period of exponential increases in global oil, gas and coal prices.  I also welcome the substantial rebate being provided by ESB to all electricity customers, which has helped to stabilise electricity prices for 2009.</P>
        <P>The individual in question may be able to avail of my Department&rsquo;s Warmer Homes Scheme which is targeted at households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of fuel allowance, invalidity or disability benefit.  The Scheme is overseen by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and is delivered principally through community based organisations.  It provides for the installation of cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost.</P>
        <P>In the case of the individual in question, I would advise the Deputy that contact should be made with the Clondalkin Home Improvement Project (CHIP) on 01-4670344.  SEI has <Col N="151"/>informed my Department that a surveyor can visit the individual&rsquo;s house as soon as next week to discuss his needs and assess what improvements can be made to minimise his energy usage.</P>
        <P>I am working closely with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to deliver a fully cohesive strategic approach on energy affordability issues across Government and Agencies.  We have established an Inter Departmental/Agency Group led by our two Departments, which include the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the CER, SEI, ESB and BG&Eacute;.</P>
        <P>The Group is finalising a booklet containing information on how to keep well and warm in cold weather, in addition to providing details of all relevant supports available to vulnerable householders.  I will arrange to have the booklet forwarded to the Deputy directly on its publication in the coming weeks.  I am also forwarding the Deputy the Power of One information pack which contains valuable advice on how small steps can lead to big savings in terms of improving energy efficiency in the home.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also wish to apprise his constituent of two schemes being run by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Firstly, the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme provides targeted support of up to 100% of cost to improve conditions in the houses of older people.  The Scheme offers grants for a wide range of structural repair and improvements including rewiring, water, sanitary services, heating, windows, as well as central heating and insulation.  Application is through the local authority.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the Central Heating Scheme provides funding to housing authorities to upgrade their rented homes with measures such as attic insulation to Building Regulations&rsquo; standards and draught proofing windows and doors.</P>

In recognition of these problems, I wrote to the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Fischer Boel, seeking approval for the early payment of the 2008 Single Payment.  My request was for advance payment at a rate <Col N="153"/>of 50%, payable from 16 October 2007.  The reason for my request was based on the very adverse weather conditions being experienced in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that the European Commission responded favourably and the advance payment of 50% of the Single Payment effective issued from 16 October.

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2009. </P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling progress has been made in relation to specific products:</P>
        <P>EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade my Department collaborated with the Department of Health and Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.</P>
        <P>Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</P><Col N="154"/>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers&rsquo; desire for country of origin labelling.  However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.</P>
        <P>The EU has 36 specific marketing standards covering fresh fruit and vegetables. Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin.  The EU Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables. As part of this process a number of the existing specific standards will be replaced by a general standard, which will cover a wider range of fruit and vegetables.</P>

	<P>A Notification of Intention to apply for Recognition of the new primary school in Louth has been received from An Foras Patrunachta na Scoileanna Langhaeilge Teo (the Patron Body for Gaelscoileanna).  I have recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation.  It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be completed and revised arrangements will be in place within a two year timeframe.</P>
        <P>In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupils numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.  This means that new schools will not be established for reasons unrelated to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where  increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.</P>
        <P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards and requirements in Louth will be included in this process.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</P>

        <Quest> his views on a request for additional teaching staff for a school (details supplied); his further views on the need for increased resources for this school; if he will commit to giving this school the supports it needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level in relation to both staffing and <Col N="156"/>grant levels were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</P>
        <P>My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations. The staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand. The preparatory work for staffing allocations has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  Once the staffing schedule for the academic year 2009/10 is published schools meeting the criteria for developing status may submit applications for an additional post(s) to the Primary Payments Section of my Department.</P>
        <P>At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out the allocation process in a timely manner. Diverting resources in order to create a staffing profile for the school referred to by the Deputy could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding discussions between his Department and the VEC regarding the acquisition of a site adjacent to a school (details supplied) in County Dublin; if his attention has been drawn to the concerns among the staff and parents that if this matter is not resolved swiftly then there will be an accommodation crisis in 2010; the plans in place to fast track a new permanent building in view of the availability of said site, as part of a Gaelscoil campus; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department have met with County Dublin Vocational Committee to discuss the matter of a site for the school in question <Col N="160"/>and is in ongoing communication in relation to acquiring a long term lease on their property as a potential site for the proposed school.  The further progression of the building for the school in question will have to be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.  In light of the many competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the acquisition of the school site at this time.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that a technical inspection was carried out in May 2008 on the schools to which he refers with a view to informing the final brief for these projects, to determine the capacity of the site for the required works and the configuration which those works might take on the site.  The accommodation brief has now been finalised and officials from my Department will be in contact with the school authorities in that regard shortly.</P>
        <P>My Department is conscious of the extent of housing developments in the Lucan area and the consequences this has for school provision.  Substantial additional accommodation has been provided in the area by my Department at both primary and post-primary level in recent years and future needs are being kept under review.</P>
        <P>The progression of the projects from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>The Department asked the Office Public Works (OPW) to source a site for the above school. OPW identified several potential sites for the school.  The Department wrote to South Dublin County Council attaching correspondence it had received from the OPW regarding one of the sites in question.  The Local Authority has recently responded indicating their views in relation to a proposed location and this is now under consideration.  Due to the commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on the details of the matter until such a time as the acquisitions have been completed.</P><Col N="161"/>

	<P>I recently announced 10 major school building projects which are to re-tender and to proceed to construction in 2009. The two schools referred to by the Deputy were part of this announcement.  The projects are being re-tendered under the new form of contracts for public capital projects to get better value for money.  These projects are now to start the re-tendering process so that construction work can get under way as quickly as possible.  Officials from my Department have already contacted the school authorities and the design teams on each project to invite them to attend a briefing session which will guide them on the next steps to be taken.</P>
