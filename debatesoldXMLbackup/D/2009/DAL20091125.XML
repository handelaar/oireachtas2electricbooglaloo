      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well today in their talks with the trade unions.  It would be wrong to have a second one-day strike next week, and I hope the talks conducted by the Government will be meaningful, in return for calling off the strike.</P>
        <P>The accounts are to be published tomorrow for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  These accounts will show an estimated operating loss of &euro;27 million.  The authority was funded by Anglo Irish Bank, and personnel from the bank were on the authority&rsquo;s board.  Almost &euro;460 million was spent on the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle Company site, of which the authority owns 26%.  Does the Taoiseach think this is an appropriate way to conduct business?  Does he have a view that the Government will have to bail out the authority because of the extent of its operating loss?</P>
        <P>When we debated yesterday the consequences of flooding across the country, the Government was able to come up with a maximum of &euro;12 million for people whose livelihoods have been washed away, but it now appears as if the Government will have to bail out the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to the extent of &euro;27 million, which resulted from the involvement of bankers and developers in the unregulated and unsupervised purchase of assets like the glass bottle company site.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to bail out the docklands authority?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The annual report of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority will be published tomorrow and will be dealt with by the chairman then.  The authority is a commercial semi-State body, financed entirely from its own resources, generated through the acquisition, development and sale of assets in the docklands.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has a general oversight role, ensuring that the authority complies with its statutory requirements and that it continues to fulfil its roll in revitalising, regenerating the docklands area.  The authority will issue its report tomorrow.  It will be dealt with by that authority, which is a commercial semi-State body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has a general oversight responsibility for this commercial semi-State body.  As the Government, through the Department, has a general oversight responsibility here, does the Taoiseach think it appropriate that bankers would authorise lending to the extent that they did for the purchase of an asset, when members of that bank were on the board of the purchasing authority itself?  Does having a general oversight responsibility extend to saying something about that?</P>
        <P>The operating loss for the authority is &euro;27 million, as is now common knowledge.  It is a commercial body that cannot default on its loans.  Will the taxpayer fork out &euro;27 million to bail out the Dublin Docklands Development Authority as a result of this, when the taxpayer is also expected to put &euro;27 billion into the same bank?</P>
        <P>Deputy Hogan has requested that the Comptroller and Auditor General be involved in an independent audit of the conduct of the DDDA and its financial affairs.  Will the Taoiseach authorise this request, so that transparency and accountability can be had in this case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The authority&rsquo;s accounts are audited by external auditors, KPMG.  The authority is specifically excluded, along with many other State and semi-State commercial bodies, from being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Under existing arrangements, it is open to the joint environment committee to have the authority appear before it, and thus afford the Oireachtas the opportunity to question the authority.  I am aware that the committee has asked the authority to come before it next week.</P>
        <P>Professor Niamh Brennan was appointed chairperson of the authority, and she has particular expertise in this area.  The Minister has asked for a report on the governance situation and is awaiting that report from the authority.  All State bodies have been asked to certify that their procedures and practices are in accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, an updated version of which was published by the Department of Finance in May 2009.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wrote separately to the chairperson, looking for a comprehensive review of corporate governance in the DDDA.  I understand that review is advancing well, but some further work remains to be done, so I cannot speculate on what the review might say.  That report will be considered when it is submitted, as will any recommendations arising from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>As we meet this morning, hundreds of families throughout the country are still not able to get back into their homes after the floods.  Many are coping with trying to clean up, there are thousands in Cork who still have no water and there are many who are literally watching the level of the water to see how far it is from the front door of their home or business, as the spell of bad weather continues.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that this was unprecedented and that it happened very suddenly and, indeed, that the emergency services responded very quickly and appropriately to it.  However, we are a week into this spell of bad weather and I want to ask the Taoiseach about the Government&rsquo;s response to it.  First, will the Taoiseach accept that the fund of &euro;12 million will not be adequate to deal with the scale of the problem that has arisen with the flooding and the bad weather?</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P>Second, I listened to the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, last night and to a representative of the HSE this morning tell us that applications for that funding to community welfare officers will be means-tested and that people applying should bring with them the appropriate documents they would need for a means test.  What instructions have been given to community welfare officers in respect of means testing?  Will it be the same type of rigorous means test that is applied when people are applying for emergency payments, where they must bring everything from their bank statements to household bills and so on?  Does anybody appreciate that the last thing somebody who has had their home flooded needs is the kind of inquiries that are made during a means test of that kind?  Can some arrangement not be made whereby advance payments are made to householders who have been flooded, which might in the course of time be restored from insurance payments or otherwise?  At the least, people should not be forced to go through a means test, having gone through the trauma of being flooded.</P>
        <P>Third, has the Taoiseach given any instructions to the banks in respect of making short-term credit available to businesses who need to get back into business as quickly as possible after the flood situation and need help with restocking and so on?</P>
        <P>Fourth, I wish to ask about the European fund that is available given that the Government said yesterday it was making inquiries about that fund.  Has any application been made for assistance from the European Union in respect of the fund for flooding?  Has an invitation been issued to the EU Commissioner to visit Ireland to see at first hand the effect of the flooding in different parts of the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, the response of the Government and all of the agencies is a continuing one.  As I said yesterday, the needs emerge and change as circumstances change, and we are still in the midst of a weather pattern which is causing flooding and rainfall, with all the attendant problems in terms of the overflow from our river systems and how that is affecting many people up and down the country.  I was making the point that there are certain parts of the Shannon basin yet to be affected that will undoubtedly be affected based on previous experience.  Everyone is very conscious of the fact that this is a changing and evolving situation, and, as we get on top of one problem, other problems emerge.  We are in that situation as matters stand.</P>
        <P>Second, in regard to the question of providing assistance, the Government made a decision yesterday about the opening of a funding line, initially of &euro;10 million.  It requires a Government decision for that humanitarian aid to be put in place under the legislation, which is the responsibly of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  That is in addition to existing arrangements regarding urgent needs payments and exceptional needs payments, which are provided at the discretion of the community welfare officer in the normal way in which supplementary welfare is provided, as people will be aware.</P>
        <P>Obviously, one seeks to avoid an overly bureaucratic response but, at the same time, one has to be accountable for public moneys.  Therefore, it is based on the experience and discretion of the community welfare service that this humanitarian aid fund is being provided, augmenting not replacing or substituting existing funding arrangements in respect of urgent and exceptional needs payments, which, as the Deputy knows, can be provided as an emergency response in respect of food, clothing, bedding or whatever would be required in the immediate term.  The community welfare officers will be working closely with other agencies in the locality which would have a very clear knowledge and understanding of who is being affected on a daily basis, as the situation evolves in local situations.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the Government made an initial response yesterday to enable that to happen, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs was working on that during the course of yesterday.  As I said, now that this funding line has been authorised, the social welfare service can proceed <Col N="4"/>to have a further line of funding available, in addition to what is already in place under the social welfare Vote at present, through the various schemes to which I referred.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of the banks, the T&aacute;naiste is meeting with the Small Business Forum today to see what issues arise in that regard and to see in what way Government can assist.  It is a question of trying to meet local situations as they arise, as demands and needs become identified, and as the assessments that are now being undertaken proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach did not reply to my question as to whether any application has been made for European assistance with the emergency fund.  I would like him to answer it.</P>
        <P>As a first point, I put it to the Taoiseach that the normal means-tested community welfare officer response to situations where people find themselves without money is not appropriate in this situation, and this will have to be varied.  We are talking here about people whose homes have been flooded.  The kind of documentation that community welfare officers normally seek may well have been washed away in the flood in many of these houses and, in any event, it is not appropriate that people who have gone through the trauma of a flood would go through the kind of rigorous means test that is normally applied by community welfare officers.  Therefore, I ask that this approach be varied and that new instructions are issued to community welfare officers which are appropriate to this set of circumstances.</P>
        <P>Second, I ask the Taoiseach to arrange with the banks, which are now supported by the State, to provide short-term credit for businesses and farms that need to get back into operation again and that have a requirement for short-term funding.  These are people who must get back on their feet.</P>
        <P>Third, throughout the debate yesterday, many Members, including Members from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s side and including a Minister of State, suggested an independent review should be carried out, when the floods have abated, to examine what actually happened here.  Given climate change and all that is happening, we can anticipate spells of bad weather like this happening again and we need to be better prepared than we were on this occasion.  The review needs to consider the flow of information &mdash; for example, what happened in Cork, where the information seems to have been somewhat deficient for whatever reason &mdash; as well the water management systems and some of the planning permissions that were granted for development and building on what were flood plains.  There should be a review of this situation and I ask that it be carried out after the floods have abated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, the Government contacted our permanent representative in Brussels yesterday, arising out of our Cabinet meeting yesterday, to inquire as to what assistance is available from the EU in respect of various solidarity funds and other emergency funding that arises when floods occur and where serious problems arise.  That matter is in hand and is being proceeded with in the normal and appropriate way.</P>
        <P>Second, in regard to the question about the banking situation and the difficulties that businesses will face in this situation, as the Deputy said, there is the insurance aspect to all of this.  In addition, as a result of meeting with representatives of the small business forum today, the T&aacute;naiste will liaise with banks to see in what way they can assist.  The T&aacute;naiste will also ask the county enterprise boards to do an assessment at local level of the position for local businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Has that not yet been done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being done.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="5"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be later today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are meeting them now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being done.  We must deal with the independent review as we tackle our priorities, which relates to the conversation we have had up to now.  What lessons are to be learned and what issues arise for the future are matters that can and should be looked at?</P>
        <P>There has been much discussion about what happened at Iniscarra.  My understanding is that if the water came over the top of the dam, all the hydrological expertise available to the ESB suggested that far more water would have come down into the valley at that point.  The question of structural damage to the dam may also have come into play by holding back water, given the amount of water coming against the dam at the time.  These are technical matters that can and will be addressed in due course.  Having spoken to sitting county managers in Cork when I visited the city on Monday, I know they are very much of the view that this matter can be dealt with in the aftermath of the immediate emergency issues arising for individuals.</P>
        <P>These are matters for later.  The immediate point is to deal with the issue as it arises, provide assistance where possible and to do this in as flexible a way as possible that is consistent with principles of public accountability for public funds.  We must consider how to assist affected businesses apart from the insurance cover that they have.  The matter is being dealt with by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office as we speak.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The OECD review of the Irish public service, Towards an Integrated Public Service, was published in April 2008.  This report, which benchmarked the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries and made recommendations as to the further direction of public service reform, was an authoritative assessment of the Irish public service.  It confirmed the many strengths of the system and identified challenges that needed to be addressed.</P><Col N="6"/>
        <P Just="Left">Transforming public services, TPS, sets out an ambitious programme of renewal for the entire public service.  It represents the blueprint for a new type of unified public service, focused on common goals, with greater co-operation and reduced boundaries between sectors, organisations and professions.  It also focuses on a much greater integration of services around user needs and far greater efficiency in internal data sharing and administration through shared service models.  Implementation of the change programme is being overseen by the Cabinet committee on transforming public services, which I chair.  The work of the Cabinet committee is being supported by a steering group of Secretaries General and the transforming public services programme office, which is based in my Department, working closely with the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Progress has been made in a number of areas to date.  The special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes was established as part of the transforming public services framework and its report was published last July.  The recommendations of the special group are being considered by the Government in the context of the 2010 Estimates and budgetary process and decisions on the proposals will be taken in that context.</P>
        <P>A range of instruments has been developed in the human resource area to contribute to the implementation of expenditure savings for 2009, notably the incentivised scheme of early retirement in the public service, the special Civil Service career break scheme and the shorter working year scheme, together with the moratorium on the filling of public sector vacancies by recruitment or promotion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Responsibility for e-Government<b> </b>policy and central operations has been consolidated in the Department of Finance.  That Department is currently working with all public bodies to develop a rolling programme of e-Government projects across the public service.  The latest EU e-Government benchmarks show that Ireland&rsquo;s ranking for on-line sophistication has now improved from 17th to joint seventh position.  Significant savings can be realised from the improved professionalisation of procurement and, to this end, the new national public procurement operations unit has been established within the Office of Public Works.  This unit is working to leverage the public service&rsquo;s buying power by organising procurement of common goods and services across the public service.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing in developing specific proposals in the area of shared services<b> </b>on the basis that there are significant potential savings associated with such initiatives.  Groups of senior officials have been established to advance shared services in the human resources, pensions, payroll and financial shared services area.  The work on shared services is being advanced within the HSE, the Civil Service, local government and in the education sector.</P>
        <P>The<b> </b>organisational review programme, ORP, has been extended so that all Departments and major offices will be reviewed within the next three years.  The ORP team, based in the Department of the Taoiseach, carries out and publishes assessments of the capacity of individual Departments and major offices to meet their challenges over the coming years.  Four organisations have been reviewed so far this year &mdash; the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the Property Registration Authority.  The reviews are due to be published around the end of the year and will be accompanied by follow-up action plans on the key findings prepared by each of the four organisations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In line with transforming public services, a new round of value-for-money reviews was approved by the Government in late 2008.  Reviews under the new arrangements for the value for money and policy review initiative are under way in 12 Departments.  These reviews focus <Col N="7"/>on evaluations of significant areas of expenditure and major policy issues with a focus on health, education, social welfare and justice sectors.</P>
        <P>Work is under way on the development of new performance and governance frameworks for State agencies and the greater use of service level agreements in this context.  A new code of practice for the governance of State bodies was published in May.  In addition, work is well advanced on the merger, abolition, etc., of a number of State agencies in line with the announcement of 30 agency rationalisation proposals in the 2009 budget.  A further 43 rationalisation measures were proposed in the special group report and those proposals are under consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In line with the priority actions set out in transforming public services, the intensive discussions resuming with unions are addressing the development of new highly flexible arrangements for the redeployment<b> </b>of staff to areas of highest priority in the public service.  These discussions are ongoing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Work has also commenced on some of the numerous commitments relating to improving customer focus. A group of senior officials is currently examining the feasibility of introducing a single point of telephone contact service and is developing a fully costed business plan to support this work.  A request for information was recently issued to a number of companies in respect of this project.  A group has also been established to determine the feasibility and value of mechanisms to simplify the provision of means information by citizens to public bodies.  The programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach is also undertaking surveys of Civil Service customers and the results of these surveys, of citizens and businesses, will be published by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of other priority actions from TPS, such as extending individual performance management systems across the public service and strengthening existing systems are the subject of discussions with the public service unions.  In the renewed programme for Government, the Government has set out a number of specific actions relating to performance measurement and reward in the public service, recruitment and promotion arrangements and a range of strengthened governance procedures for State agencies.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that the radical transformation of the public service is the subject of discussions with the public service unions at present in the context of making the necessary savings to the overall public service pay bill.  These important discussions will resume this afternoon.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that industrial action took place yesterday, particularly as efforts to find agreement are continuing.  At a meeting with senior union leaders last Friday, I urged the unions to ensure that appropriate and responsible emergency cover arrangements were put in place and I understand that this was the case yesterday.  I want to acknowledge the decision by public service unions involved in the flood relief effort to suspend their action.  We now have to move on and focus on the intensive series of meetings which commence this afternoon to see if we can still reach agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a lengthy reply which has been prepared for the Taoiseach.  The OECD report made a number of recommendations and referred to the collapse of value-for-money disciplines and the damage done by an ill-thought out decentralisation programme.  It referred to the habit of creating new agencies for every problem, the inability to deliver on the ambitions of e-Government and the refusal to tie pay increases in the public service to a tangible reform agenda.</P>
      
        <P>It is 18 months since that report came through and it is 12 months since the task force set up by the Government to review public service reform reported back to the Government with <Col N="8"/>a three-year comprehensive plan to provide reform.  The public service did not cause the current problem, but it will clearly take what it gets.  What is really causing a major problem is the fact that the only solution coming from Government is an austerity programme or plan.  Leaving aside the response prepared for him, has the Taoiseach a view of his own on what sort of public service he wants to see in two or three years time?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is entering discussions today and I hope those discussions will be meaningful and that there will not be another one-day strike next week.  The Taoiseach chairs the committee.  What sort of public service does he want to see in two or three years time?  Will we have a public service that is rewarded for its initiative and where hard work is recognised?  Will it and those it serves have a leaner, more efficient and more effective service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s negative assessment of the OECD report.  One of the great problems in discussing this issue is the failure to acknowledge those parts of the public service and delivery systems that are working well.  At the same time, I candidly acknowledge some aspects are not working as well and that best practice is not being provided right across the system.</P>
        <P>A good service is down to good management, staff and representatives and people working together in a collaborative way to ensure their organisation provides the public service the people need, one that is citizen centred and which tries to adapt at all times, with limited resources, but using technology and modern workplace practices, encouraging flexibility and empowering people at the front line involved in public service provision to assist in helping to fashion and design what needs to be done.  That is an ongoing process that is not completed on any particular day.  It is a process, culture and commitment to change and excellence which enables people to be able to fulfil their potential in their respective organisations, giving leadership at local level and trying to ensure that people work across as well as within organisations.</P>
        <P>In the context of how we have delivered and promoted public service provision here, our system has emerged organically in a way that is not consistent in every respect as we deliver services.  We need to recognise that.  The OECD report and the task force on transforming public services provide an excellent context in which we can acknowledge the work is ongoing.  The idea that there is absolute recalcitrance in the public service to change is not an accurate picture.  One can point at many areas where the contrary is the case.  However, it is clear that change is not delivered in a consistent way across the system.  We know from experience that the management of change is also about people and about ensuring the leadership is there.  We must give people the capacity and ability to proceed with change management programmes effectively and bring their organisations with them.  There are good examples where that has happened.  I already mentioned the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, an excellent example.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Social and Family Affairs have excellent welfare payment systems and have demonstrated an ability to take on technology transfer and to efficiently and effectively provide entitlements and services to people within 24 hours of the day of entitlement, for example, single farm payments.  Their systems are as good as can be found anywhere in the European Union.  The idea that this should be the exception rather than the rule is not the case.  However, we must address all of the issues in a systematic way.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked what my view was of the public service.  In our discussions with the public service unions, we have been able to give them, in addition to existing documentation, an indication of what we require in terms of restructuring, the use of modern procurement methods to save moneys, e-Government and redeployment.  Redeployment is a critical factor, in particular the ability to redeploy people across the service to areas of critical need as the <Col N="9"/>need arises.  We have seen this in a different way in terms of how we responded to the emergency flood position over recent days.  The response has been characterised by people&rsquo;s ability to collaborate, work together and work across the system and go to where they are needed.  That is flexibility and people have been able to respond and get on with the work and overcome any issues of demarcation or other problems.</P>
        <P>This is an intricate and complex industrial relations process.  The idea that all this is simply handled and dealt with immediately with the consent of everyone available or on call is not correct.  We need to recognise that and have a shared vision of the direction we want to take over the next few years.  This will involve accelerated change and will involve people being prepared to reconfigure services from the way they are currently being delivered.  This means changing how we do things.  It means not doing the same things in the same organisations and institutions as previously.  The process is about getting the most cost-effective and efficient way of delivering public services in whatever new structures that are required &mdash; some of which will involve mergers or abolition of authorities &mdash; and developing county structures and means of providing services.  There are a number of ways and means by which this can be done, none exclusive of the other.</P>
        <P>If we can find a way in which this can be agreed and to which people will commit and we get on with that and provide further savings, this will involve permanent structural change.  It involves changing the way we do all of this.  I believe the discussion process must ensure we do not just talk about what we need to do in 2010 in financial terms.  The discussion is about how, given the limited resources available to the State &mdash; a changed situation from where we were &mdash; we will provide the basic services.  It is about the priorities we are insisting upon, the aspects of services that will be eliminated and the aspects that will be dealt with by others.  We must be prepared to look at all that.  We must commit, as is the situation in Towards 2016 to which everyone is committed, to changing how we do things so that the citizen is at the centre of the issue and the service provider is in a position to provide the service as citizens require it as they go through life, in childhood, working, having families and old age.  It must cater for how we handle people with disability and mainstream services for them.  It is a more complex mosaic than people sometimes give to the debate.</P>
        <P>I believe it is possible to achieve this in the right circumstances.  The crisis situation we face today makes it an imperative for us to face the challenge comprehensively and in a collaborative way.  We must do the business based on the excellent examples already available to us in the public service as to why change provides a much better prospect for better career fulfilment, a better workplace environment, a better way of delivering services and a far more fulfilling role for people than too many aspects of the services that are characterised by crisis management mode too often and perennially.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  He would do himself a power of good if he, as Taoiseach and Head of Government, said he and the Governments he has served in got this wrong.  I agree the structures of the public service have strangled initiative and strangled many of those who work above and beyond the call of duty.  In respect of redeployment, which is critical, the Government task force recommended a common contract for public servants to enable redeployment to happen more quickly, so that people could be moved from Department to Department or section to section as their expertise or experience might require.  Has that been a subject of discussion between the Government and the trade unions?  Does the Taoiseach, as part of these discussions, intend to put on the table a proposal for a common contract to facilitate ease of movement of public servants?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach think it appropriate that any public servant should earn more than the Taoiseach of the day?  Is this the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view on how rates of pay have increased at the <Col N="10"/>higher levels of the public service and is this an issue in his view?  The public have strong views on high levels of pay.</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach provide the House with information as to the reduction in public service numbers as a result of the moratorium on recruitment?  Can he provide information on the number of posts that have not been filled as a result of the moratorium?  It is a crude instrument in many ways in that particularly critical posts may be left vacant and Ministers may lack the expert staff to provide information to them about questions which they may be required to answer.  What has been the impact of the moratorium to date on public service recruitment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that figure available to me.  The objective of the moratorium on recruitment when introduced  last year was to achieve a 3% saving on payroll costs.  I will obtain those figures for the Deputy.  In fact, the objective of the moratorium was met last year. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures regarding the common contract.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It would represent a saving of approximately &euro;300 million.</P>
        <P>The question of redeployment is critical for a simple reason.  If one is aiming to change how services are delivered, it is clear there will be surplus staff as a result of the reconfiguration process.  If a change is made in practices then it is a question of what to do with the staff in an organisation currently doing that work.  Without a commitment to redeployment it is very difficult to have an effective and cost-effective change management process.  An effective system of redeployment is needed in order to utilise the staff surplus created by the reconfiguration of services and by the adoption of e-Government and shared services, for example and to move staff to new centres of excellence.</P>
        <P>In order to minimise the overall numbers required to deliver services at any time such a system has to operate smoothly so that staff can be deployed across organisational and sectoral boundaries.  For example, surplus Civil Service staff in a particular location may, in terms of organisational needs and the available skills and distance, be more appropriately redeployed to the local government or health sector than to other Civil Service Departments or agencies.  Many agencies are considering looking at their methods for delivering services and full co-operation with such reorganisation will be necessary.  It would be essential that those being redeployed are not unfairly disadvantaged.  Management would be empowered to require deployment under arrangements to be put in place in each sector.  Where disputes arise as to redeployment, there will have to be a speedy and final method of resolution.  Extremely flexible redeployment arrangements must be viewed as the corollary to arrangements that do not provide for compulsory redundancies.</P>
        <P>A flexible redeployment model is necessary in order to avoid compulsory redundancy and to achieve a cost-effective outcome when making those changes.  The question of common contractual arrangements is a detail to be dealt with in negotiation.  As with any change management process, it is necessary to build confidence in the process and people must be brought along in order for the process to be effective.  People need to buy into the process and to take ownership of what is being proposed in order for it to be effective.  This does not mean that any one person has a veto on change because the financial realities are dictating what must be done.  It is preferable to do so in a collaborative way and with everyone on board.  This form of discussion and shared commitment is what we need to develop as part of the permanent structural change which is not only unavoidable but necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach in his opening reply to Deputy Kenny said that the Department of Finance was to be the lead Department to oversee public service reform.  If this <Col N="11"/>is the case, there will be no reform.  There may be cuts in the public service budget but it will not be reformed and I will give my reasons for this view.  The Department of Finance has too much to do at the moment.  It is already trying to manage the biggest budget crisis we have seen.  It is dealing with the banks and on top of this, the Government is going to have it undertaking reform of the public service.  The Department of Finance may know something about the number of beans to be counted in different areas of the public service but with the greatest of respect, it knows very little about the delivery of services in health, local government, education and the many other areas where service has to be delivered.  With the greatest of respect I say the Department of Finance is the Department that brought us the recession.  It could not oversee the bank regulation, could not get the budgetary figures right and the Taoiseach is now proposing to put it in charge of reforming the public service.  This will not work.  I suggest that if the Taoiseach is serious about public service reform, the first thing he will do is establish a separate and dedicated Department of public service reform, headed by a Minister charged with delivering that reform, otherwise we are not going to have reform.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the vision document to which he referred.  He spoke at length about a vision for a better public service &mdash; a vision we would all share.  I understand a vision document was presented to the trade unions at negotiations last Friday.  I ask if this document will be placed in the Oireachtas Library so that we can all have access to it, rather than reading leaked portions of the document which periodically appear in the media.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the issue of public service reform is something that is of concern not just to those who deliver public services and those who govern them but also to those who consume them.</P>
        <P>With regard to the talks, I have been saying for some months I believed it was possible to achieve a reduction in the public service pay bill by a negotiated agreement with the public service unions.  I now see that the talks taking place would appear to be aiming in that direction and this is to be welcomed.  I also heard Mr. Peter McLoone&rsquo;s public statement yesterday that his union and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were prepared to talk to Government about reductions in the public service pay bill.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House if, prior to yesterday&rsquo;s strike the Government was aware that this was the trade union position and if the Government was aware of this position, why did it allow the strike to take place yesterday?  Another strike is threatened for Thursday 3 December.  The Taoiseach will have noted that yesterday&rsquo;s strike was a pretty united solid effort across the public sector and it will happen again on 3 December unless an agreement is concluded.  Can the Taoiseach give the House any assurances that an agreement will be concluded before 3 December in order to avert a second strike?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s points.  His first point was about the Department of Finance being exclusively responsible for the programme for reform of the public service.  This is not a correct assumption.  A Cabinet committee has been established of which I am the chairman and this committee is supported by a steering group of Secretaries General and the office for the programme for transforming the public service which is based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  This office works closely with the Department of Finance which has responsibility for the public service.  The Department deals with all industrial relations issues and with human resource issues and it has the expertise to do so.  A second Secretary General post is in charge of that part of the Department.  It is autonomous in respect of its agenda of public service interaction with the trade unions and staff representatives.  This is where such expertise is concentrated.  It is not a question of any one Department having exclusive responsibility as this situation requires a collaborative team effort across Departments as much as across the trade union movement and other organisations providing public services. That is my answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s first point.</P><Col N="12"/>
        <P>Second, this discussion, the process of reform and a number of ongoing initiatives, outlined in the detailed reply I gave, should be viewed in the context of the comprehensive review under the auspices of the OECD, which has expertise in this area.  It conducted a comparative analysis of how public services are delivered and the strengths and weakness of the Irish public service and a fair assessment was given by the organisation in this respect, which acknowledged areas where things are being done quite well in all the circumstances and areas where things could be improved.  That is what one would expect to see in an organisation comprising 350,000 people providing services across a range of organisations, Departments and so on.  Third, the task force was set up immediately in order that we could have a beginning, middle and end on how to proceed with this.</P>
        <P>Fourth, we are in the process of achieving a full buy-in from everybody to proceed on this basis, in addition to what has been sought to be done in the absence of comprehensive agreement on a redeployment package.  This aspect is necessary to achieve what is envisaged.  We need to take practical steps and hard-nosed negotiations have to take place at local and institutional level, in our hospitals and in the education and other sectors.  One has to get on with that business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The discussions will build on the solid work in place, some of which is being proceeded with, as I outlined in my reply, and address the wider issues upon which there is not yet agreement and on which we need agreement if we are to do what has to be done.  The financial realities dictate that we have to get on with this process and it is better to do so in a collaborative and agreed way rather than taking other approaches, which get into the industrial relations process, etc.</P>
        <P>The second question raised by the Deputy related to documentation.  Let us remind ourselves of the basis of the current discussions.  We have indicated what we believe is required to get a contribution from public pay and pensions to meet the immediate financial budgetary problem we have.  The suggestion was made by the trade union movement that it believed other policy options are available to us that will achieve the savings.  In the context of 2010, I am concentrating on getting those savings.  I also believe that getting them on their own without a commitment to permanent structural change in the public service means we will come back to this issue again and again and, therefore, it is better to do it in a comprehensive way both in terms of the short-term requirement and what we will have to do in any event to get a public service in place that is fit for purpose and commensurate with the resources available from the taxpayer.  That will involve a serious and accelerated organisational change programme across the service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The discussions arose in that context and they are continuing.  A request was made to the Government, as one of the parties to the discussions, to give a more succinct document, in addition to all the available documents, on the issues that would be required and to indicate the Government&rsquo;s ultimate objectives in these areas.  That has been done.  Until those talks are over, I do not want to take a unilateral decision on what I do with documents that are under discussion, as the Deputy will appreciate, having been a trade union negotiator in a previous life.  He can take it the document is broadly consistent with the existing documentation, which has formed the basis of our approach to date, but until those discussions are concluded I am not free to decide on the floor of the House about those issues.  I want the public service unions to reflect on that and the discussions are resuming today.  Let them take place.  We will know the outcome in the next week or so.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked why I did not stop the strike.  I am not in a position to stop a strike but I am able to outline the Government&rsquo;s position.  I await from the trade union side the full range of policy options that will meet the requirements of the situation as we have outlined them. <Col N="13"/> That discussion resumes today.  There has been a great deal of information sharing to explain what are the cost issues.  That interaction with the Department of Finance and the public service would be the norm before people come forward with their full position in order that we are at least on the same page in terms of what certain initiatives may provide in the context of the figures, whatever about ultimately getting agreement.  Let us all know what are the common facts at least.  That is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I have said I am open to looking at policy options if they help us get to where we need to be.  I am also convinced we need permanent structural change going forward and we need a commitment to this.  On that basis, we are having discussions.  I cannot guarantee the Deputy an agreed outcome but everyone is acting in good faith.  I accept everyone&rsquo;s bona fides and like any negotiation, it will be successfully concluded or otherwise, but we will make a serious effort because I am sure everyone is of the view that it is better to find an agreed basis to go forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To some extent what the Taoiseach is saying now is what the Labour Party has been saying for months.  We have advocated that rather than unilaterally imposing pay cuts across the board in the public sector, there should be a negotiated reduction in the public service pay bill and that the opportunity of that negotiation should be availed of to achieve reforms.  I am glad the discussion on all of this has moved into that territory and I hope it will succeed.  However, while I never believed the Taoiseach was in a position to wave a wand to call off strikes, he was in a position to advance the negotiations in order that strikes could be averted.  That clearly was not done in advance of yesterday.  The Taoiseach allowed yesterday&rsquo;s strike to take place.  It appeared he wanted it to take place for whatever reason.  In any event, it took place and we are facing another strike on 3 December.  Is the Taoiseach confident he can conclude an agreement by that date to avert the strike?</P>
        <P>With regard to the wider issue, I again come back to the question of whether the Taoiseach is serious about achieving public service reform.  Clearly the Government and the Department of Finance are intent on reducing the bill but if they are serious about reform, they will start at the top.  If there is to be reform of the public service, a process that is likely to take place over a protracted period, there needs to be a dedicated Department.  The first reform that should take place is a reform at the top in order that a Department is dedicated to public service reform, as was the case for a period in the past.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach rightly said there will be complex issues such as redeployment.  He mentioned the question of civil servants being redeployed to different sectors and agencies, which begs the questions as to whether there will be a redeployment process in reverse into the Civil Service.  A range of organisational issues will require a separate Department with a separate ministerial head rather than putting it all into a Department that is overstretched as it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained to the Deputy earlier, his characterisation of this matter being dealt with exclusively in the Department of Finance is not correct for the reasons I have given because we have set up, in line with the recommendations of the task force, a Cabinet committee and a steering group, which are working through those issues, as recommended by those who have advised the Government in this area.  It is not correct to say that.</P>
        <P>Second, setting up a separate Department will not solve the problem.  I would have as great a need of a magic wand to do that as to stop strikes.  We have had Departments with responsibility for the public service separate from the Department of Finance in the past.  It was not found to be a panacea for public service reform on a major scale.  In any event, it was tried in pre-partnership days.  There must be a real and definitive commitment if these things are to happen.  If a reform process is to succeed, there must be a timeline for arbitration and a commit<Col N="14"/>ment by everyone to accept the outcome of arbitration and move on.  In the absence of that, process takes over and things churn on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did very little to stop it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy made a comment which is not correct.  He said that was his view and his view is incorrect.  That has never been my way of conducting discussions with anyone.  I know what must be obtained and what the objective is.  Everyone in this House has come around to the view that the adjustment to be made is of the order of &euro;4 billion.  While the trade union movement has set out its view regarding the time needed for an adjustment to be made, as it is entitled to do, there is an understanding and acceptance, in the context of these discussions, that the &euro;4 billion figure is the one we must deal with for 2010.  People may reserve their positions on that but we must proceed if we are to arrive at outcomes.  That was part of a previous discussion.  The sharing of information was another part of that discussion.  </P>
        <P>No one has committed to anything.  Everyone is acting in good faith.  I must now see the specific proposals which the trade unions believe can provide an outcome to which the Government can subscribe.  I accept that people are acting in good faith in this regard.  That process is occurring now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has a week before the next strike.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s third point was with regard to the possibility of another strike.  I will deal with these issues on their objective merits and not on the basis of the prospect of a strike next week or some other week.  I am not interested in people going on strike.  I do not believe it is the right approach.  I am in discussions at present.  What should the prospect of a strike convey to me as I take part in those discussions?  Should the Government change its view and move away from the objective merits of what we believe is necessary in the national interest?  Decisions being taken by others based on how they view the situation are a matter for them and should be taken up with them.  I am engaged in talks and interested in finding a solution, but it must be one that fits with overall budgetary requirements.  I will listen to any views which help me obtain that outcome.  I cannot make decisions on the basis of another problem arising on 3 December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My position is to engage on the basis of a substantive outcome consistent with the Government&rsquo;s outline of requirements for 2010 and its commitment to permanent structural change beyond that. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="15"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stressed the importance of career and personal fulfilment among those working in the public service.  Are there recent measures of morale in the public service or are there plans to carry out such measures?  Are there recent measures of customer satisfaction among the citizens who engage with the public service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In any relationship between an employer and employee, there are responsibilities, which the vast majority of people seek to discharge.  Being employed, whether in the public or private sector, one gives one&rsquo;s best every day on the basis of the remuneration one receives.  That is an objective of everyone who goes to work.  We must make sure that we have an organisational structure which enables people to find that fulfilling role, consistent with their professional standards and recognising that employers&rsquo; capacity to pay has been greatly affected by the economic crisis, which is not unique to this country but has arisen in every country in the developed world.  That requires us to look at things afresh and find a way forward which makes sure that a contribution is made by that sector, as by everyone else.  </P>
        <P>I acknowledge the contribution that has already been made.  I freely acknowledge that, despite my best efforts at the time, there was a requirement to impose a pension levy, which affects people&rsquo;s take-home pay.  There is no want of trying to find agreement but the agreement must be consistent with what we need to do.  People in many sectors of society believe we must get on with that process.  I believe we can do it collaboratively and in a constructive way if we can find the means to work through the issues which face us.  I hope that is the case.  I believe it is a better way to do business.</P>
        <P>I have had the honour of holding ministerial office in a number of Departments.  I always sought to be open and straight with people, whether staff representatives or anyone else.  None of us would have chosen to be in this situation but we are here and we must confront it and deal with it.  In the past, I was Minister when strikes took place in my sector.  I never sought, as was suggested, to try to organise a strike.  It is not an intelligent way to proceed.  I am not in the business of putting us into that position but sometimes the process we have put in place and its failure to find agreement can lead to that outcome.  No one, on any side, seeks a strike.  I do not suggest that anyone on the other side of the negotiation table is seeking a strike.  However, sometimes one occurs.  I can only continue to put the position of taxpayers in general, as a Government in the current financial and budgetary situation.  I must do that in as fair a way as possible, recognising that there are decisions which the Government must contemplate and execute which it would not normally like to make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about morale levels and the measurement of them.  I am waiting for a response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Morale levels are a function of how an organisation is operated and managed.  In many organisations one finds very high morale in recessionary times.  There are other organisations where it might not be so high.  Morale is a function of management and staff working together to make sure morale is high.  </P>
        <P>There is important work to be done.  There are difficulties and issues to be resolved in an industrial relations context.  That does not mean people do not do an honest job for an honest day&rsquo;s pay.  That is my experience of the vast majority of people I have dealt with, whether in the public or private sectors.</P>

	<P>I understand the Government considered the report on the inquiry into sexual abuse in the Dublin archdiocese.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that report is to be published tomorrow?  When will it be made available to Members of the House?  More important, will the Taoiseach give an assurance that it will be made available to the victims of the abuse before it is made available to the media?  He will recall that there was considerable distress felt by victims when the Ryan report was published that they did not receive the report before it was made available to the media.  Is it being made available to victims before it is made available to the media?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform briefed the Cabinet this week on the matter.  The Department will brief victims&rsquo; group tomorrow morning before publication of the report.  The report will be published tomorrow afternoon and being a document of public importance, it will be made available in the normal way thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Did I hear the Taoiseach say &ldquo;thereafter&rdquo; in respect of it being made available to Members of the House?  It should be made available to Members of the House certainly no later than it is released at a press conference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the consumer and competition Bill or otherwise, I wish to raise with the Taoiseach insurance for flood damage and the problems for those who have no insurance, who are underinsured or who will not be able to get insurance in the future.  In the context of that Bill or otherwise, is it possible that the Taoiseach could arrange a special investigation into insurance for flood damage, the problems associated with it, the lack of insurance and a possible arrangement for an uninsured risk committee whereby there could be some mediation between those who cannot get insurance and the group of insurers involved in this area?  Does he recognise that it is a particular problem now and is likely to be a continuing one?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am aware of Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s keen interest in this matter.  The area he represents has been greatly affected.  The issue is that there will be a reassessment of risk by insurance companies arising out of the claims experience which will now emerge.  As the Deputy knows, the Irish Insurance Federation ensures people are entitled to get quotes for insurance cover and, if not, having a mediating role and finding what a party seeking insurance cover might regard as reasonable in the circumstances.  Unfortunately, the experience in the <Col N="18"/>past has been that the reassessment of risk, actuarial risk, by insurance companies means increased premiums being sought where flooding takes place in the same way as having an accident affects one&rsquo;s no claims bonus in vehicle insurance.  Unfortunately, this is one of the consequences with which we must contend.</P>
        <P>There could be a role for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which deals with the insurance industry to see a fair and honest assessment is made and to liaise with the industry to ensure insurance cover is available to people.  Affordability will become an issue because of the claims experience which will now arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Is it possible for a meeting to be arranged between the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Insurance Federation to specifically discuss this issue in the context of the current, and likely continuing further, problems?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  That is a good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s question, has the Taoiseach considered businesses, which have suffered considerable damage, that have not been able to obtain insurance because they are located in recognised flood areas?  Is it possible that the funding proposal referred to by the Taoiseach can be extended to businesses?</P>
        <P>In terms of Standing Orders, given that we are in the midst of an emergency, can the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come into the House today to update us on the position by way of a statement regarding particular local authorities?  In particular, can he confirm to the House that retained fire fighters in the western region have been precluded from responding to flood-related calls?  They are retained fire fighters who have been instructed by the local authorities not to come on duty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy table that matter for the Adjournment.  That might be the best avenue for him to pursue this matter.</P>

	<P>Yes, very much so.  When will the sale of alcohol Bill be brought forward to enable us to discuss this issue?  As we saw from television broadcasts and pictures in today&rsquo;s newspapers, thousands of people travelled North to buy alcohol yesterday.  The abuse of alcohol is a major problem.  It is as big a cause of death as the incidence of road accidents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill seeks to consolidate, in many respects, the legal position regarding the sale of alcohol.  It contains some modernising amendments.  It is likely to be the first half of next year before it will come to the floor of the House.</P>

	<P>I got a text message about a half an hour ago from my colleague, Alan Kelly, MEP, to advise me that the European Parliament has now passed the EU globalisation fund for Dell workers and other ancillary companies.  Approximately &euro;22 million will be available under that fund.  This money must be spent within 18 months.  I raise the issue with the Taoiseach because it is imperative that the Government set up the procedures in this country to ensure that those people get the funding to which they are entitled for retraining, re-education and setting up their own businesses.  It will be ironic if the Ceann Comhairle rules me out of order for raising this matter given that the European Parliament was able to discuss it this morning.</P>

	<P>I call for a debate on this matter.  It is vital that we get this fund up and running.  I commend our MEPs, led by my colleague, Alan Kelly, on getting the matter to this point in the European Parliament, but we now need to do the necessary work in our Parliament to ensure that those workers who lost their jobs can benefit from this fund.  I would appreciate a reply from the Taoiseach on this matter.</P>

It has included close co-operation and consultation with the European Commission by the Government, culminating in President Barroso&rsquo;s announcement made in Limerick in September of Commission approval of the application.  All relevant State agencies and educational institutions in the mid-west have been involved with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department in designing tailored programmes in their areas of expertise.  Supports are currently being provided by F&Aacute;S, Enterprise Ireland, city and county enterprise boards and local vocational education committees.  A number of additional measures are being considered in the areas of entrepreneurial supports and work placement schemes.  It is correct that we would get all new measures right before rolling them out.  This will be the largest such fund application to be supported with significant co-financing being provided by Government.  It is evidence of the emphasis given to providing relevant supports for those made redundant due to the adverse effects of globalisation and of significant work undertaken to ensure the most appropriate range of measures, as provided through this fund by co-financing.  We have made <Col N="20"/>a further application on behalf of redundant workers at Waterford Crystal and we are finalising a provisional application in regard to redundancies at SR Technics in Dublin Airport.  </P>

	<P Just="Left">Before we begin, I wish to advise that I proposed amendments Nos. 79 and 91, on behalf of the Labour Party, on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 79 refers to park and ride facilities being consequent on the formation of the national transport authority, namely, that such facilities would be available through that authority.  Amendment No. 91 relates to the key point of extending the integrated transport provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority, which we passed into law last year, to the national transport authority.  We discussed those at length on Committee Stage.  I note the Ceann Comhairle sent me a letter this morning ruling them out of order, but he did not rule them out on Committee Stage.  Surely he is being inconsistent.  These amendments relate to two important items, which I believe everybody interested in transport would like to see included in the Bill.  I understand the point about them imposing a charge on the Exchequer, but should the Ceann Comhairle not at least have allowed discussion, given that they were discussed on Committee Stage?</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 79 and 91 in the name of Deputy Broughan have been ruled out of order because they have the potential to impose a charge on the Revenue.  Amendment No. 79 would require the provision of national park and ride infrastructure and the resources required would impose this charge.  Amendment No. 91 seeks to change section 33 to broaden the functions of the national transport authority to apply within and outside the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 89 are in the name of Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd and have been ruled out of order because they have the potential to impose a charge on the Revenue.  Amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 89 propose to extend the remit of the Dublin Transport Authority and, therefore, the national transport authority outside the greater Dublin area with immediate effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, line 3, after &ldquo;driver)&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;and a small public service vehicle having seated accommodation from more than 5 persons (including the driver)&rdquo;.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The reason for the amendment is to allow certain taxis, hackneys and other small minibuses to operate local public transport passenger services in urban and rural areas.  There are many examples throughout the European Union of taxis and small minibuses operating public transport services in peri-urban and rural areas where there are lower levels of demand to provide feeder services to local and longer distance bus, train and light rail transport services.  It is somewhat related to amendments Nos. 2 and 7.  It seeks to insert a provision which would help us to provide a better local transport service by allowing smaller vehicles to be included under the definition of a bus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 seeks to amend the definition of a bus to incorporate small public service vehicles with a minimum passenger accommodation of five persons including the driver.  The Minister of Transport pointed out during the consideration of this amendment on Committee Stage that the word &ldquo;bus&rdquo; is defined in the Bill as a mechanically propelled vehicle designed for travel by road with seating accommodation for more than nine persons, including the driver.  The same definition is also used in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and as Deputy Broughan is aware, that legislation is intrinsically linked to the legislation now before the House.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a new licensing regime for commercial bus services on specified routes.  Separate and distinct legal frameworks have evolved since the Road Traffic Act 1933 in respect of small and large public service vehicles.  The Minister is strongly of the view that any blurring of the fundamental difference between large and small public service vehicles should be avoided at all costs and should not form part of this Bill because the focus of the Bill is on the development of a new legislative provision for the licensing of commercial bus services.  Accordingly, the Minister requests the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(iii) carriage is provided for passengers on a pre-booked basis following a flexible route with varied stops with a specified geographical area, and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment seeks to add a third definition to section 2(<i>c</i>).  Amendment No. 7 relates to Part 2, the core of the Bill, dealing with the new licensing system.  Hopefully, at long last we will have a coherent, regulated licensing system for buses and it will end the effects of the scandalous lethargy of the Governments of the past 13 years.  I seek for the granting of licences such that a licence shall specify the route and that the public bus passenger service should follow the commencement and completion points of the service and any stopping points along that route.</P>
        <P>The rationale behind amendment No. 7 is related to the licensing of a flexible routed or demand responsive services such as those described in amendment No. 1.  They already operate as part of the rural transport network programme in Ireland and many other countries.  The <Col N="24"/>UK operates the Public Service Vehicles (Registration of Local Services) Amendment Regulations 2004.  This allows for the registration and route licensing of several flexible services.  These include a many to one service, picking up individual passengers from a location specified by them and taking them to a single fixed destination; a one to many service, the above service in reverse; and a many to many service offering maximum flexibility and picking up passengers from various locations on demand and taking them to disparate destinations within a defined operational area on demand.  That is also the transport rationale for amendment No. 2.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7, a related amendment, is proposed because demand is very difficult to measure.  The point of the amendment is that it should be up to those private operators who propose new routes to devise a business plan, measure demand and put forward proposals.  The amendments are built around a structure to support the rural transport network.  I realise the Minister of State&rsquo;s party has held some discussions on the rural transport network.  The Labour Party believes it is one of the best and most valuable initiatives of the Government in the past seven or eight years.  There are now approximately 37 operators in every county, including my county of Fingal.  Some 1.3 million passengers are carried per annum.  Some 750 are employed including between 70 and 80 full time drivers.  A very fine service is offered to local rural communities, including those in the constituency of the Ceann Comhairle, to bring them to important health, school and other engagements.</P>
        <P>Recently, we proposed the rural transport network could have a vital role as part of the new Road Traffic Bill which, it appears, will proceed after Christmas.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, referred to the famous booze buses and that there should be a provision to help people get in and out of their homes and to avoid social isolation.  In amendment No. 2 I have attempted to make provision for and to give a statutory basis to the rural transport network programme.</P>
        <P>On 9 December next when the Minister is before the House and refers to the transport budget I trust we will not see the decimation of the &euro;8.5 million allocation for this service.  That would be a terrible error of Government and I urge it not make such a change.  I seek a statutory basis for this local service.  The ideal for communities in rural Ireland is to have the best possible local provision of public transport in every area of the country, a multitude of services linked up to larger providers, led by the national network of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  On Second Stage I remarked that people are entitled to a public transport service regardless of where they live.  It should be our objective that access to a local public transport system be a basic right of citizenship for people from the Beara Peninsula to the Inishowen Peninsula.  People took the initiative at local level, for which the Government has provided important funding since 2002, initially through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and latterly via the Department of Transport.  It is critical that this service be maintained.  Professor Colm McCarthy has urged that the funding for the service be removed but we are of the view that this would be a dreadful error.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 seeks to place the service on a statutory basis.  If we do not take action in respect of the matter in this Bill, we will be obliged to return to it in the future in order to ensure that proper legislation relating to rural transport is put in place.  I urge the Minister to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 7.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments.  I agree with Deputy Broughan that amendment No. 7, in particular, is important.  The key issue in this regard is the provision of transport services for those who live in isolated communities in rural and urban areas.  People in many parts of Dublin city do not have access to public transport.  I refer to individuals who <Col N="25"/>live in estates which were built during the boom and which are located some distance from rail and public bus routes.</P>
        <P>The rural transport initiative has been a huge success.  Colleagues who represent areas throughout the country are in favour of it.  When cuts are made in the budget, the unkindest cut of all that could be made would be to remove a service that is a lifeline for those &mdash; particularly those who are elderly and who do not own cars &mdash; who live in rural or isolated communities.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the point I made on Committee Stage, namely, that a number of State and semi-State transport and delivery systems operate in rural areas.  One of these is the An Post mail collection service.  An Post&rsquo;s vehicles visit rural and other isolated areas every day.  Would it not be possible for the company to adapt these vehicles or to use minibuses or mini-vans in order that the carriage of passengers might be facilitated?  This would make a great deal of sense because postal routes are predefined and An Post vehicles visit isolated and rural communities on a regular basis and are more or less always on time.</P>
        <P>I am aware that analysis is being carried out by the Government, the HSE and many other service providers.  Perhaps An Post should be included as part of that analysis. Joined-up thinking on the part of An Post and the health service could see the former&rsquo;s vehicles used to transport people to hospital.  There is duplication of services in rural areas.  For example, certain transport operators &mdash; these may or may not be funded by the State &mdash; only cater for particular types of passengers.  I am not being critical in this regard because certain people, whether they have disabilities or whatever, require dedicated transport services.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that if this amendment were accepted and if there was co-operation among the various service providers &mdash; be they voluntary, public or private operators &mdash; we could witness the creation of a more effective transport service.  The latter is, after all, the central theme of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the points and arguments put forward by both Deputies in respect of the amendments.  I also acknowledge Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s long-standing attachment to this issue.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 7 are linked in that they put forward a proposal under which pre-booked services would be the subject of the licensing system laid down in the Bill.  That system is focused on something entirely different from what is proposed in the amendments, namely, the provision of commercial bus services on dedicated routes.  The concept that people can be transported from a specified point to any location or locations determined by them has already been established in the context of both private hire and public hire services through the operation of taxis, hackneys, limousines and other forms of pre-booked services which may be unique to particular localities.  Such services do not meet the essential characteristics of actual bus routes or bus services in that they are not scheduled, they do not follow defined routes, they do not have intermediate stops along the way and, most importantly, they are not available to the general public on a separate fare basis.  Public bus services should be available on an equal footing to all members of the public and should not be the subject of prior booking.  Essentially, prior bookings amount to private hire.</P>
        <P>The amendments tabled by Deputy Broughan are well-meaning in nature and I recognise the intention behind them.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd stated, there is a broad degree of cross-party consensus with regard to the importance of bus services.  The issue of funding is exercising people&rsquo;s minds in the context of rural transport.  However, I submit that the issue of such funding is separate to the workings of the legislation before the House.  It is not the case that it is not necessary to deal with the issues to which I refer.  However, they are separate to the <Col N="26"/>architecture of the Bill, which provides for public bus services on dedicated routes and not for pre-booked services.</P>
        <P>I must reject the amendments, which fall outside the scope of and intention behind the legislation.  However, I acknowledge the points raised by the Deputies in respect of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The key point is that in two weeks&rsquo; time, and if he follows Professor McCarthy&rsquo;s advice, the Minister for Finance could use the budget to pull the rug from under the rural transport programme.  Amendment No. 7, which relates to the licensing provision in section 7, states that the rural transport service should be licensed as a bus service.  This would place the principle which underpins the rural transport service at the core of the legislation.  That service has been built up during the past six years, it is extremely valuable and all political parties have received strong representations in respect of it.  Members of the Joint Committee on Public Transport met representatives of a number of operators, such as OK Transport, West Cork Rural Transport others, and were deeply impressed with the work these operators do for their local communities.  A number of these companies to which I refer provide significant amounts of their own funding, which is also impressive.  Some of them provide up to 50% of their funding from fares they receive.</P>
        <P>By means of these amendments, the Labour Party is trying to make legislative provision in respect of the rural transport service.  If my party enters Government in the future, I would like an integrated rural transport service to be the subject of legislation in order that those who live in rural communities might be granted fundamental basic rights.  In Sweden, Norway and the UK, this matter has already been dealt with in legislation.  It would be good if the rural transport service were enshrined in legislation.  I am of the view that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 should have been taken together and if the former is not acceptable, then the latter would provide a fine alternative.</P>
        <P>While I accept his points with regard to the local services provided by hackneys, taxis, etc., I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his position.  If he does not do so, we will be obliged to return to this matter in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with many of the points made by Deputy Broughan.  However, there is an essential difference between small vehicles booked in a private capacity and buses which can accommodate nine people or more.  The national transport authority &mdash; which, under this legislation, the Dublin Transport Authority will become &mdash; could not possibly deal with the former.  I am not stating that this matter could not be addressed in some other way.  However, it does not fall within the scope of the legislation.</P>

        <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 7, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;5.&mdash;A public bus passenger service may only be provided in accordance with a contract entered into under section 48 of the Act of 2008.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Bill arises from the discussions in the D&aacute;il on the Dublin Transport Authority Act when I made the point very strongly that reform of the 1932 Road Transport Act should have been part of it but it was not.  All of these amendments seek to address the fact that the Bill is being stuck onto the Dublin Transport Authority Act and much of it does not make sense.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s key point is that many good aspects of the Dublin Transport Authority Act will not necessarily apply to the national transport authority.  The Bill will expressly allow licensing outside of Dublin without competitive tendering for routes.  I acknowledge that section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, which we opposed and asked to be deleted, allows for different systems to apply to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Nevertheless, at the core of our principles on public transport is that competitive tendering for bundles of routes, and not the licensing system which we oppose in these amendments, would allow anybody, whether Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann or a private contractor, to apply for a bundle of routes which would meet <Col N="28"/>their needs.  These could be PSO routes or a mixture of PSO and productive routes that make money.  The problem, and reason I will call a vote on this amendment, is that the core of the Bill does not allow for competitive tendering.  It allows for a sweetheart relationship between the State and Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  That is the core of our opposition to the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill will be passed with Government support.  It will not open up public transport to real competitive tendering.  A bus market can be dealt with in many ways.  I want to make it clear that we oppose complete deregulation, which would mean open season for everybody.  We do not support privatisation, where privatisation means privatising routes to specific people.  We are stating that we must have competitive tendering.  The legislation proposes a direct award system to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and we believe this is anti-competitive in that it gives a special relationship to those two companies and protects them for a period of up to five years.  The routes of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are protected for a period of up to ten years.</P>
        <P>The Minister argued that the intent of particular sections of the Bill is to allow for competitive tendering for individual routes before the five year period is completed.  We do not accept that and we argue the State should allow it immediately.  The very good reason for this is that the private sector is being excluded from these routes by the Bill for a significant period of time.  The private sector has double the amount of buses of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann together and employs thousands of people.  To allow it to compete at this stage would remove a burden from the taxpayer in terms of the money used to fund Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The figures clearly show that this year, the CIE group of companies will be subsidised by the taxpayer to an amount of up to &euro;320 million.  This is a large amount of money.  Between them, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann receive approximately &euro;100 million in subsidies.  It would make sense if people who have bought and paid for buses are allowed to go on the road and participate in competitive tendering for individual routes.  It would increase choice for consumers and create more routes.  At present, the Dublin Bus network does not meet the needs of the more than 200,000 extra households in existence in the greater Dublin area, many of which do not have a rail or public bus service.  If we really want to make changes and have an alternative choice for our citizens we should immediately allow competitive tendering throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  Dublin Bus accepts that it is ready for competitive tendering, but like St. Augustine who prayed to be made holy but not yet, does not want it to happen yet.  It wants to wait five years, which is not good enough.  We should have competition immediately.  That is the fundamental point we are making on the Bill and why we propose these amendments.</P>
        <P>The fundamental issue is that we must have choice.  Either we have real competition or we do not.  In 2000, when he was Minister for Transport, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan proposed opening the bus market to competition.  This has not happened in the past ten years and we believe it probably will not happen in the next five years, notwithstanding the arguments the Minister of State will make.  We are strongly of the view that this is going down the wrong route and protecting people who do not need to be protected.  If Dublin Bus accepts that it will be competitive in five years, there is no reason it is not competitive now.</P>
        <P>The bus market must change and issues of monopoly and lack of choice for consumers should not continue to arise.  As I stated on Second and Committee Stages, issues have arisen with regard to Dublin Bus abusing its position in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>According to correspondence received from the Department of Transport under freedom of information provisions, a private operator which had licences for certain routes found that Dublin Bus abused its market position.  When the operator started to provide its service, buses <Col N="29"/>from Dublin Bus preceded it along the route and inspectors were everywhere.  That operator has since gone out of business, with the result that the service it provided is no longer available.  We want competition in a market which is not abused by dominant players.</P>
        <P>I understand Bus &Eacute;ireann maintains a symbiotic relationship with private operators with a view to providing a better service to the public at reduced cost to the taxpayer.  However, except in the case of school transport, Dublin Bus refuses to engage private enterprises in a good business relationship.  It allows them to operate orbital routes while closing them out of cross-city routes.  The company has had it too good for too long.  Its management does not argue against competition but says it should not be introduced now.</P>
        <P>This Bill will copperfasten the unhealthy relationship between CIE companies and the Government during a period in which less money is available for subsidies.  We should be able to stand on our own two feet and State companies should compete on a level playing pitch with private enterprise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>This grouping of amendments would eviscerate the Bill.  The reforms introduced in the Bill are critical because we continue to operate under the Road Transport Act 1932 in respect of bus licensing.  That Act was introduced to protect railways in an era when bicycles and horses were the key modes of transport.  My party has problems with the Bill in regard to ensuring a level playing pitch when competition starts, which is why we cannot give it our full support.  However, I concur with the principle of replacing the chaotic free-for-all which existed heretofore with a good system of strictly regulated competition.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Transport recently heard a presentation by Citylink, which is the Irish branch of one of the largest bus transport companies in the world.  It operates a fleet of approximately 45,000 buses in China, the Far East and various European markets.  In Ireland, it illegally operated a bus link between Galway and Dublin.  It planned to operate buses every five minutes between Galway and Dublin Airport in defiance of the departmental officials who refused it a licence.  As a law breaker, the company should not perhaps have been invited before the committee in the first place.  The fact that it behaved like a privateer as if the law on transport licensing did not apply to it demonstrates the need for further legislation on strictly regulated and sustainable competition.  It was going to use the cut-throat practices that were successful in other markets to drive a well established private company and Bus &Eacute;ireann off the route.  For that reason, I cannot agree to this grouping of amendments.</P>
        <P>The system provided in this legislation for urban and interurban transport represents a reasonable compromise in many respects.  We have to pass the Bill before 3 December or we will be in breach of EU Directive 1370/2007.  That directive initiates a ten year process of gradually opening up transport markets.  The Bill recognises this in respect of Dublin Bus and, to a lesser extent, Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Officials from the Department of Transport and the Office of the Attorney General have tried to achieve a reasonable compromise in this regard.</P>
        <P>I referred on Second Stage to a major study of transport deregulation in the UK carried out by that country&rsquo;s Office of Fair Trading.  Aspects of London&rsquo;s transport market resemble the proposals made by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd but the rest of the UK has had regulated competition for the past 20 years.  The study revealed that a monopolistic situation has developed, whereby four large companies, including the one which came before the committee, split the market between them.  They rarely compete against each other and use all kinds of scams, such as exclusivity.  If competitors operate along one of their routes, they schedule their own buses five minutes prior to the competing service in order to make it impossible to establish a foothold.  They have also used other anti-competitive measures such as the salami slicing of routes, whereby they withdraw from portions of routes which service poorer areas until the relevant local authority steps in to provide a subsidy.  The scams are of such an extent that the Office <Col N="30"/>of Fair Trading referred the British transport market to the UK Competition Commission on anti-competitive grounds.  The amendments proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd could have the result of creating a similar outcome here, which would be in nobody&rsquo;s interest.  It would simply benefit one of the four large companies in question, one of which is related to the company which operates Citylink.  A monopoly would emerge similar to that which obtains in Liverpool, Hull and Middlesbrough where services are provided by one company.  The four companies in question own the system which results in private monopolies.  We must avoid such a scenario at all costs.</P>
        <P>A few days ago, I asked the Minister for information on the PSO &mdash; public service obligation &mdash; subsidy to Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail.  The figures contradict what my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, from the Fine Gael Party stated.  It is striking how consistent the subsidy has been.  As the Deputy will be aware, the subsidy to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann has been declining and is now less than it was in several years at the start of the decade.  This reduction is due to major cutbacks introduced in the April budget.</P>
        <P>The information shows that since the turn of the millennium Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail have been operating on a subsidy of approximately 27%, 12% and 42%, respectively.  Rail, as Deputies will be aware, is the most expensive mode of transport.  These figures compare favourably to subsidies provided to transport operators in other countries.  One does not find large regional operators such as Bus &Eacute;ireann operating on a subsidy of 12% in Belgium, the Netherlands or Germany.  Some of the companies operating in these countries receive subsidies of 78% and 80%.  In other words, the system in these countries is run as a public service to link communities.  None of these facts comes through in the arguments made by privateers.</P>
        <P>The most striking feature of subsidisation is that the private system I have described in the United Kingdom receives a subsidy of 33%.  The four monopolistic operators to which I referred receive a subsidy from the British Government, through its local authorities, of one third of operating costs, which is almost three times the level of subsidy provided to Bus &Eacute;ireann and in excess of that provided to Dublin Bus.  That is the reality of the so-called competition in operation in the United Kingdom for the past 20 years.  We must move carefully to ensure members of the public do not lose services and end up with a worse transport system under the guise of reform.</P>
        <P>The Deloitte report found conclusively that Bus &Eacute;ireann was a highly efficient company.  While it noted that some reforms were required in the networking of Dublin Bus &mdash; I understand reforms are under way in this area &mdash; it also noted that, by and large, the company ran a good service.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke eloquently in the debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill.  We still have economists who worked for banks telling us how to get out of the financial crisis and what measures should be taken in the budget.  Do these people not have any shame?  Having worked for the banks, their representatives have brass necks appearing on television to give advice on budget cuts.  They should cease practising their profession because they failed us and their companies.  They did not see what was coming, even though ordinary citizens saw it coming for two or three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this related to the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, because we have the same people ranting in newspaper columns about competition in bus markets, despite not knowing how bus markets operate.  They do not know, for example, that the subsidies provided to private sector companies in the United Kingdom are much higher than those provided to public service companies here.  As I <Col N="31"/>noted, without a large population, maintaining a rail service is an expensive business.  For this reason, the bulk of the CIE subsidy is provided to Irish Rail.</P>
        <P>Several operators tried to establish new services under the current system.  For example, Mr. Trevor Patten established a service known as the &ldquo;Patten Flyer&rdquo; to link D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dublin Airport.  However, under the current chaotic licensing system, this direct service, which was deeply appreciated by commuters, was not given a licence to operate on the route.  Instead, the licence was awarded to another operator, Aircoach.  My party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and other Deputies have spoken about this case, which demonstrates the chaotic nature of the current system.  The reason we are discussing this legislation is that we need to introduce a proper system to regulate competition in a sustainable manner.  Such a system would provide the best possible service to commuters and passengers.  I will not vote for Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s amendments because they would not achieve this objective.</P>
        <P>I also have a problem with one of the other amendments.  The legislation will not create a level playing pitch for all companies.  I accept, however, that in general terms the sector needs reform, as demonstrated by the case of the Patten Flyer.  We need a modern system of licensed competition.  I ask the Minister to speak to Mr. Patten and similar operators and consider the type of services he and others could or do offer.  I hope the new system will provide for a more level playing pitch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd and Broughan for their contributions.  I have rarely on Report Stage seen such a large group of amendments on varied issues that have been teased out in committee.  The fundamental amendment proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd goes to the heart of the legislation and demonstrates the key difference that divides the Fine Gael Party and Government on this matter.  The core purpose of the legislation is to protect consumers and customers.  It strikes a delicate balance between the rather extreme view articulated by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and the more reasonable view espoused by Deputy Broughan.  The legislation steers a course between these views, albeit one that veers towards the model espoused by Deputy Broughan.</P>
        <P>I propose to make a number of fundamental points on Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s position and set out the consequences of his proposal.  As a result of the Fine Gael Party proposals, all bus services, commercial and subvented, would have to be the subject of a tendering process and contract with the new national transport authority, formerly known as the Dublin Transport Authority.  The logical conclusion of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would be that the authority, rather than the operators and private companies, would have an obligation to identify new commercial bus opportunities, including bus services for once-off events such as concerts and sporting occasions.  It would not be open to the private sector to identify such opportunities if a tendering process by a national authority was required for this purpose.  For example, if a concert was announced at short notice, it would not be open to the national transport authority to establish an entire tendering process within a very short period.  This approach would not be in the interests of streamlining the bus licensing process or improving efficiencies in the delivery of services to the general public.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd seeks to expand the terms of section 48 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to cover the operation of all services, both public and private.  The section, through which contracts for public transport services are to be made, was prepared on the basis that contracts for bus services would only arise in the case of subvented services that are the subject of a public service obligation, while commercial bus services would be the subject of a bus licensing regime.  We believe that there should be both.  Competitive tendering for all would not suit Irish circumstances.  The Minister considers that this is a reasonable and very appropriate approach, and asks the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P>The abuse of a dominant position was raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  We do not want a completely unregulated free-for-all for tendering that will leave whole areas of Dublin or the rest of the country without bus services.  That is the inevitable consequence of unregulated tendering.  A regulated competitive environment is absolutely vital, be it in public transport or private transport services.  Deregulation and lack of regulation in the banking sector serves this point.  It is important to have a very competitive banking sector, but the problem started in America ten or 15 years ago, when there was total deregulation.  The last person deregulation serves is the consumer.  The provider, the bank, the dominant player in the market &mdash; these are the ultimate winners from complete deregulation.  The essence of the debate here is whether we should have total deregulation or a highly unsustainable regulated model, as espoused by Deputy Broughan.  We suggest that this Bill strikes a balance between those two extremes, because it protects the consumer, allows existing State bus operators to operate on routes which would otherwise be unviable.  We must protect these routes, but provide for competitive tendering in other areas.</P>
        <P>We do not wish to provide complete protection.  Section 52 deals with many of the issues raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on competitive tendering.  It establishes the basis for continued provision through State funding of the existing public bus and rail passenger services that are currently provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail in the greater Dublin area.  It empowers the authority to enter into direct award contracts with Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail for the provision of existing funded public bus services and rail services in the greater Dublin area.  To facilitate the making of the contracts in respect of the public bus services, section 52 establishes that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have exclusive rights to continue to operate their current funded services, subject to the grant of bus licences under the 1932 Act and future legislative changes.  These arrangements support the continued operation of services in the general public interest.</P>
        <P>The key aspect of section 52 is that the authority must enter into direct award contracts with the three companies mentioned for the services in which exclusive rights apply.  These initial contracts may only be for five years in the case of a bus service.  The contents of these contracts and the basis for maintaining them may be reviewed at any time by the DTA.  The future national transport authority will have a key role here in monitoring the contracts to ensure they are serving the public interest, and that there is no abuse of a dominant position.  The Minister will have to keep a very close eye on this in the House, through the relevant Oireachtas committees, to see if the national transport authority is really pursuing and vindicating the objectives, aims and principles set out in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 52 provides that following the expiry of the initial direct award contract, the authority can also enter into subsequent direct award contracts.  However, such contracts may only be pursued where the authority is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest, by entering into such direct awards.  What does that mean?  It means there is a statutory framework in place to protect services that would not be protected if the Fine Gael amendment were enshrined in this Act.  That allows the authority to cater for that situation.  Where the authority reviews a direct award on the grounds to which I referred, it must invite submissions from the holder of the contracts or any other interested parties, including the users of the services.  There is provision for services which the Bill seeks to protect.  In every country there is state protection of some bus services.  We want to allow a situation where that becomes somewhat more flexible in the interests of the consumer, but we also need to protect existing bus services.  Section 52 address those competitive tendering issues that were raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.</P><Col N="33"/>
        <P>The grouping of amendments means that section 5 to section 28, inclusive, would be deleted from the provisions of this Bill.  Deputy Broughan is opposed to those amendments and he made the case against them.  It is generally recognised that the Bill provides for a replacement of the 1932 Act, which suited that time but does not suit the market as it pertains at the moment.  It applies to the licensing of private bus operators and the relevant provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  The current licensing regime has long been recognised as being outmoded and in need of reform or replacement, so that it can better support the provision of modern bus services that place consumer needs at their core.  The new bus licensing regime will apply in respect of all commercial public bus services, including those provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, and which will provide for a modern set of criteria against which licence applications can be assessed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The provisions of the Bill establish a mandatory requirement for operators, such as the need to hold a licence, to comply with conditions and allow the new national transportation authority to adapt to the system to meet changing market needs.  That is a key aspect of this.  As the requirements of the consumer evolve over time and as Dublin in particular changes, the authority is empowered under the sections and the proposals in this Bill to adapt and to adopt a flexible approach.  An inflexible and very deregulated approach does not allow for flexibility over time to deal with emerging situations.  That is where I would see the real flaw in what Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is saying.</P>
        <P>Deputy Broughan claimed that the 1932 Act does not work, and while he does not agree completely with all the details of this Bill, it goes some way to dealing with the defects in the 1932 Act.  If we were to accept the Fine Gael amendments, it would blow away the centre of the Bill and would effectively allow the 1932 Act to pertain.  It is not in anybody&rsquo;s interest that this situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Ultimately, it would serve the service provider, as it does in all completely regulated markets.</P>
        <P>I would agree with the points made by Deputy Broughan in regard to the United Kingdom, where it has not worked, either by way of bundling or complete deregulation.  There is no regulation of commercial bus services in Britain and the Deputy has cited some examples in that regard which show that, ultimately, in the last mile of services, it is the consumer who suffers.</P>
        <P>The general point which the Government makes is that while there is a genuine and recognised need for reform, the Bill as proposed strikes a reasonable balance.  We are always open to suggestions as to how it can be improved but it allows that reasonable balance and, crucially, it allows for flexibility to deal with emerging issues in regard to the provision of public services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 50 in my name deals with the issue of bundling, which is dealt with in the section concerning the transfer of licences, a subject in which the Acting Chairman has an interest.  We are very nervous about the transfer of licences following our experience in the taxi industry.  As a spokesperson on transport and a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, in trying to invigilate the transport sector and the Commission for Taxi Regulation, I have seen that perhaps one of the worst features of that market is transferability, because it makes it very difficult to keep tabs on who is in the industry.  One gets a plethora of complaints from decent operators who work morning, noon and night trying to make a living in the taxi business.</P>
        <P>Looking at the issue across the industry and in the bus sector, where there is the possibility of a transfer of a licence, the licence might be for a specific period and it might be possible to review it.  However, the basic idea is that a service is operated so that commuters get a particular licensed route, for example, from Tullow, County Carlow to Dublin.  Somewhere along the line, however, the company operating the service will no longer be doing so and a separate company will have come in, with the licence being effectively transferred.  This is an area the NTA would need to watch carefully.</P>
        <P>A nightmare situation has developed in the taxi industry which should not be replicated.  On that basis, I would have liked to delete section 18.  The Minister of State may claim there could be cases where companies are in difficulty and so on &mdash; the death of a licence holder was dealt with in the previous amendment &mdash; but, in general terms, I stand over the point I have made.  This is an important issue given the difficulties in the taxi industry, with which the Acting Chairman is familiar.  I urge the Minister of State to think again about transfers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd will speak for two minutes and the Minister of State will reply for two minutes.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd will then make a final contribution, to which no one will be allowed to respond.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of this debate, I have never come across a more uninformed Minister of State.  I am not being personal.  We are talking about choice for consumers <Col N="35"/>yet he chooses to misrepresent what I said as being an extreme view and as being in favour of complete deregulation, which is untrue.  I would put the Minister of State on one side of the Berlin Wall, which featured on George Lee&rsquo;s television programme last night.  The Berlin Wall is gone.  The Minister of State is the old hat, the old thinking, the old politics, where there is no change, where he continues to sustain and maintain State companies and State monopolies, as the Labour Party does in this debate.  We are on the other side of that wall, with the new thinking, the new modern State, the new choices.</P>
        <P>There are over 1,800 private service providers of buses in this country.  They have over 6,000 buses and employ over 6,000 people yet they are cut off by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Berlin Wall and will not be able to cross it due to this legislation.  It is he who is the extremist in his backing of the &ldquo;no change&rdquo; mentality.  It is he who is backing the question of State operation or direct reward to favoured companies.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The core of the argument is whether we open it up to competition, as the late Minister, S&eacute;amus Brennan, proposed ten years ago.  Under this legislation, it will not happen for at least another five years.  That is to wait 15 years for change.  We in Fine Gael say we will change this immediately.  We will have no sweetheart deals with companies.  We will let everybody in, be they State or private, with competitive tendering and bundling for choice for consumers.  Under the Minister of State and the Labour Party, we will have no choice but more of the same.  This means that vast areas of Dublin city have no choice of bus service.  They have only the monopoly of the State companies, which is not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We fundamentally disagree with the Fine Gael position.  The Deputy says this is a charter for no change.  It is a fundamental change in our bus licensing legislation from the 1932 Act and the Transport Act 1958 to deal with the circumstances that suit Ireland.  We disagree on one basic fact, namely, if we were to accept the Fine Gael proposal, the obligation would be on the national transport authority to invite tenders in this regard.  We want competition but we want bus service operators to request licences for particular routes.  We disagree with Fine Gael in that we believe the ultimate consequence of what it is proposing is that vast parts of this city and country would be without bus services.  That is the factual position.</P>
        <P>I wish to address Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s points on section 18.  The Minister undertook to look again at this proposed amendment in the context of the possibility that a market could develop for bus licence transfers in the same manner as that experienced in respect of taxi licences <Col N="36"/>before the market was liberalised.  Taxi licences developed a value for two linked reasons.  The first was the almost total lack of growth in the number of new taxis after 1978 in virtually all areas.  The second was the expectation that there would be no future growth, which resulted from decisions made annually by the elected members of the relevant local authorities.  Those market conditions are totally lacking in the context of the licensing regime that currently applies in respect of the commercial public bus services or the proposed regime under this legislation.  The overall licensing system envisaged under this Bill will offer a far more robust approach to competition in that there is a far greater emphasis on the need to meet the demand of consumers.  Therefore, there is no basis for any expectation that the licence will give some form of exclusive protection from competition to its holder.  It is the absence of that expectation that will render moot any potential for profiteering through the sale of licences.</P>
        <P>The Minister considered strongly the points made by Deputy Broughan but because of the considerations I have just set out, he asks the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>As the proposer of the amendment, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd does not have any time limit on his final contribution.  If he is pressing his amendment, he will have to do so before we suspend at 1.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to do that.  I want to get to the core of what the Minister and I are saying.  There is a significant division of thought between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour concerning the opening of competition in our transport systems.  Deputy Broughan spoke about a State-controlled system and the Minister of State mentioned an award system for State companies to the exclusion of everybody else.  That is a fundamental part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s view and he is wrong.  The Minister of State has said that we are extreme in our view to want more people to have more choice of buses and have more people working in these companies.  That is a reasonable position and it is the Government which is extreme.</P>
        <P>I shall discuss the meaning of the Minister of State&rsquo;s position.  In 1999, the subsidy to Dublin Bus from the taxpayer was &euro;16.8 million.  In 2009, that subsidy had risen to &euro;82.4 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the percentages?  The Deputy should give us the percentages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the rise.  This means the Minister favours inefficiency in services and a lack of support or supply to people in communities.  Over 200,000 of all new homes built in the State from 2000 to 2008 were in the greater Dublin area, yet the number of buses in the Dublin fleet remained almost static.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a Government decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The number rose from 987 to 1,028.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Government decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all right, I am used to it.  In 1999, the subsidy which Bus &Eacute;ireann got from the taxpayer was &euro;7.4 million and in 2009, the subsidy went to &euro;44.9 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 12%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Essentially, the taxpayer is subsidising the CIE companies to the tune of almost &euro;127 million per annum.  In these amendments, Fine Gael is arguing that this is <Col N="37"/>not good enough.  The spectrum of control in the bus market is now going from the State operation which we currently have to a direct award system for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has been absent from the Chamber due to issues outside his control, but I should clarify that Fine Gael has never favoured a deregulated market.  I refute absolutely the comments from the Minister of State who has just left.  We have never favoured such a market and we will not.  We favour the tendering of individual routes or bundles of routes to competing operators, with such bundles including a mix of profitable and social routes.</P>
        <P>The advantages in this method of tendering and running our public transport system are that such a system is designed to maximise the benefits of competition in a market while seeking to protect the public interest in terms of route coverage, safety standards and possible price controls.  In essence, the regulator would define the routes or bundles of routes on which the participants in the market must bid for the right to operate.</P>
        <P>In general, such bundles would be geographically cohesive in order to maximise scale efficiencies to the operator and would attempt to balance profitable and social routes.  In the case of individual routes, the tender could range from concession charges paid by operators for the privilege of operating profitable routes to route-specific subsidies received by operators to compensate for the cost of operating social routes.</P>
        <P>That is at the heart of what the people of this country want and this debate.  The Fine Gael position is exceptionally clear; it is open, fair, balanced and competitive above all else.  It gives the best deal for the taxpayer and provides the greatest choice at the lowest cost.  It provides a bus for the consumer and unlike Deputy Broughan, we do not care if that bus is red, white or blue as long as it is there on time, fares are competitive and the taxpayer is exposed to the least amount of expense in providing that bus.</P>
        <P>What could be fairer than giving the choice to compete for routes to Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and the private operators, of which there are over 6,000?  Private operators have twice the number of buses in CIE companies and they cost the taxpayer nothing.  Choice is fundamental.</P>
        <P>This Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to reform a Bill from 1932 &mdash; decades ago &mdash; but it has been rushed through the D&aacute;il to meet the deadline on 3 December.  If the Minister and his Government were serious about reforming the bus market and change, this legislation would have been introduced when the Dublin Transport Authority Bill was initially introduced to the D&aacute;il over a year ago.  At that time I said to the Minister that we needed a national transport authority and not just the Dublin Transport Authority.  It did not happen and we now have a timetable with a very short period in which changes will happen.</P>
        <P>The main beneficiaries of the legislation will be the CIE companies and those who will be disadvantaged are the consumer looking for choice, competition and reduced fares, and the taxpayer.  That is the issue in a nutshell.  The truth is out and the arguments are clear for all to see.  The divide is clear between those who do not want change or say that it might happen in five years and those of us in Fine Gael who argue for immediate change.  The people want such change and they will not put up with the current arrangements.</P>
        <P>Recently, the rail line between Drogheda and Dublin was damaged with the collapse of the Malahide viaduct and this brought a complete change in public transport.  People had the train before but they do not have the buses now which they really want.  Using the bus was quicker and more efficient because it gets to the city more quickly.  On the line between Drogheda and Dublin there are eight points where speed reductions are employed despite the millions spent on it.  Commuters want a seat if they can get one; they will get it on the bus but they are not guaranteed one on the train.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>There is much new thinking on this and it is one of the good things to emerge from what could have been one of the worst ever tragedies in Malahide.  People are thinking again and considering using the bus.  Buses are now believed by many people in my area to be the best form of transport.  They think it is the most efficient and reliable, given what has happened.  It is amazing to think that despite millions of euro in investment, the train is no quicker now than it was 30 years ago.</P>
        <P>The fundamental point in this legislation is a lack of proposed change.  It is more of the same State control and East German thinking.  A programme on television last night showed how thinking changed fundamentally when the Berlin Wall fell.  We want the Berlin Wall in public transport to end and we want choice and competition.  I could go on <i>ad nauseam</i> about this but there is a core argument.  If we are paying &euro;127 million per annum in subvention for two bus companies and providing them with a sweetheart deal for the next five years, notwithstanding section 52 or 58, is that good or bad for the consumer?  Is it good or bad for the taxpayer?  I believe it is bad.  That is the reason I am pressing these amendments to a vote.  We need massive change, but we are not going to get it in the legislation.  Between 1932 and now we have had no change.  This legislation is now being rushed through the D&aacute;il at the last minute, and we are being warned of the alternatives if it is not passed, alternatives that make no sense at all because they fail to go to the core of the issue, the change that is so urgently needed in our country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides, consolidates and updates broadcasting legislation.  Part 8 of this Act replaces and updates the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, which provided for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.  Under the 2009 Act, RTE continues to have responsibility for the provision of a national free to air digital terrestrial television system with capacity to carry RTE <Col N="40"/>1, Network 2, TG4 and TV3.  This new service will eventually replace the existing analogue terrestrial television service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislation also requires the newly established Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to provide for the development of commercial DTT services.  The BAI, which is an independent regulatory authority, is responsible under the 2009 Act for the licensing and competition issues raised by the Deputies.  In this regard, a competition for commercial multiplexes was initiated by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, in 2008 under the 2007 Act and is still ongoing.  The contract has been offered to the One Vision consortium.  The BAI has taken over the role of the BCI in finalising this competition.  While I have no direct control over or function in these matters, I am concerned on policy grounds to see an early agreement on the provision of commercial DTT services and an early time path for the implementation of such agreement.  My policy objective is the achievement of the earliest switch-off of the analogue system, thereby realising valuable spectrum to enable Ireland to reap the benefits of the digital dividend.</P>
        <P>With regard to the roll-out of DTT services, I am informed by RTE that, to date, 13 sites have been DTT enabled to accommodate both the single free to air DTT multiplex and also three commercial DTT multiplexes.  This represents the most difficult and costly element of the build plan, as it includes the main transmitter sites in Ireland.  It also involves replacing several of these masts to accommodate the commercial multiplexes.  With regard to the timing of the roll-out of the free to air DTT service, the legislation provides that RTE must provide a full national DTT service by the end of 2011 or such later date as I decide.  RTE has not yet set a date for launching the free to air DTT service but has indicated a preference for launching in parallel with a commercial DTT operator as the availability of commercial DTT is important to assist RTE in getting a return on its investment and to ensure adequate viewer choice in the digital era.</P>
        <P>Regarding the target date for switching off the analogue terrestrial television services, the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for me to establish a date or dates for analogue switch off, after consultation with RTE and the BAI, on, among other things, the availability of digital television services in the country, the availability of suitable televisions and other receivers and the take up of these services.  I am in close contact with the BAI and RTE on progress in these areas.  The European Commission has set 2012 as the timeline for analogue switch off throughout Europe and recent papers from the European Commission are requesting that member states should endeavour to adopt 1 January 2012 as the target date.  I consider that it is in the best interests of Ireland to switch off the analogue services in 2012.  In this regard, I have established a group to advise me on planning for analogue switch off and I expect to report on this in the first quarter of 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To say the Minister&rsquo;s attitude towards this issue has been lethargic is an understatement.  The response when I tabled the same question on 13 October was more or less the same with a few slight amendments, which do not offer anything new.  We do not know whether licences will be auctioned or will be granted on a roll-over basis and we do not know anything about the spectrum allocation generally, which also needs to be addressed by the Minister in the context of the renewal of existing licences.  Since the Boxer consortium pulled out of the process for the commercial provision of DTT services on a multiplex structure that RTE was to provide through its network, there has been little or no progress.  The Minister said negotiations are ongoing between One Vision and RTE on the one hand and One Vision and the BAI on the other.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister please outline some dates in order that people&rsquo;s attention can be focused and a target date is ensured by which the switch off of the analogue service will be facilitated? <Col N="41"/> Does the Minister agree with RTE that a free to air multiplex service should be launched at the same time as the three commercial multiplexes, which, hopefully, One Vision will provide?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, have been deeply frustrated about the delays.  It is not a lack of ambition or intention on my part that has delayed the process.  However, a process is set out in the 2007 Act, which was adopted by the 2009 Act, and we must follow it.  The process will comprise a free to air service and the commercial multiplex.  The contractual arrangements for the multiplex must be negotiated between the BAI and the commercial operator and between the operator and RTE regarding the transmission network.  Earlier this year, I indicated when the Boxer consortium failed that I was confident the second choice in the BAI process would get up and running.  I had expected that the contractual arrangements would be much clearer by early autumn and it is deeply frustrating that the process has not led to a result.  I cannot have direct control over this.  I must be careful not to interfere with a process set out in legislation, but I have concerns about the delays and all parties should be aware of this.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s two questions, I have said to all the parties at each stage that the 2012 deadlines still holds.  There is an urgency for us in switching off our analogue system to use the released spectrum for alternative uses, particularly in the broadband sector.  That is an imperative and I am still looking to implement that deadline.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s second question related to whether it is best to launch a unified single service.  That is the preferred solution but if we cannot achieve a satisfactory outcome in the current process and it cannot deliver something that is commercially viable for the operator, which meets the requirements set out in legislation, we will have to examine alternatives and we will find a solution that meets our objectives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not inspiring confidence.  I would like clarity on the deadline.  The EU Commission has made it clear that the aim is to have analogue switched off by 1 January 2012 but the Minister has referred to 2012 in such a way as to imply this could happen some time that year and, therefore, this could happen at the end of the year.  Were that the case, Ireland would be at a great disadvantage because the EU is moving ahead to ensure the exploitation of the digital dividend is realised for the economic benefit of those who can avail of it.  There is an urgency, therefore, about this matter.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aiming to meet the deadline of 1 January 2012?  What will be the nature of this process?  The Minister is a key player, not a spectator.  Will this process go on indefinitely or will a timeframe be set?  Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe, the chief executive officer of the BAI, stated in the newspapers in September, &ldquo;Next month will be critical&rdquo;.  Next month in that context was October but it is almost December now.  Were the critical actions taken in October or are we in a stasis, with no progress being made?  What are the stumbling blocks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would aim for the 1 January deadline if we could make it.  When we have our system up and running, the switch off may give a commercial advantage.  It may help the market to deliver but I cannot commit to this because we do not know yet.  We have not signed off on the contractual arrangements for the commercial multiplexes.  That is a deadline I will look to achieve but if it does not happen by 1 January, it will happen during 2012.  There are complexities in that we will seek to co-ordinate our switch off with Northern Ireland for a variety of reasons.  It will lead to much greater efficiencies in the transmission network and so on and the Northern Ireland authorities may not be ready for that date.  We will have to negotiate that but we can only do so when we have a clear indication as to what platform will deliver the alternative television service to run that system.</P>
        <P>I share the frustration with the delay.  Negotiations are continuing.  There have been extensive negotiations between RTE and the consortium but also between the Broadcasting Authority <Col N="42"/>of Ireland and the consortium.  As I am not party to the negotiations I cannot give details of them.  I understand they deal with transmission costs, the nature of the consortium and how it is putting its own programme together.  It is frustrating that the negotiations are taking so long.  If it is not possible for us to achieve an outcome in this area the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, must, by proper legal means, set its own deadlines with regard to how we move on to alternative solutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister likes to paint himself as a helpless observer who is frustrated like the rest of us.  He is the Minister.  He has powers within the legislation to set timelines and deadlines.  What happens, for example, if OneVision pulls out, as Boxer did last spring?  We would have to start from scratch again.  We warned about this in the spring when we said we were concerned about OneVision&rsquo;s capacity to deliver.  The Minister said he had full confidence it would happen.  He also said RTE was required to produce free-to-air digital services by the end of this year, and not by the end of 2010.  He said RTE would be required to proceed with free-to-air digital television regardless of whether there was a commercial element to the multiplexes or not.  I disagreed with the Minister on that point at that time.  He has now changed his position.  He says the preference is to launch the free-to-air and commercial multiplex services at the same time because the only way to get people to buy into the switch-over is to give them something new.</P>
        <P>The thing is drifting along and the Minister is not taking a grip of it.  He is allowing someone else to deal with the problem.  He has a legal obligation and the power to set timelines.  Will he set a time within which OneVision, RTE and the BAI must come to an agreement, after which he will change the rules and find a different way to roll out digital terrestrial television, DTT, in Ireland?  He needs to do that.  Otherwise we will continue to drift and the deadline will continue to move beyond 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is up to the Minister to set a timeframe.  He is not convincing in saying the BAI should take total control, even if it is the negotiating body.  </P>
        <P>The Minister now says it will be up to the BAI to look at alternatives.  He is the Minister responsible.  Can he outline his Department&rsquo;s view of the alternatives available if the current negotiations are not successful?  Everyone knows about the disagreement about the tariff and this does not engender confidence.  Clearly, the Minister has looked at options.  Can he outline them, as well as outlining the timeline for the conclusion of the process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to whether RTE should already have switched from analogue to DTT, we deliberately changed the legislation to give us flexibility in this regard and not to impose a legal requirement on RTE to switch off at the end of this year.  I thought about the matter and considered it better to give a certain flexibility.  This was fortunate in the event of what has happened, that is, a delay in the process, which no one wanted.  </P>
        <P>The Deputies seem to be saying that if the process is not working we should change the rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Minister should set a timeframe and only change the rules if the parties cannot get things done in that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister raised the matter of changing rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One must be very careful in that regard.  When one is in a commercially contractual and legally binding process one cannot change rules half way through.  </P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I am far from satisfied with the timelines that have evolved.  That is a clear indication to the BAI that we need to seek resolution one way or the other.  If we fail to reach a solution by one route, having gone through the proper legal process and procedures which are fair to all parties, we will find a resolution by other means.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the timescale?  The Minister will not set one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I want a timescale which meets the objective of our being able to switch off in 2012.  That is a very urgent timescale because it takes time to set up any alternative or new DTT service.  The masts are built, by and large.  </P>

        <P>The introduction of the national bio-fuel obligation next year will underpin delivery of the national bio-fuel target and will take full account of EU bio-fuels legislation.  Priority drafting of the required legislation is currently being finalised.  The national bio-fuels obligation will also integrate the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on the sustainability criteria as soon as these are finalised.  Under the obligation fuel suppliers will be legally required to include an average of 4% bio-fuels in their overall annual fuel sales.  The obligation will create a long-term guaranteed market of scale to allow the Irish bio-fuel industry certainty for the development of the sector.  The obligation therefore will act as an incentive for bio-fuel producers.</P>
        <P>The bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief schemes have already supported the development of indigenous production.  The schemes have resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief from 2005.  Since the excise relief schemes were introduced there has been a steady increase in bio-fuels used in Ireland, albeit from a very low base.  Prior to the introduction of the schemes, market penetration of bio-fuels was almost non-existent.  In 2007, penetration was 0.6% and in 2008 penetration had risen to 1.6%.  I am advised that it will be in excess of 2% this year.  There <Col N="44"/>have been at least five bio-fuel plants constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the schemes.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the bio-fuel obligation in 2010 will, through the creation of a guaranteed market demand, provide the Irish bio-fuel sector with the certainty it needs to invest in new infrastructure.  It will therefore underpin the development of economically sustainable production of bio-fuels in Ireland.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The trading of certificates under the scheme, will also act as an incentive for Irish producers.  For each litre of bio-fuel sold in the market a certificate will be issued by the National Oil Reserves Agency as the administrator of the scheme.  Certificates will also be subject to verification by sellers to demonstrate that they meet the sustainability criteria.  Bio-fuel obligation certificates may be traded among registered operators.  I am confident tradability of these certificates will enable small indigenous producers, in particular, to enter the market and develop their businesses.</P>

	<P>I agree with the setting of targets for the blending of bio-fuels with petrol and diesel.  However, to do so in the absence of a plan to promote the bio-fuel industry in Ireland is a mistake.  The Minister has done half the job.  He has not provided a plan to deliver significant bio-fuel production in the domestic market.  Importing ethanol or bio-fuel from Brazil or other parts of the world does nothing for energy security.   </P>
        <P>How many of the 18 projects for which the Minister&rsquo;s Department provided excise relief have resulted in bio-fuel production in Ireland?  How many resulted in bio-fuel factories or production facilities in Ireland?  The Minister says 2% of our fuel this year will be bio-fuel.  This is about 110 million litres.  How much of that is produced in Ireland?</P>
        <P>How many planning permissions have been granted for bio-fuel production facilities, which will have to provide a 4% bio-fuel content in petrol and diesel?  That will be the equivalent of approximately 220 million litres going into our cars, trucks and so on.  How much of that will come from Irish production facilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will give some further detail on what has been produced to date under the scheme.  Of approximately 67 million litres of bioethanol, 55% was imported, of 103 million litres of EN590, approximately 50% was imported, of 5.5 million litres of pure plant oil, 7% was imported and of 4.5 million of captive fleets, 3% was imported.  These are the figures I have.</P>
        <P>In terms of how this will work, we are keen and intent on developing an Irish bio-fuels industry using home sourced crops, whether second generation bio-fuels, cereal, beet or rape seed oil or waste products, which can deliver Irish fuels.  First and foremost, we must see how the European sustainability criteria will work.  I believe they may give a real benefit to Irish produced material which will meet the requirements in terms of emissions reductions and not seeing the chopping down of rain forests or the change in land use problems which are there with imported bio-fuels.  They will give us a real opportunity to promote home-grown bio-fuels and are due to come out at roughly the same time as our legislation will be brought before the House, hopefully early in the new year.  That will give us time to set up this scheme, get it working and adjust accordingly to promote Irish bio-fuel producers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="45"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome what the Minister said in terms of recognising the problems of importing large quantities of bio-fuel, whether that is producing ethanol by cutting down rain forests or even the madness of transporting ethanol half way around the world and the carbon footprint that entails.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister try to ensure in the legislation that all of the power is not in the oil companies&rsquo; hands to simply source the bio-fuel they require to meet the criteria as cheaply as possible and, therefore, force competition between Irish bio-fuel companies and companies half way around the world?  When putting the legislation together, we must positively discriminate in favour of producing bio-fuels domestically and require oil companies to source bio-fuels locally; otherwise, the bio-fuels plan is a waste of time, commercially and environmentally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will do everything we can to support the home generation of bio-fuels but subject to world trade rules.  We cannot breach world trade rules, put in conditions which will result in difficulties under GATT and other arrangements and then have to reverse engines.  More than anything, we need to create a stable market and a stable environment in which people can start to develop alternative bio-fuels products.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of institutional supports, programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.</P>
        <P>I am working closely with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure a fully cohesive approach across Government to energy affordability.  The interdepartmental-agency group led by my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs is drawing up an affordable energy strategy in line with the renewed programme for Government.  The strategy will set out existing and future plans to tackle energy affordability.  It is the intention to publish the strategy for public consultation before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The warmer homes scheme is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  The scheme is the primary mechanism for alleviating the key underlying cause of fuel poverty, namely, thermal inefficiency of houses.  Some &euro;20 million has been provided for the scheme in 2009, which includes &euro;5 million provided by the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>This level of funding is enabling structural improvements in at least 15,000 vulnerable homes by the end of 2009.  This includes 2,000 homes benefiting from the ESB&rsquo;s home insulation scheme which operates alongside the warmer home scheme.  The very significant upscaling of the scheme this year underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing energy affordability.  Some 5,343 homes were retrofitted under the warmer homes scheme in 2008.  So far this year, 14,248 homes have benefited under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The most recent research figures available on the numbers at risk of fuel poverty are set out in the national energy efficiency action plan.  It reflects the analysis published in November <Col N="46"/>2008 by the Economic and Social Research Institute on fuel poverty in Ireland.  The ESRI uses various methods for calculating the extent of fuel poverty.  These include the expenditure method or share of income spent on fuels and the subjective assessment by occupants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ESRI estimates that using the expenditure method, 300,000 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty in 2008 at a time of particularly high Irish energy prices.  Using the subjective method, 68,000 or 4.6% of households reported that they could not afford to heat their homes adequately in 2006.  Enhancing the energy efficiency of homes through structural improvements is pivotal to the Government&rsquo;s strategy to address energy affordability.</P>
        <P>The fuel poverty action research project was established by Combat Poverty and Sustainable Energy Ireland.  The project was an<i> ex post </i>assessment of the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the warmer homes scheme.</P>
        <P>The report was initially scheduled to be completed in 2008 but its completion was delayed due to the loss of key data.  A draft report was circulated in August to members of the research community for comment.  Publication of the final report, which has recovered the relevant data, is expected before next month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the reply, although I am disappointed to say it was very similar to one I received to a previous parliamentary question.  Will he confirm that essentially what he said was that he does not know how many people live in fuel poverty and that the research report and his strategy have not been published?  He has nothing new to tell us even though the situation in terms of overall poverty is very serious.  Despite the fact that there has been enormous economic growth in recent years, we have one of the highest excess mortality rates in Europe.</P>
        <P>The Minister has no clear strategy in place to which we can refer and support, as we would like to do, to deal with fuel poverty once and for all, especially at a time when so many people who are out of work have skills in the construction trade.  It is important that he gives us some idea as to his approach.  He must be aware that the warmer home scheme does not relate to social housing which is the largest area where people are living in fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>We now have the added experience of flooding.  Inevitably, people&rsquo;s whose property has been flooded will have much greater energy bills as a result of dealing with the effects of flooding.  What strategy will be in place for them?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify that Government policy and not Green Party policy in regard to carbon tax is to ring fence the money accruing in order to provide for greater energy efficiency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am reporting good news.  The warmer home scheme has been ramped up.  When I came into office more than two years ago, approximately 2,000 homes were being done but now approximately 15,000 homes are being done.  It is targeting those most at risk, in particular older people whom we need to keep warm in winter.  It makes a transformational difference to houses if the proper insulation is put in.  Some 15,000 homes are being done per year which has a significant effect.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had a budget of &euro;20 million to target social housing, which needed to be targeted.  On a house by house basis, the energy performance of social housing is being improved.  That is in addition to the increase we were able to give in very difficult budgetary times in the fuel allowance by extending the weeks to which it applies and increasing the amount.  We have taken various measures in the past year which have real effect and are keeping people warm and alive.</P><Col N="47"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We need, however, to go further.  This is the best investment we can make in terms of preparing us for future higher energy prices and to help cut down our emissions.  With the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science, who has invested similarly in insulation schemes, we are looking to continue that investment and to extend it further as part of an integrated fuel poverty strategy.  That will have particular relevance as carbon tax is introduced, although I cannot go into the budget details in advance of 9 December.  The scale of the investment we are making was brought home to me recently.  The packages introduced by my Department and the Departments of Education and Science and Environment, Heritage and Local Government in last year&rsquo;s budget were the equivalent of more than &euro;100 million.  The American stimulus plan is the equivalent of approximately &euro;400 million in the same area.  At least our ambition and spend in that area is of a scale that matches anything that has been done in other countries.  However, it is not ambitious enough and we have to extend and expand it, particularly in the area of social housing where people are more vulnerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has no problem commenting on this area.  A recent headline states &ldquo;Gormley insists carbon levy in budget will be revenue neutral&rdquo;.  The Minister might explain how the Minister, Deputy Gormley, can speak out but he cannot.  He might clarify the position because there is a great deal of confusion.</P>
        <P>On social housing, will the Minister accept that it is not good enough to wait for casual vacancies to arise?  The number of casual vacancies that arise are rare now because very few houses are being built and people cannot afford to move out of social housing.  The Minister has to think of a new approach.  External insulation is an obvious one, but there are probably other arrangements.  The problem will not be dealt on the basis of waiting for casual vacancies to arise.</P>
        <P>Will there be targets in this strategy that will address the problem in this area?  It is all very well to have 1,500 houses, but fuel poverty will not be dealt with unless the scale is ramped up considerably.  Will there be a timeframe for the implementation of the strategy or will it simply amount to aspirational proposals, which we have read about and heard previously from the Minister, which no longer meet the needs in this area, as more and more people struggle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of 1,500 houses represents action rather than aspirations.  I agree with the Deputy that in terms of social housing, we have to consider some of the technologies we have developed.  In the home energy scheme we have introduced the exterior insulation for particular support.  I agree with the Deputy that such technology can be of particular use in regard to social housing.  It can be applied to an apartment building and result in a significant reduction in energy use of the building without the need to disrupt the internal workings of the building or to require people to leave their homes.  I agree with her that this is an area where we should ramp up our work and in which we should invest, having learned from the experience we have gained in recent years.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that poor broadband provision has been identified as a critical issue preventing job creation in the mid-west region; when MANs schemes lying idle underground in Roscrea and Templemore in County Tipperary will be connected; when there will be direct connectivity and competitive backhaul cost to Dublin and <Col N="48"/>accelerated investment in next generation network broadband, which is crucial for North Tipperary companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[43462/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The widespread provision of broadband services is a priority for the Government.  My Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to address the provision of broadband throughout the country, including the mid-west region.  These initiatives include the national broadband scheme, NBS; the metropolitan area networks, MANs, programme; the broadband for schools programme, which is being evolved into a 100 megabits per second, Mbps, to post-primary schools programme; and the now concluded group broadband scheme, GBS.</P>
        <P>Under the NBS the Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of broadband services to rural areas, many of which do not currently have any broadband service. The company 3 is required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS coverage area and which seek a service.  The NBS will provide broadband services in many areas in the mid-west, including north Tipperary.</P>
        <P>The company 3 is progressing its network roll-out and services have gone live in a number of areas.  The entire NBS area will be covered by September 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the MANs programme, 86 MANs covering 92 towns, including Roscrea and Templemore, have been completed and elnet has been appointed as the management services entity, MSE, to manage, maintain and operate the MANs.  The MANs are fibre based, open access networks, which will facilitate the provision of high speed broadband.  The uptake of this infrastructure will depend on the level of demand in particular towns but it does represent a valuable enhancement of the infrastructure in relevant towns.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is expected that the Roscrea and Templemore MANs will be taken over by elnet in quarter one of 2010.  Between now and the time that the Roscrea and Templemore MANs are handed over to elnet, both MANs are available to service providers through an interim MSE which was appointed to manage and operate the phase II MANs.  All the services providers using the MANs are aware of these interim arrangements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lighting of both MANs and interconnection to other networks is a matter for elnet and the relevant services provider under the terms of the MSE concession agreement.  The Government strongly supports investment in high speed backhaul networks by service providers.  I am also advancing the one stop shop proposal which, by facilitating access to State-owned ducting, should improve the quality and speed of backhaul networks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I note he said such provision was a priority.  I have been listening to that since I was elected to this House two and a half years ago.  The time for sermonising and high rhetoric has long since passed.  The Minister should learn from the old saying we often use in the country, namely, that actions speak louder than words.  He mentioned there were 86 MANs in the country.  Can he advise how many of them are connected and in operation at present?  What is happening under phase III of MANs in the case of towns such as Thurles where there is no MAN system.  Forf&aacute;s has said that despite recent progress &ldquo;Ireland continues to lag behind competitor regions in range, speed and cost of broadband&rdquo;, and it includes Dublin in that respect.  I ask the Minister to confirm or deny that he and his Government are discriminating against rural Ireland and the mid-west region in particular, as was stated by the chief executive of the agency recently, when he said in a briefing that the strongest and most serious impediment to creating jobs and to maintaining <Col N="49"/>existing jobs in the mid-west region was the lack of a decent broadband service.  A direct international dial-up service is not available in the region.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the quarter to 2010.  </P>
        <P>In regard to the comments about neglecting north Tipperary, we invested some &euro;80 million in the national broadband scheme to do the exact opposite of what the Deputy has said, namely, to make sure there is coverage across the country.  There are some 50 electoral districts in Tipperary, which are covered by the national broadband scheme to make sure that services are delivered that would not be provided by the market.</P>

	<P>When will that happen?</P>

	<P>We have set up and designed the schools scheme &mdash; the 100 megabits per second broadband to which I referred &mdash; with the purpose of ensuring that where the market has not delivered we will intervene and put high speed broadband networks in place, which would not only connect our schools but would make it easier to connect the other businesses in the same area.

We have not finished there, we have given a commitment in the new programme for Government to bring that high speed system to every secondary school by 2012.</P>
        <P>We will continue to evolve the MANs system because it is starting to work.  It is a long-term investment that will take time to light up but it is the right investment.  We are seeing that as more and more companies start to use it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s personal commitment, but the reality is that broadband is not freely available in rural Ireland.  When I speak about rural Ireland, I am talking about provincial towns like Naas or Nenagh.  Many people do not have access to broadband.  We want a definite timeframe for its delivery and a commitment to do so by the Government and Minister.  The Minister has demonstrated a lack of commitment and interest.  He does not even know what networks are working and what ones are not working.  We want a broadband connection across rural Ireland and the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to deliver that.  Time is running for the Minister as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The national broadband scheme is working.  It is delivering services to areas week by week that would not otherwise have had coverage.  We will go further than that.  My officials are in Brussels today with the European Commission to work through arrangements as to how we will go beyond the national broadband scheme to provide that any further houses that cannot be covered for local reasons are covered by way of European support under the stimulus package to ensure that every house will have access to broadband.  We are at the point where 65% plus of our houses have broadband connection.  Some 70% of households have a computer.  We must develop this technology in our schools, health system and businesses so that it becomes commonplace.  However, to allow this to take place one must ensure there is ubiquitous coverage.  That is why my Department entered into very complex and detailed contractual arrangements with 3 Ireland to provide these services and that is why we have reverted to the European Commission so that we can go further.  We are determined to cover every house in the country.  Having done so we will continue to work to roll out broadband services.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he will comment on the reported deal between companies (details supplied) for satellite services; the number of households he expects to be provided with satellite broadband; if this number has changed since the announcement of the national broadband scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The national broadband scheme contract guarantees that broadband connectivity will be available to all of the buildings within the NBS coverage areas.  In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very costly and technologically challenging to reach using standard infrastructure, a limited number of residences and businesses in the NBS coverage area might be covered by a satellite service.</P>
        <P>The NBS contract defines specific thresholds and circumstances under which satellite can be deployed and allows for a maximum of 8% of residences and businesses to be served utilising satellite technology.  3 Ireland anticipates the actual deployment of satellite will be approximately 5% of residences and businesses within the NBS coverage area.  It is a matter for the NBS service provider, 3 Ireland, to decide where a satellite solution will be deployed, provided that the overall number of residences and businesses served by satellite does not exceed thresholds defined at a county level and for the NBS as a whole.  As a commercial matter, 3 Ireland has entered into a contract with two satellite providers on a non-exclusive basis for the provision of the NBS satellite service.  I understand that Avanti is one of these companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply.  This raises issues concerning the standard, quality, speed and cost of broadband.  There is a danger that because the Minister wants to say he is providing universal coverage the service he will provide will not be acceptable.  A business woman in my constituency has satellite broadband but she finds that because of the time delays it is totally inappropriate and almost useless and she cannot access corporate networks.</P>
        <P>The other complaint I received relates to schools which have satellite at present.  The service is completely inadequate.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to trumpet that schools will have good systems in place when small rural schools depend on satellite.  He must accept a basic standard should apply across the board rather than simply dealing with numbers.  Irish Rural Link has stated some 12,000 households are not within the national broadband scheme.  What is happening to these?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will outline some of the standards set within the national broadband scheme.  Satellite services must provide a 1 megabit download and 128 kilobyte upload speed, with a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, a round trip latency of 800 milliseconds and an 11 gigabyte, ten down and one up inclusive monthly allowance limit.  These are technical details.  As the technology develops we intend to continue to upgrade it and improve standards.  I understand from talking to people in the industry that improvement in satellite provision continues.  Undoubtedly, there have been difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There are difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="52"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;including slow or latent problems, in some of the schools referred to by the Deputy.  However, technology is developing and we are determined to continue to push for the highest possible standard within the available support schemes.</P>
        <P>I refer to the 12,000 houses which may be in electoral districts that cannot be covered by the NBS due to market distortion factors that would come into play.  We contacted the European Union in respect of a stimulus package which provides for the development of rural broadband schemes as part of the agriculture and rural development programme.  We seek to put in place a scheme to provide services largely by satellite.  However, we will not rule out other technological solutions for those houses and our intention is that no house is left behind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister saying to the 12,000 people not covered by the NBS and who cannot access broadband at the moment?  Is he saying they should wait and see what the Minister produces in terms of negotiations with the European Commission?  Many such people come to offices such as mine and ask if they should spend &euro;500 or &euro;700 in capital investment on installing a satellite dish in their houses, such that they can receive satellite broadband.  Should they wait for a national broadband scheme type solution that will help with the costs?  What is the Minister saying to such people in terms of the timescale for a decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Our policy is working in terms of providing for a range of platforms.  I have deliberately set out a process whereby&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What should the 12,000 people without broadband do now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;through competition and collaboration, evolving technological solutions are available, not only through satellite but also through WiMax and mobile broadband.  This is a changing landscape due to the competitive forces at play.  We must recognise some houses in this competitive landscape will not be provided with services.  We have approached the European Commission and indicated we wish to avail of the rural development scheme for broadband.  We wish to provide a scheme for such broadband applications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>When can we expect that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We expect it will be in place next year and rolled out at that stage.  I cannot give a specific time because I do not wish to give a commitment until the matter is cleared completely with the European Commission.  However, we are working flat out on the issue and it will be part of a range of measures put in place to secure ubiquitous coverage and the availability of faster speeds, which we will need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the problems encountered by schools.  I refer to one school in particular in which the principal has indicated it takes a full school day to upload three or four photographs onto the website.  That is the poor standard at issue, in case he gets carried away with technical detail.</P>
        <P>I refer specifically to the national broadband scheme.  A supplier is reported to have trouble providing sufficient capacity to meet the needs of users.  If there are additional users who seek to avail of satellite services, is the Minister convinced the capacity will be in place to meet the need?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard no details of capacity problems as such.  However, one of the benefits of the national broadband scheme is certain standards must be complied with for State support to be triggered.  We can guarantee quality in this way.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="53"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in the case of one of the suppliers which has already done a deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy has information, she may wish to pass it to me.  The analysis carried out by the Department indicates the scheme is meeting its targets in terms of roll-out, which is not easy.  There are many planning difficulties and people hold concerns throughout the country about the deployment of masts and so on.  However, the companies are working to meet these deadlines and to meet the standards, whether for satellite or mobile solutions, to provide the minimum service standards set out in the contractual arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Minister investigates that matter.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 55 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has statutory responsibility for grid connection offers and for oversight of EirGrid&rsquo;s grid connection process.  Currently, there is in the region of 1,400 MW, of renewable generation capacity connected to the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  Approximately 100 individual windfarms have been connected with a combined capacity of approximately 1,100 MW.  Some 240 MW of hydro-power are connected.  The balance represents biomass plant, mainly landfill gas.</P>
        <P>The contribution from renewable energy connected to the electricity grid is increasing very steadily from year to year.  Renewable generation contributed 12.2% of all electricity consumed in 2008 compared to just 4.4% in 2003.  Ireland is on schedule to achieve the 15% target for 2010 and must meet the 40% target set for 2020.  It is worth recording that on Thursday, 19 November, wind power was contributing more than 700 MW to the system, the equivalent of the entire output from Moneypoint.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to projects already built and connected, a further 1400 MW of capacity have already signed grid connection offers and have been accepted into the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme.  These projects were part of the gate 1 and gate 2 processes and will be built and connected to the grid in the next two or three year period.  The projects being built this year and next year will ensure delivery of the 2010 target of 15%.  Those built in following years will contribute to meeting our 2020 target.  The CER and EirGrid have calculated that approximately 5,800 MW of renewable capacity will be required to deliver the 40% target in 2020.</P>
        <P>The CER decision on the gate 3 round provides for connection offers for 4,000 MW of additional renewable electricity capacity.  Approximately 90% of these offers are wind powered capacity, including in the region of 800 MW of offshore wind.  The projects in gate 3 were selected by the CER on a first-come-first-served criterion.  The 4,000 MW of capacity within the gate 3 process are currently being assessed as part of the connection process.  Connection offers are scheduled to issue between now and early 2011.</P>
        <P>To ensure this process operates efficiently and to keep the industry stakeholders informed of the ongoing work, the CER has established a gate 3 liaison group involving all stakeholders, including EirGrid and the renewable industry associations.  The objective is to ensure the connection offer process is completed quickly, transparently and effectively.  The gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER.  With a full public consultation and dedicated industry workshops, all industry stakeholders were given the opportunity to respond in advance to the proposed connection process.</P>
        <P>The decisions by CER on gate 3 projects are potentially capable of delivering the 40% national target for the contribution from renewable energy resources to electricity consumed by 2020.  In the event of any failure to take up gate 3 offers, the CER intends to add replacement projects currently in the queue, to ensure delivery of that target.  Strategies to deliver on the distinct potential for exporting renewable electricity from Ireland will be also progressed.  These will take account of grid technology developments, power flow management techniques and progressive interconnection with the UK and potentially Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I hope he will accept that I share his vision to the effect that we must move away from a reliance on fossil fuels and towards a much more sustainable renewable power source for electricity generation.  Primarily, that source will be provided via wind energy.</P>
        <P>I take issue with the Minister in the context of how it is planned to connect onshore and offshore wind generation projects to the grid under the gate 3 mechanism.  It has been made clear, at meetings of Oireachtas committees and elsewhere, that the basis on which a grid connection under the gate 3 mechanism is granted relates to the length of time for which a project has been awaiting connection rather than on whether &mdash; in the context of wind speeds, location, proximity to the grid, etc. &mdash; that project is suitable.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that if we are to build between 2,000 to 4,000 wind turbines during the next ten years to produce the level of power envisaged by him, we should adopt a far more strategic approach with regard to where we locate this infrastructure?  Does he also accept that this would be preferable to granting grid connection on the basis of the length of time a project has been awaiting such connection?  At present, there is no strategic planning in this regard.  In that context, certain zones could be identified as being suitable locations for the development of wind farms.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P>The Green Party makes big play of the fact &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; that terrible planning mistakes have been made in the past.  Such mistakes contributed to the tragedy to which the past week&rsquo;s flooding has given rise.  We must not do the same when it comes to planning for this massive infrastructural project that will involve the construction of thousands of wind turbines.  Instead of relying on stakeholders who have a vested interest in obtaining grid connections, we should take a much more strategic approach and zone areas where the development of wind farms &mdash; in the form of new projects and those awaiting connection &mdash; should be encouraged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the broad points made by the Deputy.  Projects in gate 3 were selected on a first-come-first-served basis.  However, I do not believe this will be the key criterion in the context of what has been built and developed.  I ask the Deputy to be publicly supportive of what is the key criterion, namely, the development of the grid that will be required to take on the power produced by these wind turbines.  That development project will not be politically popular, it will prove to be contentious and many people will voice their concerns in respect of it.  If Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s party is serious with regard to meeting some of the targets we have set, I ask that it be supportive of the key criterion to which I refer.  If we fail to construct the grid that is required, no amount of gate systems will work.  It will not be possible to proceed unless the grid is built out to connect to the wind generation projects in question.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that our approach in this regard must be strategic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>If the approach was strategic, there would not be a necessity to build such a large grid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.  However, the study being carried out by EirGrid is strategic and is correct.  EirGrid is prioritising investment and developments on the basis of how the grid can be rolled out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole point is that it does not match gate 3.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s second point, namely, that the planning decisions made in respect of this matter must be the correct ones, is valid.  I understand that approximately half of the applications made in respect of the development of wind farms have been rejected.  Decisions in this regard are appropriate on a range of grounds, including the proximity to housing, the effect a project could have on the landscape or environmental concerns relating to the nature of the habitat where it is proposed to build a wind farm.  It is a matter for local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to adjudicate on such matters on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>I hope decisions in respect of this matter will be made in the understanding that there is a need for urgency, particularly in light of the temporary opportunity afforded to us &mdash; as gas prices fall &mdash; to switch to a renewable alternative that will be cheaper, cleaner and more secure in the future.  There is an imperative in this regard for me to inform the regulator and the grid company that we should proceed with development in as quick, safe and proper a manner as possible.  Such development will be in the long-term interests of the country and its people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Ostensibly, we are all on the same side in respect of this matter.  However, there is a problem with regard to implementation.  The Minister referred to instances where planning is not granted and everyone accepts this can happen.  Is he aware of the position with regard to cases where planning permission in respect of projects is running out?  I refer, <Col N="56"/>for example, to a project to construct a large wind farm at Bellacorick, County Mayo, with which Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB are both involved, which cannot proceed because of difficulties relating to grid development.  That is a matter of which the Minister should take charge.  If the different agencies are not working together to ensure that needs are met, the need for urgency to which the Minister refers is not getting through.  Will the Minister comment on this matter?</P>
        <P>When will timelines outlining the different elements of the grid development plan prepared by EirGrid be forthcoming?  The Minister called on the Opposition to support grid development.  I presume he is referring to the North-South interconnector in this regard.  Will the Minister indicate what is the level of support for grid development on the Government side?  The Government tends to hide behind agencies such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la and local authorities when it comes to difficult issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak for the Government, which is fully supportive of the process in which EirGrid is engaged and which is aware of the fact that critical infrastructure is going to have to be rolled out.  The Deputy referred to the North-South interconnector.  In that context, if areas such as Cavan-Monaghan are intent on attracting industries in the future, they will be obliged to have in place high-quality transmission grids that will ensure high-tech factories remain open.  This will not happen if the grid is not developed along the lines envisaged by EirGrid.  Unless we build the grid, we will not be able to meet the targets that have been laid down in respect of renewables.</P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney is correct that this matter is going to be politically sensitive and difficult to deal with.  However, the parties in opposition which state that they support the meeting of certain energy targets must follow up on their claims in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not our problem.  It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that those targets are met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will be supportive, despite the difficult decisions that must be made.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus referred to the period relating to planning permissions running out.  We accept that this is an issue and that is why the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wrote to county managers to discover whether they could assess the projects that have been built.  He also sought to discover whether the definition of &ldquo;progressed works&rdquo; could be reconsidered in order that some leeway could be provided in respect of those projects which have been unnecessarily delayed &mdash; not through the fault of those responsible for them but rather as a result of the difficulties that exist in respect of the grid &mdash; in order that they might proceed despite the fact that their planning permissions are running out.  The county managers with whom I have been in communication &mdash; I spoke directly to the county manager in Mayo &mdash; in respect of this matter are extremely supportive because they recognise that building the grid will not only allow for the generation of energy but will also ensure the infrastructure required to allow them to attract other direct investment and ensure that jobs are retained will be put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister received legal advice on this?  I can imagine a court case where a local authority or service provider argues that the works are substantially progressed when there is not a sign of anything on the ground.  That is a weak argument.  Is the Attorney General happy with it?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="57"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has done so.  Equally, one does not want a local authority taking such an interpretation that makes any development of wind farms possible.  Within the confines of the law and the planning system, they are to do what they can to assist development in this area because it is in the national interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a weak response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the true response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard much about commercial producers and large wind farm proposals.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s policy on micro-producers and what incentives can he offer them?  I understand that micro-producers do not require the same level of grid infrastructure.  We could be progressing that while we are dallying with the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned that the Minister has moved away from the essence of the question.  I am not trying to make my point in an adversarial way and will give a practical example.  If I have a piece of land on which it is suitable to develop a wind farm, which has reasonable proximity to the grid, good wind speeds and is on the coast and not in an area of scenic beauty, I have no chance of getting a connection under the gate 3 process.  Somebody who has a really poor site for a wind farm but who has been waiting for seven or eight years, which I accept is very frustrating, will be connected before me despite the fact that it would be far more beneficial in the national interest for the farm which makes more commercial sense to be connected.  That is the weakness of the gate 3 process.  Will the Minister address this specific issue so we can examine the most strategic places in the country to develop wind turbine technology rather than connecting people based on the length of time they have been waiting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my initial reply to the Deputy I stated that where someone is not able to avail of a gate 3 connection it will go back into a pool to develop an alternative project.  The CER and EirGrid will have to do this in a very timely manner and recognise that the targets we have set are ambitious and require action.  The Irish Wind Energy Association and others recognise that every system will have certain failings and difficulties for one operator and not another.  What they do not want is for us to throw up the entire apple cart and have to pick up the pieces afterwards.  While the gate 3 process is difficult and has certain limitations, it gave them the certainty they needed to get projects built and that was the first of my criteria.</P>
        <P>To answer Deputy Coonan, we introduced a support scheme for micro-generation of less than 11 kilowatt hours and an SEI grant scheme to test the various systems.  This is proper and right to ensure that we are developing the proper technologies.  My ambition goes beyond that.  I have asked the ESB about how we can extend that to larger small-scale micro-producers.  I am particularly interested in putting something in place that works for the Irish farming community because it must have a benefit from the system and not just a cost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Minister is considering the farming community.  He is one of the few in Government who is doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The low price of dairy products makes this a particularly difficult time for the dairy industry, where there is huge potential application of micro-generation.  However, I see that as an area with huge potential for us to develop a distributed electricity generation system.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the projected timeframe for the availability of broadband in the entire country; the percentage coverage projected at the end of 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[43234/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take questions Nos. 41 and 63 together.</P>
        <P>Broadband services are provided across the country by private service providers over various platforms including DSL over telephone lines, fixed wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre.  Details of broadband availability throughout the country are available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  Information contained on this website is provided by the service providers.  Details of broadband penetration levels are available from ComReg at <i>www.comreg.ie</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general, the State intervenes in the provision of broadband where there is clear evidence of market failure.  Where there are already existing service providers, such intervention is governed by EU state aid and competition rules.  My Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the national broadband scheme, NBS, in December 2008.  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS coverage area and which seek a service.  The NBS is being rolled out on an electoral division basis with a total of 1,028 electoral divisions to receive broadband services under the NBS.  3 is progressing its network roll-out and, to date, NBS services have been made available in 38% of the electoral divisions.  Under the NBS contract, 48% of the electoral divisions in the NBS coverage area are required to be enabled by the end of December 2009, while all electoral divisions in the NBS coverage area must be covered by the end of September 2010.    The status of the NBS rollout is available at <i>www.three.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>My Department is intensively monitoring delivery of the NBS to ensure that all contractual commitments are fully met.  It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be a small percentage of premises that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons such as the suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange or line of sight issues.</P>
        <P>The European economic recovery programme includes funding for access to broadband infrastructure in rural areas and my Department is considering the design and implementation of such a scheme.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  A notification of state aid has been made to the European Commission as part of the process of securing the necessary approvals for the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have already touched on this issue and I want to ask the Minister specifically about the delivery of the national broadband scheme and how 3 is performing.  The Minister stated the Department is monitoring it closely to ensure it is meeting the conditions of the contract.  What is the average broadband speed and bandwidth delivery provided by 3 in the electoral divisions it has covered under the roll-out of the national broadband scheme? <Col N="59"/> Will the Minister confirm that 3 is meeting the upload and download speed targets outlined in the contract?  Will the Minister provide me with the figures on speed delivery that the monitoring has uncovered?  Is any independent assessment of the roll-out being done by the Department or are we relying on receiving information from the company involved in rolling out the infrastructure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The speeds mandated are 1.2 MB for download and 200 kb upload.  I have been informed that to date the technology is working.  It provides those levels of service and above.  Obviously, it varies according to distance from a mast and the level of contention at any time but we have minimum standards and they are being met.  The roll-out is proceeding along the projected target timelines.  It has not been easy and many difficulties have arisen in planning provisions for masts so meeting the timelines cannot be absolutely guaranteed but based on what has happened to date, we expect the end of year target will be very close to, if not above, the 48% of electoral divisions roll-out that we seek to achieve.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my response to an earlier question, funding is dependent on the targets being met.  There is a real contractual commitment that gives us certainty on the basic service levels we have put in place.  The advantage we have in this area is that the technology has been further developed since the first version of the mobile broadband systems.  This is a major project involving an investment by the company and the State of more than &euro;200 million and I am informed that the technology is working well and to plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the average download speed being delivered by 3?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that information but I will provide it to the Deputy.  I will have to revert to the Department to get the precise figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In light of our dependence on providers for information, concerns have arisen about whether the national broadband scheme is subject to rigorous scrutiny.  The scheme is in effect working from a false premise, that is, the famous but inaccurate map.  I can cite an example from my constituency involving an unemployed man who invested &euro;20,000 in setting up a small business.  Before he made his investment, he was given confirmation that he would have broadband but the company involved subsequently informed him that it was unable to provide him with a service.  He is desperate because his business is completely dependent on broadband.  He contacted the Ombudsman, ComReg and six broadband providers but every road leads back to Eircom.  He has logged 18 calls with that company but cannot even speak to the same person twice let alone get an answer.  ComReg has finally lodged an official complaint but the response will take ten days to issue.  On paper, it appears that broadband is being provided in certain parts of the country but there appears to be no oversight by the Department of the reality on the ground.  In the case I have outlined, a man&rsquo;s livelihood is dependent on the provision of broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The contractual documents for the national broadband scheme are four or five times the thickness of the pile of papers in front of me.  Working out the details took time but we got them right in the end.  The contractual arrangements give me the confidence that the scheme will provide the level of service we seek.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not speaking about the contractual arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific example to which the Deputy referred pertains to a fixed line company.  Difficulties have arisen in regard to split lines and distance to exchanges, particularly given that 40% of rural houses are once-off developments.  </P>

	<P>The map makes it seem as if there is no problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more difficult to service such areas.  We are delivering alternative solutions, such as wireless, WiMAX, mobile and fixed wireless, in addition to the crucial role played by fixed lines.  Competition among these alternatives will deliver the best service possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister failed to fully address my question.  I asked for the percentage that remains to be covered by the national broadband scheme.  The map circulated to Deputies reveals that huge tracts of the country are not covered.  I ask the Minister when the greater part of my constituency of Cork South-West will be completely covered by the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Every square inch of the country was examined and areas in which the majority of the population were unable to access any service were targeted for the national broadband scheme.  In respect of areas in which a small percentage of the population lacked access, we are working with the European Commission to establish, subject to state aid rules, a final support scheme to give every house, be it in south-west Cork or north-east Donegal, the potential for getting broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>Vast areas of my constituency are not covered by the map circulated to us two days ago.  I am amazed that is the case.  The tip of Sheep&rsquo;s Head peninsula will be covered but Kilcrohane, Ahakista and Durrus will not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very familiar with Ahakista, Kilcrohane and Durrus.  The Government has made a clear commitment that no house in any of those villages, or in any other village in the country, will be unable to access standard broadband services.  We have put in a place a variety of mechanisms to cover the country in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, as well a number of other amendments in the name of Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, cannot be moved because they are consequential on amendment No. 3, which was negatived.  </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendments 8 and 9 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10: </P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;10.&mdash;Before consideration of applications for grant of licences begins the Authority shall initiate a public consultation process which clearly sets out procedures for advertising for applications and how the public can make submissions before applications are considered.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We held a lengthy discussion on this issue on Committee Stage.  It is critical that competitions are fully advertised so that all interests can be consulted.  The Bill does not make sufficient mention of the numerous commuter and passenger organisations that have been established in Ireland.  We are contacted on a regular basis by Rail Users Ireland, to cite one example.</P>
        <P>Communities all over Ireland are interested in their parts of the national network.  Historically, public demand for improved or new routes has been expressed through Members of this House.  It is alleged, for example, that one of the routes discontinued when the Minister for Transport slashed the budget of Dublin Bus was originally provided after representations by the former Taoiseach on behalf of his constituents in Dublin Central.  Communities have legitimate concerns when they learn of routes being threatened.  Recently, the collapse of the Broadmeadow viaduct on the Dublin-Belfast rail line caused concern among commuters in Drogheda, Balbriggan, south County Louth and east County Meath.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure better consultation is a key aspect of the process of issuing licences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will recall, we discussed this issue at great length on Committee Stage when I set out in detail the reasons I could not accept the proposed approach.  The major reason remains the issue of commercial confidentiality for proposals to provide commercial bus services.  A great deal of commercial detail must be presented to the authority when it is considering bus licences.  It is generally accepted that when one is trying to operate on a commercial basis it is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest that commercial information be made publicly available.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P>One of the themes to emerge in both Houses on more than one occasion during the passage of the Bill has been the need to ensure licensing decisions are taken quickly.  Representatives of the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland emphasised to me at a recent meeting that the Bill must provide for speedy decisions.  When a company applies for a licence it should expect the decision to be taken quickly.  Acceptance of the proposal would make the licensing process slow and tedious.</P>
        <P>As I noted previously, a third problem would arise if the amendment were accepted.  To take the planning process as an example, if a developer with an interest in a town becomes aware that an application has been made for permission to construct a shopping centre in another part of the town, he will lodge an objection to prevent the project from proceeding, even though he may not intend to proceed with his own development for many years.  This course of action delays the process.  I have no doubt, having observed such cases under the current regime, that existing operators, should they become aware that another operator has applied for a licence, would alert members of the public and put forward their own case.  It is for this reason that I do not favour adopting the approach proposed by Deputy Broughan.</P>
        <P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point on the need to ensure customers have a say and role.  Section 10(2) provides that the authority can seek any information from any source it wishes to assist in its consideration of applications.  This provision, allied to the current practice whereby an existing operator on a proposed route is given prior notice of the consideration of an application, provides an adequate basis for the authority to have views that are relevant to particular applications.</P>
        <P>Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s comments related primarily to discussions on a company&rsquo;s decisions to withdraw from a route rather than applications for a licence.  On the basis that consultation is provided for, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of those in the transport industry believe the issue of consultation is skated over in the Bill.  In their view, a specific provision on consultation should be introduced.  The Minister argues that commercial information needs to be protected.  This was the subject of a recent debate we had on how one could achieve freedom of information in commercial companies while maintaining adequate invigilation.  From my experience, this is impossible if one is running a commercial operation.  Despite this, there is scope for consultation.  However, as there are one or two references to consultation later in the Bill, I will withdraw the amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 11 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that operators of public bus services are treated on an equitable basis with operators of private bus services,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The amendment would add to the general provisions of the core licensing section the words, &ldquo;shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that operators of public bus services are treated on an equitable basis with operators of private bus services&rdquo;.  Its origins lie in concerns that arose from an examination of the badly regulated English market where public monopolies <Col N="63"/>have been replaced by private monopolies.  The four large operators in England engage in a form of dance with each other but refuse to compete in a serious or significant manner.</P>
        <P>The core issue relates to the companies which will operate a public service obligation.  Some of the vulnerable communities served by these companies only have access to a bus service.  For this reason, an amendment is needed to ensure a level playing pitch between the public service operators and private bus services.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s comment that other parts of the Bill would render redundant this amendment, it would be preferable to spell out this matter at the start of this critical section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot have a level playing pitch if one side is subsidised by the taxpayer.  How does the Minister propose to discount to private operators the advantage public operators will secure through having the taxpayers foot the cost of putting a bus on the road?  This is an important issue.</P>
        <P>The Freedom of Information Act expressly provides that individuals are not entitled to obtain sensitive commercial information.  For instance, in tendering processes people are not entitled to receive full details of the various bids, although in many cases they are entitled to receive details of the successful tender.  As someone who consistently argues for transparency, openness and accountability, I believe we cannot have enough freedom of information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Bill reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reform bus licensing to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all of the market.  Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendment, while it seeks to treat all parties equally, would result in public transport companies being treated more equally than the private sector.  Representatives of the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland made proposals which would have precisely the opposite effect.  The CTTC would like wording inserted in the legislation to protect its members.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the Dublin Transport Authority Act and this legislation, specifically sections 28 and 52, is to create a level playing field in which private and public bus service providers will be licensed to operate under the same legislative regime.  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill create that level playing field and we can make no distinction between bus licence applications in the future, whether they are submitted by public or private operators.  For that reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 12.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We have a public bus company.  It was previously decided that it would be a good idea to have a public transport company.  It has operated and served us well.  As it is a public transport company, it gets subsidies to run particular routes that would not be profitable.  This Bill helps to create a situation whereby private sector companies can compete for such PSO contracts if they so wish, and the playing field will be levelled for an open tendering process.  It is not possible to expose the commercial secrets of a semi-State company and expect it to compete on a level playing field if the private sector receives commercial confidentiality.  Both will be treated equally in that event as well.  The Bill outlines very clearly from where we are coming and for that reason I believe the Deputy should withdraw his amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The amendment is related to a number of other amendments tabled by the Labour Party.  We have serious concerns about the kinds of work standards and conditions which will pertain in the industry upon passage of the Bill.  In those areas where competition is taking place, the public sector company will not be disadvantaged.  I was seeking <Col N="64"/>to make that point in a global amendment.  I understand the difficulty of doing this in general terms, although I have specified the issue in other amendments.  A core issue for our party is how workers and the passengers of transport companies will be looked after in the future.  We do not want to see one law for one group and one law for the other.</P>
        <P>I am amused to hear Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd to talk about freedom of information requests.  We could extend the FOI legislation to all companies, such as Independent News and Media, The Irish Times Limited and so on, so that we might know the salary range of the ladies and gentlemen who sit in the Press Gallery and compare it to the salary range in this House, an issue about which they write quite often.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the company is a State agency, then fair enough.  However, if the company&rsquo;s remit is to compete in a commercial business, then surely it must have the same rights as other commercial companies.  That is the point of the amendment.  There should be a level playing pitch.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s point is that we should know everything about everything, but if that is not the case, there should be one law for one company and one law for the other.  In this case, we would be fearful that on critical issues such as fleet and infrastructure standards, the treatment of workforces, working conditions and salaries, a company might drive a coach and four through this Bill, which has been framed with the best of intentions.  I will revert to this issue in later amendments, but I will withdraw this one now.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, to delete lines 33 to 38.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These amendments deal with the general provisions for the consideration of an application for the grant of licences.  Section 10(1)(<i>a</i>) states that the regulator:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0">shall take account of the demand or potential demand that exists for the public bus passenger services to which the application refers having regard to the needs of consumers and any existing public bus passenger services on or in the vicinity of the route to be served by the proposed public bus passenger services,</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The core issue with this is the problem with measuring demand.  People in the transport business would say that it is up to the promoters of a route to come forward with proposals that are then assessed and in that context it would be better not to have this section at all.  The Minister considers that a reference to the needs of consumers is important but there are some people who consider that it is up to the companies themselves, and that it is not the regulator&rsquo;s business to assess the demand for the service.  It is up to promoters, entrepreneurs and existing companies to come forward with ideas.  That is the rationale behind amendment No. 13.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 14 provides an alternative to section 10(1)(<i>a</i>) and I will press it, having listened to what the Minister said on Committee Stage last Friday.  I wish to add the phrase &ldquo;the sustainability of the demand or the potential sustainable demand&rdquo;.  The idea of sustainability is a key element of demand measurement.  In other words, promoters need to show that the <Col N="65"/>demand for a service will exist.  In my own constituency, a private company known as AerDart was launched by local businessmen and provided a service between Kilbarrack station, Howth Junction station and Dublin Airport.  It had infrastructure, including its own bus stops and so on.  The company was sold to a UK operator and suddenly disappeared.  There was some demand on the route, but from observing the buses as they went back and forth, there was not a sustainable demand for it.</P>
        <P>We have been referring to new suburbs in west and north Dublin.  Generally, I found Dublin Bus to be very good at responding to the needs of the new communities and new residents in the North Fringe, where a new town is being built.  We got a fine new cross-city service, the No. 128, which is very sustainable because new residents and existing families are using it.</P>
        <P>Sustainability is one of the words of our time.  When we come out of the current crisis, we should have a sustainable economic programme for our country so that we do not get into difficulties over the next few years due to unsustainable and unregulated development.  We are trying to regulate a new bus market and in this regard the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; would be a valuable addition to the Bill.  The Minister knows what I mean and I can give him two examples where there was no sustainable demand and an example where there was sustainable demand.  We know what it is when we see it, and it should be in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what the Deputy is trying to achieve in either one or both of the amendments.  I have had a good look at this during the course of the passage of the Bill and discussed it with officials and others.  What the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments would do is almost the exact opposite of what he wants to do.  I acknowledge what the Deputy has said about amendment No. 14 in particular.  However, if either of these amendments was accepted, particularly amendment No. 13, we would essentially end up with deregulation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy said several times, and I agree with him, it is important that the needs of consumers are not just considered but placed at the centre of the consideration process for licences.  The demand test is established as having specific regard to those particular needs of consumers.  I accept there might be a fear that this will work to the disadvantage of existing companies but that is not what is intended.  On amendment No. 13 specifically, the removal of the demand test could have the potential to facilitate effective deregulation.  If it was not there, one would have that difficulty and would end up with deregulation.  The retention of the requirement for consideration of consumers in regard to the consideration of all applications for licences will ensure that the interest of consumers takes precedence over the interest of the providers themselves.  The provisions of section 10 are such that they afford sufficient flexibility and discretion to the authority in the consideration of licence applications but they also reinforce the central aims of the Bill itself, which is consumer focused.  That point relates specifically to amendment No. 13.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 14 would mean that the paragraph in question would require the authority to consider applications in the context of both demand and potential demand, or the sustainability of the demand or the potential sustainable demand, in the case of applications for all licences.  This would be to add an unwarranted complexity to the consideration of applications, which would not be helped by the fact that the concept of sustainability of demand would be very difficult to define &mdash; almost impossible, I would suggest.  The concepts of demand or potential demand which are contained in the paragraph are clear and can be fairly readily explained.  I referred to this point on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Given the context of this section, which is a pivotal element of the overall Part of the Bill, the application of the concept is linked directly at all times to the needs of consumers and focused on those needs.  Meeting consumer demand for the provision of any public bus service would be the primary reason any operator would contemplate the introduction of such a service <Col N="66"/>in the first place.  It is also the reason the concepts of demand or potential demand form the test against which all applications for licences have to be considered.  In any event, in developing the structure for the consideration of the licence application, the authority is mandated under section 1 to have regard to the general objectives established for it under section 10 of the DTA Act of 2008.  These include the consideration of issues relating to environmental sustainability, social cohesion and promoting economic progress.  In that context, it is considered that the theme this amendment promotes is already reflected in the overall mandate being given to the authority.</P>
        <P>Having considered this &mdash; the Deputy has made some eloquent pleas in this regard at various stages in the House and on Committee Stage &mdash; I believe what he is trying to achieve is actually achieved by this section as it stands.  For that reason, I ask him to withdraw the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will withdraw amendment No. 13 but I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s argument in regard to amendment No. 14, namely, that the sustainability of demand cannot be considered.  If one considers any business plan, one would have the parameters of the impact of a proposed new service on existing operators, on the attraction of new consumers and on modal shifts.  Part of the whole place of this Bill in our national legislation is that we continue to develop a modal shift away from cars and into buses, trains and trams.  That is measurable and much work has been done here and internationally in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is striking that the recommendations of the UK Office of Fair Trading report and the conclusions it reaches are based on lengthy transport research that has been done over decades in big markets like that of the UK, where it can be said the price of fares is elastic and that there is a tendency for commuters to take the next service, whatever service appears, and so on.  Like other areas of transport, it is a market that has its own particular characteristics.</P>
        <P>Going on past experience, does the Minister believe the proposal from Citylink to have 750 buses a week travelling between Dublin Airport and Galway city is sustainable?  Obviously, it would be a wonderful service for the population concerned but, as soon as Citylink mother company, ComfortDelGro, has driven its private sector competitor and Bus &Eacute;ireann off the route, does the Minister realistically believe Citylink would maintain that service at such frequencies and with such a good fleet and so on?  Most people simply do not believe it.  As we know, the company is engaged in exclusive behaviour, which is something I asked the Minister to ban in the competitive sector under this Bill.  Therefore, I will press amendment No. 14.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, lines 39 to 41, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;save&rdquo; in line 39 down to and including &ldquo;appropriate,&rdquo; in line 41.</P><Col N="67"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 10(1)(<i>b</i>) states &ldquo;save where the application is in respect of a category of licence where the Authority deems it not to be appropriate, shall take account of any or all of the following:&rdquo;  I ask that this sentence be deleted up to the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; so it simply reads &ldquo;shall take account of any or all of the following:&rdquo;.  The section is ambiguous at present and could be interpreted to allow the national transport authority to grant a licence to operate a network or route which would compete on the road with existing services, including services on PSO routes.  That would directly affect the financial stability of a company offering the public service transport, which in turn could lead to an increase in the State subvention or difficulty for a State company in maintaining a service.</P>
        <P>There are good points in the provisions.  For example, consultation must take place and all the qualities that a good licensing system must have &mdash; such as being attractive, integrated and well-functioning &mdash; could be negatived if the Bill is left as it stands.  That is why we should remove that portion.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 16 deals with the authority taking account of &ldquo;any or all&rdquo; of certain provisions.  The term seems vague, although it seems to have the basic meaning that the national transport authority &mdash; which is currently the Dublin Transport Authority &mdash; could ignore the parameters for the granting of a bus licence.  The good qualities that the Bill has regarding the introduction of a modern bus licensing system would be wiped out.</P>
        <P>We had a discussion last Thursday and Friday about the term &ldquo;any or all&rdquo;.  It is the type of phrase that the Attorney General or Parliamentary Counsel should have eliminated from the Bill.  We have resources in our own offices to put forward amendments and it is difficult to get everything correct in a legal sense.  Unless it was intended, the Department should have a watertight formula in this regard.  This is in preference to saying that the authority should have regard for these important provisions or it should not.</P>
        <P>I do not see any necessity for the term &ldquo;any or all&rdquo; and I do not see how the authority could deem it inappropriate in the first place to take these provisions into consideration.  If that is the case, why have the Bill at all?  Why not just continue with the ramshackle and chaotic system from the 1932 Bill?</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to consider the rationale of the two amendments.  We discussed the appeals system on our last day of discussions.  It is conceivable that some of these issues will end up in the Circuit Court down the line.  One aviation operator, Mr. O&rsquo;Leary, loves to go to court when he gets the wrong decision from the regulator and there could be a <i>modus operandi</i> to go to court or a European forum.  Would it not be better for the Bill to be watertight?  Is there not merit in both of these amendments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked me to have a look at this issue, which I did, to see if there was an alternative to the phrase &ldquo;any or all&rdquo; or if it should be tightened up.  I have considered it very carefully and came to the conclusion that the phrasing as it stands is probably the most effective.  I will explain briefly the reasoning behind this.</P>
        <P>It would not be in the interest of the national transport authority to hand out licences for services in direct competition to subvented services, unless as I outlined earlier in the discussion the service can be provided at a lower cost to the taxpayer.  We may come from different angles but we are all here primarily to protect the interests of the consumers and taxpayers in this country, and not one company, whether it is public or private.</P>
        <P>There is no ideology involved in this and we need a good public transport system.  This has been well provided by the public sector much of the time, as the Deputy noted earlier.  The decision on whether the service will continue to be provided by the public sector or a combi<Col N="68"/>nation of public and private will be made not by us, but by how effectively and efficiently the companies in this market will operate.</P>
        <P>The result of the acceptance of either of these amendments would be that every application for a licence, irrespective of its nature, would have to be considered against its potential impact on a PSO transport service.  Amendment No. 15 goes a little further in envisaging that the other ten provisions set out in the paragraph would be applied to the consideration of all applications.  In many respects, that would be a recipe for disaster.</P>
        <P>We made a very definite policy decision in preparing the Bill that the consideration of the impact on contracted public transport services generally, including contracted bus services which attract State subvention &mdash; the PSO routes &mdash; would not be mandatory in respect of all applications and would instead be a matter for determination by the authority.  If the authority is required to consider the matters in all cases with the full range of bus licences, it would do much irrelevant work.  I have given the example before of a once-off event, the response that we had to make to the Malahide viaduct collapse.  That was a special circumstance and if we had to measure the provision of services in that case against these criteria, the viaduct &mdash; thanks to the efficiency of the job done &mdash; would have been open again before the commuters could get an alternative service.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made his argument on Committee Stage and I considered the matter to see if there was another way of phrasing the section.  I have not been able to come up with one and the phrasing we have, as it is from a layman&rsquo;s and legal perspective, is as watertight as possible.  The authority is allowed that little bit of discretion that it should have with licences of a specific type.  It is not phrased in such a way that the national transport authority will be able to decide that it would like to see an operator working a route even if there is a PSO route beside it, which, I think, is the Deputy&rsquo;s fear.  It is not designed in that way.</P>
        <P>It is meant to allow the authority consider a licence application under relevant criteria; if it sees all the criteria as relevant, it has the freedom to proceed in that way but if it is a once-off event or a response to a specific emergency, for example, it does not have to consider all of them.  I undertook to consider the matter but I could not come up with a better wording.</P>
        <P>Question, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(i) the protection of the integrity of the national urban and local bus network,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These five amendments divide naturally into two groups and amendments Nos. 17 and 21 go together.  Amendment No. 17 seeks to include, between lines 41 and 42 in the general provision for considering licences, a new clause (i) to include the words &ldquo;the protection of the integrity of the national urban and local bus network&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 21 seeks to add a new clause (ii), between lines 44 and 45, to include the words &ldquo;the need for the provision, maintenance and investment in public transport infrastructure and modern bus fleets across all networks and for all users,&rdquo;.</P><Col N="69"/>
        <P>It goes without saying that over the past decades Bus &Eacute;ireann has put together a good, effective, national bus network.  This network was constructed to serve the widest possible group of passengers and consumers.  It was constructed to include as many towns and villages as possible on the various routes so as to provide comprehensive access in rural Ireland.  Earlier we spoke about the rural transport network, which we hope will escape the axe in the budget.  I proposed and hoped that this network would become part of the national bus network constructed over the decades by Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The great fear of people around the country is that the enactment of this Bill will allow some operators to cherry pick point to point routes, such as the example I cited earlier.  There is scope for that route, but if we end up in a situation where we only have a non-stop service between Dublin and Galway, people along the route in east Galway, the midlands and west Leinster could be left without a service.  Therefore, it is important to include a provision in the Bill to ensure we maintain a national bus network.  I spoke about the rural transport network earlier.  I hope the Minister has campaigned at Cabinet level to retain that service and that it will be saved and we can build on it in the years ahead.  The Labour Party wants it because it has seen the worth of the service throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>The national network is the spine of the overall bus transport network and it is very important it is not allowed deteriorate.  Whenever we have met representatives from Bus &Eacute;ireann and people in the private sector who are subcontracted to parts of the Bus &Eacute;ireann network, we have found that they recognise the network exists, is a fact of life and makes life better for people.  Therefore, we should not allow a situation develop whereby the Bill could be badly interpreted by the new transport authority, the incoming chief executive and his board and allow them operate in such a way as to allow the network deteriorate.  The network is critical and this should be recognised in the Bill.</P>
        <P>With regard to all the infrastructure that pertains to running an efficient and effective bus company, it is important that any provider who comes forward to compete for a route will be able to demonstrate that his or her company will be able to afford such expenditure, most importantly, on up-to-date, modern buses.  It is important that significant numbers of people do not end up travelling on clapped out bangers or have to rely on that type of service rather than on the best available up-to-date service.  Specifying the provision of a modern bus fleet is important.  Bus depots and all the other infrastructure are also critical.  Traditionally, our State companies have been involved in the provision of the infrastructure and have sometimes used the Government subvention for that.  The maintenance of this infrastructure along the various routes is critical.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We hope that in 2010 we will finally have real time auto vehicle location, AVL, information available at bus stops so that we will know where each vehicle is, as happens in other areas of the transport industry, and people will have full information about the service available.  It is important that all companies offering the services will provide and have access to this kind of infrastructure.  They should have good buses, efficient fleets and buses must be accessible.  The complaint is often made that accessibility requirements are far higher for public sector transport than private sector where buses are much older and less accessible.  The regulations applying to Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to access for citizens with disability are not followed in the private sector; they are ignored.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, deal with the issue of sustainability.  The key issue here is the need to provide a well functioning, attractive, competitive, integrated and safe public transport system of services and networks for all users.  Some of my amendments offer alternatives, but I will press one of them.  I want to add the key words &ldquo;regulated, sustainable, efficient&rdquo; so as to ensure we finish with a well regulated system.  I want it to be a requirement of the new <Col N="70"/>transport authority to run its business in a proper way, unlike the way the Financial Regulator did its business over the past six years.  I want to ensure the transport regulator can be relied upon, under its new chief executive and chairman, to develop and carry out in a highly efficient and strictly controlled way the provisions of the Bill.  Therefore, I believe we should use the word &ldquo;regulated&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A similar issue arose with regard to sanctions and fines for operators who, like Citylink, operate services without a licence.  Citylink showed a cavalier disregard for the Department of Transport and its officials who refused a licence and went ahead and did what it wanted.  It is critical the new regulator has teeth and is seen, even in its broad principle, to be a serious, strict regulator that will ensure we get a level playing pitch and proper conditions for the industry.  Therefore, I believe we should include the words &ldquo;regulated&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, the Minister does not seem to know what &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; means.  It is hard to describe.  In some industries we have seen things that are unsustainable.  I put it to the Minister that in the debate in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport last Wednesday we saw an example of somebody trying to provide a service that was unsustainable.  We know it was unsustainable, but it was done to drive fair competition off the roads.  We can work out what we mean by sustainability.  We mean a service is initiated and a contract is fulfilled to the letter over the years by the contractor, whoever that is, and with regard to older contracts, by an existing State company and any new competitors that come along.  Sustainability is an issue that should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have also mentioned the word &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; in my amendments.  Again, there is concern in the transport industry that part of the problem with regard to the old regulator &mdash; the Department of Transport &mdash; was that it was buried for a long time.  The Department disappeared for years in that there was no dedicated Department of Transport, even though most other countries always have a department of state for transport.  However, we let the Department disappear during several Governments.  It was lumped in with various other areas.  For example, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke was the Minister for a huge Department that included the current Minister&rsquo;s recent Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the current Department of Transport.  That is not the way to operate, particularly when we have some areas which only require a small input from the Civil Service, yet have a full Department of State.  It is important, therefore, that we have what I have termed &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; regulation.  It is quite important.  It would mean that people would not be forced to write to me and perhaps to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd complaining that they had made an application three years ago.  The attitude of the Department, for whatever reason, was that it wished to get rid of the old regulatory system which was not working and that it had been asking for this Bill for the past five to eight years.  However, it is important that this Bill provides efficient regulation.  In respect of the addition of the words proposed in amendment No. 20, competitive could be better expressed as &ldquo;regulated and sustainably competitive&rdquo;.  Those amendments would be an improvement over the key provision of this Bill as expressed in this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be surprised if the regulations with regard to disability are not applied universally; otherwise, it is discrimination against disabled persons using either public or private transport.</P>
        <P>Many bus operators are small-time entrepreneurs on a small budget.  They do their best to keep their buses on the road.  Prior to this legislation, most of them were confined to small runs such as the bingo bus but they are the hearts and souls of their communities. In many cases, their vehicles are small minibuses or a smaller type of public service vehicle.  I laud them <Col N="71"/>for their enterprise and for their commitment to their community.  They do their very best and they comply with all the road safety regulations.</P>
        <P>On the question of competition, many of the larger private sector companies have first-class buses, as good as any used by Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus.  What is needed is a level playing field.  If the Bill were to achieve this, then it would find favour with Fine Gael, whose policy is that any operator could compete for a bundle of routes.  These routes would be based and planned to make them attractive to the smaller operators with three or four buses.  Ireland is built on enterprise and the majority of these operators are based in rural areas where they are held in the highest esteem in their local areas.  I would like to see them being allowed compete to provide an even better service.  We want the legislation to allow them to do so.</P>
        <P>I am not sure about Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s views but the Minister and I are in agreement on this point.  I refer to a person operating without a licence &mdash; under the current legislation this would incur a fine of &euro;50 and &euro;6 per day thereafter.  If the new legislation requires the applicants to be of good character and to meet certain requirements, then a conviction no matter how small for operating an unlicensed bus service could mean that such an applicant will not be considered for any further or other licences by the national transport authority.  I know the system operates very well in London.  Fine Gael would not support a system to allow a State monopoly to be replaced by a private monopoly.</P>

	<P>We want competition and choice.  Notwithstanding my serious criticisms of the Bill, I ask the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
        <P>As regards the aviation sector, one of the largest European aviation companies, Ryanair, was founded by an Irishman.  It is a fantastic company.  If Deputy Broughan ever wishes to go to places far afield, such as east or west Germany or Russia, I am sure that company would provide him with a suitable seat near the engine so that the noise of one would be drowned out by the other and there would be equilibrium in transport in that case also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan proposed the amendments and has divided them into two groups so I will follow his template.  The purpose of section 10 is to establish an overall framework for the consideration of applications for bus route licences by the authority.  Such consideration must be pursued, having regard to the general objectives of the authority provided for in section 10 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 which is updated by means of section 29 of the Bill.  It is helpful to read the two sections together.  The link between section 10 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and section 23 of this Bill is of particular importance when considering these amendments.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 17 and 21 propose the introduction of a new paragraph in subsection 10(1)(<i>b</i>) to establish a requirement to protect the integrity of the national urban and local bus networks.  This is catered for and specifically addressed through the existing subparagraph (iii) of that subsection.  It allows the authority to consider the impact of a proposed commercial bus service on public transport services which are the subject of public transport service contracts where the authority considers that such consideration is warranted.  The concerns expressed by the Deputy are acknowledged and are included in this section of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provisions of section 10 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, as substituted by the amendment in<b> </b>section 29(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill, set out clearly the objectives the authority must seek to achieve in exercising its functions.  These include, in section 10(1)(<i>a</i>), the development of an integrated transport system which contributes to environmental sustainability and social cohesion and promotes economic progress and, in section 10(1)(<i>b</i>), the provision of a well <Col N="72"/>functioning, attractive, integrated and safe public transport system of services and network for all users.  Those elements of the objectives established for the authority address the majority of the issues raised in amendments Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, especially when these are viewed in association with section 10(<i>b</i>)(i) as presented in the Bill at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The valid points raised by Deputy Broughan are addressed specifically in the Bill.  Amendment No. 19 also envisages the removal of the reference to competition from subparagraph (<i>b</i>)(i), while amendment No. 20 would see the concept restated as &ldquo;regulated and sustainably competitive&rdquo;.  I am unable to support this proposal to remove the reference to competitive because competition in the market for commercial bus services can have a very positive impact for consumers where such competition is regulated.  The promotion of regulated competition will be a further objective of the authority following the passage of this Bill.  It must be recalled that the incorporation of a reference to competition will counter any potential claims that incumbent operators on routes could make to the effect that they have some form of exclusive rights to the provision of commercial bus services on those routes.  In overall terms, I do not think there is any need or gain in the removal of the phrase or its refocusing as proposed in amendment No. 20.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd queried the effect that operating outside the law might have on a licence application.  The questions of good reputation, licensing infringements and so on are covered in section 10.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, they would not secure the licence.  It could be a significant factor in determining the application.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It could.  There is also provision in the legislation for the revocation of a licence where people breach the terms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is clear then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Disability Act 2005, operators will have to run services in accordance with the law.  The Act sets out a timetable for the provision of services and accessibility and so on and that will apply across the board.  The fleet of our main public transport provider is 82% accessible by people with disabilities.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd raised a query about level playing fields earlier but this gives the provider an enormous advantage because as we move towards the complete enactment of the Disability Act 2005, it will be ahead of many private operators.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that many private operators have been entrepreneurial and innovative.  They have carved out niches for themselves in various transport sectors.  Some have become large and they provide employment, which is positive.  Deputy Broughan referred to a level playing field regarding terms and conditions but I gave him a commitment that when we bring forward the new RTOL legislation, such issues will be addressed.  In the meantime, everybody will have to comply with the current law regarding health and safety conditions, wages, the minimum wage, etc.  I will deal further with the issue raised by him in that legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, refer to a strictly well regulated market and industry where sustainability is taken into account before licences are granted.  Those are core attributes of what we hope will be an effective market in order that we do not end up with the worst result similar to what we have witnessed in a so-called regulated market in the UK where a public provider was replaced with a private monopolist, which could do what it liked.  The Office of Fair Trading has accepted that and responsibility has transferred to the Competition Authority.  Transport is cited as an uncompetitive industry and <Col N="73"/>it will be hard for administrators to untangle that for most of the UK.  I want us to avoid that fate and that is why I will press a number of the amendments.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This relates again to the issue of networks.  Concerns have been raised by people in the transport industry who believe the network is the key element we have to consider when we make plans for the development of public transport.  The network does not comprise a collection of unintegrated services and the authority, therefore, would need the powers to reject licences for services that would compete adversely with the core network and not just for services parallel to specific routes.  The issue again is the protection and maintenance of the network.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said on Committee Stage, the effect of the amendment would be the opposite of what the Deputy desires.  The legislation contains protections for the network and I agree with the Deputy that it is extremely important that the concept of the network be protected as much as possible and it is not seen as a collection of individual routes.  One of the effects of the amendment would be that consideration of applications would have to account of the impact of the proposed public bus services on all transport services subject to a PSO contract.  I am sure the Deputy does not desire that every PSO contract would have to be considered across Dublin city for licence applications.  That would make it impossible to make decisions.  Every PSO would have to be considered whether the bus service would have an impact.  If there is unmet demand in an area to which such a contract relates, it would be impossible to refuse applications for a licence.  This could potentially undermine subvented services. That is why accepting the amendment could have the undesired effect from the Deputy&rsquo;s point of view of undermining the subvented services in an area.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment for that reason.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, to delete lines 4 to 6.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment seeks the deletion of paragraph (iv), which makes an exception from the provision that account shall be taken of  &ldquo;the contribution the proposed public bus passenger service would have in achieving an increase in the availability of public transport services for the public&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is very vague.  A very effective service run by a company, whether in receipt of a subvention or not, could be damaged by a competitor who claims that an increase in availability is called for on the route.  The amendment is related to amendment No. 22, which focused on demand and the difficulty of measuring it.  This provision could be used as a device to grant licences where there is no additional demand or where demand is already catered for, either by a public service operator with a PSO or another operator.  The provision could be counter-productive.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on my proposal.  This view has been expressed to me from the transport industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 24 is related.  It would insert a paragraph making a further exception, having regard to &ldquo;the vehicular capacity of the routes of the proposed services&rdquo;.  People involved in traffic management suggested this amendment to me.  There is already congestion some on bus routes, such as the quality bus network in Dublin and the green routes in Cork city, caused by buses, taxis, bicycles and so on.  If the new national transport authority were to procure a bus route on a particular high quality route it would require the ability to reject licence applications which would affect the reliability of services on that route.  By adding a service, one should not damage an existing very good service.  Competition should not be the primary aim.  Routes which have sustainable services with good frequency should not be clogged up by the addition of competitive services, as happened when deregulation was introduced in cities such as Glasgow 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>The example of Leeds was cited to me.  In that city, when a high quality bus rapid transit route is being procured the ability of private operators to apply for licences to run buses on that route is restricted in order to maintain the reliability of the core service.  We have not seen such difficulties yet.  However, this could become a major problem in the future when the Bill is enacted. I ask the Minister to look at this matter one last time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 23 focuses on sub-paragraph 10(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv).  The paragraph is based on the reasonable assumption that the public would benefit from a proposed public bus service.  The removal of this provision could give rise to claims from the existing operator on a route, whether public or private, that he or she has an exclusive right to the route, given the absence of any account being taken of the prospect of increasing the availability of transport services.  Having regard to that, I propose to retain the paragraph and do not accept amendment No. 23.  </P>
        <P>The purpose of amendment No. 24 is to allow the authority to refuse licence applications where there might be an issue related to the vehicular capacity of the proposed route or where, for example, the proposed commercial service might impact on the reliability of an existing PSO service that has been procured by the authority.  I do not doubt that this might arise.  That is why I have addressed this in the combined provisions of sub-paragraphs 10(1)(<i>b</i>)(i) and <Col N="75"/>10(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii), which address issues such as the need for well-functioning and safe public transport systems and the need for the preservation of good order and safety on the public roads, generally.</P>
        <P>The wording of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments is more prescriptive and rigid.  I assure him that the scenarios he outlines are covered in the Bill.  I appreciate that the Deputy is raising objections and fears which people have brought to his attention.  Many of those fears are based on the assumption that the national transport authority will set out to damage public transport companies and will do everything it can to make life difficult for them.  That is not the intention of the legislation.  The two people who have been appointed as chair and chief executive of the authority are known to Deputy Broughan.  They are two very fair-minded individuals who will set the tone for the authority, as will the Bill.  The wish of the House, as expressed in the Bill, is that the authority will ensure a level playing field and an efficient and effective public transport system which will meet the needs of consumers without being a huge burden on the taxpayers.  The taxpayers must pay.  There will always be a taxpayers&rsquo; subvention for a public transport system.  There are very few places in the world where the public transport system does not require the support of taxpayers.  I have no difficulty with that.  However, we must ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is not wasted.  I would like to secure more taxpayers&rsquo; money for the public transport system.  At some time in the future we may do that but we cannot do so currently.  It is important that Members of this House, and particularly the Minister with responsibility for transport, can say that the taxpayers&rsquo; subvention for public transport is well spent.  The Bill will ensure that.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s concerns, while not stated as explicitly as he might like,  are contained in the Bill.  The provisions can be applied.  The fears about the Bill which have been raised are groundless.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(xiii) all relevant health and safety, labour and accessibility legislation and regulation and fair and reasonable salaries for all transport workers.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are critical.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s view of the Bill is predicated on these two amendments being adopted.  When the Bill is enacted there must be a level playing pitch in the bus market and the highest possible standards for workers in the industry must apply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Transport is a safety critical industry.  I think of the recent incident involving a Luas tram and a Dublin bus in O&rsquo;Connell Street, Dublin.  A few years ago there was a horrendous incident in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency involving a school bus.  It is very important the highest possible work standards are maintained for the protection and safety of passengers &mdash; the consumers &mdash; and for the provision of a high quality service.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 25 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(xiii) all relevant health and safety, labour and accessibility legislation and regulations and fair and reasonable salaries for all transport workers.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Health and safety goes without saying.  Recently we saw how the Health and Safety Authority rightly tried to get involved in investigations of horrendous collisions and crashes in the context of the state of national primary and secondary roads.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Michael Kennedy, might remember we discussed that at the Oireachtas Joint  Committee on Transport.  The highest possible health and safety standards in the industry are critical.  I heard Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments on the accessibility legislation.  A key requirement should be that the national transport authority takes responsibility for this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to existing labour legislation and regulations.  We spoke about phrases in legislation in other countries and different precedents.  The words &ldquo;fair and reasonable&rdquo; seemed useful in regard to salaries.  I hope that will preclude the kind of behaviour we saw in other parts of the transport industry in recent years.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport had a major discussion with Aer Lingus workers and management last Thursday afternoon.  There were many references to companies operating in this country with offshore workers and offshore contracting and subcontracting.  The hours and conditions of work and wages are very bad.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will get the chance in the next week or two to discuss the developing situation in Aer Lingus.  We believe Aer Lingus is being pulled in a race to the bottom, in particular by Ryanair and its standards and operations.  One need only look at the new amazing salary being offered to cabin crew, or offshore workers.  The Acting Chairman rightly expressed amazement and anger when he heard of the wages &mdash; &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,000 &mdash; being proffered to cabin crew being hired abroad, as we all did.</P>
        <P>We have had warnings about what can happen in a transport market if one is not vigilant.  We need to include this as a condition for the provision of licences in order that we will not have some operators doing what they like and treating their workers in a despicable way with the regulator not having the power to take action.</P>
        <P>I will refer later to the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Court, the industrial relations structures and so on.  The regulator, Mr. Gerry Murphy, must require people to adhere to fundamentally decent labour standards.  Everybody who wants to go into public transport provision, whether local, national, urban or rural, should have to adhere to these standards.  That is a reasonable request to make of a public service operator.  Will the Minister include that as a basic condition of licences?  I hope he supports that in order that we can support the Final Stages of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 26 adds to that.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) shall require the applicant to produce a statement confirming that they agree and that they accept that is a condition of the granting of the license that they will respect the established conditions of employment in the public transport sector, including respecting the rights of employees to engage in collective bargaining through a trade union.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That is a fundamental principle for us.  It is a huge bone of contention that I have had with Ryanair for the past decade or so.  The chief executive and the board of that company are not prepared to allow professional representation for their workers even though they get the best professional representation in regard to their own salaries and work conditions, as we have seen with Mr. O&rsquo;Leary, who is not prepared to give the same facility to his own workforce.</P><Col N="77"/>
        <P>We saw cases of victimisation of workers who tried to get professional representation from a trade union.  Ten or 11 years ago when I was enterprise, trade and employment spokesperson for my party, I introduced the trade union recognition Bill in the House.  As the Minister knows, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, did not take on board the full Bill, as presented, which would have made it essential for companies such as Ryanair to give full recognition.  I make no apologies for this.  Despite what certain people in the media and elsewhere believe, people have the right to professional representation and it is a critical component of how one operates.  Most of us have been used to it throughout our lives as workers and professionals.  It should be a basic requirement.</P>
        <P>I differ with Fine Gael in that it should not be the case that some companies adhere to decent, reasonable and sustainable standards in all these matters while other companies do what they like, turn out whatever kind of fleet they like and treat their workers whatever way they like.  We are determined to prevent a race to the bottom in the transport industry and in the provision of bus services.  While we recognise the need for reasonable competitive services, we are not prepared to allow the bus transport industry to go down that route because it will be detrimental to our citizens and our country.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 28 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) he or she [somebody who applies for a licence] complies strictly with the best labour, health and safety standards,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Amendment No. 29 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, line 38, after &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;indicating the discharge of all previous fiduciary taxes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A tax clearance certificate is required.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and I refer to the recent interesting study by the Comptroller and Auditor General on fiduciary taxes and the problems collecting them given company governance in this country.  The Committee of Public Accounts is making suggestions to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Revenue Commissioners.  If somebody has not discharged his or her fiduciary obligations to this nation in regard to his or her workers, he or she should not be able to get another licence.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 30 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) he or she complies with the highest health and safety and labour standards as defined in Irish and EU legislation.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That should be a requirement for somebody who wants to obtain a public bus licence.</P>
        <P>These amendments are critical to the Bill.  I agree with the principle of meeting the deadline of 3 December and of ensuring the very good work of our public service companies is protected and that in the future we have a modern licensing system.  There must be a level playing pitch for all companies.  There must not be one set of high and good standards for one group of companies and a lack of standards for others.  Will the Minister accept these amendments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his contribution but a fundamental point that must be reiterated is that anybody who operates a business, whether it be a transport business or some other business, must do so in accordance with the laws of the land.  If operators do <Col N="78"/>not do so, agencies of the State generally or active trade unionists are quick to highlight that, and that is as it should be.  I commend anybody who has been involved in highlighting that.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I indicated to the Deputy that the proposals in many of these amendments relate to issues that would be more properly addressed in the road transport operator licensing legislation.  While I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s bona fides in this respect, some people will argue that the same safety standards and conditions must be maintained for no reason other than to ensure the same inefficient practices and high costs apply to competitors as apply to themselves.  They will argue that rather than do what is currently being done in Dublin Bus and has happened, to a large extent, in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann, where practices have been changed and flexibilities have been increased to ensure the organisations become much more efficient.  For that reason I do not believe the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments are necessary in this legislation, as health and safety legislation, tax law and minimum wage legislation apply and will apply to anybody who will apply for a licence and enter this sector.  Under the transport operators licensing legislation that is to be introduced, I will make sure that is further reiterated.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s fundamental point and principle that we should not have a situation where a private operator or any other gains a competitive advantage by exploiting its workers.  I do not agree with that, nor I am sure does any Member of this House.  Anywhere it happens it should be stamped out.  I have no difficulty with that.  The amendments before us are unnecessary because what they seek to achieve is already covered in labour law, tax law and other legislation.</P>
        <P>I come from the constituency in which the unfortunate bus accident to which the Deputy referred took place.  The bus in question was a public transport school bus operated to the highest standards.  The other accident to which the Deputy referred involved a bus serving a route that is subvented.  Neither of those buses involved private sector operators, but I do not want to go down that route.  We have by and large a good record on public transport companies.  Private transport companies have a good record on road safety and employment.</P>
        <P>I dealt at great length with the amendments and told the Deputy of the strong advice that we received in respect of amendment No. 29 regarding fiduciary taxes.  That position has not changed.  The provision we have in this respect is a standard one that applies to all Government contracts.</P>
        <P>All the other issues raised by the Deputy were discussed at length on Committee Stage.  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s support for the general thrust of the legislation.  I acknowledge that and his efforts to improve the legislation, but I cannot deal with the amendments he has outlined in this legislation.  I have given him a commitment in regard to road transport operator licensing legislation to be introduced in the coming year.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 31 is probably more relevant to section 13, which facilitates the imposition of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The men and women who would run and work in companies that would receive licences under this legislation would hope that living standards would be central <Col N="79"/>at the start of this development.  We are failing them, if we do not insist on that.  I want to press amendment No. 25.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(3) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (2)</i>, the Authority shall invite and consider submissions from any local authority whose functional area includes a place to which the application relates.</P>

	<P>Has Deputy Broughan already spoken on this amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, amendment No. 27 was not in the group.  Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, were in the group.  It is a different amendment and one in which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kennedy, might be interested.  The amendment seeks to provide local authorities with a role in the licensing process and place it in legislation.  It is almost certain that local authorities will have a view on this and the Acting Chairman expressed strong views on the maintenance of some services in north Fingal.  It is very important to our constituents that councillors have an opportunity to make known their views on a licence application.  Under section 10(2) a local authority may but is not required to, as the Minister mentioned on Committee Stage, seek the views of any person.  The amendment would make it mandatory for local authorities to do so.</P>
        <P>During the debate in the Seanad, the Minister stated he might include a reference to local authorities but he did not want it to be a reserved function because it would cause delay.  My colleagues in the Seanad argued that was not democratic.  Surely it is a basic attribute of local authorities to have an interest in transport routes.  They are responsible for traffic management and constantly receive submissions on all aspects of local traffic and transport provision.  It would seem reasonable that local authorities would be involved at the licensing stage and that members would have a view.</P>
        <P>Often, the level of demand for a service was brought to the attention of the national bus company, Dublin Bus and other operators by Members of this House and councillors.  There has been a movement to try to take power away from councillors.  I believe strongly in the power of local government and I look back with great fondness at the 12 years I spent on Dublin City Council because of the work done by my local government colleagues and the officials in trying to run the city.  Transport is part of that and the Minister might give a direct role in licensing provisions to local authority members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This proposal seeks to introduce a requirement for the authority to invite and consider local authority submissions in the case of all bus licence applications.  It also stipulates that making a submission would be a reserved function of the local authority unless a period of 35 days elapses after which it would be an executive function.  As the Deputy pointed out, this was discussed at length in the other House and on Committee Stage.  I proposed an alternative amendment which clarifies that the authority may seek the views of any local authority in whose functional area the proposed public bus passenger services will operate.  That amendment now forms part of section 10(2)(<i>b</i>) in the text as amended by the select committee.  As this provision addresses the point made by the Deputy in his proposal in a manner that is consistent with the generic as opposed to specific approach adopted in this part, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0" el="5">This deals with the provisions on the authority&rsquo;s requirements for a licensee.  We had a lengthy discussion on it this afternoon.  I want the requirements for the grant of a licence to include that all of the operator&rsquo;s fleet be fully accessible.  The Minister will reply that this is covered in other legislation but accessibility should be a requirement of the transport legislation.  We have had a very long struggle to obtain lower entrances to buses and changes in the DART and train networks to try to bring about accessibility.  The Minister stated that one company has an 80% accessibility rate.  To have a level playing pitch we should require that all fleets be accessible and it should be part of the requirement to get a licence for a bus operation.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy proposed his amendment and set out my response to it.  He is correct that we have discussed this on several occasions.  The existing provision is adequate in that the condition can only be applied in respect of certain categories of licence until such time as all buses in the market are accessible.  We would not create a level playing field by including the proposed amendment.  The Disability Act 2005 will address the issue over a period of time and that is the fairest way to proceed. </P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) any requirements to post a bond or guarantees to protect the State in the event of bankruptcy or substantial non compliance with this Act or the conditions of the Licence.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment deals with key issues in respect of the provision of licences.  I previously mentioned the AerDart service which operated in my constituency for approximately 15 months before arbitrarily disappearing.  This is a protective measure for the State and the regulator which ensures that the withdrawal of a service would not greatly inconvenience commuters where an operator refuses to adhere to the conditions of a licence.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 52 provides for the revocation of a licence where the authority believes conditions have not been met or the agreed service has not been provided.  Again, this amendment seeks to protect the regulator and the State.  We held a long discussion on Committee Stage about minimum notice periods for the discontinuation of services and while the Minister gave us assurances regarding the revocation of licences, questions remain about the protection offered to the regulator and the State in the event of non-fulfilment of the conditions of a licence under this section.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We held a long discussion on the amendments proposed by Deputy Broughan on Committee Stage but my view has not changed.  It is unrealistic to expect that applicants for licences to provide public bus services on a commercial basis would be required to enter bonds or give guarantees in respect of the operation of those services if there is no cost or risk to the State.  I reiterate my response on Committee State to the effect that in considering applications for licences, the authority is empowered under section 10(3) to seek assurances that the applicant has the capacity to obtain the necessary financial and other resources to provide the service.  Linking of the requirement that an operator enters into a bond that would protect the State in the case of bankruptcy should be viewed against the absence of evidence that operators have abandoned or sought to revoke licences because of bankruptcy.  For these reasons, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have offered an example of a service which was withdrawn.  I am not sure of the licence conditions in that instance but I understand the licence remained outstanding for the service long after it had ceased.  Commuters would be gravely concerned if an operator ceased to provide a service arbitrarily because it was taken over by a foreign operator or wanted to wait upon more favourable political or economic conditions.  The Minister might like to reflect on these issues further.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 35: </P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 10, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) The Authority shall publish details of the levy scheme or any other mechanism it will utilise to finance the regulation of private operators.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">This amendment requires the authority to publish information on the ways it finances its operations.  We have in recent times discussed the difficulty of ensuring quangos and public agencies have sufficient resources to fulfil their responsibilities.  A number of quangos are self-financing.  A spectacular example of self-financing in the transport area is the taxi regulator, which was able to raise a significant level of funds to develop its programmes and create a surplus.  This amendment seeks to strengthen regulation by requiring the authority to promulgate the ways in which it raises revenue.  The intention of the Bill is to provide good regulation rather than the light touch approach taken in financial services, which let the country down badly by allowing people to engage in detrimental practices.  The Minister rightly called those who misbehaved in the banking sector economic traitors.  They almost bankrupted the country.  The Financial Regulator is a spectacular example of a failed regulatory system and we now have to establish a new way of regulating financial services.  We should not have departed from the single regulator model and allowed the Central Bank basically to have a regulatory function <Col N="85"/>under itself.  With the birth of a new transport regulator &mdash; the Dublin Transport Authority is operating only in shadow form &mdash; it is important to ensure the new body has power to generate the finances it needs to do a good job.  Regulation requires resources and costs money.  For this reason, the Bill should state in black and white that the national transport authority has the power to impose whatever levies it requires to regulate the sector in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Transport economics is a complex area for which high quality research is required.  It is important that the new chairperson of the national transport authority, Mr. John Fitzgerald, with whom Deputies have worked in the past, and Mr. Murphy have access to the best and widest possible research, including on best practice in other jurisdictions and so forth.  The amendment seeks to strengthen the role of the regulator by giving it a strong mandate and sufficient resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Some form of economic charge needs to be imposed.  I presume the levy will be imposed on everyone who applies for a licence.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.  Under Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendment, the levy would only apply to private operators.  If it is applied to all applicants for a licence, it should be set at a level that is not prohibitive.  It must be fair and equitable because many private bus companies are small operations with fewer than five buses.  They must operate in a competitive environment and one must consider that a levy a CIE company would regard as small may be substantial for a small, private operator.  I urge the Minister to ensure any levies are reasonable. </P>
        <P>While I am not certain how one would define the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, in setting the level of a levy consideration should be given to the economic circumstances of the applicant and the type of route for which the application is being made.  I presume the approach taken to public service obligations will differ from the approach to profitable routes.  If a company is being considered for a profit-making route, different economics should apply.  The levy applied to applicants seeking a licence for loss-making routes should not prohibit competition.  I oppose the amendment for this reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment provides for the potential to establish a levy on applications for licences.  As stated, section 12 gives the authority to determine the fees to be charged for bus licence applications under the Bill.  The fees are not refundable and will be used to defray the expenses of the authority.  They will also apply to everyone who applies for a licence.</P>
        <P>Section 12(4) proposes that the fees imposed for licences &ldquo;shall be applied for the purpose of meeting the expenses properly incurred by the Authority in the discharge of its functions.&rdquo;  The Bill adequately covers the point made by the Deputy.  The introduction, as proposed, of a levy to meet the cost of processing licences in addition to a fee structure could be open to challenge on the basis that it may be construed as a tax.  It is not permitted to impose such a tax in legislation of this nature.  As I outlined, I cannot accept the amendment for this reason.  However, it is expected that the authority will apply appropriate fees which will maintain a balance.  As it will discharge a number of different functions, the authority will obviously need to meet its costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">May the national transport authority use resources raised by the Commission for Taxi Regulation for any purpose?  This issue arose recently with regard to student registration fees when it was alleged a college was using these fees for purposes other than the welfare of students, the purpose for which the fees were collected.  A number of Deputies raised this matter in recent weeks.</P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>Representatives of the company which owns Citylink appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport recently.  The company, one of the wealthiest public limited companies on the planet, has massive resources at its disposal.  Contrary to what Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd naively imagines, the operators seeking licences will not be small companies with one or two buses but in many cases will be major companies which have come here to take over large chunks of the market.  It may be that these companies will decide among themselves which of them will have the market in Scotland, which will have the market in the Republic of Ireland and so forth.  This is how some of the individuals in question think.</P>
        <P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and the Minister&rsquo;s officials will confirm, the discussion the joint committee had with the chief executive of Citylink was one of the most astonishing hearings we have had.  The company appears to be prepared to ride roughshod over whatever regulation we implement.  It is important, therefore, that the regulator will have the resources needed to invigilate companies of this kind.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point on the levy, taxi drivers, some of whom are in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery, will argue that they were required to pay fees which were used as the income for the Commission for Taxi Regulation.  This is an important point.  I have received an e-mail in which the correspondent complains that the reason it is not intended that the national transport authority will have many resources is that the authority will not engage in regulation and we will have instead a free-for-all.  This fear will become more widespread if the regulator is not properly resourced.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Commission for Taxi Regulation will be merged in the new national transport authority and its staff will transfer to the new body and continue to enjoy the same rights.  The commission&rsquo;s income will become part of the resources available to the new authority.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation generated significant revenue because the number of taxi licences issued increased significantly.  This source of revenue is diminishing rapidly as fewer taxi licences are approved.</P>
        <P>I share Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s objective to introduce regulated competition.  That is the thrust of the Bill.  We do not want anyone engaging in predatory behaviour, whether a native company or otherwise.  It will be an important function of the regulator to prevent such behaviour.  The powers available in the legislation, including the power to revoke licences and take good repute into consideration, will be enormously helpful to the regulator in ensuring we have a good and well regulated market for consumers.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 11, line 4, after &ldquo;taken&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and/or geographical area covered&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment adds &ldquo;geographical area covered&rdquo; to the route to be taken in the section dealing with the attachment of conditions for licences.  I thought of this in respect of the local transport network.  We should think about networks as well as routes.  I hope we get good news in the transport section of the budget on 9 December and that the axe will not be struck on the rural transport network.  Many people around the country are counting on the Minister to make sure this does not happen in Cabinet and to ensure that the network survives.  The amendment tries to enable the development of flexible and demand responsive services.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 38 deals with the standards for licences.  Section 13(<i>i</i>) refers to the &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; accessibility standards, and I wondered why the Minister did not include the highest of standards, given the battle we have had over the years for accessibility for citizens with disability.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this one last time, as we had a long discussion about it on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>In amendment No. 39, I wanted to add the following to the section 13:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>j</i>) compliance with all health and safety, labour and employment legislation, regulations and standards including those on salary and work conditions,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We have had two votes on this, which the Minister has not been able to support.  This is the last chance he has to put into the section dealing with conditions for licences a key condition related to health and safety, labour and employment legislation, regulations and standards, including those on salary and work conditions.  He has stated that he will bring another Bill before us dealing with commercial transport operators.  I have been waiting for the two and a half years of the lifetime of this D&aacute;il for this Bill, even though it was on the first cl&aacute;r when the Government was formed.  We are still waiting.  My predecessor as spokesperson for transport, Deputy Shortall, waited four or five years for the legislation to be brought before the House.  The Minister&rsquo;s statement is aspirational rather than reality politics.  I would like the Minister to reconsider this one last time.</P>
        <P>I would like to be able to support the basic principle of the development of our transport network under EU Regulation 1320 of 2007.  However, on these critical issues which relate to worker conditions and salaries, I am precluded from doing so as the Minister is not prepared to come the extra mile with us.  In two votes this evening, slim margins of four and three in the House decided that we would not have references to worker protections in this Bill.  There are clearly people in the Minister&rsquo;s party who have grave problems with not accepting this amendment and the earlier amendments.</P>
        <P>In amendment No. 40, I want to add &ldquo;the inclusion of Automatic Vehicle Location or similar technology to support Real Time Passenger Information and the general management of the public transport network&rdquo; to section 13.  In the 1989 general election, when I first stood for my party, people spoke at the time about integrated transport and real time information, so that one could stand at the bus stop on the quays and see the time of the arrival of the next bus.  It has taken us 20 years to get closer to that reality.  We are asking that AVL, real time infor<Col N="88"/>mation and all the other important modern transport infrastructure would be included as a condition for granting the licence.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 41 calls for minimum notice periods for services to be revoked.  The public would not be left in the lurch and all operators &mdash; public or private &mdash; would have to adhere to such notice periods on every route.  That is a fair requirement.  Amendment No. 42 calls for minimum notice periods for amendments to services and requirements for public consultation.  The Minister has set himself against widespread consultation before any service is changed.  If any route is being changed, the commuter should be consulted and there should be a minimum notice period for this, so that people would not just find out at the last minute that the bus serving the road on which they live has disappeared.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 43 calls for the provision and maintenance of essential bus infrastructure for all users and modern bus fleets, as indicated in regulation by the national transport authority.  This means that the authority would insist on certain basic standards.  When he was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government many years ago, I used to question him about the safety features on vehicles, which was within his Department&rsquo;s remit at that time.  I used to raise issues like the lighting system, the fact that vehicles are legally imported into the country without a rear windscreen wiper.  One might meet vehicles on a rainy night that had peculiar, dazzling lights.  The transport regulator would have a view on that in respect of buses.  It should require the highest standards before granting a licence.</P>
        <P>There are two basic points in these amendments.  They are similar to the amendments I tabled to the section on provisions and they require the best possible standards and wages for workers, and the best possible fleets and safety features for commuters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 37 refers to geographical areas.  I addressed this issue on Committee Stage and in response to amendments Nos. 2, 6 and 7, so the Deputy will understand if I do not go back to it again.  Amendment No. 38 refers to accessibility standards.  We have had a fair amount of discussion on this.  The important issue on such standards is that the authority may apply conditions to licences that are consistent with the national requirements as they evolve.  That is exactly what section 13(2) achieves.  It gives the flexibility to the authority to apply the standards as they evolve nationally, as the targets are set by Government and as final timescales come into play.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 39 was discussed at length with amendments Nos. 25, 26 and 28 to 30, inclusive.  I have assured the Deputy in regard to the legislation on the road passenger operators&rsquo; licences, and we will have that discussion at a later stage.  I also made it clear that I agree with the concept the Deputy is pursuing.  It is not a matter of a difference in opinion or principle.  We are both of a mind in this regard but this is not the appropriate legislation for it.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 40 to 43, inclusive, provide for the insertion of a series of provisions to subsection (2), including to provide for automatic vehicle location, AVL.  Many companies, whether public or private, will want this system at various stages and, given the development of intelligent transport systems, it will become more of a feature.  However, imposing it as a requirement may be unnecessary in respect of many bus services and, for that reason, it would not be fair to impose it on every company for every service.  For example, why would services that have no intermediate stopping points and which simply travel from one location to another need AVL?  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to apply a requirement for AVL in respect of all types of commercial bus services.  However, there is nothing to prevent the authority imposing a condition in respect of AVL in circumstances where it deems it to be appropriate.  Again, the Bill gives the authority power and discretion that it can use.  It must also be <Col N="89"/>recalled that the AVL system has not yet been rolled out in respect of the subvented bus services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, although it is being rolled out.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 43 would potentially require bus operators applying for licences to establish support infrastructure for the use of the proposed service.  It is obviously in the interest of operators to have the necessary structures to support their operators but, again, it is not appropriate for the State or the authority to determine the requirements for such structures.  The market will decide that in many respects.  If a bus operator operates in particular areas which are not very comfortable for passengers, by the very nature of the competition that is involved, the operator will either provide the structures or will probably go out of business.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 deal with the minimum notice period for services to be revoked.  This has to be seen against the fact that there has been virtually no history of operators revoking licences.  Again, it is open to the authority to consider the need for such a provision if it considers that it might be of some practical use.  It can do this if it decides it needs to have such a provision.  It is not necessary to have it in legislation.</P>
        <P>Where service is amended, the licence must also be amended in accordance with section 14, so it is obviously in the interest of the operator to give notice.  In any event, it is expected that all details of licences will be available for the information of the public on the authority website.  In light of that, it is not necessary to pursue amendment No. 42.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 seem to be based on the presumption that the authority does not have to approve amendments to the licence.  That is not the case.  All amendments to a licence will have to be approved by the authority under section 14.  Where an operator has not complied with amendments which would not be in his or her interest because he or she would have proposed them in the first place, the operator is committing an offence.  Section 14(4)(<i>a</i>) also clearly establishes that where the holder of a licence alters the public bus service to which the licence applies without obtaining an amended licence under this section, the licence holder is committing an offence.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 46, section 14(3) makes it clear that the provisions of sections 10 to 13 will apply to applications under this section.  As is the case with the proposed amendment No. 5 to section 10, this amendment appears to envisage that the authority would advertise applications for the amendment of bus licences and seek submissions from the public.  Again, the same arguments that are used about commercial confidentiality and so on apply in this regard.</P>
        <P>The series of amendments the Deputy proposes are catered for currently within the Bill and are not necessary.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw them.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment deals with the operation of the licences.  I want to insert a subsection (4) to deal with the licensing of certain existing passenger bus services.  The amendment arose from discussions within the transport industry with reference to subsection (3), which allows for the expiration of all existing licences granted under the 1932 Act after two years.  The Minister needs to provide guidance through regulation as to how existing providers of urban bus services will have a chance to tender for services awarded under Part 3, Chapter 2 of the DTA Act of 2008.

        <P>The continued operation of funded bus services by the State companies has already been addressed through section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and both Bus &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath will be free to submit tenders for new subvented services in respect of their dedicated areas of operation where the authority seeks such submissions under section 48 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.

Within the transport industry there is a feeling that the decision of a deciding officer alone may be unfair and that there should be some other level of appeal besides going directly to the Circuit Court.  We are very familiar with the planning process, where there is a decision by a local authority and people go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la if they are unhappy with the decision or we want to put a case for our constituents.  The national transport authority, acting as a board, might make a decision on this if somebody felt hard done by at the licensing stage.  This would be relevant if people had a genuine case, as putting it to the board would mean a deciding officer would not have the last word on the matter.</P><Col N="91"/>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?>
        <P>We have had many discussions about this over the years with regard to planning and social welfare.  When I was the Labour spokesman on social and family affairs, I remember advocating an independent statutory appeals system.  I had drafted heads of a Bill in that regard that would keep the systems separate.  The Department might argue that this is the case under existing legislation but we felt it should have been ring-fenced because of concerns that constituents would have sometimes.</P>
        <P>In this regard we should have another level of appeal in this sector without the need to go to the court system.  We met an operator some weeks ago at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport who did not seem worried about going into court and going through costly legal procedures.  He seemed to feel that while this would happen, he would run the opposition &mdash; including Bus &Eacute;ireann &mdash; off the road.  We would effectively be left with GoBus, which is a massive multinational operator, as our operator on the Galway to Dublin route.</P>
        <P>This is an attempt to have another level of adjudication on a licence, which may be particularly valuable to smaller operators.  I speak for such operators, who if this amendment were accepted might not have to go straight to the court system if they were turned down for a licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The appeals system established in section 22 provides that officers specifically appointed for that purpose by the chief executive officer of the authority will determine the appeals, and those appeals officers will act independently in the performance or functions set out in the section.  It is not unusual and the Deputy referred to the social welfare appeals process, where medical card appeals are operated on the same principle.  People have recourse afterwards to go to the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>The main reason for this type of appeal system is that it will be a faster and more efficient way of making an appeal.  I have discussed with the Deputy the possibility of the board of the authority performing this appeal function but I would not favour it.  The board has a specific corporate governance role to play and the executive and management have another role to play; the two should not overlap.</P>
        <P>This section outlines our proposed process, which will bring about an efficient, effective and inexpensive procedure.  I ask the Deputy to accept it.</P>

	<P>Different deciding officers will make these decisions.  The person making a decision could be the same rank as somebody who has already made a decision.  The view may be independent but it may not get people very much further if they feel that they have been turned down on a proposal that is genuine, sustainable and an addition to public transport services.  I hope it will not be something we live to regret because many of these cases end up in court.  I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 16, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) Bus Eireann has the exclusive right to ownership and responsibility for planning and operating the provincial and urban bus network outside of the Greater Dublin Area.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This relates to the guidelines.  The amendment looks to insert what I felt would be basic good requirements for licensing law.  The group of amendments resemble amendments I have addressed already so I will be brief.</P>
        <P>The amendment inserts a critical provision which the Minister does not refer to in the Bill.  He might feel that he has accepted a necessity for longer-term contracts under European legislation for the two State bus companies.  The issue is that a network exists, and any time we have met Mr. Tim Hayes, the chief executive of Bus &Eacute;ireann, he has made the basic point to the Oireachtas committee that he runs a network, which can be seen on a map of the country and which has a critical role in keeping connectivity and giving alternatives to the 20% of rural dwellers who do not have their own car or access to private transport.  The grave concern is that we will allow the network to be gradually eroded.  I made the point earlier in discussing the Bill.</P>
        <P>The simplest way to proceed is to indicate that Bus &Eacute;ireann will maintain the network.  We are used to having semi-State and commercial State bodies with a designated operator of the network.  Effectively, part of the ESB is designated as the network manager.  In the previous D&aacute;il the Minister had responsibility for this area and I was the Labour spokesperson on it.  We have effectively given the ESB a mandate which emerged through our discussions in the last D&aacute;il to be the sustainable network manager for the country.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is a different business but it is analogous.  It would be useful for the Minister to accept amendment No. 60.</P>
        <P>This is a series of amendments which seek to add to the guidelines.  Amendment No. 61 would insert &ldquo;all operators, fleets and bus infrastructure [would] comply with the highest health, safety and accessibility legislation, regulations and standards,&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 62 would insert a new paragraph (<i>e</i>), which would read &ldquo;maintain the highest standard of working conditions with fair and reasonable salaries for all transport workers including those established by collective agreement obligations,&rdquo;.  I made this point earlier and we voted on it.  This is the last opportunity for the Minister to come on board the bus of fairness to ensure this is in the legislation.  Unfortunately, if the legislation is unclear or is without guidelines, people will take advantage of it.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 62.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 63 provides a new subsection which would ensure the legislation would &rdquo;(<i>f</i>) have due regard for the development of a fully integrated national bus transport network including the provision of local rural transport services,&rdquo;.  This is my last chance to make a plea that the rural transport service be allowed survive budget cuts next Wednesday week.  We hope that the desolation we will have to cope with at the next general election will not include the rural transport network which is doing a great job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In amendment No. 64 I provide for paragraph (<i>g</i>) &ldquo;shall include requirements for public consultation,&rdquo;.  I continue to call for the need for public consultation and if I was amending the Bill in the future, I would go with this.  However, I understand the Minister&rsquo;s point with regard to commercial sensitivities.  Amendment No. 65 provides the section &ldquo;shall include minimum notice periods to revoke or amend licenses,&rdquo;.  This is a point I raised already.</P><Col N="93"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 66 deals with an issue we have not had a chance to deal with, although the Minister said he might take another look at it.  This amendment is based on my reading of the Office of Fair Trading report on the British market.  The amendment suggests including in the guidelines a clause that would specify anti-competitive practices and abuses.  The key issue in this regard is exclusivity.  This basically means the practice where an operator runs a bus just ahead of, and possibly behind, another bus making it difficult for a company to draw up a development plan in the face of this messing and anti-competitive behaviour.  We know from transport literature that the public tends to take the first bus because fares are usually similar.  Other practices I have mentioned are salami-slicing and gaming of routes, which were spectacularly identified by the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom.  We must try to avoid this happening here by ensuring we provide in the legislation to prevent it.  The Minister&rsquo;s guidelines have not specified any well-known anti-competitive practices in either regulated or deregulated transport markets.  I urge him to consider covering this issue by including a provision on the lines of amendment No. 66.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 60 is not appropriate to the Bill as it has no direct relevance to the licensing of public bus passenger services.  Under Part 2, exclusive rights have been afforded to Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to the continued provision of the public bus services currently being provided by the company, as outlined in section 52(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  That right is mandated by the need to ensure the continued operation of services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann will, obviously, retain the role of planning the services it provides within the exclusive rights referenced in section 52, subject to the provisions of that section.  However, given that the role of deciding on the needs that exist for new networks has been given to the national transport authority under section 48 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, it would not be appropriate to grant that type of exclusivity to Bus &Eacute;ireann, as envisaged in the amendment.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.  Outside of the area mentioned, planning for new networks will be the job of the NTA from now on.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 were discussed at some length on Committee Stage and again here.  My position remains the same with regard to those amendments.  Amendment No. 63 is also linked to amendments already discussed under section 10.  I reiterate that the protection and integrity of the national, urban and local bus networks is already specifically in place.  Amendment No. 64 raises the issue of public consultation, an issue we have dealt with on several occasions.  We have gone as far as we can in that regard.  Including this would not be appropriate for once-off events and the like.  Section 10(2) already provides that the authority can seek information from any source, which covers the issue.</P>
        <P>The requirement for a minimum notice period for services to be revoked is proposed in amendment No. 65.  This is linked to amendments proposed on sections 13 and 14.  This issue has already been discussed.  It is a matter for the authority to consider the need for such a provision and if it considers this might be of some practical use, it can do it.  I do not consider this a matter for primary legislation.  With regard to amending licences, I mentioned that such amendments must be noted in accordance with section 14.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 66 is already facilitated, in the context of its consideration of applications, under the provision of section 10 of the Bill.  A further reference in section 23 is neither appropriate nor necessary.  The guidelines must be published in draft form as a result of amendment No. 67, which will be considered shortly.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport will be presented with a draft of the guidelines and have the opportunity to present its comments.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is based on the premise that there will be deregulation of the bus market, which is not what the Bill proposes.  It provides <Col N="94"/>there will be regulated competition in the market for commercial services, a fact that is clearly established in the expanded section 10 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act as provided for in section 29 of the Bill.  On those grounds, I ask Deputy Broughan to withdraw the amendments.</P>

	<P Just="Left">These amendments go to the heart of the difference between the different parties with regard to the Bill.  Some of the amendments are restrictive and would restrict fair and open competition between the public and private sector, particularly the Labour Party proposal that Bus &Eacute;ireann would have exclusive right to ownership and responsibility for planning and operating the provincial and urban bus network outside of the greater Dublin area.  If that was passed, it would negate the principle of the Bill, which is to open up the area and make the national transport authority the sponsoring authority for all proposed networks and changes to them.  Notwithstanding the excellent work of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the connection and positive interaction it has with the private sector on routes throughout the country, if the Minister accepted the amendment, it would mean Bus &Eacute;ireann would become the dominant and sole influence in what would happen and where and why it would happen.</P>
        <P>There are more than 6,000 people working in the private bus sector, providing transport throughout the country.  The majority of these are small operators, not the big multinational operators one finds in the United Kingdom.  The majority of the operators here function in the community and provide local services, bingo and school buses and provide for the needs of local clubs and so on.  It is only right that when such companies reach a stage when they could tender for other routes, they should be able to compete with Bus &Eacute;ireann and other companies for routes that would suit their needs and size.  It is a key point of Fine Gael policy that such companies are able to compete, whether a PSO route or not is involved.  We cannot sustain a system &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This debate is particularly timely and it is an opportunity for the House to focus on the undoubted potential of the Irish agrifood sector to contribute significantly to the recovery of the economy.  I express my sympathy to all those who have been badly affected by the flooding in recent days.  I am aware, from my Department&rsquo;s assessment, of the impact of the flooding on the agricultural community.  The Government discussed the impact of the flooding at its meeting yesterday and has agreed to the allocation of &euro;2 million for a targeted fodder aid scheme, which will complement a wider humanitarian aid scheme to assist those communities most badly affected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This has been a particularly difficult year, with low commodity prices, currency difficulties, particularly with sterling, and weakened demand at home and abroad.  The global economic turmoil continues to have its effects on all sectors.  Throughout the year, I have continued to work actively at EU level on the most effective use of market support measures, notably for the benefit of the dairy sector.  In view of the importance of export markets for Irish food products, the importance of such market support measures cannot be underestimated.  I have also consistently raised the imbalance in the food chain with the increasing power of the multiples.  The potential of the Irish agrifood sector has long been recognised by the Government but it is all the more important in current economic circumstances that it is kept in sharp focus.  The Forf&aacute;s report, Sharing our Future 2025, points to the importance of the agrifood sector, realising its further growth potential and maintaining its place as an important part of the national economy and of strategic relevance in food security.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agrifood sector is operating in a dynamic environment and, to harness the sector&rsquo;s potential, we cannot afford to standstill.  A new direction is needed for the agrifood sector and new thinking is required on what needs to be done, as more of the same will not be enough.  It is for this reason that the Department and five State agencies &mdash; Bord Bia, Teagasc, Enterprise Ireland, BIM and the Marine Institute &mdash; have completed significant work on a new strategy for the development of the agrifood and fishing sector for the period up to 2020.  The Department has long been of the opinion that the agrifood sector should consistently take a medium-term view, to be renewed periodically, and the development of medium-term strategies has been a feature of our work for a considerable time, as evidenced by previous Agri Vision 2010 and Agri Vision 2015 strategies.  Those who have made recent comments, with which I wholeheartedly agree, about the need for a new medium-term strategy seem to have been unaware of the advanced nature of the work on the Agri Vision 2020 strategy.  The work that has been done to date has involved the preparation of a series of papers on the main sectors.  These papers are almost complete.  They will give an informed basis to a web-based public consultation process and request for submissions, which I hope to initiate very shortly. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will have an important input into this work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take this opportunity to repeat my invitation to all those with a stake in the Irish agrifood sector to participate actively in the 2020 process, to stimulate debate and help chart the course for the future.  I know there are no easy answers, but I am convinced that, unless the 2020 strategy gives concrete direction to the industry as a whole, it will be a lost opportunity to maximise the potential of the sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am anxious that the Agri Vision 2020 strategy will maintain the impetus gained from the very successful Agri Vision 2015 report and action plan.  The new strategy will take full account of new global and market realities, where agriculture and food are central to the major global challenges of food security and climate change.  The plan will focus on the critical issue of <Col N="97"/>competitiveness, the challenges from the global economic downturn, currency fluctuations, climate change and how best to maximise the opportunities arising from a growing international food and energy crops market.  We also will be investing considerably in research and development over the next few years, as it applies to the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the competitiveness issues affecting our economy and the particular effect, especially when combined with the currency difficulties, on the food industry.  The broad thrust of the Government&rsquo;s approach is to take every possible step to help improve our competitive base.  This is not an easy process but is one being afforded the highest priority and persistence.</P>
        <P>The establishment of NAMA is a critical step in the Government&rsquo;s efforts to achieve a properly functioning banking system.  We all appreciate the importance of getting credit working through the system, particularly, for example, given the ongoing credit difficulties being experienced in the farming sector.  I am acutely conscious of those difficulties and I have maintained close contact with the Irish Banking Federation and the major banks, which gives me the opportunity to impress upon them in very clear terms the short-term liquidity difficulties experienced by farmers and the wider industry and, in particular, the need to extend normal working capital facilities to farmers.  My most recent meeting with the Irish Banking Federation and the chief agricultural advisers of all the banks was earlier this evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following my request, the European Commission agreed in May 2009 to an advance payment of 70% of single farm payments from 16 October to assist farmers experiencing difficulties in the dairy market and other sectors.  As a result, more than &euro;850 million has been paid to 120,000 farmers since last month. These payments have been a full six weeks earlier than provided for under the rules of the scheme and the level of advance payment, at 70%, is unprecedented.  Following the issue of the 70% advance payments, my Department will begin issuing the 30% balancing payments from next Tuesday, 1 December 2009, when 98% of the remaining balance will be paid out.  Assuming all applications are cleared for payment, a further &euro;380 million will be paid to Irish farmers, bringing to &euro;1.24 billion the total amount paid between October and December.  It is worth putting on record that we have the most efficient system in the European Union for the disbursement of money under the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>In further recognition of the income difficulties experienced by farmers, I have secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to request the D&aacute;il to approve a Supplementary Estimate for my Department.  This will allow me to bring forward some &euro;85 million in payments under the farm waste management scheme and the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, which would otherwise have fallen to be paid in the new year.  If the Supplementary Estimate is approved, my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on REPS this year will reach a record level of &euro;369 million, paid to a record number of 62,000 participants.  In addition, spending on the farm waste management scheme for 2009 will be &euro;286 million and by the end of January, Exchequer spending on the scheme will be approximately &euro;1 billion, totally funded by our Exchequer.  I expect we will have the opportunity to debate this Supplementary Estimate in the next week or so and I hope all parties will support the proposal.</P>
        <P>The price farmers get for product represents the most important way farmers can enhance their incomes.  Unfortunately, we have experienced a significant weakness in prices achieved for dairy, beef and cereals this year.  We are all aware of the particular difficulties the dairy sector has experienced and, thankfully, there have been some signs of price recovery in recent weeks.  Obviously, we all hope this necessary price improvement will continue.</P>
        <P>The past year has clearly demonstrated the value of market management mechanisms which prevented a bad situation from becoming worse.  In the course of last year&rsquo;s CAP health check negotiations, I was to the forefront in arguing for the retention of these measures and, as a <Col N="98"/>result of the pressure which I and subsequently a number of my colleagues brought to bear on the Commission, many of these measures were activated to help stabilise a very difficult position.  Equally, in recent months, an increasing number of member states, of which Ireland was a central player, pressed the Commission to address the difficulties in the dairy sector.  The outcome was positive, with agreement on the need to maintain the effective use of market measures, including intervention and private storage aid, as well as the introduction of what will now be a &euro;300 million dairy fund, as a means of providing direct support to dairy farmers.  I have impressed on the Commissioner, and she accepts the point, that there has to be a very controlled release of butter and skimmed milk powder from intervention stocks to avoid any negative shock to prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the key outcomes negotiated in the health check was the agreement to abolish milk quotas in 2015.  This is unquestionably in Ireland&rsquo;s interest and I am particularly pleased the decision was recently reaffirmed by the EU Agriculture Council.  In relation to quota abolition, we are on a road of no return.  The industry must now focus on dealing with the challenges and opportunities the abolition of the milk quota will bring. One immediate benefit of the abolition of quotas was my ability to allocate 14 million litres to 70 new entrants to dairying under a new entrants&rsquo; scheme.  These are young farmers who have a genuine future in the industry and the scheme was an outstanding success, both in terms of the quantity and quality of applicants.  In terms of the further 1% of additional quota that will be available next year, I intend to consider how the scope of the scheme may be expanded to new and recent entrants.  There will be an even greater focus on providing quota for new entrants.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the industry is weathering a very difficult period, exacerbated by very dramatic price volatility.  I am hopeful that we have now turned a corner.  That is very important because the outlook for prices in the medium term is positive, due to significant world demand for dairy products based on an increasing world population and economic growth in developing countries.  For an industry that exports 85% of its produce, valued last year at &euro;2.3 billion, the anticipated growth in world demand should bring real benefits.</P>
        <P>The beef industry is even more dependent on exports with more than 90% of production exported.  As important as export earnings are to the economy, this level of export-dependence makes the sector susceptible to fluctuations and trends in international and EU markets.  The global economic downturn has seen consumers curtail spending and a consequential decline in beef consumption throughout Europe this year.  This fall has been especially noticeable at the high value end of the market, a segment of the market specifically targeted in recent years by Irish producers and processors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nonetheless, as in the dairy sector, the medium-term prospects are encouraging.  Rising population levels, improved standards of living that are forecast, growing urbanisation and changing dietary patterns, particularly in Asia, are all contributing to increasing food demand.  Furthermore, the EU Commission has estimated that EU beef and veal production is expected to decline by almost 5% by 2015.  This will lead to a supply gap within the EU of 600,000 tonnes by 2015, providing market opportunities for efficient market producers.  I believe Irish producers are well placed to benefit from these opportunities.  Apart from the sectoral challenges and opportunities, one of the most significant issues that will impact on the future of the agrifood industry is the shape of the future Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. While funding arrangements for the Common Agricultural Policy are fixed until 2013 under the current EU financial perspectives, all aspects of the EU budget are currently being reviewed.  This will be followed by negotiations to determine the composition of the next financial perspectives of the EU from 2014 to 2020, including the funding available for agriculture and rural development.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>In the negotiation on the new financial perspectives there will be competing pressures for funds including pressure for less money overall for CAP, as a share of the EU budget and in absolute terms.  In this regard, the recently leaked Commission draft paper is of concern to us in that it advocates major policy changes and lower funds for CAP.  We have serious concerns at some of the options mooted in the leaked document from the Commission on the budget review.  There is speculation that it will be subject to significant re-writing, and we will press for that.  We have a particular concern at the notion of co-financing of direct payments.  In current circumstances, this obviously would be unaffordable for Ireland and for many other member states.  More fundamentally, it would arguably represent re-nationalisation of the only real common policy of the EU.</P>
        <P>Decision making on the Financial Perspectives will, for the first time, come within the co-decision process where the European Parliament as well as the Council of Ministers has to agree to the results.  This is obviously a more open and democratic process.  However, it leads to some uncertainty about the outcome, as it is new.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our overarching view is that we need a strong and adequately resourced CAP after 2013.  This is a point I have pressed strongly in discussions to date and for which there is good support in the Agriculture Council.  In view of the new co-decision making process, I want to work with our MEPs to ensure the best outcome for Ireland and for the Irish agrifood sector.  That engagement has begun with all MEPs.</P>
        <P>Food security and climate change are key challenges to be addressed in the coming years.  By 2030, the planet will need to produce 50% more food, with less land, water and energy as inputs.  Food companies are faced with the challenge of meeting the needs of an ever increasing population while at the same time, limiting the impact of their activities on the environment.</P>
        <P>Speaking recently on the occasion of the World Food Day 2009, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for food and horticulture, Deputy Sargent, made the following point:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">We need to consider where our food comes from and our joint responsibility to achieve food security.  Even in a developed country like Ireland, it is incumbent on us to consider our own food security and, furthermore, how our natural advantages and expertise in food production can be leveraged to assist in meeting long-term increased global demand.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">As I said at the outset, this is an important and timely debate.  There are clear challenges facing the Irish agrifood sector but importantly as well, great opportunities for the growth and development of the sector.  It is a sector of enormous economic and social benefit to the country, particularly in our rural and coastal communities.</P>
        <P>We need to have a serious analysis of the sector based on the facts and realities and not based on rhetoric and soundbites.  No more than any other sector in the economy, the agriculture sector has not been immune from the difficult choices the Government has had to make.  No analysis of the sector and its prospects can conveniently ignore the fiscal realities.  Despite the difficulties in the public finances, the Government is investing a record level of &euro;369 million in funding for REPS in 2009.  Within a matter of weeks, total spending on the farm waste management scheme will have reached &euro;1 billion, by an enormous distance the highest ever on-farm investment in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>The new on-farm facilities provided over the past number of years have been extremely important in recent years when we have had extremes of rainfall and very difficult conditions.  Most farmers have been able to put their cattle in appropriate housing accommodation.  It is very important investment for the farming community.</P>
        <P>When the future of the Irish pork industry was threatened last December, the Government acted swiftly to secure the industry by restoring public confidence and by providing a financial <Col N="100"/>facility worth up to &euro;200 million.  These are the actions of a Government committed to securing an industry&rsquo;s future and viability, in this case a production and processing industry worth &euro;1.1 billion annually and employing 6,500 people and 500 farm families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish agrifood industry is worth in excess of &euro;8 billion annually in exports to more than 170 countries.  It has proven to be robust and resilient.  It has faced and overcome challenges in the past and I have no doubt that it will emerge from this current challenging environment well-placed and conditioned to take advantage of the undoubted opportunities.</P>
        <P>The 2020 Agri Vision strategy presents an opportunity for everybody with a stake in this most important of sectors to contribute constructively to the development of an updated vision for the next decade.  The sector will have to be flexible, creative and innovative and one of the most efficient in Europe, which is it at present.</P>
        <P>I am optimistic and positive about the industry&rsquo;s future, notwithstanding the serious difficulties faced this year.  I am confident about its potential to contribute to the recovery of the economy.  The Government recognises that potential and I want to work with the industry and all those involved, from the primary producer right through the chain, to ensure that the sector reaches its potential and maximises the contribution it can make to the growth and development of the economy nationally and, equally important, to the many local communities and economies throughout the country.</P>
        <P>One of the main issues confronting agriculture over the next few years will be the review of the Common Agricultural Policy and the need for the European Union to ensure adequate budgetary facilities are provided to have a well-resourced Common Agricultural Policy for the benefit of consumers.  Over the past year in particular, the power of the multiples has been of serious concern to everybody involved in the food chain.  We have seen the deficiencies in the food chain with the primary producer and, in many instances, the processor not getting adequate return for their product.</P>
        <P>I refer to unfounded commentary outside and inside this House in regard to Exchequer funding for the Department.  The initial budget in 2008 for the Department was &euro;1.89 million.  By the end of that year, the Department had allocated well excess of &euro;2 billion under the various schemes.  This year, with the approval of this House, we will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, a sure sign and evidence of my commitment and that of the Government to supporting the agriculture sector through what is a very difficult period.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Crawford.</P>

	<P>We are two weeks from the budget and I want the Minister to leave the Chamber tonight with one message ringing in his ears, namely, that there is no scope whatever for further savings in farm gate schemes.  If he needs proof of that, he should read the Teagasc farm income survey of 2008 which shows that farm incomes in 2008 fell by an average of 13%.  Today&rsquo;s figures show that farm incomes in 2009 have fallen by 28%.  </P>
        <P>Yesterday this country came to a standstill because people with secure employment and secure pension provision feared a cut in their pay.  I have some sympathy but this House must respond to an industry which, over two years, has taken a cumulative cut in income of 41%.  No other sector has taken that kind of cut in income.  To put that in context, the Teagasc farm income survey showed that the average family farm income in the beef sector in 2008 was &euro;7,700.</P><Col N="101"/>
        <P>I am not saying there is no scope for efficiencies and savings in the departmental budget but I am stating clearly two weeks from the budget that there is no scope whatever for savings in farm gate schemes.  There has been much comment on the McCarthy report in which efficiencies were identified.  I agree with many of them but others are off the wall.  The core message with which the Minister must leave this Chamber is that there is no scope for savings in farm gate schemes.</P>
        <P>I will deal briefly with a number of sectoral issues.  I refer to the beef sector.  Evidence was published last week that in the past 12 months, the suckler cow herd has declined by 6%.  I believe that figure to be a complete underestimate.  I suspect the trend will be similar to what has happened in the sheep sector where breeding ewe numbers have dropped by almost 50% in a decade.  I suspect the figure will be closer to a cumulative cut by the end of this year in the region of 20%.  That is sufficient to undermine our beef industry, which is a huge employer in the economy.  I have never been a great admirer of the suckler cow welfare scheme.  It was flawed in its detail but in the current climate, we cannot countenance any interference with that scheme in the budget.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to roll up his sleeves and get involved in the introduction of a quality payment system in the beef sector.  The negotiations between the industry and the primary producers have dragged on too long.  I acknowledge there will be winners and losers in a quality payment system but for full-time beef farmers, we can no longer have a situation where quality production is not rewarded to the fullest extent possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the past decade, our dependence on the UK market has increased substantially to a situation where 54% of our beef production goes to the UK.  If we cast our minds back to the 1990s, we will remember that most of our beef production went to Egypt, which was our single biggest market.  The most lucrative market for us is mainland Europe.  Given the current sterling difficulties, we are excessively dependent on the UK market.</P>
        <P>Live exports are a very important aspect, although not for the volume of live exports of finished cattle but for the price setting mechanism they establish.  The Minister and the T&aacute;naiste are complicit in national sabotage of the beef industry by failing to take on the meat factories which are colluding to deny the opportunity of slaughtering live exports in their UK owned plants.  It is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>We are paying good money under the beef investment fund &mdash; almost &euro;50 million &mdash; to the main plants in this country to improve their facilities.  That is as it should be but we have leverage to bring these companies to heel and ensure this national sabotage does not continue.</P>
        <P>We continue to provide several hundred work permits to the industry annually at a time when the number of unemployed has increased by 200,000 in the past 12 months.  There were proposals by the Department to F&Aacute;S to introduce a processing, butcher and deboning training scheme to replace those people but for some unknown reason, which is worthy of investigation, F&Aacute;S refused to proceed with that training scheme at a time when the Irish and EU market is allegedly unable to fill those vacancies.  It is a scandal.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the dairy sector which, along with every other sector, has had an <i>annus horribilis</i>.  The price support mechanism in the Common Agricultural Policy did not work sufficiently to deliver support to family farms which cannot deal with the kind of price volatility that in an 18-month period has seen milk production prices drop from almost 40 cent to 20 cent per litre.  The price support mechanisms in the Common Agricultural Policy did not work sufficiently to deliver support to those with family farms who cannot cope with such price volatility in an 18 month period during which milk production prices decreased from almost 40 cent a litre to 20 cent a litre.  It will collapse the family farm structure, which is not desirable.</P><Col N="102"/>
        <P>We have the results of the banking system following the processing of financial products, subprime mortgages, etc.  Now the bankers are moving into trading in commodities, grain and dairy products.  We will witness the hurricane that happened in the financial sector in the food sector unless that issue is addressed.  We need a proper price support mechanism at a European level.</P>
        <P>The Minister cannot continue to talk out of both sides of his mouth on the proposed electronic identification system.  I refer to the sheep tagging system that is being foisted on the industry here.  We have a system that works.  We are being asked to carry the can for that fact that, during the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the UK in the early 1990s, it did not have a system.  DG SANCO has now foisted a system on us that will not work.  The Minister&rsquo;s Department is making plans to introduce that post-haste.</P>
        <P>The proposed sheep tagging system will not work.  It has been proven that the proposed electronic identification system has a 20% failure rate.  If it is superimposed on a system that is currently working, both systems will collapse.  We will have the worst of both possible worlds.  It is interesting to note that in the cross-compliance checks, 20% of the problems currently arise in the sheep tagging system.  The Minister will collapse the sheep industry with the imposition of an electronic identification system.  The Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, might smile.  This may not be a big issue in north county Dublin but a large number of farmers are engaged in the sheep industry throughout the country.  It is a valuable industry and it is vital to peripheral communities in particular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There are sheep farmers in north Dublin as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should know then that this system will not work.  The EID system the Department proposes to introduce will collapse both systems and we will be left with no sheep tagging system.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister at this late hour to retreat from the decision he made on REPS 4.  It is an outstandingly successful scheme.  It delivers valuable results in terms of environmental rural management and income to farmers.  The Minister&rsquo;s replacement scheme has been described elsewhere as a Mickey Mouse system, a description with which I concur.  The existing system works.  As the saying goes, &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo;.  I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with a new rural development plan.  I advise him, with all the conviction I can muster, that this is the single biggest fatal decision the Department has made in respect of the agri-industry during his tenure.</P>
        <P>We need somebody at the Cabinet table who is an advocate, not an apologist, for the industry.  The decision on REPS will be the Minister&rsquo;s lasting legacy in the Department.  I appeal to him not to proceed with that decision.</P>
        <P>I want to deal briefly with the flood crisis.  There are three issues that need immediate hands-on management by the Department and other State agencies, particularly Teagasc.  There are the issues of the fodder crisis, animal welfare and housing for animals that are in flooded houses on flooded lands, and slurry management.  We have farming by calendar, which makes it illegal for farmers, even if it were possible in the current climate, to empty their slurry tanks.  We need an understanding approach to that issue.  We need immediate identification of the farmers most at risk and targeted interventions at those farm gates.  The &euro;2 million fund that will be provided will be entirely inadequate.  I wish the Minister had not even referred to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to deal with this crisis as it emerges and to target resources.  The &euro;2 million fund is entirely inadequate and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was interested in the Minister&rsquo;s observation on the banks and to learn of his meeting with them this evening.  Farmers are crying out for working capital but they have not got it.  They need it now for fodder relief and producers of store cattle, winter finishers and winter fatteners need it to buy cattle.  They are not getting any relief from the banks.  I would like to know what exactly they said to the Minister during his meeting with them today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to conclude on the Common Agricultural Policy, to which the Minister referred.  A paper was leaked from the Commission a few weeks ago, which suggested co-financing of the single farm payment, which in any climate would be a disaster for this country, but in the current financial climate it would be abominable.  We need to preserve the common aspect of the agricultural policy across the 27 member states.  The arrangements in place whereby the Germans can come to assistance of their farmers to the tune of &euro;1,500 spell the beginning of the end of the Common Agricultural Policy.  That is something that happened under the Minister&rsquo;s watch, albeit under the aegis of state aid from Germany.  We need to be much more vigilant and aggressive about an industry that can be a significant engine for recovery and job creation.</P>
        <P>We need an advocate with ambition at the Cabinet table, not an apologist for the industry.  The Minister has two weeks to show his mettle at the Cabinet table to ensure that he delivers for agriculture.  We will be watching closely.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Creed for sharing time with me and allowing me to contribute to this debate.  It is ludicrous that we have only one hour and 15 minutes to discuss such a major industry.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no scope for savings under the farm gate scheme.  In the more than 40 years that I have been involved in farming, farm organisations and politics I have never seen so many young progressive farm families under such economic pressure.  Some of these farmers expected to get installation aid, which of course they did not get.  All of them received a cut in their payments and the REPS payment has been removed from other farmers, which they had already committed to covering the cost of payment on farm building loans, etc.  The decisions on these cuts and delayed payments were all in the Minister&rsquo;s hands.</P>
        <P>The price of milk, beef and pigs has collapsed.  The mushroom industry is now available to a small number of farm families who are also under pressure.  As a constituency colleague, the Minister should have a full understanding of the needs of people in areas such as Cavan-Monaghan.  I implore him to stand up and be counted at Cabinet and European levels.  The European Union has not been used to the full.  I know that to be the case.  Without the presence <Col N="104"/>of the agriculture and food industries in our constituency and elsewhere throughout the country, what alternatives do we have?</P>
        <P>Farmers in Cavan-Monaghan have invested more than most in the pig and poultry industries and in the dairy and beef sectors and they deserve support not only for their own sake, but for the future of the area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, should show us the sheep farmers who agree with the proposed tagging system.</P>
        <P>Even farmers who have an income but have a cashflow problem find it almost impossible to get the much promoted farm assist payment and their current financial problems are not being recognised by the inspectors.  It is in the best interests of consumers and farmers that the industry is managed properly at Government and EU levels.  Without leadership and support, farmers cannot survive the lack of income and the failure of banks to provide normal capital funding.  I, too, would like to know from the Minister what exactly the banks said to him.  I know what they have been saying to farmers on the ground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister said he is delighted that the milk quota is gone.  I am not sure the farmers of the north west would agree with him.  The producers of winter fatteners cannot get funds and that is affecting the cattle trade.</P>

	<P>The Minister said that it is in the best interest of farmers and I guarantee him we will prove that it is not. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin my contribution by expressing my solidarity and support for the many families affected by the recent unprecedented weather conditions which have caused untold damage, particularly along the Shannon basin and catchment area, with torrents of rain wreaking havoc and devastation across wide geographical areas and people&rsquo;s houses being destroyed and so on.  We have seen the picture of desolation arising from this natural disaster.  I congratulate the many emergency workers and volunteers who continue to work hard to ensure that help is given to those most affected, especially to the elderly and the infirm.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?>
        <P>I also congratulate the staff of the local authorities, the members of the Defence Forces, the Civil Defence and community and voluntary organisations.  We have seen them at their very best in recent days.  They all carry out such work away from the glare of publicity day in, day out in the normal course of their duties.  I recognise the Minister has indicated some &euro;10 million will be allocated for humanitarian assistance.  I trust this will be delivered quickly to the many people who are suffering.  Certainly, people in Athlone require help in this regard.  The &euro;2 million allocation of relief is only a start but it would appear to be totally inadequate to deal with the devastation foisted upon farmers throughout the country, including the loss of fodder.  It is a start but clearly it will not be enough.  The situation is especially severe along the banks of the Shannon in parts of Galway, Clare, Limerick, Athlone, south Westmeath, Leitrim and <Col N="105"/>other areas with severe flooding problems and there is more to come.  This financial package will be insufficient.</P>
        <P>Although only 25 days of November have gone, one third of average annual rainfall has fallen in these 25 days, an objective measure of the dimension of the problems.  Yesterday, I took the opportunity of visiting Athlone, along with Councillor Jim Henson and my brother, Councillor Johnny Penrose.  I witnessed the devastation sustained and suffered by the people of Athlone and surrounding areas.  More than 60 people have been evacuated from their houses to date and a further 50 or 60 people have suffered from severe flooding as well.  One cannot but be moved by the resilience displayed by these people and their families in the most trying and difficult of circumstances.  It is possible to see the devastation in such areas as Wolfe Tone Terrace or Parnell Square.  Overnight, other areas such as Iona Villas were subjected to flooding and for the people involved it feels like a never-ending cycle.  I compliment many of the local representatives who were physically working on the ground, helping people and providing as much assistance as humanly possible.</P>
        <P>Some people involved in farming have no insurance and have been unable to get insurance.  This is an important matter for the Government and every assistance should be given and rendered to these people to ensure they can get back on their feet.</P>
        <P>Although the matter is not directly related, the events of recent days bring to mind the need for a River Shannon catchment authority, to acts as an umbrella for all vested interests and stakeholders.  It could be in a position to co-ordinate activities and responses from Lough Allen through to the sea in Limerick.  It is time to stop foot-dragging and procrastination and establish a single over-arching authority.  I drafted a Bill on 21 January 2000 which I have before me this evening, namely, the River Shannon Authority Bill.  It contains 12 sections and several subsections and I am prepared to hand it over again.  It is time.  The river runs through the Minister&rsquo;s county and he knows it as well as anyone.  The main purpose of the Bill is to put a single new authority in place to tackle the problem of flooding, which has dogged the midlands, including Cavan, and parts of the west for many years.  The authority would provide a medium to long-term solution to the flooding problems of the River Shannon.  As it stands there is no single authority in the Shannon basin to deal with flooding.  At the end of the day the response to recurring flooding has been characterised by delay and denial by local authorities and by a host of State and semi-State bodies throughout the years.  The work of this authority could significantly reduce flooding and ensure people in these areas are not left without a livelihood if flooding recurs.  It could have overall responsibility for the management and improvement of the Shannon catchment.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill I drafted almost ten years ago, the authority would be obliged to submit a five year plan to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with regard to its proposed activities to improve the river and surrounding areas.  This plan should deal with fisheries, navigation, improvement by drainage of lands adjacent to the Shannon, the improvement of water quality and the protection and enhancement of the river environment and of the natural habitat of its bird and fish life.</P>
        <P>The Bill would also have enabled a whole range of interests to be represented on the new authority, including representatives from the farming sector, the community, tourism, fisheries and a range of statutory bodies including the Office of Public Works, Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB, D&uacute;chas and the relevant local authorities.  The authority would have complete responsibility for directing all public bodies, where relevant, and for the management of the Shannon catchment area including fisheries, navigation, drainage and wildlife habitats.</P><Col N="106"/>
        <P>I believe that Bill offered and continues to offer the best solution to the problems of the communities which have been marooned in their homes by the recent flooding.  The Bill could be amended or whatever but it is time to take the bull by the horns and to make progress in this regard.  There is no guarantee these problems will never be prevented but we should put in place an authority to bring forward a national early warning system.  There are geographical early warning systems in existence but no such national system.  Such a body would be a positive contribution but I do not say as much in any political way.  I am not interested in politics on this matter as it is too important for the wider interests of the country.  The Bill is still an option and the Parliamentary Counsel could improve it.  I have no monopoly on divine inspiration in that regard.</P>
        <P>We do not know to what the ultimate cost of the clean up will amount.  The recent flooding is reason enough for concern.  However, the result of that combined with one of the wettest summers in living memory means we face a very significant fodder crisis.  Many farmers housed their cattle in mid-October and early November and will not be in a position to let them out until April or, in many western counties, as late as May.  I note Deputy Connaughton is in the House and he is aware a seven month winter is not unusual in this context.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to bank credit.  I acknowledge he is concerned about this matter and I accept his bona fides at face value; I have no reason to doubt them.  However, the availability of bank credit for farmers is of major concern.  As the Labour Party spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment, every banking institution I encounter informs me that life is beautiful.  However, when one inquires with a small or medium sized enterprise, a farm, anyone involved in the locality or who comes to a constituency clinic, a totally different picture is presented.  I am beginning to wonder if I am too stupid to realise what is going on.  No money is filtering down or else it is not filtering down quickly enough.  Today one of the chief executives stated that after NAMA there would be a very slow trickle of credit.  This is a time when money was never required more, when people will have to buy additional fodder and need money to tide them over the difficult, extenuating, unprecedented and unanticipated circumstances.  Such people indicate the availability of credit might happen and if it does it will only be a trickle.  However, to use the terrible term, a flood of credit is required at this stage to help out.  Sufficient bank credit is very important and of greater urgency now than ever, to help the farming community and small businesses.</P>
        <P>The old proverb is that a wet and windy May fills the barn with grain and hay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should note that did not happen this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However combined with a wet June, July and August many farmers were only able to cut one crop of silage rather than the usual two or three crops.  This shortage, combined with the long winter, will lead to major problems in the early spring.  As Deputies Connaughton and Creed are aware, I make this point from the perspective of beef farmers.  Not only is there a problem with fodder quantity, there is also a problem with fodder quality.  The reduced dry matter of silage made in bad weather along with reduced digestibility as a result of late cuts will force many farmers to purchase very expensive concentrates to supplement the nutritional needs of such stock.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to an excellent article in Teagasc&rsquo;s <i>Today&rsquo;s Farm</i> wherein there is an excellent analysis of the fodder crisis facing farmers on page ten.  It calls for a response in the budget to assist farmers in the light of the difficulty presented to them at present.  A survey was carried out by Teagasc last September.  It included the Minister&rsquo;s county <Col N="107"/>and that of Deputy Johnny Brady, and indicated one in three farmers does not have an adequate supply of fodder.  Given the disastrous weather of recent weeks, I believe this figure will rise significantly.  The year 2009 has been a poor year for silage.  It has compounded the drop in real income in the sector due to increased inputs for feed and the low dry matter content in silage.  Farmers will now have reduced stock in a market already deflated.  As Deputy Creed remarked there are issues of animal welfare, a slurry build up and so on, all of critical importance.  The situation is not tenable.  The price for silage bales ranges from &euro;35 to &euro;50, although closer to the more expensive figures at present.  This development will impact very negatively and very severely on agricultural income when coupled with the fact that silage is rotting in the pits, slurry spreading is curtailed until January, as Deputy Creed remarked, and we are working off this calendar of events.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Beef is going down by the pound as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Beef is almost back to the price it was when I was a student.  If farmers cannot buy silage cheaper than &euro;35 per bale then purchasing meat or feed will be the only real option for them to maintain stock against a poor market for sales.  I acknowledge and welcome the move of the Minister to front-load payment.  It is extremely important and I have noted it because it will help to address animal welfare concerns and it will allow cattle to be fed adequately.  However, much of that money will be subsumed by the very banks to which I have referred to try to meet other areas of payment.  Given the weather of the past week, the remainder of the country is in a similar situation to the area covered by the study, that is, north-west Cork, west Limerick, north-west Galway and Cavan.  Most farmers will encounter a fodder shortage.</P>
        <P>Farmers can only replace fodder by using meal and this presents a major cost input that cannot be met because of falling incomes.</P>
        <P>The REPS payments have been cut and changed, the disadvantaged area payments under the social welfare scheme have been significantly cut, the early retirement scheme has been turned upside down and the isolation scheme has been emasculated.  All of this has meant incomes have dropped by 28% according to the CSO and over two years this will become very significant.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">I spoke to a number of beef farmers and discovered they are depressed and in dire straits.  It may be stated that we have heard all this before.  However, on this occasion there has been a major impact on beef farming.  Many people are considering leaving beef farming.  I know people who stuck with the industry in the past, in good and bad times.  In addition, everyone is aware of the situation for dairy farmers.  In that context, bringing forward payments or trying to secure payments is extremely important.  I hope the Minister will meet the relevant farm interest groups, discover what their needs are and put in place a plan of action.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to address some of the issues relating to the McCarthy report.  Today&rsquo;s Teagasc bulletin highlights the importance of research in assisting farmers to maximise their potential through using evidence-based models to maintain yields against falling incomes.  Teagasc is an essential component in maintaining and increasing our comparative advantage in agribusiness and agrifood production.  We retain that advantage and we should never resile from expounding on our clean, green image.  However, we must penetrate the high-value markets.  It took some time to change our production systems in the past in the context of moving from Holstein breeds and half-breeds to pure beef breeds.  Some 80% of our production should be concentrated on pure beef breeds and good beef cross-breeds in order that we might penetrate the markets to which I refer.  At one stage, we could not get <Col N="108"/>even one in five of our cattle onto high-quality European markets.  I accept that the position has changed dramatically in the interim but there is a need for further action.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?>
        <P>Jim Power of Teagasc recently stated that Ireland could become the Silicon Valley of agrifood production, particularly if it takes serious steps to penetrate the sector.  I wholeheartedly agree with this analysis.  We must do what those in Silicon Valley did in respect of IT and high technology, namely, sustain and develop this natural resource.  In addition, when the agrifood production sector experiences difficulties we must not abandon it.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report recommends that some &euro;14 million could be saved through a restructuring of how research funding is awarded.  It also recommends the establishment of a single funding stream for research in respect of which each entity could compete.  This could work, in theory, if it were done fairly.  However, I have major reservations as to whether that would be the case.  I am sceptical with regard to cutting the research of an entity such as Teagasc, which is driving higher rates of output in our basic productive sector, which will drive economic growth in the future and which is intent on retaining the maximum number of farmers on the land.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report recommends that a total of &euro;100 million be cut from the overall research budget.  On a <i>pro rata</i> basis, this means funding for agricultural research would be reduced by &euro;14 million.  The implied assumption in the report is that Teagasc and other agencies are given just that for which they ask.  In reality, however, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is, like all other Departments, obliged to make its case for funding to the Minister for Finance at budget time.</P>
        <P>The agriculture industry is at a crossroads and farm families are struggling to survive.  Is the Government serious about this indigenous industry which accounts for more than 25% of economic activity in the rural economy?  Given that this week&rsquo;s extreme weather has led to hardship for farmers and rural dwellers &mdash; residents in particular urban areas were also affected &mdash; it is important that we should do everything possible to secure the agriculture brief when appointments are made to the European Commission.  We must not pass up the opportunity to have an Irish Commissioner in charge of matters during the run-up to the CAP negotiations in 2013.  Every effort should be made to secure this brief.  If implemented, the proposals in the McCarthy report would decimate rural areas.  The halving of payments, from &euro;80 to &euro;40, under the suckler cow welfare scheme in the most recent budget was cruel in its own right.  However, the abolition of the scheme, as recommended in the McCarthy report, would be detrimental to the 50,000 people who avail of it.  Up to 10,000 farmers will leave REPS 4 during the next 12 months.</P>

	<P>The Deputy must conclude as his time is exhausted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>A replacement scheme must be drawn up, particularly as farmers have factored REPS payments into their budgets.  The reductions in the disadvantaged areas scheme will also affect our most vulnerable farmers.</P>
        <P>I have much more to say on this matter.  In that context, I would like the House to debate it further in the future.  We should do more than merely pay lip service to this indigenous industry.  We should provide it with every assistance possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>In common with tens of thousands of other people, large numbers of farmers are suffering the consequences of the flooding which occurred during the past week and which will continue, depending on weather conditions, to pose a severe threat in parts of the country in the coming days.  The problems that have arisen range from loss of animal feed, <Col N="109"/>a need to move animals and damage to machinery and buildings.  The impact on farm operation and the costs involved mean that many of those farmers affected will have been pushed over the brink of survival and may well be forced to cease operations.  It is important, therefore, that &mdash; as in the case of the damage done to homes and businesses &mdash; the State should intervene, where possible, to ameliorate the effects of the damage that has been done and to assist those most affected in recovering.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the grant scheme that was put in place in the past 18 months in respect of waste management, etc.  In many instances, the slurry tanks that were installed, for environmental and other reasons, under this scheme have been submerged as a result of the floods caused by the recent unprecedented rainfall.  As a result of a regulation that prevents the spreading of slurry until January, we find ourselves in the ridiculous situation whereby &mdash; despite the fact that good weather may arrive in the interim &mdash; these tanks must remain full.  The Minister should allow common sense to prevail and permit farmers to empty their slurry tanks if the weather improves.</P>
        <P>Apart from the floods, 2009 has not been a particularly good year for the farming sector or the related rural economy, which has suffered from the impact of the overall economic downturn.  As in other sectors, the effects of the recession have been further exacerbated by the negative response of the Government.  This was evident in the cuts introduced in last year&rsquo;s budget.  People in the farming community are concerned that the forthcoming budget will contain more negative proposals that will further restrict the sector&rsquo;s ability to survive and recover.  The projected loss in income for farmers to date this year is approximately 28%, while last year the actual loss was 13%.  Therefore, as Deputy Creed stated, there has been an overall reduction of 41% in farm incomes.  The current average income is in the region of &euro;13,000 for part-time farmers and &euro;16,000 for full-time farmers.  This means they earn approximately on quarter of what public sector employees are paid, which shows their determination and commitment to trying to survive on minimal incomes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Farmers, like those who own small businesses, have been affected by the restrictive lending practices of the banks.  These practices contrast starkly with the banks&rsquo; liberal dispensing of huge amounts of credit to property and other speculators whose activities &mdash; allied to whatever global impact there has been &mdash; contributed greatly to the economic downturn in this country.  In comparison to those involved in the property sector, farmers have always found it difficult to access credit.  Many of them are currently unable to persuade the banks to lend them money.  It is ironic that in order to procure loans, farmers are obliged to offer the deeds of the property as collateral.  This is in stark contrast to the position with regard to speculators and developers, who in recent years could obtain credit whenever they desired.  The latter proved detrimental to the health of the economy and we are all being obliged to pay as a result.</P>
        <P>Lending institutions are also exerting pressure on farmers to make repayments on existing loans.  This constitutes a massive pressure on many farmers and is greatly restricting their ability to remain in operation.  In a significant number of cases, they are being forced to consider the option of leaving farming altogether.</P>
        <P>The large processors have been also less than helpful in the current situation.  During this year they have again systematically attempted to cut the prices paid to farmers for milk and other products.  In some instances the products involved are being used as loss leaders in a competitive war between the major retailers.  The historical evidence, however, points to a long-term reduction in the proportion of the price charged to consumers that is eventually passed on to farmers.  As I stated on previous occasions, and as was highlighted by a number of submissions to the report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on farm<Col N="110"/>ing in the west, this has implications for the way in which a small number of large operators have come to monopolise the processing of farm produce.  It also illustrates the loss of power of farmers as what were once farmer-owned co-operatives have been transformed into orthodox businesses which are no longer amenable to the type of democratic decision-making that was previously in place.  Farm co-operatives have become public limited companies whose motivation is profit whatever the consequences and this is detrimental to the good intentions of those who established those co-operatives.</P>
        <P>Returning to the issue of the budget, all rural representatives are aware of the impact which the cuts in areas such as disadvantaged payments and the early retirement and installation schemes as well as other cuts in the budget available to Teagasc have had on the sector.  In many cases it has meant the difference between a farmer being able to survive or not.  The cuts in the retirement and installation schemes have had a massively negative impact on the transfer of land and farms from elderly farmers to a new generation.  That is having a major impact along the west coast where the average age of farmers involved in the process is in excess of 45 years and in many cases is well over 60 years.  The early retirement scheme was beneficial; it offered security to those giving up their land to a new generation while they awaited their old age pension.  The installation aid was a start-up grant for young farmers which was necessary for someone taking over a holding.  Cutting that has been a disaster.</P>
        <P>To return to the report, one of the clear demands made throughout the sector was that those cuts should be reversed.  It is vital that no further similar measures are included in next month&rsquo;s package.  Their impact extends beyond the farming community and into the rural economy as whole, taking as it does vital income out of circulation and weakening the ability of farms to contribute to the overall economy, as they do in so many ways.  That direct economic impact has been added to by the implementation of cuts in public provision to rural communities, with other cuts yet to be made.  It will also be added to by the impact of the type of cuts recommended by the McCarthy report if the Government decides to implement them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is ironic that the report of the economic forum of Irish farm and food industry leaders on the agrifood sector should appear at a time when it is unlikely to be matched with the type of commitment on the part of the Department which it urgently requires.  As the report states, there is huge potential to harness the food sector as a vital element in economic recovery.  Central to that is the issue of food security which, it has been argued, in the Irish context would be threatened if the EU was to return to advocating the type of measures proposed by former Commissioner Mandelson in the context of the WTO trade negotiations.</P>
        <P>This country still retains significant advantages in food production and these can be built on to further enhance the Irish processing and general food sector with all the benefits that would bring to farm viability and income as well as job creation.  It is one of the few major areas where we can make decisions and implement strategies that are not dependent to a huge extent, as is the case in some manufacturing areas, on what happens outside of Ireland and decisions taken by multi-nationals.</P>
        <P>Key areas identified by the report are access to credit; research; the relationship between the farmer and the processors, to which I have already referred; and the power of large retailers in determining price and standards.  The report also addresses other areas such as State supports and targets higher value production for the domestic and overseas markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008, the agrifood sector accounted for 10% of total merchandise exports from Ireland at approximately &euro;8.6 billion in produce.  Similarly, the sector accounted for approximately 9% of total exports on average.  Given that the worldwide population is increasing at a rapid pace, <Col N="111"/>consumption is rising and food demand is greater than ever, agrifood exports are a large potential source of revenue for the country.  Ireland is seen as a green food island and greater efforts should be made to capitalise on this and expand our agrifood exports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present the agrifood sector directly employs approximately 50,000 people as well as providing the primary outlet for the produce of 128,000 family farms.  These jobs are dispersed throughout all regions of Ireland, especially in rural areas.  The sector accounts for half of Irish goods and services purchased by the manufacturing industry and just more than half of exports by indigenous manufacturing industries.  The importance of protecting that and the potential from any expansion hardly needs to be pointed out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Arthur Morgan is completing a report for the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment on expanding employment in the agrifood sector, which covers much of the same ground as the report to which I referred.  The submissions provide much evidence of optimism about the future of the sector to stimulate the economy but suggest that practical initiatives are required to create the basis for a prosperous indigenous economy.  However, they also highlight market failures in the provision of services to SMEs in the availability of capital and support for start-up companies, where indigenous SMEs increasingly compete against companies that can produce goods from a much lower cost base.</P>
        <P>Among the key challenges to the growth of scale and employment in the industry are access to credit, regulation and Government policy, retail pressure and disparities in labelling requirements.  Similar findings were made in the industry forum report.  Among its recommendations are the need to research problems; more rigorous labelling so that, for example, a term such as &ldquo;Irish food&rdquo; can only be used after specific criteria are satisfied; and the encouragement of greater co-operation among producers and other related and supporting groups to take advantage of opportunities through enhanced knowledge and contacts, easier access to markets, reduced costs, increased bargaining power and greater competitive advantage.</P>
        <P>The farming sector faces a number of serious problems at the present time, the most immediate being the impact of the floods, but also the long-term impact of the cuts.  However, as the reports to which I referred indicate, there are grounds for optimism in the future if the correct strategy and support is put in place.</P>

	<P>Like other speakers, I am conscious that we are conducting these proceedings with the backdrop of very severe weather conditions which are affecting many parts of the country, particularly the south and the west.  I would like to convey my solidarity to the many farmers who have been badly affected by the flooding and I look forward to the &euro;2 million in aid alleviating the disruption and unrest which many are experiencing.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware that this has been a very challenging year for the sector.  A series of factors have combined to put severe pressure on incomes, most notably low commodity prices, difficulties with sterling and weakened domestic and international demand.  The dairy sector in particular has had a tough year, which was acknowledged by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith.  He has had notable success at EU level in pursuing market support measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remain optimistic about the future of farming and the agrifood sector, notwithstanding the serious difficulties being faced.  The Minister already mentioned his commitment to developing an Agri Vision 2020 strategy, which has the potential to be an exciting blueprint to take the <Col N="112"/>sector forward well into the 21st century.  No doubt major obstacles will have to be crossed in the negotiation of the CAP post-2013 but I see no reason to believe that the outcome will not be positive for Ireland.  The abolition of milk quotas in 2015 holds great opportunities for our dairy farmers.  However, it is vital that the industry focuses on dealing with the challenges as well as the opportunities that milk quota abolition will bring.</P>
        <P>Of immediate and critical importance is the need to assist farmers as much as possible with cash flow difficulties.  I am glad to state that the Minister has responded imaginatively and energetically to this need.  His efforts have borne fruit to the early advance of the single farm payment, which began allocating from 16 October.  A full 70% of the amount due has been paid to more than 120,000 farmers at a cost of &euro;850 million.  These payments, which were made a full six weeks earlier than was provided for under the rules of the scheme, have been an enormous relief to the sector.</P>
        <P>Assuming all applicants are approved, farmers can look forward to a further &euro;380 million from next week.  The total value of payments will be &euro;1.24 billion.  Farmers will also warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intention to seek D&aacute;il approval for the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;85 million.  If approved, this money will allow payments due next year under the REPS and the farm waste management scheme to be paid before Christmas.  These efforts are a direct response to the income challenges facing our farmers and clearly demonstrate that even in the most difficult of economic environments the commitment remains to assisting them in sustaining their livelihoods.</P>
        <P>The dairy, beef, sheep and pig sectors have all experienced difficult times.  Potato farmers, of whom there are a number in my county, have experienced particularly severe problems over the past three years.  Some in my constituency have not been able to harvest a single acre of potatoes.  Any assistance for them would be more than welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Trevor Sargent and Tony Killeen, for their support, flexibility and dedication in addressing the serious crisis bedevilling agriculture.  International volatility in markets, the global financial depression and weather conditions have had a deleterious effect on Irish farming.  I am grateful to the Minister for the flexibility he has shown in advancing payments and bringing a Supplementary Estimate before the House.  I thank him for despatching a team of inspectors to my constituency to investigate at first hand the serious situation that obtains on the ground.  I warmly welcome the &euro;2 million investment in a special fodder scheme for the farming community.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure sustainability in farm incomes, it is vital that we put the maximum effort into restoring REPS payments to their full capacity.  The suckler cow welfare scheme and the disadvantaged area payments are also critical to my county and the entire western region.  I appeal to the banking community to show flexibility and generosity in advancing payments, extending overdrafts and recapitalising farmers.  The Government is prepared to help them despite the constant financial pressure it faces.  The banking community has been supported by the Government and should in turn ensure a cashflow to all our citizens, including farmers.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister and his colleagues on their efforts.  With their leadership, I am confident we can resolve the serious difficulties which the farming community faces at present.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank all those who contributed to this debate, although I share with Opposition Deputies the wish that we had more time.  My colleague, Deputy Mary Alexandra White, is <Col N="113"/>one of many Deputies  from both sides of the House who is disappointed at being unable to contribute.</P>
        <P>We all agree this has been a difficult year for farming families and farm incomes.  It is cold comfort to the many farmers who are facing immediate cashflow problems to say that the medium-term outlook is an improvement in market conditions for core products.  For that reason, I welcome the Supplementary Estimate being brought by the Minister, the cash injection of &euro;120 million into the primary farming sector through REPS and the bringing forward of payments due in 2010 under the farm waste management scheme.  These will have beneficial effects on farmers&rsquo; cashflows.  The supplementary payments on foot of the ongoing flooding crisis will also be badly needed.</P>
        <P>Reducing the costs associated with farming may not be a headline grabber but it is, nonetheless, a major element in maintaining the viability of farms.  In January 2009, the minimum age for BSE testing of animals slaughtered for human consumption was increased to 48 months.  In September, new arrangements were introduced to reduce the cost of brucellosis testing.  A scheme worth &euro;7 million was introduced for upland sheep producers.  From 2010, a new support scheme for sheep producers will provide grant aids of &euro;54 million over a three year period.  These are significant developments which indicate the seriousness with which my Department is approaching the problems facing farmers.</P>
        <P>These provisions should be seen in the context of the crisis in the country&rsquo;s finances.  Despite the closure of the REP scheme because of shortages in funding and pressure from the European Commission, payments to farmers in 2009 and 2010 will be at their highest level ever.  Almost 17,000 applications were received by the scheme&rsquo;s closing date of 15 May and it is safe to assume that the great majority will see their REPS III contracts end this year.  These applications are now being processed with a view to making payments at the earliest opportunity.  A further 1,600 applications arrived between 16 May and 9 July and these will be processed as applications for 2010.  All REPS contracts will run their full course so that farmers will receive payments until 2014.  It is hoped that the new measures which are on their way will help to maintain the agri-environmental objectives with which we have to comply.  We will maximise payments to recognise the benefits of REPS.</P>
        <P>I agree with the IFA that sterling&rsquo;s devaluation is a distortion of the Single Market.  As Deputy Michael Creed noted, we have to get around the problem by focusing our attention on the eurozone.  Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are directing considerable energy at marketing Irish products in this area.</P>
        <P>Deputy Johnny Brady and I recognise the difficulties being experienced by the horticulture sector and potato growers in particular.  This sector lacks the benefit of single farm payments and is more exposed to the market than other sectors.  In many ways, the sector represents the canary in the coalmine and highlights the need for new thinking.  We have included a number of new measures in the revised programme for Government, such as an ombudsman redress the imbalance between producers and retailers.</P>
        <P>We must get to grips with the flooding crisis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is ensuring that forestry plays a role in reducing floods and addressing our climate change commitment of doubling planting rates.  I have a particular interest in the organic sector because I see its merits not only in regard to its 11% annual market growth, but also in the impact on percolation of increasing organic matter in soil.  Yesterday, I was told by an organic farmer in County Galway that the panning of land which does not contain good organic matter is contributing to run off.  We need to take account of these issues because they demonstrate that <Col N="114"/>organic farming helps in terms of percolation.  We need to have more cognisance of the methodology that helps organic matter in the soil improve.</P>
        <P>I ask Deputies and members of the public to read the new programme for Government to see the renewed commitment therein and the manner in which we are adapting to changing times.  We will do everything possible to ensure the agricultural food sector, on which the country relies, grows.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with a further opportunity to speak in solidarity with the people of east County Galway.</P>
        <P>A major crisis bedevils us at this time, with serious flooding reported throughout Galway East, from Ballymoe in the north-east corner to Beagh in the south-west corner, from Clonfert in the south-east corner to Headford in the north-west corner, and in all the towns and villages in between, including Gort, Labane, Kilcolgan, Killeenan, Craughwell, Athenry, Loughrea, New Inn and into Menlough, Abbeyknockmoy, Williamstown, Ballinasloe, Eyrecourt and Meelick.  All these areas are in a serious state.</P>
        <P>I arrived in the area last Friday to see the serious situation in Ballinasloe where the town square was under four feet of water.  I have been all over the constituency negotiating in different areas with State agencies and the local community and liaising with volunteers.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Mansergh, all of whom visited the constituency on Saturday and Monday.  Working through the day and into the night we saw at first hand the seriousness of the situation.</P>
        <P>Cattle are drowning, people are isolated, churches are flooded, businesses are destroyed, housing estates are under water and people must be relocated and evacuated at short notice with nothing but the clothes on their backs.  This is a serious challenge.  The country faces a crisis as a result of climate change and three years of incessant rain.  I hope all the State agencies, under Government direction, will be able to work together to bring about a resolution to the problem by providing humanitarian aid and assistance for agriculture.  I thank the Minister for providing aid and dispatching officials to the constituency to experience conditions at first hand.</P>
        <P>At a joint meeting of the Joint Committees on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and European Affairs this afternoon, I was proud to move a motion seeking full support for an application by Ireland to the European Commission for major assistance from the European solidarity fund.  We need additional humanitarian aid and resources for the management of water systems and flood diversion and flood alleviation programmes.</P>
        <P>All those affected are in a serious state.  I spoke today to various farmers who were marooned with their livestock.  In the past week I have spoken to many women and children who are in a distraught state as a result of having to leave their homes.  Leaving one&rsquo;s home is very difficult, especially for young mothers with children and old people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I am grateful for the action taken by the Government thus far, we need national, regional, local and area plans to deal with the flood crisis bedevilling the nation and devastating <Col N="115"/>my constituency.  I am grateful to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, for providing support over the weekend and the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, for coming to the House, on behalf of the Government, to hear what the position is at first hand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I pay tribute to Deputy Treacy for the work he is doing on behalf of his constituents in Galway East.  The Government&rsquo;s primary concern is for the families and individuals in Galway, Cork, Clare, Carlow town and Clonmel and other areas who are suffering the effects of flooding of their homes and property and businesses whose viability and whose workers&rsquo; livelihoods are put in jeopardy.</P>
        <P>I record my appreciation and that of the Minister and Government of all the personnel of the various authorities and agencies, both public and voluntary, individuals and communities for their outstanding work in assisting in the rescue of people and the protection, where possible, of homes and premises from the effects of the flooding.  It is also very encouraging to witness the community spirit of neighbour helping neighbour to cope with the difficulties arising from the floods.</P>
        <P>The detailed work of the past few years in developing the major emergency planning system was satisfactorily put into action by local authority staff and other statutory agencies.  Local authorities responded promptly to ameliorate the worst effects as regards those aspects for which they have direct responsibility.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Trojan work of the Galway county manager, her crisis management team and staff in responding to the serious flooding occurring in east Galway.  Flood damage to part of the water treatment plants in Ballinasloe and Portumna, while not requiring the closure of the plants, has meant that precautionary boil water notices have been put in place.  Local authorities are required to liaise with the Health Service Executive before issuing or removing a boil water notice and must also notify the Environmental Protection Agency of such notices.  On transport difficulties, while the position can change at short notice, I understand more roads have reopened for traffic in the Galway area.</P>
        <P>The main priority at present is to help people with their immediate requirements of shelter, water and other supplies.  The Government, conscious of the trauma caused by the flooding, announced yesterday that it will provide an extra &euro;10 million for the humanitarian aid scheme through the community welfare service and an extra &euro;2 million for the agriculture sector.  Any person who is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding should contact the local community welfare officer.</P>
        <P>To learn lessons and look to the future, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will ask the local authorities for reports on the effects of the flooding on individuals and businesses in their areas and measures which could be taken to reduce the risk of such further flooding in the future.</P>
        <P>Although I appreciate that many people continue to experience great difficulty, it is important to acknowledge that the response agencies and members of the public have worked well together on the ground in Galway East and the other affected areas.  It will be essential that we continue to focus on the range of measures that are needed to mitigate severe flood impacts for the future.  The Government will keep the situation under review.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.  I apologise for my late arrival which was the result of a misapprehension that a division would be called at the conclusion of the debate on farming and the agrifood sector. </P>
        <P>I have grave concern about the neglect of 2,500 schoolchildren in 24 national schools in the Loughrea and Portumna catchment area who have been without a dental service for almost two years.  In addition, dental hours in the area have been reduced by half.  This is due primarily to the early retirement from the dental service of a wonderful professional, which had a major impact on schoolchildren and their dental health.  It is the second time such circumstances have arisen in the area in recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is an act of neglect of parents and children in south-east County Galway by the Health Service Executive in failing to provide the area with a locum until a permanent appointment is made.  It strikes me that the organisation is trying to suppress the appointment of a dentist in the area and reallocate the money saved for use in other areas.  There is no indication that the HSE has made a reasonable move to seek a replacement.  Due to the illness and early retirement of the excellent dental surgeon in question, we feel once more neglected by the HSE locally.  Given that similar vacancies in other areas have been filled almost immediately, why has the Loughrea-Portumna area been neglected again?</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate, the service has come under great pressure as increasing numbers of children have become eligible to avail of it.  While the service is important to national schoolchildren, it also serves children at second level up to 16 years and children with special needs, including those attending St. Dympna&rsquo;s day care centre in Portumna.  There is also a gap up to the school leaving age of 16, and these people also have to go without.</P>
        <P>There is no possibility of cover from the other areas adjoining this area, except in the case of emergencies, because the other dental surgeons in the adjoining areas are already stretched in dealing with waiting lists.  I call for an immediate response from the HSE to fill this post and not to allow for this continued neglect.  Nothing less is acceptable following this shameful neglect of the children, in particular those children with special needs.  Whether the HSE neglect has taken place locally or at national level, this particular situation cannot be allowed to continue without an indication of a date for an appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue of the appointment of a dentist to the Loughrea and Portumna area of County Galway, as raised by Deputy Burke.  The Health Service Executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  This includes the delivery of dental and oral health services.</P>
        <P>The vacancy in question has arisen from the retirement of a dental surgeon based in Loughrea.  This has led to a gap in the dental screening service provided to schools in this and other areas.  At the moment, a principal dental surgeon and another dentist are attending to priority groups in the Loughrea area and dental teams in surrounding clinics are accommodating emergencies from this area.</P>
        <P>In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to the end of 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.  The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained so far as <Col N="117"/>possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>The employment control framework specifically exempts staff in the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium &mdash; medical consultants, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, clinical psychologists, behaviour therapists, counsellors, social workers, and emergency medical technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling &mdash; 111,800 whole time equivalents &mdash; for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services.  In addition, special provisions apply to certain specialist grades under the national cancer control programme.  The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided.  The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children has not received an application from the HSE for a derogation from the moratorium to fill the general dental surgeon post in Loughrea.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>For shame.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to make such an application, savings would have to be made elsewhere.  It is a matter for the HSE to identify where such savings can be made and to prioritise the delivery of health and social services to those with greatest needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>So they are subsuming the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I do understand that the local area monitoring unit in the HSE is considering an application to fill this vacancy.  The operation of the employment control framework, including the moratorium on recruitment, is kept under review by this Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The HSE will be focusing on the scope that exists within the health services for the reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care.  It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, this is the first time I have had an opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment, and I am grateful for the opportunity you have given me to speak on the issue of public transport, with particular reference to the needs of my constituents in Stamullen, Gormanston, Greenanstown and surrounding areas.</P>
        <P>The rural transport service in Meath has recently set up a shuttle service between the townland of Greenanstown, the village of Stamullen and the village of Gormanston, which is designed to enable commuters from Stamullen to connect with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail services at Gormanston.  To establish this project on a long-term basis, the Meath Accessible Transport Project, also known as Flexibus, has submitted an application seeking funding from the Government&rsquo;s smarter travel fund.  Flexibus is the rural transport group operating in Meath and it has shown itself to be committed to serving the needs of communities in Meath that do not have access to any other kind of public transport, such as Stamullen.</P><Col N="118"/>
        <P>Stamullen is a fast growing town populated mainly by young families, but it has no full-time public transport system.  In fact, the population of Stamullen village is about 2,500, while the population of the Stamullen electoral division is about 6,500.  In 2007, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that three quarters of all houses in Stamullen had been built in the five years to 2006.  Stamullen is probably the largest town in Ireland without a scheduled Bus &Eacute;ireann service.  With a large population explosion in the area, there was clearly a great need for public transport in Stamullen and its environs.  The rural transport service in Meath has responded to this, and in October 2009, it began operating services on a trial basis from Greenanstown through Stamullen village every morning and evening that connects directly with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail services at Gormanston, approximately two miles from the village.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann service travels to Balbriggan and onto Dublin city centre via the airport and the port tunnel.</P>
        <P>I worked very closely with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Flexibus to get this shuttle bus off the ground, and both companies are fully supportive of it as a pilot project.  The innovative aspect of the arrangement is that there is integrated ticketing with the Bus &Eacute;ireann service.  When a person buys a ticket on the Flexibus shuttle in Stamullen, the ticket is valid with Bus &Eacute;ireann, while ten journey tickets are also sold.</P>
        <P>In my opinion, the service has been an overwhelming success to date.  The pilot will end very shortly, but I have received many requests from constituents to retain the route, which has proven to be a speedy and efficient mode of transport for Stamullen commuters.  Flexibus has submitted an application under Transport 21 and the smarter travel programme, and this should be supported at Government level because it is succeeding in reducing the amount of traffic leaving Stamullen and giving people the opportunity to complete their journey to work in Dublin purely public transport means.  I support the application for the funding of this project, and I understand that the Minister is considering it.  I would be very grateful if the Minister approved it to allow the project to continue on a full-time basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  The provision of public transport services in rural areas is being developed under the Department of Transport&rsquo;s rural transport programme.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural transport is clearly stated in Towards 2016 and in the national development plan.  The development of rural transport is also a key objective in the Government&rsquo;s sustainable travel and transport plan, known as &ldquo;Smarter Travel- A Sustainable Transport Future&rdquo; and in the Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The renewed Government programme also contains a commitment to explore the provision of a full-scale transport system in rural areas using the network expertise of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the resources of the school and health transport systems.  The rural transport programme was launched in February 2007 and mainstreamed the former pilot rural transport Initiative, which ran from 2002 to 2006.  Its principal objective is to help to address social exclusion related to unmet public transport needs in rural areas.  Thirty-six rural community transport groups are being funded under the rural transport programme, which is now operational in every county.  These groups are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas, having regard to local public transport service needs and the availability of resources.</P>
        <P>Pobal administers the programme on behalf of the Department of Transport and neither the Minister nor his Department has any role in the day-to-day management of the programme, including allocating specific funds to particular groups or for services.  Arrangements for the provision of services funded under the programme are matters for individual rural community transport groups.  Local communities know best where the transport needs are in their rural <Col N="119"/>areas and how best to address those needs.  The Department of Transport&rsquo;s role is one of facilitator through financial and administrative support, but communities themselves have the lead role in developing the transport services to fulfil these needs.</P>
        <P>The maintenance and development of rural passenger transport services is one of the principal objectives of the Department of Transport.  It is, therefore, vitally important that the resources available for rural transport are utilised as cost-effectively as possible and that best possible service is achieved from these resources.  In that regard, earlier this year, the Minister for Transport asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to work with Pobal to explore the potential for achieving better rural transport service delivery through closer working and better resource utilisation between the various service providers.  Arising from this, a number of pilot initiatives have been instigated to explore how the various transport services in rural areas might be jointly developed so as to enhance their coverage and take-up.</P>
        <P>In addition to Bus &Eacute;ireann, the initiatives involve the Health Service Executive, in its capacity for providing transport to access health services; the Department of Education and Science, in respect of school transport services; Pobal, in respect of rural transport services; and voluntary bodies, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association.  Pilot projects are being developed in the north west and north east to explore how existing transport providers might make more effective use of their individual resources by working in closer co-operation with each other.  The types of pilots envisaged for collaborative action include &ldquo;collect and connect&rdquo; type services; hospital feeder services; co-ordination of disability services; ticketing integration; co-ordinated information provision and journey planning; and increased synchronisation of partner systems and processes.  The Minister for Transport is hopeful that these pilots will prove successful and so provide the paradigm for rural transport in the future.  The Minister looks forward with interest to hearing of the outcomes to these pilots in due course.</P>
        <P>As part of the north east pilot projects, a commuter &ldquo;connect and collect&rdquo; service serving the Stamullen area is being trialled.  The pilot service is operated by Flexibus, the community transport group which operates rural transport programme-funded services in County Meath, and it involves morning and evening bus services which link with the Bus &Eacute;ireann service between Drogheda and Dublin.  The pilot projects do not have an identified budget line as they are primarily about utilising existing financial and operational resources in the best manner possible in order to meet their objectives.  However, a small amount of additional rural transport programme funding was made available to Flexibus to pilot the Stamullen commuter &ldquo;connect and collect&rdquo; service to the end of 2009.  The project partners recognised the very considerable potential this service could offer in providing public transport to a community of some 4,000 persons and considered it was important that the pilot should be supported.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this stage to make any commitments in relation to funding for the rural transport programme for 2010.  As Deputies are aware, the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommends the termination of the rural transport programme.  The Government is considering all the recommendations in the special group&rsquo;s report and decisions will be made by the Government in the context of the budget for 2010 and later years.  The Department of Transport has received an application from Flexibus for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Smarter Travel project fund in respect of a proposal to provide an integrated commuter service with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail.  The proposal involves a service that links commuters in Stamullen, Greenanstown area, to the mainline service to Dublin operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail.</P>
        <P>The Smarter Travel project fund was established in June 2009 and the closing date for submitting an application was on 9 September.  The Flexibus application is one of 121 applications <Col N="120"/>received by the Department.  The assessment process for the applications is nearing completion, as Deputy Byrne pointed out, and successful projects will be announced in the next few weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue concerning Carrickmines, where a new but fully inhabited apartment block had its roof blown off this morning.  The Minster of State will be familiar with it because it was formerly in his constituency and is now in mine.  I am sure, like myself, he must wonder what it is like to have the roof of one&rsquo;s home blown off.</P>
        <P>It is too early at this stage to know how the unfortunate homeowners&rsquo; problems will be addressed in the longer term but, for the present, I know that those who need it are accommodated in a local hotel.  I contacted the builder who assured me he is putting procedures in place to replace the roof.  I intend to keep an eye on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to raise with the Minister of State the wider problem of safety and standards and the ability of modern high-rise apartment blocks, particularly in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains, to withstand high winds.  I live very close to this area and know it was windy this morning but it was not what one would call an extreme weather event &mdash; it was not a 200-year event or even a ten-year event, and we have had similar weather in recent weeks and months.</P>
        <P>High winds are a feature of elevated areas and building standards reflect the need to design to accommodate wind loading at different locations because wind speeds vary due to location, geography, varying elevations and topographical conditions.  For example, it is much windier and higher standards are required in the west than in the east.  However, the height of the building has an impact.  All of this information is available from wind speed maps which are published by Met &Eacute;ireann.  The building regulations therefore require designs to accommodate the expected wind speeds for the area and then to apply a factor of safety on top of that, as per the British guidelines and codes of practice.</P>
        <P>Today, I am not interesting in apportioning blame.  A whole variety of factors could be responsible for this, including design failure, construction failure, materials failure or an extreme event, for example, a particularly high gust of wind that was well beyond what might have been expected in the 50-year cycle.  It is a miracle that a roof came off a huge building yet nobody was killed.  I want to ensure there are no more such incidents because we could not be as lucky again with a similar incident.  The frightening aspect is that it is not the first incident in the area.  This is the second roof to be blown off an apartment block in the general area as a similar incident took place on the Blackglen Road in October of last year.  It is not normal to have roofs blowing off buildings so it has to be more than a coincidence when it happens twice.</P>
        <P>What is required is an audit by the Health and Safety Authority of all the high-rise buildings in the area.  This area around Stepaside, Leopardstown and Carrickmines is elevated and exposed, being in the foothills of the mountains, and there is no room for error or for the assumption that all of the other buildings will somehow be okay.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should ensure this happens and I ask the Minister of State who is present to communicate this to the Minister.</P>
        <P>There is a further issue in this general area of south County Dublin, which I am sure applies elsewhere, namely, the safety of the half-completed and unoccupied high-rise buildings, many of which are in this general area, as the Minister of State will be aware.  All of these buildings are victims of the property market collapse.  In at least some cases, the building companies are now in receivership and others are or will shortly be on the books of NAMA, and nobody <Col N="121"/>knows what the ultimate fate of all of these buildings will be.  Meanwhile, they are lying idle, half finished with building equipment lying around, and they are completely uninhabited.  If these uncompleted buildings lose a roof, who knows what kind of hazard they pose not just to their neighbours but to passers by.  The Sandyford industrial estate is full of such abandoned buildings.  Wind damage by hoardings, scaffolding and by the buildings themselves present obvious dangers.  If there are accidents, we have no idea who will is responsible, who is maintaining the buildings and who, ultimately, is monitoring their safety.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If these buildings are not completed, their planning permissions will die and the owners will be in breach of the planning Acts because they have not completed the buildings according to their planning permissions.  Clearly, for financial reasons, they are not in a position to do so.  This is a planning issue that will apply throughout the country.  We have had a graphic demonstration today of what can happen but this could happen to many of the high-rise buildings throughout the country, particularly in the Dublin area and in my constituency and that of the Minister of State.  It is a planning issue that has to be addressed and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must take the lead.</P>
        <P>Today, however, it is the immediate safety issue that cannot be ignored.  Two examples of roof loss in high-rise buildings in the same general area must ring alarm bells for all such buildings in the area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for raising this important issue, which affects both of our constituencies.  At the outset, I place clearly on the record of the House my sympathy for those homeowners in the Carrickmines Manor complex whose properties were damaged by this morning&rsquo;s roof collapse.  We have seen very clearly over the past week the destruction that can be caused by the powerful forces of nature, be they in the form of wind or rain, and the upset and difficulties that can be caused for families having to move out of their homes as a result.</P>
        <P>The legal requirements regarding the construction of new buildings, including houses and extensions to, and material alterations of, existing buildings, are set out in the building control code.  A comprehensive suite of related technical guidance documents provide detailed guidance on how to comply with the regulations.  Under the provisions of the Building Control Act 1990, responsibility for compliance with the building regulations rests with the builder and the owner of a building.  Enforcement is a matter for the local building control authority, which is empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings when considered necessary.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Carrickmines Manor incident, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been in contact with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in whose administrative area the development is located.  I understand that in response to a request from the fire service this morning, officials from the council&rsquo;s dangerous buildings section went to the scene of the event, where they met with representatives from the developer and their consultant engineers.  I understand also that in addition to the fire service, the Garda, the council&rsquo;s housing department and representatives of the managing agent engaged to manage the apartment complex were also in attendance.</P>
        <P>In total, three apartment blocks and a number of houses were evacuated.  The immediate housing needs of the evacuated residents are being looked after by the developer and the property management agent.  In terms of dealing with the physical issue on-site, the council has indicated that measures are being taken to remove the debris of the fallen roof.  In addition, <Col N="122"/>steps are being taken to secure the roof of the remainder of that block and of the two adjacent apartment blocks as a precautionary measure.</P>
        <P>As the House will appreciate, the response to this incident is at an early stage.  It would not be appropriate to become involved in matters that may ultimately have to be resolved between the developer, the residents and their insurers, but the council has been asked to keep the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government apprised of developments in its response to the incident.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I thank everyone, particularly those in the emergency services and the county council, who attended the scene at Carrickmines Manor this morning and assisted the residents in responding to the difficult position in which they find themselves.  I hope the parties involved can work quickly towards finding a resolution and ensure that the residents do not have to remain out of their homes for any longer than is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 56 and 61 together.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; is one of the commitments contained in the Next Generation Broadband policy paper &ldquo;Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June this year.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; concept is to facilitate telecoms operators in gaining access to ducting assets in State owned networks, thereby ensuring optimal use of State assets and facilitating more cost-effective roll out of broadband.  The context to the proposal is <Col N="124"/>the anticipated increase in demand for high speed broadband.  This can be facilitated by the installation of fibre in State owned ducting.</P>
        <P>The actual implementation of the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; is a complex process involving engagement with a range of State Bodies who own the assets and also consideration of the best operational model to implement the concept.  My Department has had internal engagement with the relevant State Bodies who are generally supportive of the proposal.</P>
        <P>On foot of this engagement my Department has undertaken a review of State owned networks to determine the routes of infrastructure such as roads, electricity, gas and rail.  A more detailed audit of the infrastructure in these networks will now be necessary in order to provide telecoms operators with the type of information they require to inform commercial decisions on broadband rollout.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to establish an Implementation Task Force chaired by my Department and comprising senior officials from the relevant State agencies who own ducting infrastructure to oversee the project.</P>
        <P>It is necessary, in advancing the concept of a co-ordinated service for telcos, to ensure that any arrangements will not impose net additional costs on them and will provide added value.  We will also consider possible impacts on both private sector telcos and State companies with a telco arm to ensure that the introduction of the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; supports a competitive market but does not create undue market distortions.</P>
        <P>It is also important, in terms of future-proofing, to understand what alternative options telcos may have to the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; concept and what impact regulatory changes may have on these over time.  There are complex commercial, legal and technical issues, which my Department is progressing as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>To assist implementation of access to State ducting, I intend to amend Part V of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 relating to carrying out communications work on public roads.</P>
        <P>These proposed amendments will provide a framework for the National Roads Authority to make ducts on national roads and motorways accessible to telecommunication companies.</P>
        <P>It is intended that these amendments will be introduced in the Report Stage in the D&aacute;il of the Premium Rate Services Bill 2009, which is scheduled for early next month.  My Department will also advance urgently consideration of all the other issues which will impact on implementation of the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo;.  This includes the appropriate operational model.  It is my intention that the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; will be in place in 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 82, 88 and 90 together.</P>
        <P>Quantifying the numbers of people who can be classified as fuel poor depends on the methodology employed.  The ESRI estimates that some 300,000 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty last year.  This figure is based on the share of income spent on household fuels.  ESRI estimates that based on subjective assessment by householders, some 68,000 or 4.6% of households could not afford to heat their homes adequately in 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to mitigating the impact of energy costs for vulnerable households through a combination of institutional supports, structural energy efficiency improvements to houses and advice for consumers.  The effective communication of energy saving information and advice to the elderly and other vulnerable customers is crucial.  The updated Keep Well and Warm booklet, and the associated website, provide energy saving advice as well as information on grant schemes and other supports.  Some 132,000 copies of the booklet have been circulated this year.</P>
        <P>I am working closely with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to ensure a fully cohesive approach to energy affordability.  The Affordable Energy Strategy, currently being developed by the Inter Departmental Agency Group, will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is the pivotal mechanism for alleviating the underlying cause of energy poverty &mdash; that of thermal inefficiency.  Some &euro;20 million has been provided for the scheme in 2009, which includes &euro;5 million provided by ESB and BGE.  Under the Scheme, structural improvements will have been made to an additional 15,000 homes by the end of this year.  This represents a very significant up-scaling of the scheme and underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to those most at risk this winter.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty at zero or nominal cost.  The scheme is primarily delivered by 22 community based organisations (CBOs).  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and St. Vincent De Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.</P>
        <P>Each CBO is responsible for managing applications in their own operational areas.  Neither SEI nor my Department have data on the number of applications in each CBO area.</P>
        <P>The waiting time for approval and participation in the scheme varies across CBOs.  It depends on the level of demand in individual areas and available resources available to them.  The average waiting time under the Scheme currently ranges between six and ten months.  This is a significant improvement on previous years.  It is the case that applicants who have recently <Col N="126"/>applied under the scheme may not, in the time available, be assisted before the end of the year.  They will however, be accommodated next year subject to available funding.</P>
        <P>Apart from the Warmer Homes Scheme there is considerable financial assistance to alleviate fuel poverty provided under various schemes which are the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Fuel Poverty Action Research Project was established by Combat Poverty and SEI.  The project was designed to assess the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the Warmer Homes Scheme.</P>
        <P>The report was initially scheduled to be completed in 2008.  However, I am advised that its completion was delayed due to the accidental loss of some key data.  In August of this year the draft report was circulated to members of the research community for comment.  Following this consultation process, publication of the final report is expected next month.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 92 and 93 together.</P>
        <P>As I advised the House earlier, the Government is committed to the sustainable development of an Irish biofuels market in line with EU biofuel requirements and policy developments.  The introduction of the National Biofuel Obligation next year will underpin the development of the Irish biofuels market.  The Obligation will also integrate the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on Sustainability Criteria as soon as these are finalised.  Under the Obligation fuel suppliers will be legally required to include 4% biofuels in their overall annual fuel sales.  I am satisfied that this target will be delivered.  The Obligation will in effect create a long-term market based framework for the progressive development of the Irish biofuels sector.  As the Deputy is aware, prior to the introduction of the Excise Relief schemes in 2005, market penetration of biofuels in Ireland was almost non-existent.  Penetration is set to exceed 2% in 2009.  There have been at least five biofuels plants constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the schemes.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.  Under the excise relief schemes there has been over 180 million litres of <Col N="127"/>biofuel produced for the Irish market to date, of which 49% was imported from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and South America.  The steady growth in indigenous biofuel production is reflected in the fact that it represents 51% of biofuel production to date.  The introduction of the Biofuel Obligation in 2010 will, through the creation of a guaranteed market demand, provide the Irish biofuels sector with the certainty it needs to underpin investment and sustainable growth.  This will create economic activity across the regions.  I can advise the Deputy that funding of over &euro;5 million was provided under ReHeat and CHP programmes for 2009.  It is the case that projects to date have come from the solid biomass sector as opposed to the liquid biofuel sector.  Overall, I am satisfied that the National Obligation from next year, will incentivise and enable the sustainable growth of the Irish biofuels market and support indigenous biofuel producers.  The EU sustainability criteria will also provide some competitive advantage by ensuring that non-EU imports meet strict environmental guidelines.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to address the windfall profits being made by electricity generators on the back of charging consumers for the cost of carbon; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[43323/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which runs until the end of 2012, requires a free allocation of carbon credits to electricity generators.  The North-South Single Electricity Market Committee, which is statutorily responsible for the operation of the all-island electricity market on the island of Ireland, decided that from 2008 all electricity generators must include the full opportunity cost of their carbon allocations when bidding into the Single Electricity Market.  The enterprise community in particular is concerned that this increases the wholesale cost of electricity and gives rise to windfall gains being earned by electricity generators.  The cost impact of carbon and the related windfall gains for generators fluctuates with the price of carbon, which is currently at approximately &euro;13 a tonne.  The Government decided last July to work to progress the introduction of legislation to recover carbon windfall gains from electricity generators up to 2012.  My Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance, is examining the complex issues inherent in designing a legislative mechanism, which could recover carbon windfall gains from electricity generation companies.  There are many legal and other considerations to take into account in any potential treatment of carbon windfall gains.  The potential impact on the rules and operation of the all-island Single Electricity Market, which straddles the two jurisdictions, North and South, is also a key consideration.  I will be reverting to the Government with the outcome of the analysis and the advice of the Attorney General as soon as possible.  The ESB has contributed over &euro;300 million this year to reduce electricity prices for all consumers, of which ESB&rsquo;s carbon benefits accounted for a significant portion.  For the future and in the context of the European Union&rsquo;s ambitious plans for carbon emissions and cap and trade after 2012, my personal view is that the allocation of carbon credits, which is the basis for trading, should be done by auction rather than free allocation.  I strongly favour a scenario post 2012 in which all carbon permits should be bought on the open market and producers can compete on the basis of carbon costs.  This will eliminate any windfall gains for electricity producers and promote competition between generators as to who can produce electricity using the least carbon.  In my view this is an essential development, which will be good for the environment and good for the consumer.</P>

	<P>The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is responsible for spectrum management in Ireland and is required, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, to produce, publish and maintain the national Radio Frequency Plan, which is a national table of frequency allocations.  This document details international and European frequency allocations as well as national usage and relevant national and European legislation.  Copies of this document can be obtained from ComReg at <i>www.comreg.ie</i>.  ComReg is also responsible for the assignment of spectrum by means of licences issued to individual licensees or licence exemptions, in accordance with Regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 with my approval.  The process used to determine which spectrum is assigned to whom is a matter for ComReg, including where necessary by competition or auction. In carrying out these functions, ComReg holds regular public consultations regarding the most suitable course of action for various spectrum ranges.  ComReg is currently considering how best to assign spectrum that will become available in the medium term.  In particular, there is likely to be significant demand for the spectrum which is in the GSM band and other spectrum that will become available when analogue TV is switched off.  The options are complicated, and the final decision, regarding the optimal process is entirely a matter for ComReg.</P>

        <P>The report of the Geothermal Working Group is being finalised and it is intended to publish it, when complete, on the Department&rsquo;s website.  I am strongly committed to the early provision of a legislative framework for the exploration for and development of geothermal energy.  Accordingly, I have instructed my Department to prioritise the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill with a view to producing heads in early 2010, with detailed legislative drafting to follow by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  It is important to stress that geothermal energy is a new area of legislative endeavour in this jurisdiction and the Bill is likely to be substantial, dealing with a range of matters such as ownership of the resource, regulation and licensing of exploration and development, ancillary rights and protection of third party interests.  In relation to combined heat and power facilities, it is my intention that the Bill will be drafted to accommodate a range of technical approaches to the exploitation of geothermal energy.  While I am <Col N="129"/>committed to expediting the preparation of this legislation, it is not possible at this juncture to identify a firm date for publication.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 49, 74 and 76 together.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides, consolidates and updates broadcasting legislation.  Part 8 of this Act replaces and updates the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 which provided for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.  Under the 2009 Act, RT&Eacute; continues to have responsibility for the provision of a national free to air digital terrestrial television system with the capacity to carry RT&Eacute; 1, Network 2, TG4 and TV3.  This new service will eventually replace the existing analogue terrestrial television service.  The legislation also requires the newly established Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to provide for the development of commercial digital terrestrial television, DTT, services.  The BAI, which is an independent regulatory authority, is responsible under the 2009 Act for the licensing and competition issues raised by the Deputies.  A competition for commercial multiplexes initiated by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, in 2008, under the 2007 Act, is still ongoing.  The contract has been offered to the One Vision consortium.  The BAI has taken over the role of the BCI in finalising this competition.  While I have no direct function in these matters, I am concerned on policy grounds to see an early agreement on the provision of commercial DTT services and an early time path for the implementation of such agreement.  My policy objective is the achievement of the earliest possible switch-off of the analogue system thereby releasing valuable spectrum to enable Ireland to reap the benefits of the digital dividend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the rollout of DTT services, I am informed by RT&Eacute; that, to date, 13 sites have been DTT enabled to accommodate both the single free to air DTT multiplex and also three commercial DTT multiplexes.  This represents the most difficult and costly element of the build plan as it includes the main transmitter sites in Ireland.  It also involves costs associated with replacing several of these masts to accommodate the commercial multiplexes.  RT&Eacute; has <Col N="130"/>informed me that the accumulated capital expenditure on DTT, commercial plus free to air, for 2009 is expected to be &euro;13.5 million.  In relation to the timing of the rollout of the free to air DTT service, the legislation provides that RT&Eacute; must provide a full national DTT service by the end of 2011 or such later date as I decide.  RT&Eacute; has not yet set a date for launching the free to air DTT service but has indicated a preference for launching in parallel with a commercial DTT operator as the availability of commercial DTT is important to assist RT&Eacute; in getting a return on its investment and to ensure adequate viewer choice in the digital era.</P>
        <P>In relation to the target date for switching off the analogue terrestrial television services, the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for me to establish a date or dates for analogue switch off, after consultation with RT&Eacute; and the BAI, on among other things, the availability of digital television services in the country, the availability of suitable televisions and other receivers and the take up of these services.  In this regard, I am in close contact with the BAI and RT&Eacute; on progress in these areas.  The European Commission has set 2012 as the timeline for analogue switch off throughout Europe and recent correspondence from the European Commission is requesting that Member States should endeavour to adopt 1 January 2012 as the target date.  I consider that it is in the best interests of Ireland to switch off analogue services in 2012.  In this regard, I have established a group to advise me on planning for analogue switch off and I expect to report on this in the first quarter of 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 53, 57 and 84 together.</P>
        <P>A smart economy envisages economic development based on innovation and sustainability and an economy aiming for high end performance requires that the underlying infrastructure supports enterprises based on knowledge and innovation.  One key element of national infrastructure which is required is a common spatial identifier across the economy.  Postcodes provide this common identifier which will assume greater importance as we become more embedded in the digital economy.  Ireland is the only country in the EU that does not have such a postal code in place.  The Government has recently approved the implementation of a <Col N="131"/>postcode for Ireland as recommended by the National Postcode Project Board.  This board, which comprised representatives from Government Departments, together with public and private sector organisations, including the Communications Workers Union, identified many postal and non-postal benefits of introducing postcodes and recommended that a postcode be introduced.  Consultations conducted by the Board&rsquo;s advisors revealed an overwhelming support for the introduction of postcodes across public, private and voluntary sectors and identified that postcodes would not only deliver benefits for the postal sector but also would contribute to the development of a knowledge economy and the country&rsquo;s overall competitiveness.</P>
        <P>With respect to the postal sector, the forthcoming liberalisation of the market in 2011 has highlighted the absence of a postcode as a potential barrier to market development and many stakeholders see postcodes as playing an important role in development of a competitive, high-quality postal sector.  I am aware of the criticisms made by the Communications Workers Union, in particular, that postcodes will damage the position of An Post.  This is not the case.  It has been longstanding Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to compete in a liberalised market.  The Government&rsquo;s core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure that Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services.  This would not be possible without a key piece of infrastructure such as postcodes.  The introduction of postcodes will bring opportunities for all players in the postal sector.  However, some of the more significant benefits of having a postcode in place will materialise outside of the postal and logistics sectors.  These benefits include providing an enhanced capacity and capability to use spatial data effectively and link databases with spatial elements across Government.  Using spatial data more effectively can improve public policy making and help with the more effective use of resources.  Postcodes will also facilitate better location-based services and will also facilitate the speedier deployment of emergency services.</P>
        <P>As regards costs, the National Postcodes Project Board&rsquo;s report estimated upfront costs of establishing a postcode address database, implementing and promoting the postcode would be in the region of &euro;15 million.  The ongoing annual maintenance costs, will be financed from revenues generated by the postcode manager charging for value added products and services.  The upfront investment by Government can be justified, because, the benefits to society, which are spread across a wide range of stakeholders, including the public sector, outweigh the private benefits accruing to any individual investor.  No single stakeholder or set of stakeholders is likely to ensure the delivery of a publicly available postcode.  Government is in the unique position of being able to implement a national postal and location code.  As a key piece of national infrastructure, they will deliver economic and social benefits, which we will reap long into the future.  Whilst many of the benefits of postcodes cannot be accurately gauged in monetary terms, consultants asked to review the public sector benefits estimated the monetary benefits to the State would be &euro;22 million in the medium term.  This analysis incurred fees of &euro;54,450.  Separately, the National Postcodes Project Board was assisted in its work by technical and economic consultants, recruited and funded in 2005 by ComReg, at a cost of approximately &euro;479,000.  Following on from the Government approval to implement postcodes, my officials and I are working to address the next steps in this project, including the process of selecting a body to implement the proposed system.  It is expected that postcodes will be assigned and in use in 2011.</P>

	<P>The Greener Homes Scheme supports the installation by householders of renewable energy heating technologies including wood pellet and chip stoves and boilers, gasification boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps.  The grant is a fixed amount, based upon the technology selected, towards the cost of purchase and installation of the chosen scheme.  Products and installers must be selected from published Sustainable Energy Ireland registered lists.  The net number of applications from 2006 to date under the scheme is 29,000.  Nearly 25,000 installations have been completed under the scheme.  Exchequer funding to date has amounted to just under &euro;62 million.  The Greener Homes Scheme has created a stable market in domestic renewable energy technologies and has supported the development of the renewable heating industry.  The current phase of the scheme was launched in July 2008.  New homes ceased to be eligible with the introduction of the new building regulations under which it is now compulsory to include a component of renewable energy in new housing developments.  The scheme is supporting a range of objectives, including more competitive offerings for the consumer, enhanced product standards, quality assurance and improved training standards and certainty for the renewable heating industry.  The Exchequer allocation of &euro;12.345 million for 2009 was increased by &euro;3 million during the year in order to meet continued levels of demand under the scheme.  Decisions in relation to funding for 2010 will be taken in the context of the Estimates process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 65 and 68 together.</P>
<P>The Government has ambitious plans for the large scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  A target has been set of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020.  This would equate to around 225,000 cars on Irish roads.  Electric vehicles are an increasingly realistic solution to the challenge of reducing the transport sector&rsquo;s Greenhouse Gas Emissions and reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.  There is now very significant global investment under way in research and development in this area.  The technology is maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  There is keen interest internationally in Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to be an early mover in this field.  Ireland is seen as an excellent test-bed particularly in relation to network infrastructure development.  The challenge now is to develop economically viable options for the establishment, cost efficient operation and maintenance of an electric vehicle infrastructure network in Ireland, together with measures to develop a market for the vehicles themselves.</P><Col N="133"/>
        <P>ESB Networks has a central role to play in the research and development of the infrastructure network.  The ESB is also playing a leading role in work by European utilities and car manufacturers to progress essential standardisation across Europe.  The Inter Departmental/Inter Agency Taskforce is advising on the costed options and timeframes for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the cost effective deployment of electric vehicles on a national basis.  Initial estimates by ESB Networks for the roll out of infrastructure are between 6 and 18 months depending on the scale of initial deployment.  Global developments will be factored in as the technologies mature.  I am currently reviewing the report of the task force with a view to bringing it to Government in the near future for agreement to setting a clear roadmap ahead.  While it is my intention in the context of Budget 2010 to discuss with the Minister for Finance, the possible introduction of incentives to assist in the roll-out of electric vehicles, such decisions can only be considered in the context of the overall budget framework.  My Department and the ESB have already agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with Renault-Nissan which provides for ongoing information exchange on developments.  Discussions are underway with a number of other car manufacturers, with a view to developing Memoranda of Understanding, with them also.</P>

	<P>Developing the electricity grid infrastructure in the North West in an economically viable and environmentally acceptable way is the key to optimising the North West renewable energy resources to the benefit of the region, the economy and consumers.  The North West has the potential to become a net electricity exporter to the rest of the island and beyond.</P>
        <P>EirGrid&rsquo;s GRID25 strategy sets out in broad terms the development required in each region of the country out to 2025.  EirGrid concludes that the capacity of the backbone transmission system needs to be doubled in the period from now to 2025 in order to meet future levels of demand, security of supply needs and to deliver on our ambitions for renewable energy.</P>
        <P>Grid25 states that the renewable energy demand in the North West region could grow by up to 60% by 2025.  EirGrid&rsquo;s assessment is that Donegal could have almost 700 MW of wind generation by 2025, with Mayo/Galway having around 890 MW and Leitrim/Roscommon having just over 250 MW of wind generation.  This is in addition to the potential for 300 MW of ocean generating technologies where the challenge is to get to large scale deployment over the next decade.</P>
        <P>An ambitious but cost effective level of transmission infrastructure will be needed to deliver this renewable capacity in a region which is acknowledged to have a relatively weak transmission system currently.</P>
        <P>Grid25 has already identified the key infrastructure upgrades for the North West region:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Investment of approximately &euro;750m to upgrade almost 700 km of the existing transmission network in the North West and to build new circuits;</P><Col N="134"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Extension of the 220 kV network into Sligo, which is already in progress;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />110 kV reinforcements between Killybegs and Letterkenny and between Ballaghadereen and Castlebar;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Major infrastructural development from Mayo to the main bulk transmission system in the eastern part of the region;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Further integration of the Donegal and Northern Ireland networks in conjunction with NIE, the Northern Ireland Transmission company.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">In the latter context, EirGrid, in conjunction with SONI and Northern Ireland Electricity, is assessing the overall options for strengthening the linkages between the two networks. Eirgrid has confirmed with me that options for the Sorne line are being reviewed among several possible options being assessed.  The specific lines and routes ultimately identified will be subject to the normal planning processes North and South.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that the benefits of competition in electricity supply, which have previously been confined to large industrial and commercial customers, are also available to domestic consumers.  The entry into the domestic electricity market of two new suppliers, Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is Energy, demonstrates that policy to encourage competition in electricity generation and supply is paying dividends for consumers.</P>
        <P>The independent suppliers are offering discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB unit rates.  These discounts apply even after the 10% reduction in ESB prices implemented by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) from May 1st 2009.  The independent suppliers are also offering domestic consumers fresh choices, such as the proportion of renewable electricity they purchase, as well as alternative billing arrangements.  Domestic customers have been switching to the independent suppliers in unprecedented numbers.  However, there are close to 2 million domestic electricity customers and ESB still retains some 80% of the market share in this category.</P>
        <P>The CER has made it clear that the regulation of ESB tariffs will only continue until competition has taken firm hold in the market.  Energy price regulation is designed to ensure that a dominant player cannot engage in uncompetitive, short-term pricing practices, which could undermine or drive out emerging competition.  The CER has been working with ESB and with the other players in the market to develop a timeframe for deregulation.</P>
        <P>In a tariff decision paper published on September 3rd 2009, the CER set out its commitment to the short to medium term removal of all price regulation provided there is the continued <Col N="135"/>development of the appropriate levels of sustainable competition in all sectors of the market.  I welcome the CER&rsquo;s commitment to publish a &rsquo;Roadmap&rsquo; for deregulation in the near future.</P>

	<P>There are no plans to disband the Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA).  The Agency has enjoyed much success in creating a cluster of young and vibrant enterprises focussing on the creation and development of digital media content which will be key to the success of the smart economy.  The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes did recommend that the DHDA should be amalgamated with either Enterprise Ireland or the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) but no decision has been taken by me or the Government.</P>
        <P>The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) continues to develop and grow the Digital Hub.  The number of companies and employees based in the Hub has grown steadily and the demand for additional space for digital media companies continues to increase.</P>
        <P>There are now 870 employees working in 101 companies located in the Digital Hub.  A further 290 approximately contract employees are engaged on a regular basis by Hub companies.  Approximately one in six digital media companies currently operating in Ireland is based in the Digital Hub.  The work of these companies encompasses computer gaming, animation, online bookings, Internet security, website development, mobile technologies, broadcasting, design and Internet services.  Such highly skilled knowledge economy companies are key to maintaining and developing economic success.</P>
        <P>The Digital Hub Development Agency has performed remarkably well since its inception and I look to the client companies that have been nurtured at the Digital Hub as exemplars of what we can do in establishing Ireland as a leader in digital media industries.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 86 together.  </P><Col N="136"/>
        <P>Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles which are crucial to the development of the market including (i) competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment (ii) investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure, (iii) investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide to address market failures and to provide certain of the State&rsquo;s communication needs (iv) appropriate regulation.</P>
        <P>A variety of international reports on electronic communications markets are published periodically.  It is clear from all of the reports that the roll out, penetration and quality of broadband in Ireland has improved steadily over recent years.  I welcome the &ldquo;Broadband Quality Score&rdquo; report published jointly by the Universities of Oxford (England) and Oviedo (Spain) on October 1st last and referred to by the Deputy.  The report is the second annual global study on the quality of broadband connections, which provides useful comparisons of quality and penetration indicators between the countries studied in each year and a measurement of progress achieved in the period between the two reports.</P>
        <P>The 2009 report highlights significant progress in Ireland&rsquo;s broadband performance across a range of headings.  In particular it reflects the significant improvements in the roll out, penetration and quality of Ireland&rsquo;s broadband over the past year.  The report highlights the improved broadband quality of service in Ireland moving the State into the group of countries that are recognised as &ldquo;Meeting the needs of today&rsquo;s applications&rdquo;.  In the previous report, published in 2008, Ireland was in the lower ranked group of countries that were classified as &ldquo;Below today&rsquo;s applications threshold&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s overall ranking of 16th out of the 66 countries in the Broadband Leadership table, measuring broadband quality and penetration by households, is commendable and shows due recognition for our increased penetration and quality over recent years.  Ireland is also credited for its performance in terms of &ldquo;Broadband Leadership Movers 2008&ndash;2009 Innovation Economies&rdquo;.  Only 11 of the 66 countries are credited as leaders in this &ldquo;innovation economies&rdquo; class.  Dublin is ranked at 87, from a Broadband Quality Score perspective, of more than 240 cities surveyed bringing it within the top 100 cities in the 66 countries surveyed and is classified as meeting the needs of today&rsquo;s applications.  It should be noted that major enterprises already located in, or who wish to locate in Ireland can contract with service providers who can provide high broadband speeds if required.</P>
        <P>Our significant improvement in broadband availability over recent years is recognised in the table &ldquo;penetration 2009&rdquo; where we occupy 12th place in the table of 66 countries and were the 5th best country in terms of improvements in penetration between 2008 and 2009.  I fully recognise the need to further improve access and the speed of broadband available in Ireland. I am determined to ensure that targeted Government action, the proper regulatory regime and a spirit of competitive collaboration within industry will address the issues.  The high level recommendations for policy makers contained in the report are already embedded in my policy paper &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;.  It is also important to note that the report underpins recent OECD, ECTA and ComReg reports, which confirm improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s roll out and speed of broadband.</P>

	<P>The second progress report by the Monitoring Committee was presented to me in early November 2009 and can be viewed under the Corporate Publications section of my Departments website.  The report has been circulated widely to interested parties who have been invited to submit observations on its content, together with a general invitation to raise any issues concerning the Sectoral Plan with the Department, at any time.  Arising from that circulation a number of submissions have been received, concerning both the material in the progress report and the content and implementation of the Sectoral Plan.  These issues are under consideration within the Department and will be brought to the attention of the Monitoring Committee. </P>
        <P>The submissions received have also been considered in the context of the report being completed by my Department under Section 31(4) of the Disability Act 2005.  When completed, that report will be forwarded to the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform for presentation to Government, in December 2009, as one of a suite of reports from Sectoral Plan Departments.  The Monitoring Committee is committed to undertaking an examination of the Sectoral Plan taking into consideration the revised remit of the Department since the Plan was published.  That process will consider progress achieved to date, submissions from interested parties and the views of the bodies under the aegis of the Department.</P>

        <P>The policy paper sets out the Government&rsquo;s position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible, by Government (e.g. by providing access to State owned electronic communications infrastructure).  Existing policy has facilitated significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband speeds over recent years and my focus will be in continuing implementation of this policy.  I do not have any plans for the State to be involved in a strategic partnership with any service provider to roll out next generation broadband.  I do however, welcome all plans by service providers across different platforms to invest in high-speed broadband and will ensure that the State provides a supportive environment for such investment.</P>

	<P>The two regulators, North and South, have been working together since late 2007 to develop joint proposals for the Common Arrangements for Gas (CAG) whereby all players in the gas market could buy, sell, transport and contribute to the development and planning of the natural gas market North and South on an all-island basis.  The work of the Regulators has included a Cost Benefit Analysis of the potential mutual economic and strategic benefits of the project.  The analysis has shown quantifiable and strategic benefits for the two jurisdictions.  Following further independent review of that analysis undertaken on behalf of both Departments North and South, both Minister Foster and myself have agreed that the project has the potential to achieve the strategic benefits identified.</P>
        <P>The two regulators are working closely with my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland (DETI) on the project.  They are also continuing to engage with industry on the development of the high level design for CAG.  Work to date has focussed on the key areas of system operations, transmission tariffs and gas quality which are the foundation stones on which the project can be built.  The Regulators have also commenced work on security of supply and the retail market.  To date, a number of consultation documents have been published and industry workshops held.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the work on this project, the EU Third Energy Package aimed at further reform of the European gas and electricity sector includes new rules for the promotion of regional and bilateral solidarity between gas transmission system operators and regulators leading to the establishment of regional gas markets.  These are objectives which dovetail very closely with the CAG project.  Further work on CAG proposals is being fully informed by the EU internal gas market developments including the structural arrangements for joint operation of the gas networks.  With a view to working towards conclusions at an early date on the high level design of the CAG while also achieving compliance with EU legislation I will, over the coming months, be considering the advice from my Department on optimum structural arrangements for CAG and discussing further with my Ministerial colleagues in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the project would require arrangements to be underpinned by enabling legislation in both jurisdictions as was the case for the Single Electricity Market.  In light of work by the Regulators to date and the completion of further analysis by both Departments, I am hopeful that Minister Foster and myself can reach agreement in the coming months on the way forward and agree a clear timetable for the gas industry for progressive delivery of the CAG.</P>

	<P>Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is a highly efficient way of generating onsite heat and electricity simultaneously.  It can offer significantly reduced energy bills for the end user and is a particularly efficient form of energy generation as it minimises any transmission losses involved in getting power to the site.  Traditionally, CHP plants were only used in large industrial units with a high on-site heat load.  Increasingly the technology is developing higher efficiency, smaller scale units that are capable of servicing smaller buildings and even down to individual residential scale units.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As this technology becomes more common in the market, smaller commercial premises, including public buildings, can now reduce their energy costs by installing CHP systems.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) administers the Deployment Programme for CHP technologies.  The programme was expanded in early 2008 to include dedicated support for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion powered CHP.</P>
        <P>Under the SEI Support Programme a significant number of Public Buildings have taken advantage of the benefits of CHP, or are currently in the process of doing so.  For example, three separate academic institutions have installed CHP systems, with a total electrical capacity of 850 kilowatts, and two more are in the process of installing systems with an electrical capacity of 750 kilowatts.  In the Health sector, 5 hospitals have already installed CHP systems with a total electrical capacity of 770 kilowatts, and 3 local authorities sites have installed systems with an electrical capacity of 350 kilowatts, with one more in construction.</P>
        <P>The Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat), which incentivises the installation of biomass boilers, is also open to institutional users of heat, and has already supported the construction of a number of projects where the heat load was not sufficient to justify the expense of a CHP plant.  Taken together, CHP technologies and the projects supported by Reheat offer a real and immediate solution to energy costs in these types of institutions by reducing the cost of power and increasing the overall energy efficiency of the buildings.</P>
        <P>There are particular challenges for Ireland in achieving significant CHP penetration given our dispersed low density population and the characteristics of the built environment.  The improvements in CHP technology and the ongoing work of SEI with the Public Sector and industry will help us to overcome the challenges.</P>

	<P>Part 7, Chapter 6 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of an Oireachtas Channel and a film channel. Part 8 of the Act provides for a right of carriage on the RT&Eacute; digital terrestrial television multiplex in respect of these channels. </P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas may establish a public service channel to be made available throughout the island of Ireland providing coverage of: proceedings of both Houses of the Oireachtas; proceedings of a local authority; institutions under the British-Irish Agreement; other legislatures; and UN, EU and Council of Europe institutions.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Act provides that the cost of such a channel would be met from the budget of the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas and that no advertising is permitted on the channel.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Film Channel, the Act provides that the Irish Film Board may establish a public service channel to be made available throughout the island of Ireland providing coverage of Irish, European and World films including those in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>The Act provides that the cost of such a channel would be met from the budget of the Irish Film Board.  The Act also provides that the Irish Film Channel can broadcast advertisements.</P>
        <P>The development of these channels is therefore a matter for the Irish Film Board and the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas respectively.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a new Oireachtas channel could provide for extended free-to-air television coverage of the proceedings which take place in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in other democratic fora.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Irish Film Channel can both add to the diversity of available public broadcasting services and provide a wide audience for the wealth of Irish and foreign films produced and in production.</P>

These training opportunities, which will be provided in partnership with community and voluntary organisations, will provide for beginners to learn precisely the type of skills our research shows are most in demand &mdash; i.e. use of email, basic Internet use, as well as a range of other useful skills including conducting on-line transactions.</P>
        <P>The Department is preparing a knowledge society strategy for publication in 2010 and, in that context, will inter alia be looking at the approach to tackling the digital divide, taking account of resource availability.  The approach will also entail a stronger focus on meaningful content, raising people&rsquo;s awareness of the content relevant to them so as to promote further engagement and encouraging the providers of online services to focus on the usability of their technologies.</P>

	<P>It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) there will still be a small percentage of premises that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).  The European Economic Recovery Programme includes funding for access to broadband infrastructure in rural areas and my Department is currently considering the design and implementation of such a scheme.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s high energy costs, by comparison with much of Europe, are primarily due to significant dependence on imported fossil fuels, particularly gas, as well a requirement for very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  The under-investment in networks and power generation posed real risks to security of supply which had become a major concern for enterprise. Ireland also faces structural challenges, including geographic isolation, a small and widely dispersed population and lack of economies of scale in power generation, which lead to a higher cost base in Ireland than in competitor countries.</P><Col N="143"/>
        <P>In the current economic downturn, indigenous business and the inward investment community have become even more concerned about energy costs. The Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.</P>
        <P>All electricity users benefitted in 2009 from direct subsidies totalling &euro;567m.  These were made up of an ESB rebate to consumers of &euro;315m, a repayment of certain Public Service Obligation (PSO) levies of &euro;87m and the deferral of some network revenues until after October 2009.</P>
        <P>The Government agreed in July that these subsidies will continue for large energy users at their current level until October 2010 and will then be phased out over the following two year period.  In a number of cases this will see businesses paying up to 40% less for electricity compared with what they were paying in 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition, arising from their mid-year review of energy prices, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) lowered electricity prices for all customers by 10% and gas tariffs by an average of 12% for domestic and SME gas customers from May 1st 2009.</P>
        <P>The CER&rsquo;s most recent pricing decision approved an average decrease in gas tariffs of 9.8% with effect from 1 October 2009.  The decrease was made possible by the downward shift in recent months in wholesale gas prices.  Small to Medium businesses have also seen further average reductions in their electricity bills of 5.5% from 1 October as the new CER tariff decisions came into effect.</P>
        <P>The CER also recently announced that the Public Service Obligation (PSO) Levy will be zero for 2009/2010.  The PSO is the mechanism through which we support the security of our energy supplies, including peat, and the development of wind power in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The level of capacity payments, that compensate electricity generators for their long run costs, will also be 15% lower in 2010 compared with 2009.  This represents a direct saving to all electricity consumers in 2010.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these actions will benefit all businesses, including both large energy users and SMEs, by significantly reducing the level of energy costs they would otherwise face in 2009/10.</P>
        <P>Working with the CER, my Department is also investigating the scope for further permanent structural changes to our electricity tariffs that will benefit business.  These changes include some rebalancing of network tariffs from 2010, as well as recovering carbon windfall gains from electricity generators.</P>
        <P>The CER is also about to commence work on a 5-year review of network expenditure.  These reviews are designed to ensure that ESB, EirGrid and BGE make even greater efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure, thus driving down costs to all consumers. CER will ensure that this review is rigorous in the interests notably of mitigating energy costs for business.</P>
        <P>The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in place, the sale of ESB generation capacity, entry of new players and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The development of supplier competition in the Large Energy User (LEU) market has meant that since 2006 the CER no longer regulates prices for this sector. ESB Customer Supply now supplies less than 10% of this market. The four main independent suppliers are Energia, Bord G&aacute;is, Airtricity and the independent ESB Independent Energy. The Enterprise community <Col N="144"/>acknowledges that there is a robust competition in the LEU supply market with the suppliers very actively competing for customers.</P>
        <P>There is also active competition between electricity suppliers in the SME market and companies can avail of discounts of up to 10%-20% simply by switching suppliers.  Already approximately 60% of SMEs have made this switch and are experiencing the benefits.</P>
        <P>Energy support programmes, offered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), are proving very successful in helping businesses reduce their energy usage and hence their costs.  In the past two years SEI has given free advice and training to over 1500 businesses in the SME sector and has advised that every single business has identified immediate savings, typically greater than 10% of costs.  Total business cost savings from the programme already total close to &euro;60 million per annum, which is in addition to savings of a similar scale in the SEI Large Industry Energy Network.</P>
        <P>Firms in this Network include some of Ireland&rsquo;s major employers and represent a significant proportion of Irish export income as well as accounting for 61% of all industrial energy use.  In addition to the significant annual savings achieved by firms in this network, Irish industry is also developing an international reputation for its efficiency activity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Smart Metering Programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government.  The Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand deliver smart networks and to deliver greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.  Smart Metering is also increasingly being seen at European Union level as a critical dimension of energy demand management in the interests of consumers and businesses.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s smart meter project covers both electricity and gas.  The pilot phase of the programme, which encompasses two strands, technology and customer behaviour, is now underway.  Technology trials are testing a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  Customer behaviour trials are determining the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.  The trials are essential to ensure that the optimum and most cost effective technology and systems are identified for the implementation phase.</P>
        <P>The electricity element of the pilot phase is expected to be completed at the end of December 2010.  It is important to have a trial that captures seasonal changes in usage for peak demand management purposes.  The outcome will be a fully informed decision on the most suitable model of smart meter/IT system, tariffing structure, communications system and demand stimuli.  The model must have the proven capability to deliver the anticipated benefits of smart metering, taking account of the specifics of the Irish energy system.</P><Col N="145"/>
        <P>The electricity technology trial will examine metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  Installation of up to 8,000 meters has commenced for technology testing in Limerick/Ennis, Cork City/Bandon and South Dublin/Wicklow.</P>
        <P>Over 6,000 participants for the electricity customer behaviour trial have been selected to ensure that the sample is representative of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity consumers both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  Installation of 6,363 meters for this trial has been completed and the data benchmarking period is in progress.  This trial will go live on 1 January 2010.</P>
        <P>The specifications of these metering systems will allow the testing of a range of functionality to deliver enhanced demand management.  These include interval metering reading, time of use tariffing and the use of In Home Display devices.  They will also provide reliable quality data on actual energy use which will lead to significantly better services to consumers in areas such as, improved fault monitoring and outage recording, power quality monitoring, reduced theft and losses and improved network planning.</P>
        <P>The gas element of the pilot phase is also moving ahead.  Installation of over 1,900 meters for the Customer Behaviour Trial is on schedule for completion by end November.  A further 750 meters will be installed to facilitate the Gas Technology Trials.  The gas customer behaviour and technology gas trials will go live in June 2010 and will continue until May 2011.</P>
        <P>The smart metering pilot is proceeding in parallel with the current microgeneration initiative and there are important links between the two.  The data gathered from the interval meters being used in the microgeneration scheme will provide vital information on the import and export of electricity, which will feed into the analysis of electricity use being carried out in the electricity element of the smart metering pilot.  In turn, the findings of the smart metering pilot will also inform the development of a long term microgeneration strategy.</P>
        <P>The present estimated cost of the pilot project is &euro;34.9m.  This comprises &euro;29.9m for the electricity element and &euro;5m for the gas element.  The cost of a national roll out will be determined on foot of the results of the pilot programme and decisions taken on the optimum type of cost effective smart metering system that will deliver the level of functionality required in an Irish market.</P>
        <P>A key component of the pilot phase is the associated cost benefit analysis, which will critically inform future decisions.  An interim analysis will be completed next year with the final analysis, to include the results of the gas trials, to be completed by mid 2011.</P>

	<P>Phase I of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme has delivered optical fibre based networks to twenty-seven towns and cities throughout the country.  All twenty-seven are operational and open for business and thirty-six service providers are currently offering services on twenty four of the Phase I MANs.  Three of the Phase I MANs are not currently used by service providers.  These are: Carrickmacross, Gaoth Dobhair, and Kingscourt.  While these networks are not yet being used, the significant increase in the demand for bandwidth is leading to greater demand for fibre based products and services.  Therefore these MANs will be used at a future time.</P>
        <P>An additional fifty-nine MANs covering sixty-five towns have been built under Phase II of the Programme.  One other Phase II MAN is currently under construction and is expected to <Col N="146"/>be completed in early 2010.  Following a competitive procurement process, the Department appointed e|net as the Management Services Entity for the Phase II MANs on 8 July 2009.  The Phase II MANs are being taken over by e|net on a phased basis.  It is expected that this process will be completed by quarter three of 2010.  Seven of the Phase II MANs are already being used by service providers and additional connections are expected as the handover process continues.</P>
        <P>Analysis undertaken by e|net shows that up to 570,000 end users are provided with electronic communications services by service providers connected to the MANs.</P>

	<P>The &ldquo;All Island Grid Study&rdquo; published early last year, examined the ability of the electricity systems on an All-Island basis to absorb power from renewable energy powered projects.</P>
        <P>Without being prescriptive, the study&rsquo;s findings showed that penetration of up to 42% renewable electricity is technically feasible without any major increase in pumped storage.  There are however, a number of different perspectives on the potential role for pumped storage in an electricity system with very significant levels of renewable energy.</P>
        <P>In order to further explore the various perspectives and current analysis, Sustainable Energy Ireland in conjunction with UCD hosted a seminar on energy storage on 4 November. The presentations made at the seminar are available on the Sustainable Energy Ireland Website.</P>
        <P>It is also the case that several private parties, including the Spirit of Ireland group specifically referred to by the Deputy, are developing renewable energy proposals which are predicated on pumped storage projects.</P>
        <P>The promoters of the Spirit of Ireland project presented their proposal last May, during a series of meetings with my Department, with other Departments as well as with the ESB, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I also met the Spirit of Ireland group myself.</P>
        <P>These early initial meetings gave us a good preliminary insight into this highly ambitious and complex proposal.  The promoters themselves acknowledged at that stage that there were very many elements to the project which needed detailed evaluation and analysis.

	<P>The Home Energy Saving Scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retro-fitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.</P>
        <P>Persons on low incomes are not excluded from the Home Energy Savings Scheme.  It is, however, clearly important to strike a balance between value for money in relation to the cost of the investment in delivering energy efficiency savings measures and the value of those energy savings to the economy.  SEI has therefore put in place a requirement that applicants to the Scheme install measures attracting a minimum grant payment of &euro;500.  The minimum grant threshold serves to ensure value for money to the Exchequer, while encouraging homeowners to take a holistic approach from the outset to improving the energy efficiency of their homes.  The success of the Scheme to date reflects the appetite among homeowners to make energy efficiency improvements. There are currently 27,000 approved applications in the system, representing in total a take-up of over 50,000 measures.  Roof and cavity wall insulation are proving the most popular.  This clearly shows that householders are availing of the combinations of measures to secure grants.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme, also administered by SEI, is specifically targeted at low income households.   Some &euro;20 million has been provided to the Warmer Homes Scheme for 2009.  This represents a very substantial increase on previous years.  This Scheme provides for the installation of a range of energy efficiency measures at little or no cost to the homeowner.  The measures include cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Details of this Scheme are available from Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also set aside some &euro;25 million for two initiatives designed to address thermal inefficiencies in local authority dwellings.  Of this, &euro;20 million has already been allocated to local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of dwellings and apartment complexes, to a BER standard of C1.  &euro;5 million has been set aside to support a number of demonstration projects that will achieve a BER rating in excess of C1 and will inform the future improvement of the overall local authority stock.</P>
