	<P>A dhaoine oirirce, 90 bliain &oacute; shin nuair a th&aacute;inig an Ch&eacute;ad Dh&aacute;il le ch&eacute;ile, bh&iacute; 34 duine as 105 de na comhalta&iacute; tofa i bpr&iacute;os&uacute;n.  Bhraith roinnt mhaith de na comhalta&iacute; a th&aacute;inig go dt&iacute; an fhoirgnimh seo go rabhadar i mbaol.  Sheasadar i dtoghch&aacute;n agus th&aacute;ngadar anseo ar ch&uacute;is amh&aacute;in: chreideadar sa neamhsple&aacute;chas agus chreideadar sa daonlathas. </P>
        <P>N&oacute;cha bliain ina dhiaidh sin, is minic a bhraithimid easpa sp&eacute;ise a bheith ag daoine sa pholait&iacute;ocht n&oacute; go bhfuiltear ag d&eacute;anamh talamh sl&aacute;n d&aacute;r bhain na daoine cr&oacute;ga sin amach 90 bliain &oacute; shin.  Ach, ar shl&iacute;, is comhartha ratha &eacute; sin &oacute; thaobh na ndaoine misni&uacute;la a th&aacute;inig go dt&iacute; an seomra seo 90 bliain &oacute; shin, agus &oacute;na dtaobh si&uacute;d a th&oacute;g &aacute;r n&aacute;isi&uacute;n agus &aacute;r gc&oacute;ras polait&iacute;ochta &oacute; shin.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go nd&eacute;anann daoine talamh sl&aacute;n d&aacute;r ndaonlathas agus d&aacute;r neamhsple&aacute;chas, ach is amhlaidh at&aacute; toisc go bhfuil siad muin&iacute;neach nach mbainfear d&iacute;obh iad.  Is comhartha &eacute; sin gur &eacute;irigh leis na daoine cr&oacute;ga a chruinnigh anseo 90 bliain &oacute; shin, ach n&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn a thuiscint i gc&oacute;na&iacute; nach dtarla&iacute;onn c&oacute;ras polait&iacute;ochta agus socha&iacute; fholl&aacute;in shibhialta astu f&eacute;in &mdash; n&iacute; fol&aacute;ir iad a chruth&uacute; agus iad a chothabh&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Ninety years ago when the First D&aacute;il met, 34 of the 105 elected Members were in jail.  Many of those who did come here to this building felt they were in danger.  They ran for election and they came here for one reason: they believed in independence and they believed in democracy.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P>Ninety years on, we often note a public disinterest in politics, or a sense that people take the achievements of those brave people 90 years ago for granted.  In a way, that is a tribute to them and to those who built our nation and political system since then.  Perhaps people do sometimes take our democracy and independence for granted, but that is because they are confident that nobody will take either away from them.  In a way, that is a mark of success, but we must always remind ourselves that a healthy political system and a healthy civil society do not just happen; they must be created and maintained.</P>
        <P>Throughout our somewhat tragic and troubled history, the Irish people have always made known their desire for national self-determination.  That desire to have our own Parliament was best enshrined in Charles Stewart Parnell&rsquo;s rallying speech in Cork on 21 January 1885:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">But no man has the right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation.  No man has a right to say to his country &lsquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no farther&rsquo; and we have never attempted to fix the <i>ne plus ultra</i> to the progress of Ireland&rsquo;s nationhood, and we never shall.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Exactly 34 years after delivering this speech at Cork, a group of very brave people assembled in this building to give life to that aspiration for nationhood.  It is an honour and a privilege to be here as Ceann Comhairle to mark the 90th anniversary of the sitting of the First D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Today, we salute the patriotism and courage of those elected representatives who, through their meeting here in the Mansion House in January 1919, assumed the right to establish a Parliament and run the affairs of this country.  They put in place an administration and a parliamentary structure which effectively marked the foundation of the State.  They gave new life to the stated wish of the Irish people for national self-determination which was expressed overwhelmingly in the 1918 general election.</P>
        <P>On that historic day they ignored the might of the British Empire and established the First D&aacute;il.  In doing so they made a clear statement to the world about Ireland&rsquo;s right to independence and they also signalled a commitment to parliamentary democracy.  In the words of Brian Farrell they established &ldquo;the authentic credentials of modern Irish democracy&rdquo;.  Risking their liberty and even their lives, they demonstrated extraordinary courage and determination to ratify the 1916 Proclamation of the Republic and followed that with the passing of what is now regarded as one of the most historic documents in Irish history &mdash; the Declaration of Independence.</P>
        <P>Once the declaration was made, my predecessor and very first Ceann Comhairle of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Cathal Brugha, said:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A Theachta&iacute; na D&aacute;la, tuigfidh sibh &oacute;na bhfuil dearbhaithe anso go bhfuilimid scartha anois le Sasana.  B&iacute;odh a fhios san ag an saol, agus ag daoine a mbaineann an sc&eacute;al leo.  P&eacute; n&iacute; a thiocfaidh as a bhfuil r&aacute;ite anso &mdash; imirt anama n&oacute; b&aacute;s &mdash; t&aacute; deireadh le r&eacute; na cainte in &Eacute;irinn, agus m&aacute;s maith &eacute; is mithid &eacute; &mdash; t&aacute; deireadh le r&aacute;im&eacute;is.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">T&aacute; teachtair&iacute; &oacute; fhormh&oacute;r a bhfuil de n&aacute;isi&uacute;in sa domhan ag Versailles mar seo, agus is &eacute; rud a thug ann iad, ar a n-admh&aacute;il f&eacute;in, n&aacute; chun s&iacute;och&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh do chin&iacute; an domhain ionas nach mbeadh a thuilleadh g&aacute; le cogadh cho&iacute;che ar&iacute;s.  Deirimidne leo anois, agus san go d&aacute;na, m&aacute; t&aacute;id d&aacute;ir&iacute;re, go gcaithfear briseadh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gceangal so idir an d&uacute;thaigh seo is Sasana.  Muna nd&eacute;antar san, n&iacute; bheidh aon s&iacute;och&aacute;in ann.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Achain&iacute;m oraibh iontaoibh a bheith agaibh as a ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; l&aacute;mh D&eacute; in&aacute;r n-obair: is l&eacute;ir san as ar tharla le dh&aacute; bhliain anuas.  Dh&aacute; bhliain is an Ch&aacute;isc seo a d&rsquo;imigh tharainn, buna&iacute;odh Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann.  N&iacute; g&aacute; d&uacute;inn anois ach seasamh le ch&eacute;ile, moladh is bu&iacute;ochas le Dia.  Cuirimis le ch&eacute;ile agus n&aacute; deineadh &eacute;inne sinn a dheighilt, agus n&iacute; baol d&uacute;inn.</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P FLI="0">Cathal Brugha believed that independence and peace were inextricably linked and that if they remained united, they would succeed.  And succeed they did, but let us remember that in the dark years that followed, many people paid the ultimate sacrifice to pave the way for the freedom to elect our own Parliament, that privilege we enjoy today.</P>
        <P>Our Parliament survived those dark times and since then it has not only survived but thrived.  When other nations and parliaments, born from the breaking of empires at the end of the carnage of the First World War, had succumbed to dictatorship and totalitarianism, the Irish Parliament remained independent, free and democratic, no mean feat in a world wracked by war and strife.  It continued to do so, surviving through the economic war and depression of the 1930s, the Second World War, and indeed the years following that when alien ideologies again threatened to overtake democracy.  It endured the stagnation and emigration of the 1950s, was instrumental in the industrialisation of Ireland in the 1960s and led Ireland into Europe in the 1970s.  It survived the downturn and recessions of the 1980s and played a vital role in the turnaround of the State&rsquo;s fortunes in the 1990s.</P>
        <P>Today, it is very easy for elected representatives and parliamentarians to take for granted our ability to put our names forward for election, to canvass freely the electorate, to put forward our ideas without censorship.  Maybe as a people, we can sometimes forget that some gave all so that we can cast our vote in our own country for our government of choice.  We owe a lot to those pioneers who took the first steps on that road.</P>
        <P>If they could see us today, I feel they would be proud of what they achieved.  The challenge for us as parliamentarians is to build on the achievements of those fearless individuals who collectively gave us our national Parliament.</P>
        <P>However, as a Parliament and as individual politicians, we know that our parliamentary democracy is not without its flaws and that some citizens query the relevance of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in today&rsquo;s globalised society.  If citizens are apathetic about our parliamentary democracy today, we politicians must look at ourselves and our parliamentary procedures.  Too often in the past, politics, Government and the Oireachtas may have been seen as somewhat remote from society, remote from the ordinary man and woman in the street, while the adversarial and confrontational style of debate can be a turn-off for some people.</P>
        <P>In today&rsquo;s fast moving world, parliamentary politics can seem slow, unwieldy and bureaucratic.  Parliamentary politics, by its nature, is a long process.  Legislation is changed slowly and through complex parliamentary procedures that do not easily provide the stories required by daily journalists and for a news hungry readership and listenership looking for hourly news reports.  The reality of legislation and political progress is that one can rarely say &ldquo;something changed yesterday&rdquo; &mdash; the parliamentary process does not often fit the daily news cycle.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, that does not mean we cannot improve.  Our parliamentary system must change and is changing and is making politics and Parliament more relevant, more open and more transparent.  This is why I, as Ceann Comhairle, strongly support the efforts of our parliamentarians to reform procedures, to make our Parliament more accessible to civil society.  I think the direction in which we are heading is the direction the members of the first ever D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would have both envisaged and approved of.</P>
        <P>Our meeting here today is a celebration of their courage and foresight and their ratification of the declaration of our independence.  It is also an acknowledgement of how far we have come over the past 90 years.  I started with Charles Stewart Parnell and I will end with him.  &ldquo;Why should Ireland be treated as a geographical fragment of England?&rdquo;, he asked in April 1875.  &ldquo;Ireland is not a geographical fragment, but a nation.&rdquo;  It took a brave stand by the members of the First D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to make that a reality.</P><Col N="4"/>

	<P>T&aacute;imid anseo inniu ag su&iacute; speisialta de Thithe an Oireachtais le ceili&uacute;radh a dh&eacute;anamh ar eachtra an-t&aacute;bhachtach i stair parlaiminte na t&iacute;re.  N&oacute;cha bliain &oacute; shin, san &aacute;it seo, i dTeach an Ard Mh&eacute;ara, a buna&iacute;odh &aacute;r bParlaimint n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  Smaoin&iacute;mid anois baill an Tr&iacute;och&uacute; D&aacute;il agus an Fiche tr&iacute;&uacute; Seanad &Eacute;ireann, ar na daoine cr&oacute;ga, misni&uacute;la, &eacute;irmi&uacute;la sin a chuir t&uacute;s leis an daonlathas nua-aimseartha in &Eacute;irinn.</P>
        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte speisialta roimh na hionadaithe tofa &oacute; thrasna na Teorann.  Ina measc an Leas-Ch&eacute;ad Aire Martin McGuinness agus Mark Durkan, Ceannaire an SDLP.</P>
        <P>Rinneadh a l&aacute;n machnaimh roimh r&eacute; ar pharlaimint d&aacute;r gcuid f&eacute;in a bhun&uacute; i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  Chreid na hionadaithe tofa a th&aacute;inig le ch&eacute;ile anseo in Ean&aacute;ir 1919 san fh&eacute;inrial&uacute; agus i rialtas le toil na ndaoine.  Ba chearta iad sin ar throid na ngl&uacute;n t&iacute;rghr&aacute;th&oacute;ir&iacute; ar a son roimhe sin.  D&rsquo;fhulaing go leor de na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la sa Ch&eacute;ad Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann ar mhaithe leis na prionsabail sin.</P>
        <P>Is fi&uacute; smaoineamh ar an d&iacute;lseacht agus ar na c&uacute;ins&iacute; inar thug comhalta&iacute; na C&eacute;ad D&aacute;la faoina gcuid dualgas mar ionadaithe tofa.  Ag an gc&eacute;ad chruinni&uacute; de Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann n&iacute; raibh i l&aacute;thair don rolla ach fiche hocht Teachta, bh&iacute; an chuid ba mh&oacute; mar a d&uacute;radh &ldquo;f&aacute; ghlas ag gallaibh&rdquo; n&oacute; &ldquo;ar dibirt ag gallaibh&rdquo;.  D&uacute;radh go raibh Teachta amh&aacute;in, Michael Collins, i l&aacute;thair c&eacute; nach raibh &mdash; n&iacute; raibh siad ag iarraidh aird a tharraingt air.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ar a bhealach le cuidi&uacute; le h&Eacute;amon de Valera &eacute;al&uacute; as pr&iacute;os&uacute;n Lincoln i Sasana.</P>
        <P>Mar chomharba&iacute; ar an gc&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in sin n&iacute; c&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh ar an muin&iacute;n a bh&iacute; acu sin in &Eacute;irinn neamhsple&aacute;ch &oacute; thaobh saol n&iacute;os fearr a bhaint amach do na saor&aacute;naigh ar fad.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn a bheith bu&iacute;och freisin as an traidisi&uacute;n bunreacht&uacute;il a chuir siad anuas chugainn.  Thuig siad agus th&oacute;g siad ar an t&aacute;bhacht a bhain le cur leis an am a bh&iacute; thart.  Ba rud radacach ann f&eacute;in a bh&iacute; i nD&aacute;il a bhun&uacute;, mar bh&iacute; na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; s&oacute;isialta a bh&iacute; sa Chl&aacute;r Daonlathach radacach.</P>
        <P>B&rsquo;iontach an rud &eacute; don am toghadh an Countess Markievicz, agus gur ceapadh &iacute; mar Aire Saothair le feabhas a chur ar shaol gn&aacute;th-oibrithe.  T&aacute; na p&aacute;irtithe polait&iacute;ochta ar fad sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann go m&oacute;r faoi chomaoin acu sin a bhunaigh an Ch&eacute;ad Dh&aacute;il agus a thug anuas chugainn an Pharlaimint dhaonlathach a bhfuil s&eacute; d&rsquo;on&oacute;ir againn a bheith p&aacute;irteach inti faoi l&aacute;thair.</P>
        <P>Ninety years ago tomorrow, the elected representatives of the overwhelming majority of the people of this island who were not otherwise detained or in flight from the forces of occupation, met in Dublin&rsquo;s Mansion House with the purpose of asserting the self determination of a sovereign, democratic, Irish Republic.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann &mdash; a National Parliament for the Irish nation &mdash; ratified and gave democratic legitimacy to the Proclamation of Independence for which the republican vanguard had laid down their lives at Easter 1916.</P>
        <P>As of 21 January 1919, foreign rule in Ireland was relieved of any claim to democratic legitimacy.  The Declaration of Independence adopted by the First D&aacute;il ordained &ldquo;that the elected representatives of the Irish people alone have the power to make laws binding on the people of Ireland, and that the Irish Parliament is the only Parliament to which the Irish people will give its allegiance&rdquo;.  From that day on, there has been an Irish Parliament and Irish Governments which have governed in the interests of the Irish people.</P><Col N="5"/>
        <P>When the First D&aacute;il met, partition was a fear rather than a reality and civil war unimaginable.  Partition disfigured our island and scarred the psyche of Irish people.  It has sapped the energy and resources of our island and its people over generations.  Only in the recent past have political leaders on the island been able to find the will and imagination to identify a path through the barriers to reconciliation.</P>
        <P>When, in 1998, the people of Ireland voted by a majority, and by majorities North and South, in favour of the Good Friday Agreement, it was the first occasion since the general election of 1918, the election at which the people selected the representatives who sat in the First D&aacute;il, that the people of this island had voted on the same day on the issue of their constitutional status.</P>
        <P>It now falls to our generation of Irish republicans &mdash; a heritage to which all political parties represented in the Thirtieth D&aacute;il can legitimately lay claim &mdash; to rededicate ourselves to the challenge which animated the members of the First D&aacute;il: to build a sovereign, democratic, Irish republic embracing all the people of our nation.</P>
        <P>But if our challenge is the same, it is different in nature from that which faced the men and women of 1919.  The First D&aacute;il had one, single, overriding ambition: to secure &ldquo;the evacuation of our country by the English garrison&rdquo;.  Today, Ireland is no longer in conflict with Britain.  A sovereign, independent Republic exists in the Twenty-six Counties and Britain has entered into a binding international treaty obligation with the Republic to withdraw from the Six Counties of Northern Ireland, if and when a majority of the people in Northern Ireland should ask it to do so.  The Irish people, North and South, have for their part accepted that Northern Ireland remains in union with Britain unless and until the majority in the North desires otherwise.</P>
        <P>As successors to the generation who convened the First D&aacute;il, our task is to persuade those of our fellow Irishmen and women who currently hold fast to the union with Britain that their future is best secured in a closer accommodation with the majority with whom they share the island.</P>
        <P>How can we achieve such an aim?  We know for sure how not to succeed.  Violence, intolerance, discrimination and name-calling have led the communities in the North up blind alleys where walls of concrete present physical and psychological barriers.  What we must do is two-fold.  First, we must redouble our efforts to build a prosperous, peaceful and fair society in the Republic.  Second, without abandoning our own ideals and traditions, we must seek to better understand and accommodate the strong identification with Britain felt by many hundreds of thousands of Irish people.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement acknowledged the right of people living in Northern Ireland to be British, Irish or both.  This has to be about more than simply recognising that people have different symbols on their passports or tick different boxes on their census forms.  It should be about people on this island having the opportunity to celebrate their culture and language free from harassment and discrimination.  It should involve institutions of government recognising and supporting our common heritage in all its rich diversity.  Relations between Ireland and Britain have never been better than they are today.  Never have the Irish living in Britain felt more comfortable, or British people felt more welcome to make their homes in Ireland.  Whatever about the past, it cannot be denied that recent British Governments have played a positive and constructive role in seeking to heal divisions on the island of Ireland.  The steady improvement in British-Irish relations during the course of the 20th century, which began with independence and has continued throughout our common membership of the European Union and the political agreement in the North, has enabled old enemies to become new and close friends.  We should not forget that this positive relationship exists because it is based on equality and respect between sovereign nations.  It would not have been possible without the action of the <Col N="6"/>First D&aacute;il in reasserting what it described in its message to the free nations of the world as Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;historic nationhood&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom sit together as member states of the European Union has played a significant part in our reconciliation.  While the Members of the First D&aacute;il could hardly have foreseen the creation of the European Union, they were very much aware of Ireland&rsquo;s place in Europe.  In its message to the free nations of the world, the First D&aacute;il described Ireland as &ldquo;one of the most ancient nations in Europe&rdquo; and as &ldquo;the last outpost of Europe towards the West&rdquo;.  It regretted that English occupation prevented Ireland &ldquo;from being a benefit and safeguard to Europe and America&rdquo; and argued that &ldquo;the permanent peace of Europe can never be secured by perpetuating military dominion for the profit of empire&rdquo;.  The history of Europe up to that point had been defined by a regular cycle of war as tribes, kings and nations sought to subjugate or dominate their neighbours.  The First D&aacute;il met in the aftermath of the most terrible or all such wars.  I am certain that, given the opportunity, the Members of the First D&aacute;il would have wished Ireland, once it had secured its right to independent nationhood, to join with other nations ready to share sovereignty in the common cause of peace, prosperity and freedom in Europe.  Sadly, another 50 years and a further world war were to pass before Ireland was given such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>The First D&aacute;il met as Europe lay in ruins in the aftermath of the First World War, which was a war of unprecedented destruction and brutality.  It had an extraordinary sense of the need for Ireland to engage with the world.  The D&aacute;il&rsquo;s message to the free nations of the world, which was cast in a strikingly internationalist tone, stated that &ldquo;Ireland...believes in freedom and justice as the fundamental principles of international law, because she believes in a frank co-operation between the peoples for equal rights&rdquo;.  The world, however, did not respond.  The Paris peace conference, which was in thrall to the great powers, ignored our plea for recognition.  Ireland learned early that the world can be a lonely place for small states.  This lesson is as valid today, in the depths of a global economic crisis, as it was in 1919, in the aftermath of a war of unprecedented devastation.  Such experiences have helped us to understand the true meaning of our country&rsquo;s sovereignty.  Properly understood, it means independence of action rather than insularity.  In theory, all states enjoy unfettered sovereignty; but in practice, an individual country may have rather less real freedom to chart its own course in the world.</P>
        <P>Since 1973, we have applied this principle to guide our participation in what is now the European Union.  Our membership puts Ireland squarely at the centre of one of the world&rsquo;s most influential players.  Amplified by the Union, Ireland&rsquo;s voice, unlike that of the First D&aacute;il, cannot be ignored internationally.  In contrast with what happened in 1919, our requests are now heard by the great powers.  We sit regularly around the table with many of them as equals.  We have presided over their meetings on six occasions, most recently in 2004 at the head of a Union of almost 500 million people.  Our influence within the Union is pervasive, whether at the highest levels of its institutions or as a mediator helping to resolve different positions at intergovernmental meetings.  We have been an extremely successful participant in the Union, which has given us a reach and a power unachievable to us alone.  In short, our membership of the Union gives life to the aspirations of the First D&aacute;il.  It is surprising, therefore, to hear some so consistently question our role within it.</P>
        <P>Those who oppose every development of the European Union are unmoved by fact, experience or progress.  Where we see a landscape populated with opportunity and co-operation, they see one of threat and interference.  This narrative is a fiction, unrelated to any reality I have experienced of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with its partners in the EU.  Such a crude distortion seeks to obscure the Union&rsquo;s role in assisting Ireland&rsquo;s fulfilment, these past 36 years, of the aspirations expressed by the First D&aacute;il.  The truth is that Europe empowers us.  It gives us a place at <Col N="7"/>the table from which we can deploy our resources, our influence and our sovereignty to the benefit of the Irish people.  The ultimate goal of the First D&aacute;il was to empower the Irish people to elect Irish men and women to an Irish parliament to serve their best interests honestly and unselfishly.  As we gather here today, my parliamentary colleagues and I are deeply conscious of the great task the First D&aacute;il entrusted to us and the responsibility we bear to carry forward and seek to perfect the work of that and subsequent D&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Along with building peace and establishing a respected place at the heart of Europe, we have used our independence to develop a stronger and fairer Ireland.  In every decade since independence, this country has faced serious economic challenges.  Despite the hardships involved, we confronted each of the challenges successfully.  We face into this global recession after a period of unprecedented economic growth which has seen living standards rise beyond all our expectations.  During that period, we have seen an era of full employment, record investment and migration to Ireland, replacing the historic experience of the forced emigration of our people.  The next few years will be very difficult for us all, as the economic turmoil faced by the whole world touches many lives in this country.  The scale of the adjustments required represents a major political, economic and social challenge for everybody in Ireland.  As everyone will be affected, everyone will have to play a part in overcoming that challenge.  With unemployment rising, we must not allow the full burden of adjustments to fall on those who lose their jobs.  Those who are in employment, whether in the private or the public sector, will also share the burden.  A particular responsibility lies on those who have benefited most from the rapid growth of the economy over recent years, whether as investors, self-employed or employees.  They are being asked to show solidarity with those who are less well off.</P>
        <P>It is that sense of solidarity which marks Irish society at its best.  That spirit gave rise to the social partnership process, which has contributed so much.  It is the basis on which the Government has engaged fully in developing its response to the current economic challenges.  Solidarity is the assurance that the Ireland we shape together for the future beyond the current turmoil will be worthy of the sacrifices we need to make and the vision that inspired the Members of the First D&aacute;il.  For my part, I will lead the Government and ensure it shoulders its democratic responsibility.  We will take action to ensure this country has a future by making the necessary decisions.  We will do our best to be fair.  In our time, on an island at peace, no one will be asked to lay down his or her life for his or her country, as the generation we celebrate today did.  This generation will face the return of long-term unemployment and economic decline if corrective action is not taken.  The essential question before us is simple.  Are we prepared to work together, in partnership, to tackle this crisis for the benefit of our fellow citizens and our children?  Those who founded D&aacute;il Eireann and carved an independent Ireland from the most powerful empire in the world faced daunting challenges.  They succeeded.  So too will we.

	<P>Fourscore and ten years ago on 21 January the men and women of the First D&aacute;il met here in this room.  Their meeting sent out a message of independence, of courage and of hope to the peoples of the world.  That message has been repeated by many leaders in many lands in the intervening decades.  It will be repeated again today in another place by another young man carrying in his genetic makeup part of what makes our Irishness unique.</P>
        <P>I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, &eacute;ir&iacute; amach ab ea ch&eacute;ad chruinni&uacute; na Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;la &mdash; &eacute;ir&iacute; amach sa ghaol idir &Eacute;ire agus an Bhreatain; &eacute;ir&iacute; amach i stair daonlathach na h&Eacute;ireann; &eacute;ir&iacute; amach idir &Eacute;ire agus t&iacute;ortha eile; agus, go speisialta, &eacute;ir&iacute; amach sa chaoi ina mbreathnaimid orainn f&eacute;in mar dhaoine agus mar n&aacute;isi&uacute;n.  Sna blianta sin, ba &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad &eacute;ir&iacute; amach i r&eacute; r&eacute;abhl&oacute;ideach ar fud na hEorpa.</P>
        <P>Its membership read like a &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s who&rdquo; of the people who framed the 20th century in Ireland &mdash; de Valera, Cosgrave, Mulcahy, O&rsquo;Kelly and Collins, among many others.  It also <Col N="8"/>included the first woman elected in Ireland, Countess Markievicz.  I am moved by the spirit of those who preceded us in this place, particularly by those elected to that First D&aacute;il who later became the leaders of the Cumann na nGael Party and later Fine Gael, over which I now preside as leader.</P>
        <P>The most striking characteristics of the First D&aacute;il were its simplicity and its austerity.  There was no fanfare, no pomp or ceremony, just a short prayer in Irish read by Fr. O&rsquo;Flanagan and then the roll call of members.  The majority of the 103 Members returned in the 1918 election were not present &mdash; some by choice, others through force of circumstance, their absence recorded in the recurring phrase of that day, &ldquo;faoi ghlas ag Gallaibh&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Those who scoffed at this new body, and there were many, totally under-estimated the seriousness of purpose, the utter determination of this new emerging generation of Irish politicians.  It was easy to be sceptical.  The new assembly had no legal standing or international recognition, no building of its own, no government apparatus to direct or carry out its wishes.  Its very calling, said <i>The Irish Times</i>, was &ldquo;a solemn act of defiance of the British Empire by a body of young men who have not the slightest notion of that Empire&rsquo;s power and resources, and not a particle of experience in the conduct of public affairs&rdquo;.  Yet, in spite of its shadowy existence, in spite of the constant raids and harassment, and in spite of not having any real power or resources, this D&aacute;il did establish the authentic credentials of modern Irish democracy.  It was a clear signal that once the military campaign was over, the people&rsquo;s Parliament would be supreme.</P>
        <P>It was more than just symbolic.  The new D&aacute;il laid down the principles and guidelines on which an independent Irish Parliament would evolve.  At the heart of these principles was the central role of a sovereign D&aacute;il.  It also gave us many of our rules and procedures which have persisted to this day.  Crucially, it insisted on full total accountability by Government to the D&aacute;il &mdash; accountability as to how the people&rsquo;s money was spent and answerability for all the actions of Government.</P>
        <P>It would be good to recount that this principle of D&aacute;il supremacy found its way into the life of the new State.  Sadly, it did not.  It may have been the Civil War which created an atmosphere of mistrust among former colleagues; it may have been a too rigid system of party discipline; it may have been the diffidence of the D&aacute;il itself.  For whatever reason, subsequent years saw an inexorable strengthening of the position of the Government over that of the D&aacute;il, and saw the D&aacute;il itself, except maybe in times of crisis, give up so many of the powers and functions, and indeed responsibilities, that should have rightly been its own.</P>
        <P>We celebrate this anniversary at a time in the life of our country which is as unhappy and dangerous as any we have known.  If one thing is clear at this time it is that we need a D&aacute;il as envisaged by the men and women of 1919, a D&aacute;il which is at the centre of our politics, not one at the periphery of events, a D&aacute;il to which the Government and all its agencies of Government are openly accountable, and most of all a D&aacute;il which leads events rather than reacting to them.</P>
        <P>There are other things to reflect on today.  There is, for example, the debt our democracy owes those who were not present 90 years ago today, the old Irish Party, the party of Parnell, Redmond and Dillon.  It is easy to forget the enormous part they played in the shaping of Irish parliamentary democracy.  For 40 years it was the voice of nationalist Ireland and for 40 years its goal was an independent Irish Parliament.  For all of this it got little thanks.  The great Se&aacute;n MacEoin, the Blacksmith of Ballinalee, expressed it well in 1938 when he said, &ldquo;The old Sinn F&eacute;in members should apologise to the members of the old Irish Party... We blackguarded them up and down the country because we were not aware of the facts.&rdquo;  His words were not universally welcome in 1938, but today those of us in the two larger parties especially, who stem from <Col N="9"/>the old Sinn F&eacute;in, should echo the words of Se&aacute;n MacEoin and acknowledge on this very special day the contribution of the Irish Party to the establishment of our strong and durable parliamentary democracy.</P>

	<P>We should remember too that just a few short years after the meeting of the First D&aacute;il our country was split by civil war, an experience that disfigured our politics for years to come.  Those years of bitterness and sterility should remind us that while our politics should be tough and searching, and maybe rough at times, we should never forget the role of Parliament as a unifying force in times of national difficulty and a source of leadership and solidarity rather than divisiveness.</P>
        <P>The most important memory today should be a positive one, the memory of the men and women who made the First D&aacute;il possible.  They were, it has been said &ldquo;politicians by accident&rdquo;, but by any standards they were an exceptional generation, rising to the challenge of independent statehood, establishing and sustaining democratic institutions and values.  They were men and women of probity, of ability and most of all of simple and honest values.  They led by example, living up to the values they preached.  This was true of all sides, Cosgrave and de Valera, Lemass and Mulcahy, McGilligan, MacEntee and Tom Johnson.  Let us remember them today with pride and take courage in their values as our country faces into days as difficult and uncertain as any we have previously encountered.</P>

	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, sa tseomra seo, 90 bliain o shin, cuireadh feoil dhaonlathach ar id&eacute;alacha &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca.  Ar an l&aacute;thair stairi&uacute;il seo, d&eacute;anadh an r&eacute;abhl&oacute;id a dhaonlath&uacute;.  Don ch&eacute;ad uair, i stair na h&Eacute;ireann, leagadh s&iacute;os cl&aacute;r oibre polaiti&uacute;il chun an r&eacute;abhl&oacute;id a thabhairt chun foirfeachta.</P>
        <P>Bh&iacute; an Cl&aacute;r Daonlathach i measc orn&aacute;id&iacute; na C&eacute;ad D&aacute;la, cl&aacute;r a scr&iacute;obh Tom Johnson, ceannaire an Lucht Oibre ag an am.  Labhra&iacute;onn na prionsabail a shoils&iacute;onn an chl&aacute;ir sin f&oacute;s d&uacute;inn sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann &mdash; saoirse, ionannas agus an ceart don uile dhuine &mdash; rosc daonlathach d&uacute;inn, oidhr&iacute; na C&eacute;ad D&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>In this Round Room, 90 years ago, the old ways came to an end and a new era began.  On 21 January 1919, as our first TDs gathered here, life for most people in Ireland was very hard.  Europe had just been ravaged and re-divided by a bloody, senseless, imperialist war which claimed the lives of 50,000 of our fellow Irishmen.  Another 10,000 people had died from flu in the previous year.  Hundreds of thousands lived in slums and abject poverty.</P>
        <P>The general election of 1918 was the first when all adult men and almost all women got the vote.  Two out of every three voters in 1918 were on the electoral register for the first time.  They used this new political opportunity to sweep away the old order &mdash; away with the seemingly impregnable Irish Parliamentary Party which had been built up by Parnell, now replaced by a popular independence movement.  Instead of going to Westminster they came here, to build something new &mdash; a democratic parliament, that owed much to the liberal parliamentary tradition which had supported the Irish cause in the latter part of the nineteenth century.</P>
        <P>The proceedings that day were short, but the objectives were great.  A declaration of independence, an appeal to the nations of the world, read in Irish, English and French, in the hope that Ireland would be seated at the post-war peace conference.  The Democratic Programme set out a vision for what democracy and independence could mean in practice for the people of the country.</P>
        <P>The Democratic Programme was written by the then leader of the Labour Party, Tom Johnson.  However, Johnson and his colleagues sat in the Public Gallery that day.  They were not <Col N="10"/>TDs in that First D&aacute;il, because Labour had decided not to contest the 1918 election, so as not to split the vote of the independence movement.  That was a patriotic, selfless decision, putting country before party by a Labour movement which was playing a central role in the events of the time.  Labour was pivotal in the anti-conscription campaign which mobilised Irish people in the run-up to the election, including the organisation of a general strike.  It was Labour which won the very first international recognition for Ireland&rsquo;s independence at the Socialist International in Berne in 1919, a few weeks after the meeting of the First D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il was steeped in the ideals of Labour and was brimming with optimism.  Some 90 years later, those same values were never more relevant and the optimism was never more necessary.  Echoing down the years, the words of the Democratic Programme reproach us challenge us and yet inspire us.</P>
        <P>Even before our present economic difficulties, as a country we had not vindicated what the programme called &ldquo;the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation&rsquo;s labour&rdquo;.  Mired as we are again in scandal about the abuse of children, and considering the consequences of cutbacks in education, can we say that we have lived up to the objective that &ldquo;the first duty of the Government of the Republic is to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children&rdquo;?  Can the elderly patient lying on a hospital trolley, or the pensioners defending their medical cards and their pension rights feel that &ldquo;the nation&rsquo;s aged and infirm shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the nation&rsquo;s gratitude and consideration&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>As we see this week how a small number of greedy individuals have brought economic havoc to our country, we can reflect on the simple statement in the Democratic Programme &ldquo;that it is the duty of every man and woman to give service&rdquo; and that as thousands lose their jobs, that &ldquo;it is the duty of the nation to assure that every citizen shall have opportunity to spend his or her strength and faculties in the service of the people&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This day of commemoration comes at another difficult moment in our country&rsquo;s history, when we are confronted again with the human consequences of economic mistakes.  A time of uncertainty and apprehension.  However, we can take heart from the pioneers who assembled here 90 years ago.  We too can make a new beginning.</P>
        <P>That First D&aacute;il faced near impossible obstacles and what it achieved was not inevitable.  Its Members endured pain, but chose to make new history.  They were free, and they freed this country, because they refused to be prisoners of their past.  In this our time, as we face our moment of national crisis, we should be inspired by their words and by their courage.  We too can forge a new beginning and sweep away the failings of the past.  We too can be inspired to build a sustainable prosperity and a fair society &mdash; a country that respects its old and values its young, a country governed as the First D&aacute;il decided, by the principles of liberty, equality and justice for all.  I know it is not possible to make a formal proposal here, but may I suggest that we consider making 21 January our national independence day?</P>
        <P>Braithim timpeall orainn inniu, taibhs&iacute; fathaigh na C&eacute;ad D&aacute;la n&aacute;r loic an chr&oacute;gacht orthu.

	<P>Ceann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach Seanad &Eacute;ireann, a dhaoine uaisle go l&eacute;ir, is on&oacute;ir domsa mar cheannaire An Comhaontas Glas a bheith anseo i dTeach an &Aacute;rd Mh&eacute;ara ar &oacute;c&aacute;id cheili&uacute;radh 90 bliain Ch&eacute;ad Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Is minic agus m&eacute; ag l&eacute;amh stair na t&iacute;re seo a rith liom misneach agus f&iacute;s na fir agus an t-aon bhean amh&aacute;in, Countess Markievicz, a sheas sa seomra seo 90 bliain &oacute; shin.  Ritheann s&eacute; liom freisin, c&eacute; go raibh siad ag troid le hImpireacht Shasana ag an am, go raibh siad s&aacute;sta mar sin f&eacute;in an c&oacute;ras rialach&aacute;n agus parlaiminte a bh&iacute; acu sin a ghlacadh acu f&eacute;in.  Bh&iacute; siad id&eacute;alach agus praitici&uacute;il ag an am ch&eacute;anna.</P>
        <P>We gather here today to commemorate and celebrate the first meeting of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann 90 years ago.  The young men and one woman who were elected to the D&aacute;il knew they carried the hopes and dreams of a new generation, for a brighter, democratic and independent future for our island.  They met here against the backdrop of huge ferment and upheaval in Ireland and the wider world.</P>
        <P>The world war in which thousands of young Irish men had died had just ended, the Easter 1916 Rising had radicalised Irish nationalism and in late January the first shots of the War of Independence were fired.  The world was also in the grip of a flu pandemic which would kill millions, the Versailles Treaty was being negotiated, Mussolini&rsquo;s fascists were organising and the Weimar Republic was trying to establish itself.</P>
        <P>Yet despite all of this, the young idealists, the elected representatives of the First D&aacute;il came here to deliver a message to the world.  It was a message about liberty, equality and justice, a message which resonates today with the present generation of Irish men and women.  We can take hope and encouragement from their struggle, for the challenge we now face as a nation is the most daunting since the First D&aacute;il.  We can and we will prevail if we work together and think differently.  We can treat history as a nightmare from which we are trying to awaken  &mdash; the words of Joyce who was completing <i>Ulysses </i>at the time &mdash; or we can choose to learn from it.</P>
        <P>Was the Civil War inevitable?  Was the carnage in Northern Ireland avoidable?  We cannot reverse time, nor can we undo the mistakes of the past, but we can and must embark now on a course of radical change.  Such change will require courage, dedication and real leadership.  Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures.  It is time for this generation of political leaders truly to reflect on what is best for our country in this difficult period.  We must resolve to put aside some of our political differences.  Let us be open to the possibilities of change and wise enough to know that the economic circumstances will not change miraculously regardless of who is in power.  Let today be the beginning of a real debate on where we are going as a nation, how best we can achieve the goals of protecting our economy and our society and how we can continue the unbroken line of democracy and dedication to the rule of law of the last 90 years, which is unique among the new European states that emerged after the First World War.</P>
        <P>Today we acknowledge the contribution of our political parties to the shaping of our society, the Labour leader Tom Johnson who had the foresight to know that the goal of national independence was the most important aspect of the 1918 election, the contribution of Sinn F&eacute;in to our modern peace process, the Progressive Democrats founder Des O&rsquo;Malley who said he would stand by the Republic.  We salute Alan Dukes, the Fine Gael leader whose Tallaght strategy brought us through an economic crisis.  We recall Sean Lemass and Jack Lynch who modernised and opened Ireland to Europe and the world.  Each party has, with its own ideas and policies, enriched our democratic traditions.</P>
        <P>Unlike other parties in this room today, the Green Party does not trace its roots back to the early days of nationalism, but for more than a quarter century we have made our contribution.  Indeed it was in this very room that we took the momentous decision to enter Government. <Col N="12"/> We are part of an international movement dedicated to global responsibility and the future of our planet and its people.</P>
        <P>It is the Green new deal, embraced so confidently by Barack Obama, that offers our people and the people of the United States renewed hope.  Ireland should not just be part of this new Green revolution, we should be leading it.  This generation of Irish people has the skill and the talent once again to reinvent ourselves to create new jobs in clean technology, in renewable energy, in energy conservation and in insulation of houses and schools as we move to a low-carbon future and a better quality of life for all our citizens.</P>
        <P>If we do not accept the need for radical change, if we remain resolutely focused on our own party political interests and if we indulge in partisanship, recrimination and adversarial pettiness we will be failing in our political duty.  That duty is to serve the people first.  Putting people first means recognising that while the era of the Celtic tiger may have brought prosperity it was also a time of corporate greed, irresponsibility and profligacy.  In this new era we must have the highest standards of transparency and accountability, the most rigorous regulation of our financial system and those guilty of bringing our banking system into disrepute must be pursued and punished.  There can be no hiding place &mdash; no parallel legal system &mdash; for the corporate sector.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that were the Members of the First D&aacute;il here today they would be debating a new Green economy.  We already have the evidence of our history books to tell us that they would be united in one purpose &mdash; to keep Ireland free and prosperous.</P>
        <P>It has been my privilege to reflect awhile on the First D&aacute;il meeting here in this room 90 years ago.  Now I ask all of you to reflect on how we can identify common remedies together for our future.</P>
        <P>Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil ceachtanna le foghlaim againn uatha sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</P>

	<P>Ar son Shinn F&eacute;in is &aacute;bhar br&oacute;id dom labhairt ar an l&aacute;thair stairi&uacute;il seo chun an Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a chom&oacute;radh.  Ar an l&aacute;thair seo 90 bliain &oacute; shin th&aacute;inig ionadaithe tofa mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann le ch&eacute;ile mar thion&oacute;l n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair siad neamhsple&aacute;chas Phoblacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Sa Faisn&eacute;is Neamhsple&aacute;chais cuireadh an Phoblacht ar bun agus sa Teachtaireacht chun Saor-Naisi&uacute;in an Domhain d&rsquo;iarr D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann ar na n&aacute;isi&uacute;in aitheantas a thabhairt do neamhsple&aacute;chas mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann.  Sa Chl&aacute;r-Oibre Daonlathach bh&iacute; cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; soisialta agus eacnama&iacute;ochta na Poblachta curtha os comhair an phobail.</P>
        <P>Mar sin is cu&iacute; an rud go dtagann muid le ch&eacute;ile inniu chun an l&aacute; sin a chom&oacute;radh.  Ach n&iacute; amh&aacute;in com&oacute;radh at&aacute; ann.  T&aacute; dualgas orainn obair an lae sin a lean&uacute;int len&aacute;r linn fh&eacute;in.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir na c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; a glacadh leo ar an 21&uacute; l&aacute; d&rsquo;Ean&aacute;ir 1919 a l&eacute;amh gan a r&aacute; go soil&eacute;ir: t&aacute; daonlathas n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta f&oacute;s le baint amach in &Eacute;irinn; t&aacute; t&iacute;r agus pobal le hathaont&uacute;; agus fi&uacute; 90 bliain ar aghaidh n&iacute;l an Cl&aacute;r-Oibre Daonlathach curtha i bhfeidhm.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Never was the past so near, or the present so brave, or the future so full of hope.&rdquo;  These were the words of a young republican, M&aacute;ire Comerford, who was present in this room 90 years ago on 21 January 1919.  She shared with her generation the sense of their historic mission, their selfless courage and their faith in the potential of the Irish people to flourish in freedom.  They were inspired by the ideals of the men and women of Easter Week 1916.  Their sights were set on the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms on the streets of this city.  They had seen the executions of 16 of their comrades by the British Government.  They had seen hundreds of people interned without trial in the aftermath.  They had experienced British military rule, and <Col N="13"/>the men and women of that generation gave their answer to imperialism by rallying to the flag of Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>In successive by-elections in 1917 and 1918, Sinn F&eacute;in triumphed.  In October 1917 here in the Round Room of the Mansion House the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis adopted a new constitution which was committed to achieving the independence of the Irish Republic and to opposing British rule in Ireland by any and every means at their disposal.</P>
        <P>The British Government tried to impose conscription on the Irish people in 1918 and it was met by the determined resistance of a people&rsquo;s movement.  In April 1918 the one-day general strike against conscription led by the Irish Trade Union Congress dealt the fatal blow to the British Government&rsquo;s plan.  It is appropriate that we remember here the legacy of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union which this month celebrates its centenary.  It played a pivotal role in the struggle for national independence, workers&rsquo; rights and socialism in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The overwhelming victory of Sinn F&eacute;in in the December 1918 general election was on the basis of a manifesto committed to the establishment of the Irish Republic.  That was the mission of An Ch&eacute;ad Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Declaration of Independence adopted in this room ratified the establishment of the Republic and pledged the Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and the people to make the declaration effective by every means at their command.</P>
        <P>D&uacute;irt an Ceann Comhairle Cathal Brugha go raibh siad ag cur deireadh le riail Shasana in &Eacute;irinn.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go raibh deireadh le r&aacute;im&eacute;is.  B&rsquo;shin an tuiscint a bh&iacute; aige agus ag a chomh-Theachta&iacute;.  Bh&iacute; d&oacute;chas acu go mbeadh dualgas idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ar Rialtas Shasana neamhspleachas na h&Eacute;ireann a aithint.  Ach bh&iacute; siad ullamh chun troda ar son na saoirse sin m&aacute; bh&iacute; g&aacute; le troid.</P>
        <P>It was an All-Ireland D&aacute;il that assembled here, a D&aacute;il united in opposition to the intention of the British Government to partition Ireland.  We know the tragic outcome.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was suppressed by the British Government which waged war on Irish democracy.  Our country and our people were divided and the mass movement so strongly manifested here in January 1919 was split apart in January 1922.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We salute all those who struggled for Irish unity and independence since the First D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann met.  We recall all those who suffered imprisonment and who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom, as so many of the first Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la did.  No one can credibly deny the spirit of freedom that links, to take but two examples, the Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, TD for Mid-Cork who died on hunger strike in 1920 and the TD for Cavan-Monaghan Kieran Doherty who died on hunger strike in 1981.</P>
        <P>Equality was the basis of the Democratic Programme adopted here 90 years ago.  The programme set out progressive social and economic goals based on the principles of the 1916 Proclamation and articulated by P&aacute;draig Mac Piarais and James Connolly.  Its key section stated that the sovereignty of the nation &ldquo;extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation&rsquo;s soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the Nation and...we reaffirm that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare&rdquo;.  It declared &ldquo;the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the Nation&rsquo;s labour&rdquo;.  The Democratic Programme said it was the &ldquo;duty of the Government of the Republic&rdquo; to ensure that no child should suffer &ldquo;hunger or cold&rdquo; or homelessness and should be provided with &ldquo;proper education and training&rdquo;.  The programme promised to ensure that the aged and infirm would be no longer &ldquo;regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation&rsquo;s gratitude and consideration&rdquo;.  It made it clear that the Republic has a duty to &ldquo;safeguard the health of the people&rdquo;.  The programme pledged to build Ireland&rsquo;s economy and reinvigorate industries which would be developed &ldquo;on the most beneficial and progressive co-operative and industrial lines&rdquo;.  After nine decades, the Democratic Programme remains to be implemented.</P><Col N="14"/>
        <P>If the public right and welfare had been placed above the interests of private profit and property over the past decade, our economy would not be in recession.  C&eacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; mar obair againn na ceisteanna sin a phl&eacute; go mion inniu, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an Ch&eacute;ad Dh&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a chom&oacute;radh gan an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute; faoi shocha&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann len&aacute;r linn.

Ba i nGaeilge a rinne an Ch&eacute;ad Dh&aacute;il a cuid oibre ar an gc&eacute;ad l&aacute; sin.  Caithfear a admh&aacute;il nach bhfuil an D&aacute;il agus an Seanad ag tabhairt an cheannaireacht ba ch&oacute;ir.  Is le pobal na Gaeilge an cheannaireacht san obair chun an teanga a choth&uacute; agus molaim iad as an obair sin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; mar r&uacute;n againn inniu teanga na C&eacute;ad D&aacute;la a chur ar ais ina h&aacute;it cheart mar theanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The sovereign will of the Irish people was denied by British imperialism in 1919.  In its message to the free nations of the world, the D&aacute;il looked forward to a new era of national self-determination and the ending of what it called &ldquo;military dominion for the profit of empire&rdquo;.  The hopes of subject peoples across the globe, including the Irish people, were dashed as the British and French empires reasserted their control after the First World War.  Those two powers divided the Middle East between them and ensured the continuing Western domination of that region.  The terrible legacy of their actions is evident today in the region&rsquo;s many conflicts.  I take this opportunity to extend particular solidarity to the dispossessed people of Palestine, whose agony the world has witnessed in recent weeks.  As we mark the 90th anniversary of the First D&aacute;il, we look forward to a day when the elected representatives of all the people of our country will once more gather in the national assembly of a united Ireland.  Creidim&iacute;d go dtiocfaidh an l&aacute; sin agus is ar a shon at&aacute;im&iacute;d ag obair.  Is &eacute; sin &aacute;r gcusp&oacute;ir.  Is &eacute; sin an d&oacute;chas a bh&iacute; anseo 90 bliain &oacute; shin agus at&aacute; f&oacute;s ann.  Is &eacute; sin an bealach ar aghaidh do phobal na h&Eacute;ireann uile.</P>

	<P>Is m&oacute;r an phribhl&eacute;id dom &iacute; labhairt anseo inniu agus deis a bheith agam rian a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il ar cheann de na h&oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute; is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; i stair na t&iacute;re seo.  D&eacute;anaim &eacute; mar cheannaire an bP&aacute;irt&iacute; Daonlathach, a party that has made a distinct contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s democracy, prosperity and standards in public life, but will soon enter the annals of Irish political history.  I hope I can recognise the tenacious and precious durability of democracy, while acknowledging the vulnerability to which ideas and organisations are subjected by the passage of time.  We are here to mark the importance of a pivotal event in Irish history.  It gives us a chance to examine the values, certainties and realities that have endured over time in a way that transcends the twists and turns of history.  We are here to mark the fact that 90 years ago, in a bold and radical development, the First D&aacute;il was convened in a move aimed at securing Ireland&rsquo;s freedom from Britain &mdash; a country then described as a foreign enemy.  The Members of the First D&aacute;il were determined that Irish people would have the power to decide their own futures.  Ninety years later, with freedom, respect and prosperity having been achieved, our small country, in common with countries all over the world, recognises that our fate is inextricably linked to and dependent on global events and governance.  Decisions made by others, sometimes at a great distance, have the power to alter our future prospects considerably for good or for ill.</P>
        <P>Ninety years ago, in the wake of what the First D&aacute;il described as 700 years of &ldquo;foreign usurpation&rdquo;, the Irish people sought to break free from the chains of foreign domination and to emerge into a new dawn and a world of possibility dictated by ourselves.  We have had an extraordinary journey in the intervening nine decades.  We have seen the best of times; we have seen the worst of times.  We have seen civil war and terrorism, but we now see lasting peace.  We have seen mass emigration and mass immigration.  We have seen poverty and stagnation as well as extreme wealth.  We have at times felt isolated, sometimes by our own choice.  We <Col N="15"/>have recently had the feeling of being a cosmopolitan magnet for people from countries all around the world.  Where once we felt the cold Atlantic to our back and Britain blocking our view of Europe to the front, we now belong to a family of nations in a European Union that is striving to improve the way we all live.  We had little in 1919, and little remained our lot for a long time.  When President Kennedy visited Ireland and addressed the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas 44 years later, in 1963, he said that Ireland &ldquo;is not rich and its progress is not yet complete, but it is, according to statistics, one of the best fed countries in the world&rdquo;.  In the last years of the 20th century significant economic prosperity arrived and took our breath away.  Our small country, which was praised in 1963 because it was well fed, became one of the richest countries in the world, and not by accident.</P>
        <P>On 21 January 1919, the First D&aacute;il declared in its message to the free nations of the world that Ireland was &ldquo;the gateway of the Atlantic&rdquo; and &ldquo;the point upon which the great trade routes between East and West converge&rdquo;.  That foresight came to its greatest fruition in recent times, when inward investment made Ireland rich.  This resulted from the commitment, confidence, education and skill of our people and our position as the gateway to the Continent of Europe.  It was crucial that Ireland was a fully participating and active member of the European Union, at the heart of the Union.  By forging highly developed political and economic ties with our European partners, we positioned ourselves to harness a rising tide.  Perhaps more important than money was the fresh sense of pride the Irish people felt about this country&rsquo;s ability to succeed at the highest international level.  Our confidence was boosted.  We felt we could hold our own on any stage.  We felt like winners and it felt good.  In 2009, at the start of a new millennium, in many ways we are as uncertain &mdash; perhaps even more concerned &mdash; about what the future holds for Ireland and the world as we were 90 years ago.</P>
        <P>The First D&aacute;il knew it wanted complete political independence.  It declared that the elected representatives of the Irish people alone had the power to make laws binding on the people of Ireland and that the Irish Parliament was the only parliament to which the Irish people would give its allegiance.  After 700 years of foreign domination, we were determined to become a sovereign state.  Ninety years later, much has changed.  Where once we had the desire to break free of shackles to become our own masters, in many ways we now have an overwhelming sense of interdependence, as never before.  We realise our best future lies not in splendid isolation on the periphery of Europe, but as part of a family of nations free to surf the tides of international economic opportunity.  They say that no man is an island.  In the modern world, it is clear that no island can stand alone.  Not only do we recognise that a decision made last Friday in Philadelphia can bring joy to the Philippines and great sadness to Loughrea, but we also recognise, for example, that decisions made in Frankfurt are a central part of our best defence against the buffeting tides of an international financial crisis.  As commentators have said, in a sea of uncertainty our membership of the euro currency gives us a strength and stability that are crucial for a country that survives by exporting goods.</P>
        <P>Our sense of interdependence is heightened further by the understanding that the planet itself is in danger unless we consider the effects of our actions, particularly with regard to the use of energy.  Nearly 40 years ago, in 1970, in an article from <i>Time</i> magazine entitled &ldquo;Fighting to Save the Earth From Man&rdquo;, the point was made that &ldquo;Technological man is so aware of his strength that he is unaware of his weakness.&rdquo;  The article concluded that man&rsquo;s weakness was &ldquo;the fact that his pressure upon nature may provoke revenge&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the world now know that nature&rsquo;s revenge has been provoked.  We must now work together to renew the balance that has been lost.  We must do so not just for our own good but also for the international good.  In the modern world real freedom means the attainment of a position of influence and the dignity to work together with others to produce a better future for all.</P><Col N="16"/>
        <P>The men and that one woman of the First D&aacute;il showed courage and vision.  They showed passion, confidence and a determination to break free and chart our own course.  The men and women of this D&aacute;il and Seanad have no less a challenge in forging and strengthening the international bonds of co-operation that will lead to a better and sustainable future for us all.  We now have the urgent job of reassuring the people that our recent success was no accident, that our pride was not misplaced and that future triumphs lie ahead.</P>
        <P>The men and women of 90 years ago paved the way for international recognition of Ireland&rsquo;s sovereignty.  The task before us as politicians in the modern world is to work together with other sovereign countries, pooling that sovereignty, where there is a real common advantage, in the search for balanced, prosperous and just progress for all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proper today that we acknowledge the vision, perseverance and patriotism which was central to establishing this country&rsquo;s political independence.  The responsibility entrusted in all of us, as Members of the Oireachtas, to debate, plan and legislate policies to enhance our country and to better the quality of life of our fellow citizens stems from the courageous stance taken in January 1919.  That generation saw a sovereign native parliament as essential to the noble objective of ensuring that the people, in every generation, would have the freedom to chart their own social, economic and political progress.  Its lasting achievement is the representative democracy that it is the duty of each of us, in our time, to uphold and nurture.</P>
        <P>It is no accident of history that the Declaration of Independence of the First D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, its Democratic Programme and its Message to the Free Nations of the World, each of which were adopted in this room 90 years ago, make glowing reference to and derive legitimacy from the 1916 Rising.  The Easter rebellion is at the genesis of the First D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Those who founded our national Parliament envisaged a new Ireland, based on the ideals and the vision of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation.  They strove for an Ireland that would be free, an Ireland that would promote social justice and an Ireland that would be unequivocally democratic.  The significance of 1916 is only truly to be understood if it is seen as part of a movement which rapidly received democratic legitimacy and inspired a successful war of independence.</P>
        <P>The patriots of the past knew that this country had vast potential, if only freedom could be achieved.  Those who set up D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann had an innate belief that a native government was necessary to build up our economy and strengthen its capacity to provide decent livelihoods for all Ireland&rsquo;s people.</P>
        <P>In our recent history, this country has enjoyed astonishing success.  Up to last year, the Irish economy was growing year on year, which resulted in unprecedented progress in creating jobs and tackling forced emigration.  However, due to the international economic climate, the lack of confidence in global markets and the worst recession in a generation, we all know the next year will be very tough.  In confronting our current fiscal difficulties, we can draw inspiration from our proud past.</P>
        <P>It is instructive to recall the optimism of those who set this country on the route to independent nationhood and their belief in the capacity of each generation of Irish people to confront the problems of their time through their own ingenuity and common sense, building on what has been previously achieved.</P>
        <P>I want to refer to a letter from the period, written by Michael Collins to a fellow Deputy, Austin Stack.  This correspondence highlights both the bravery and the risks taken by Members of the First D&aacute;il to establish a democratic parliament in this country.  It reads:</P><Col N="17"/>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P LI="1" el="5">After the D&aacute;il meeting at the Mansion House on Friday, a few of us had a very interesting experience. . .  At about 5 o&rsquo;clock, the enemy came along with three motor lorries, small armoured car machine guns, probably 200 to 250 troops.  They surrounded the building with great attention to every military detail.  They entered the Mansion House and searched it with great care and thoroughness, but they got nobody inside.  The wanted ones codded them again!</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The generation that set up the D&aacute;il was made up of practical patriots who refused to be browbeaten by the scale of the challenges they faced.  The Members of the First D&aacute;il, which included Countess Markievicz, knew that the objectives they had set of supplanting the political, administrative and judicial systems of the British Empire would require a massive, unprecedented effort.  They met that challenge with determination and courage.  That great national work commenced here on 21 January 1919 and from it flowed the establishment of democratic self-government in Ireland, with its own judicial system and diplomatic representatives.</P>
        <P>Now 90 years on, in commemorating that historic occasion and in recalling the vision of our predecessors, we dedicate ourselves here to their example &mdash; representative government of the Irish people, by the Irish people and for the Irish people.</P>

	<P>On Friday, 16 January 2009, the Taoiseach requested me by letter under Standing Order 24 to summon D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to meet today, 20 January 2009, at 1.30 p.m. to consider legislation to enable Anglo Irish Bank to be taken into public ownership.  The business of today&rsquo;s special sitting is confined to the subject matter set out in the summons and arrangements relating thereto.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 2, motion re allocation of time and No. 1, Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 2 shall be decided without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.  We have just come from the Mansion House commemorating the first sitting of the D&aacute;il 90 years ago tomorrow.  The point I tried to make there was that the fundamental aspect of that First D&aacute;il was accountability in this Chamber &mdash; full accountability by the Government to the Parliament and through the Parliament to the people in respect of all dealings of the Government on behalf of the people.  To suggest that this House can deal with a Bill of 38 pages produced at 9 o&rsquo;clock this morning with the magnitude that it contains in a number of hours is simply not credible given what we have just said and from where we have just come.  I propose that the D&aacute;il rise not later than midnight tonight to allow adequate time to deal with the thousand questions that need to be asked arising from the Government&rsquo;s position on the matter.</P>
        <P>The country is now in a crisis of confidence, which partly arises from the international situation.  However, principally it is a crisis of confidence in the Government led by the Taoiseach, which has no clarity, coherence or agenda in terms of the way out of the problems <Col N="18"/>we now face.  The situation of the banks today affects every single person and business on this island and those who have connections beyond it.  The many thousands of rock solid people, who put their money into shares in banks, and whose shares and futures have now been decimated, do not speak but are shocked and appalled by the lack of leadership from the Government in dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>Last Wednesday the Fine Gael Party for its part called for the State to take over one bank &mdash; Anglo Irish Bank.  It also suggested that the proposed &euro;1.5 billion recapitalisation should not proceed and instead that the bank should be wound down in an orderly fashion over seven years.  When the Taoiseach spoke in Tokyo three or four hours before the decision was made, he said that recapitalisation was proceeding.  Subsequently following telephone calls or whatever, the Government decided to change direction and announced its intention to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>For his part the Minister for Finance has said that there were no irresponsible lending practices in Irish banks.  We have not seen copies of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report into these banks which is fundamental to the business we need to do here.  I wrote to the Taoiseach concerning a number of issues about Anglo Irish Bank and the Government&rsquo;s plan for it to continue as a going concern.  I asked about a new management board, a vetting of that board, the new commercial expertise that would be put in there and the issues surrounding the extension or otherwise of the guarantee.  The Taoiseach replied in part to that letter.  He also sent me a letter on his own behalf personally stating that he was very concerned at statements being made that would have a detrimental effect on the banking and fiscal situation in the country.  I can assure the Taoiseach that this party will be responsible and will not be gagged by any overtures from Government or any letters from him.  If many Ministers on the other side of the House had watched their mouths in the past six months we might not be in the position we are in today.</P>
        <P>Given that Standard and Poor&rsquo;s has readjusted its rating of Spain and is likely to do the same in respect of Ireland, this is a crisis of confidence.  Our banks are now practically valueless without the Government.  We know the importance of the banking sector to our economy in allowing businesses to continue with credit lines.  It is very important for people to be responsible in their attitude to the banking system.  In saying that, it is critical that all Deputies in this House receive answers from the Minister for Finance to the questions posed during the debate.  What is proposed by Government is completely insufficient to deal with this.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that he amend the proposal and allow the House to sit until midnight so that Members can have a decent opportunity to ask questions and get answers.  We want accountability here.</P>
        <P>We have had all the allegations about the Fianna F&aacute;il tent in Galway, about developers&rsquo; banks, and people saying they do not owe money to Anglo Irish Bank any more but to the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>At the beginning of the session the Ceann Comhairle drew attention to a letter he had received from the Taoiseach asking him to reconvene the D&aacute;il today.  However, the D&aacute;il should have been in session today and this week.  We have serious business to deal with on behalf of the people.  Since the D&aacute;il last met, we have had the worst Exchequer returns we have ever seen.  We have seen a continuing rise in unemployment, with 1,900 people told they are to lose their jobs in Limerick and others told yesterday they will lose their jobs in Galway, and a continuing problem with confidence in our economy and in our banking system.  Even if there were no proposal to nationalise a bank which required the reconvening of the D&aacute;il today, the D&aacute;il should have been back in session.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has tabled a number of amendments to the proposed business today, the effect of which would be that this D&aacute;il would continue to sit this week as it would any week.  In the current economic climate and the current banking situation, with the problems we are now facing, and given the concern the people of this country have for their jobs, their businesses and their futures, the idea that the D&aacute;il should come back for a couple of hours in the afternoon <Col N="20"/>to deal with a major proposal regarding the nationalisation of a bank is not acceptable.  The Government&rsquo;s proposal in that regard is out of touch with reality.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny that the priority must be to restore confidence to the Irish banking system and to the economy.  That confidence is badly damaged.  We can see this in the markets, for example, with what is happening to bank shares.  The way we do our business here will have a major impact in terms of restoring confidence.  It will not restore confidence in the Irish banking system and in the economy to rush through legislation dealing with an important issue such as this.  We know from past experience &mdash; it has happened over and over again &mdash; that when one rushes legislation one often gets it wrong.</P>
        <P>The proposal is to deal with a Bill containing 39 sections in a time which allows less than four minutes&rsquo; discussion on each section.  This is a major decision.  The implications of what is being done here and what is happening beyond this House are huge.  If a bank goes down, it will cost the taxpayer, because the guarantee will take effect.  If a bank has to be recapitalised, it will cost the taxpayer because that it where the money is going to come from and if a bank is nationalised, it will cost the taxpayer because of the implications contained therein.  This is quite apart from the importance of what the banks do for business, for households and for the running of this country.</P>
        <P>The Government has on previous occasions come in here, when it wanted to rush legislation through the House, and suggested debating a proposal for a few hours, taking all sections by a particular time and imposing a guillotine, and that would be the end of the story.  This legislation is far too important and serious, and there is far too much riding on this.  As regards the letter which the Taoiseach sent me and Deputy Kenny yesterday, the contents of which were then spun by spokespersons for the Taoiseach yesterday evening, the Labour Party needs no lecture or pious homily from the Taoiseach about responsibility on the subject of banking and the economy.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has been measured, as indeed has all the Opposition, in what we have said about the state of banking and the state of the economy over the past number of months and we stand ready, as always, to be constructive in dealing with any proposal that is brought before the House to deal with problems in banking or in any other area of the economy.  However, one cannot be very constructive if the time allowed for the consideration of the Bill is as short as is proposed here.  This is too serious for the kind of short, rushed approach the Government intends to take to today&rsquo;s business.  The House should continue to sit later tonight.  Deputy Kenny has proposed sitting until midnight and my amendment proposes sitting until 10.30 p.m.  I also believe it should continue to sit as normal throughout this week and take the time that is necessary.</P>
        <P>The proposal to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank was announced by the Government last Thursday.  It has taken from Thursday to Tuesday to reconvene the D&aacute;il.  The Bill to nationalise the bank was not published until last night and I do not see any reason it cannot be subjected to a good, normal debate here in the House where the implications can be teased out.  We are here to represent the taxpayer who will end up having to pay the bill if this goes all wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not only an issue of the amount of time or how robust is the debate on the proposition, but the fact that this proposal is ill-conceived.  It is being rushed without the Government even knowing the full facts of the situation applying at Anglo Irish Bank.  The Members of the House are being asked to agree to the potential nationalisation <Col N="21"/>of what could well prove to be, and has plenty of indicators to suggest it, a financial cesspit.  This is what we are being asked to nationalise.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has advocated a State bank approach, the nationalisation of a bank certainly if that was the methodology to be approached&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Member opposite will have his chance to mouth again later, whoever he may be among the caucus over there.  I have my brief opportunity to speak.  I am saying clearly that as people who believe sincerely that a State bank approach is indeed one that should be pursued by Government, why would it take on board Anglo Irish Bank which already has such a damaged reputation?  How does the Government propose such a State bank exercise will regain the confidence of the people and will go forward with the potential of succeeding in the future as a further entity among all the competing financial institutions in this State?  Why does the Government believe that a State bank or nationalised entity must always be, as in this instance, nothing more than a potential financial cesspit?  Surely we have higher standards in respect of what should be a nationalised entity or State bank and not this particular example of gross abuse and mismanagement.</P>
        <P>As we speak, a constituent of mine is in Mountjoy Prison over not being able, through unemployment, to meet repayments on a &euro;3,000 loan from a credit union.  He is in prison, jailed by a District Court, while there are people in Anglo Irish Bank who have been responsible for masking, with the connivance of others in other financial institutions, major loan irregularities.  Has the Taoiseach any idea of the full extent of it?  With resignation after resignation of directors, does the Government even know the full truth regarding the financial practices, the bottom line and the balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank?  All the information we have been shown so far suggests it does not.  It is, therefore, irresponsible for the Government to come before the House and expect Members to adopt this Bill.  This is not the way forward.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in supported in principle the proposal to address the then emerging crisis in the financial institutions in September.  We took the opportunity to engage with the Minister for Finance outlining our concerns and how we believed the banking guarantee proposals should be put into practice.  The Government, when it returned with the details of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals, failed far short of the minimum requirement in our view and we were forced to oppose the details of the guarantee scheme.  We are mindful of and recognise the importance of fiscal stability in the economy.  This is not, however, the correct working out of what was initially flagged.  Not only do I object to the time constraints imposed by the Order of Business but I oppose the proposition for Anglo Irish Bank.  This bank does not deserve to be nationalised.  I strongly reject the Government&rsquo;s proposals.</P>

	<P>It is important today that we give effect to the policy decision taken.  The draft of this legislation has been available since Thursday evening and the Opposition has received full briefings from the Department of Finance on many of the matters involved.  In this regard I send correspondence to the party leaders out of a sense of responsibility that I have, no more than the party leaders, to ensure that the public commentary is such so as not to undermine stability in the financial system.  That is the purpose for which I would communicate, on the basis of advice and the offer of a briefing from the Governor of the Central Bank to those who wish to take it in respect of correspondence I send.  It is for that purpose and no other that I would act in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is important to make the point that it is in the country&rsquo;s interest that legislation be passed through the House, that clarity and certainty be brought to the policy decisions as taken in respect of taking the further, decisive step to put this bank into public ownership.  We will continue to have a debate on this and on banking policy generally.  The Minister for Finance is more than ready to be available, through the committee system in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are using the time available prior to the return of the House next week to make sure we can finalise our arrangements in that regard.</P>
        <P>While we all have views on these matters, there is adequate time to debate in this House and to legislate on this Bill for the purposes of bringing certainty to the policy that was announced.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies for their time, given the short notice available, but clearly this is an issue of serious national importance requiring swift action by the Government.  I bring this Bill to the House today with a view to securing the financial position of Anglo Irish Bank and by extension the stability of the Irish financial system. The Government took the decision to bring Anglo Irish Bank into public ownership following consultations with the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency, the Financial Regulator and our legal and financial advisers.  I have also consulted with the board of Anglo Irish Bank subsequent to the decision of the Government.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the House that the Government&rsquo;s move to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank is in the national interest and has been taken to safeguard the economic future of the country and the continued viability of our financial institutions.  The Government is determined to protect the taxpayers&rsquo; interests by putting clear blue water between the new Anglo Irish Bank and the unacceptable behaviour that has gone before.</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P>It has been said so often outside this House that perhaps this bank is not of systemic importance to the Irish economy but I would like to outline on the record of the House certain fundamental facts about this institution.</P>
        <P>The total number of customers with loans in this institution is approximately 7,000, of whom the Irish customers who owe money to the bank are approximately 5,000.  The total number of retail depositors in this institution is approximately 300,000, of whom 72,000 are Irish customers.  The total number of corporate deposits held in this institution is approximately 12,000, of whom approximately 3,500 are Irish customers.  It is important the House understands that this bank is of systemic importance to Ireland and our reputation throughout the world.  This was not an optional decision for the Government; it was a carefully considered decision, arrived at by the Government after consideration of all the factors at a full meeting of the Cabinet.  When the House endorsed the decision of the Government on 29 September 2008 to guarantee the six Irish financial institutions, it was clear the Government took that decision to prevent a failure or collapse on the part of any of these institutions.</P>
        <P>The next step taken by the Government, as part of a consistent and coherent banking policy, was to analyse the loan books of all the financial institutions.  We are fortunate that ours is one of the few states that have had an opportunity to take such action.  Deputy Kenny requested that the details of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report be made public.  The difficulty I have is, of course, that the report contains the details of customers and customer information in several Irish financial institutions.  That cannot be disclosed in this House or in the public domain, given the fundamentally confidential character of the relationship that always exists between a bank and its customer.  However, the State did have the benefit of a very detailed analysis of the loan books of the Irish banks before any decisions were made about recapitalisation of these institutions.  When recapitalisation decisions were made, it was in the context of a carefully researched information document being available to the Government and its advisers.</P>
        <P>Particular decisions were made about the three largest institutions, the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Anglo Irish Bank.  Those decisions were announced before Christmas.  A particular arrangement was made with regard to Anglo Irish Bank, to which I will refer later.  At the expiration of the period envisaged in that arrangement, the Government reviewed the position of Anglo Irish Bank and came to the conclusion that the final option of nationalisation was the only one available to secure the position of the bank and the wider financial system in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach, therefore, has been a considered response to the financial crisis, which has resulted in state interventions across Europe and the world.  Through the bank guarantee scheme we have created a space to assess the further measures needed to best protect our financial system in a strategic manner.  We have always sought to minimise the risk to the taxpayer.  The bank guarantee scheme has succeeded in securing the funding position of the Irish financial system as a whole.  Our recapitalisation proposal will strengthen Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland as financial institutions central to the economic future of the country.  Discussions are continuing about the capital requirements of other financial institutions.</P>
        <P>While recapitalisation is the appropriate solution for AIB and Bank of Ireland, we have concluded that a different response is required for Anglo Irish Bank.  Intensified oversight of this bank in recent months has brought to light unacceptable practices by the former chairman and some of his former staff.  The concealment of loans to directors and the scale of those loans have done serious damage to the reputation of Anglo Irish Bank and to Irish banking at a difficult time in the markets.  These matters are now the subject of a number of investigations being undertaken by the Financial Regulator and the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  These investigations must be followed up both by the regulatory authorities, which have exten<Col N="28"/>sive powers, and by the bank itself.  I will insist on this as shareholder and as the responsible Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>What about the Garda?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Accordingly, the Government believes recapitalisation is not now the appropriate and effective method to secure its continued viability.  Therefore, the Government must move to the final and decisive step of public ownership.  Later, I will highlight in more detail the salient provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware of the international context in which this action has been taken.  I do not wish to dwell on old ground but it is important to note that the past 18 months have been unprecedented in terms of the pressure financial institutions, and banks in particular, have been under throughout the world.  Traditional sources of funding have dried up and although there has been some improvement in recent times, the international financial system remains in a very fragile position.</P>
        <P>Like every country in Europe, Ireland has moved to ensure the security and stability of its banking system.  Market expectations with regard to the capital that banks hold have altered significantly.  As a result, banks have had to vigorously compete for deposits and other forms of funding in a weakening economic environment.  Banks have also been forced to seek capital in a market unwilling to finance banks, resulting in an array of state recapitalisation programmes across the developed world.  In this challenging period, a bank&rsquo;s reputation, board and senior management and its good standing become ever more important.</P>
        <P>The extended financial crisis we have experienced has brought home to all of us the pivotal role the financial system plays in supporting the economy.  In turn, it has become clear to all that it is essential for Government to take appropriate action to maintain the stability of the financial system.  Throughout this process our approach has been based on two basic principles.  First, the State will not let any systemically relevant financial institution fail and, second, any State involvement in financial institutions will protect the interests of the taxpayer and have regard to legal and European law implications.</P>
        <P>In this context and taking the best advice available, the Government acted in September last year with purpose and determination to guarantee the deposits and other liabilities of credit institutions.  The principal Opposition party supported us in that enterprise, for which I thank it.  This move was essential to allow banks to continue their normal business of providing credit in this country.  The Government guarantee scheme succeeded in ensuring Irish banks have continued to do business and improved the amount of liquidity available to the various financial institutions.  For banks everywhere liquidity, that is, the cash that comes in the form of deposits and interbank moneys, provides the basis for lending and the guarantee has ensured the banks can continue to access that liquidity.</P>
        <P>The guarantee scheme gave rise to detailed engagement by Government with the banks.  This process has involved my Department, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the National Treasury Management Agency working with the relevant institutions and examining all options to maintain stability and the proper functioning of the banking system.  It has been a comprehensive and structured process, addressing such issues as the business plans of the banks, potential private investment, market expectations and, above all, the role of the banks in supporting the real economy.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that I have been clear about my intentions, there has been speculation that the action we are taking on Anglo Irish Bank somehow changes the position of the two other institutions on which the Government has announced plans.  Both Bank of Ireland and Allied <Col N="29"/>Irish Bank are fundamentally sound and solvent institutions.  The Government reiterates that it regards these banks as central to the Irish financial system and essential to the proper functioning of the economy.  The Government wishes to ensure that both banks remain as independent commercial entities.</P>
        <P>The Government reaffirms that it is proceeding with the planned recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank on this basis and its firm intention is that both banks remain in private ownership.  In particular, the Government reiterates its intent to provide &euro;2 billion to each institution from funds already earmarked in the NTMA for this purpose.  As previously outlined, this capital will be deemed to be core Tier 1 by the regulator and the terms and conditions when finalised will be framed to underpin market confidence.  The Government reiterates its commitment to underwrite or otherwise support a further &euro;1 billion in core capital to each of the banks.  As Deputies will be aware, we are also in discussion with certain other institutions about their future capital needs, if any, and we will work through this issue with a view to early discussions.</P>
        <P>It was recognised from an early stage that the challenges faced by individual institutions were not the same in each case and the necessary strategies to stabilise and strengthen them would be different.  From the outset of the financial crisis, market sentiment towards Anglo Irish Bank was especially negative, as evidenced by the dramatic collapse in the bank&rsquo;s share price and continued pressure on its funding.  While the bank&rsquo;s business model, which was heavily focused on commercial and real estate lending, had been profitable during times of strong economic growth and the steady expansion of the property sector, with the sharp contraction in both the Irish and United Kingdom property markets over the past 12 months, Anglo Irish Bank was perceived by investors as being more exposed than other institutions due to its less diverse business model.</P>
        <P>Taking advantage of the space provided by the Government guarantee and with a view to stabilising Irish financial institutions and ensuring the flow of credit to the economy, discussions were held with Anglo Irish Bank with a view to ensuring it had adequate capital levels.  The outcome of this engagement with the bank was a proposal by the Government for an initial and immediate capital investment of &euro;1.5 billion in preference shares, with a commitment to provide further capital to support the bank&rsquo;s position, as required.  The terms of the proposed &euro;1.5 billion investment took into account the greater degree of risk inherent in Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s business.  A higher rate of return was required from the bank than from the other two banks and the State was to hold 75% of the voting rights.</P>
        <P>Since that course of action was outlined in the week before Christmas, it has become necessary to take the ultimate step of nationalisation.  I will explain the reason.  At the time of the recapitalisation announcement, I made clear that the Government&rsquo;s offer to Anglo Irish Bank represented the last step short of nationalisation for the bank.  The commitment of Government support to Anglo Irish Bank was designed to boost market sentiment by bolstering its capital to a level which would ensure the bank&rsquo;s ability to withstand losses on its loan book that may arise over time.  Such losses are dependent on the effects of the worldwide economic outlook. The objective was to enable Anglo Irish Bank to trade out of its current difficulties under its existing ownership structure.</P>
        <P>However, the disclosure of the unacceptable practices which took place at Anglo Irish Bank in relation to loans to its former chairman and the consequent resignation of the chairman and a number of the bank&rsquo;s senior management team, including the CEO, compounded the weak position of Anglo Irish Bank in the eyes of investors and debt providers.  Market confidence in the bank was eroded and this was reflected in a limited weakening of its funding base in recent weeks and the increased risk of knock-on effects on its credit ratings.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank is a major financial institution.  While I outlined some of the elements of its accounts earlier, its balance sheet is in excess of &euro;100 billion.  There is no doubt that the viability of an institution of this scale is of systemic importance to Ireland.  Contrary to the impression being put about, the bank lends to a wide range of customers, providing funds for investment and employment in such areas as retail, office, leisure, health care, tourism and other services.  It is also a significant lender to construction and development which is a very important part of its balance sheet.</P>
        <P>Thousands of customers rely on Anglo Irish Bank for credit, while hundreds of thousands of depositors are involved.  All my advice is that letting the bank fail would lead to very serious disruption of our financial system.  It is not a question a saving a few developers from going to the wall, it is a matter of underpinning deposit and wholesale funding throughout the financial system.  The developers will have to pay their loans.</P>
        <P>The nationalisation of a financial institution is not a step which can be taken lightly or as a first solution because it results in a significant degree of State intervention in normal market processes.  In recent months, the Government has provided the support required to stabilise Anglo Irish Bank in the shape of the Government guarantee.  While the recapitalisation proposal in respect of the bank would have helped underpin it, even greater certainty can and will be provided through taking the bank into public ownership.</P>
        <P>There has been some recent media debate regarding the effect of this measure on Government accounts.  Taking Anglo Irish Bank into State ownership should have no immediate impact on either the general Government debt or current deficit as the bank is a going concern and will continue to operate as a commercial bank.  As with other commercial State companies, its debts and assets will remain on its own books.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny stated on the Order of Business that it was somehow improper to suggest that Anglo Irish Bank should continue as a going concern.  In commercial practice the alternative to a going concern is a liquidation business.  Naturally, the Taoiseach and I have been anxious to stress that Anglo Irish Bank will continue on a going concern basis.  When the board assumes its duties as a board of directors appointed by me tomorrow, it will have to return to me with a strategic plan for the future of the bank and the part it can play in the wider Irish banking scene in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s actions have been made on the basis that the health of the economy is inextricably linked to the banking sector.  The Government is committed to protecting our sovereign rating through restoring order to the public finances.  Immediate action is required and the Government has agreed that expenditure savings of &euro;2 billion will be made in 2009, in addition to the measures contained in the October budget.  Other important work is continuing, including a root and branch review of public service numbers and expenditure levels and a report on the taxation system by the Commission on Taxation.  The decisions we make in that regard will have the most vital and important bearing on our sovereign rating around the world.</P>
        <P>I will say a few words on the impact of this decision on various stakeholders.  The immediate impact of the Government&rsquo;s action is to provide certainty to all of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s depositors and other customers, across all of the bank&rsquo;s operations in Ireland and internationally, that the bank is secure and stable and will continue to conduct its business on normal terms.  Depositors and other creditors of Anglo Irish Bank continue to be protected by the Government&rsquo;s guarantee and creditors, including bond holders, can be assured that it is in a position to continue to fulfil its obligations and repay its debts at maturity.  The suggestion canvassed in some quarters that the State should repudiate the &euro;20 billion it owes the bond holders, an action taken in the case of Lehman&rsquo;s Bros. Bank in September, is an unacceptable course of action for the State. <Col N="31"/> Added to this, all customers of Anglo Irish Bank have the assurance of stability that full State ownership of a financial institution brings.</P>
        <P>It is important to be clear that the day-to-day running of Anglo Irish Bank will continue as normal and employees remain employed by the company.  The bank will be managed on a commercial basis at arm&rsquo;s length from the Government, allowing the full potential of its business to be realised.  The legislation I have put before the House provides for a relationship framework.  The Government will appoint a new board to oversee the running of the bank and prepare a comprehensive business plan to enable Anglo Irish Bank to continue as a going concern.  This business plan will be required to demonstrate how the board will oversee the continued commercial operation of the bank in the best interests of the bank, financial sector and taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decision of Mr. Donal O&rsquo;Connor to accept my invitation to be the bank&rsquo;s Chairman.  As I stated when Mr. O&rsquo;Connor was appointed, he has a substantial and impressive commercial track record and is a natural choice to lead this financial institution in what is a challenging period for all financial institutions.  Mr. O&rsquo;Connor did sterling service in the past with financial institutions which were going through turbulence.  The outgoing board, before it appointed him, consulted with me to consent to his appointment.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to acknowledge Mr. Maurice Keane&rsquo;s appointment to the board and to thank Mr. Alan Dukes and Mr. Frank Daly for their continued valuable contribution to the board.  I will announce further appointments in the near future.</P>
        <P>While the &euro;1.5 billion preference share purchase is not now immediately required, the Government is committed to providing the support to ensure Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s continued commercial viability.  There is no question of moving the bank into a wind-up scenario which would create the potential for an under-priced realisation of the loans and other assets held by it.  All borrowers from the bank remain subject to the same terms and its new board will place a particular focus on ensuring that all debts are fully pursued by the bank in a commercial way, as any other bank would.</P>
        <P>While the Act provides for the transfer of Anglo Irish Bank into State ownership, shareholder rights are protected under Irish law, and accordingly I have provided for the role of an independent assessor under the Act to assess what would be fair and reasonable compensation for shareholders.  The assessor will take into account a wide range of factors before making a recommendation on the level of compensation.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of commentary about the bad debt position in Anglo Irish Bank.  Deputies will be aware I received from the Central Bank and Financial Regulator a report undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the financial position of the institutions participating in the Government&rsquo;s guarantee scheme.  We had the time and opportunity to supplement that work with an examination by independent valuers Jones Lang LaSalle, which generally confirmed the conclusions reached by PwC with regard to Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>The bank is large in Irish terms and its assets include approximately &euro;70 billion in loans and advances to customers.  These are not bad debts, as many try to suggest.  As with any bank, there is a mixture of good loans and some that are distressed.  Many people have asked what the implications will be for the State if there are very significant losses on loans in Anglo Irish Bank, and it is clear that there will be losses on some of the loans.</P>
        <P>It is important to clarify to the House that in the first instance there are significant moneys within Anglo Irish Bank to take the strain of loan losses arising over the next three or four years before State support is engaged.  There are approximately &euro;7 billion of shareholder funds and other capital available to offset any losses on the loan book, in addition to ongoing pre-loan loss profits which have been very significant in the case of Anglo Irish Bank.  Its position <Col N="32"/>is secured by nationalisation, and the Government can work with the new chairman and board to extract the optimal value from its loan book and minimise the taxpayer&rsquo;s exposure.</P>
        <P>The Government has estimated that for the Irish banking system as a whole and allowing for a large degree of stress, it would be appropriate to allow for capital injections into the main banks in the order of &euro;10 billion in total.  Within this &euro;10 billion, I would have allowed for a capital injection into Anglo Irish Bank to offset potential loan losses, maintain its capital base on a sound footing and leave a prudent margin for error in current circumstances.  As it is now a nationalised entity with the State behind it, rather than make an immediate upfront capital injection we can provide appropriate funds as necessary over time to complement its own resources if required.</P>
        <P>Looking beyond Anglo Irish Bank, I would like to address what the Government sees as the future of the banking system in Ireland.  The Government is committed to providing a platform for a well regulated, profitable banking industry of high repute in Ireland that operates in a national and international financial services environment.</P>
        <P>The nature and thrust of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory regime needs to adjust to the new realities.  Lessons must be learned from mistakes made and from the international experience of the recent period of worldwide financial disruption.  We need a regulatory regime which fosters probity.  I welcome the review now being undertaken by the authority to that end and we are not alone in this process.  Work has begun on forging a new model to govern the conduct and behaviour of the financial sector both here and internationally.</P>
        <P>I can assure the House that Ireland will play its part internationally and especially at EU level in seeking to ensure that the redesign of the financial system, and in particular of financial regulation, is consistent with the objectives that underlie a strong, stable and functioning national banking system.  Our vision for the banking sector is that banks will serve borrowers, small and medium-sized enterprises and all stakeholders in an honest way, and ensure customers and consumers are treated in a reputable and respectable manner.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 sets out my functions in the public interest as Minister for Finance under the Bill.  These functions are granted on the basis that following consultations with the directors of the bank, the Governor and the authority, I have formed the opinion that there are concerns about the viability of Anglo Irish Bank and that the exercise of these functions is necessary to preserve its capacity to continue as a going concern.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister may specify a relationship framework to govern the relationship with the bank recognising the separation of it from the Minister and limiting the Minister&rsquo;s intervention in the conduct of the bank&rsquo;s business to actions necessary to protect the public interest.  Section 3 gives the Minister a power to issue general directions to Anglo Irish Bank where it is necessary or expedient in the public interest, subject to regulatory requirements.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides that the provisions of the Act will have effect regardless of any provision in the Companies Acts, any other enactment or any provision in Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association.  Section 5 is a crucial provision, the effect of which is to transfer all of the shares in Anglo Irish Bank to the Minister on the commencement of this Act.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that on enactment, the bank will convert from being a public limited company to being a private company limited by shares.  Section 8 provides that the Minister may transfer some or all of his shares in the bank to a nominee at any time on such terms as the Minister specifies.</P><Col N="33"/>
        <P>Section 9 deals with instruments to which the bank is a party.  Commercial instruments may provide for their termination or other consequences, for example accelerate payment not otherwise due to be paid until some future time, where the ownership or control of one of the contracting parties changes.  This section provides that specified consequences shall not arise solely as a result of the enactment of this Bill unless I provide by order that they shall.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that Anglo Irish Bank will remain fully liable to all of its creditors.  However, it is important that creditors do not suddenly become entitled to the early repayment of moneys or the termination of contracts because of the State&rsquo;s necessary intervention.  Steps have already been taken to guard against such an action, but this section provides an appropriate backstop.  There is a hardship provision where I may reduce the effect of the restriction by order where otherwise the section might be unduly onerous.</P>
        <P>Section 10 extinguishes certain legal rights, largely enjoyed by directors, senior managers and employees in Anglo Irish Bank to subscribe for shares in it.  Section 11 deals with situations where someone has an equitable interest or security interest and any sum paid as compensation will be held in trust.  Section 12 provides for the discontinuation of any listing of shares.</P>
        <P>Sections 13, 14 and 15 provide that specified provisions of the Central Bank Acts, Companies Acts and competition legislation shall not apply.  Section 16 disapplies a number of legislative provisions which would impose procedural, notification and approval requirements.  Section 17 facilitates timely and expeditious decision making by me or my nominee when acting as shareholder.</P>
        <P>Sections 18 to 20, inclusive, provide powers that facilitate swift action to make necessary changes in the administration of Anglo Irish Bank.  They provide for changing of the financial year, removal and appointment of directors, officers and employees from their positions within it and its subsidiaries and appointment of their replacements.  These powers are exercisable only in the public interest.</P>
        <P>Section 21 provides that specified persons shall not be regarded as <i>de facto</i> or shadow directors of the bank or its subsidiaries.  Sections 22 to 32, inclusive, address the issue of the amount of compensation that should be payable.  Section 22 provides for the assessor.  Section 23 provides for the payment or reimbursement of remuneration or expenses.  Section 24 sets out who may make submissions.</P>
        <P>Section 25 lays out the criteria to be applied by the assessor.  Section 26 provides that before making a report the assessor will circulate a draft of it.  Section 27 provides for a report by the assessor to the Minister on the determination of fair and reasonable compensation.</P>
        <P>Sections 28, 29 and 30 address the practicalities if the assessor determines that compensation is in fact payable.  Section 31 provides for appeals to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.  Section 32 provides that leave will not be granted for judicial review of a determination under section 26 unless the application for review raises a substantial issue and the time limits for such application.</P>
        <P>Section 33 provides that expenses and expenditure incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Bill will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 34 provides for the creation and issue of securities for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 36 provides that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of facilitating the exercise by the assessor of their functions.  Section 37 allows the Minister to make regulations.</P>
        <P>Section 38 amends the Finance Act 1970, the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 and the Central Bank Act 1942 to facilitate the achievement of the purposes of the Bill by enabling the Minister to delegate the borrowing powers in section 34 to the National Treasury Management Agency.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to address a major systemic threat within the banking sector.  Anglo Irish Bank presents a particular problem.  Increasing uncertainty and concerns about corporate governance have threatened its ability to access necessary funding and the concentration of its lending to the building sector exposed considerable risk to its loan book.</P>
        <P>The regrettable and unacceptable corporate governance issues surrounding the bank further damaged its reputation and had the effect of neutralising any positive boost which the proposed recapitalisation would have generated.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the NTMA and our legal and financial advisers were unanimous in their advice to the Government that strong and decisive action in the form of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was needed to maintain its commercial viability and that a failure to support the bank in this way would damage our financial system generally.</P>
        <P>I was disturbed that an article appeared on page 14 of <i>The Irish Times</i> today suggesting that when the Government made a previous decision on a matter of this character on 29 September last it did not act on the advice of the Central Bank, or the officials at the Department of Finance, or the Financial Regulator.  The suggestion made in the article is not in accordance with the facts, and that matter has been attended to.</P>
        <P>The decision to nationalise is a clear indication that the Government is fully prepared to stand behind the Irish banking system and to demand and ensure proper governance.  Our actions send one clear message to customers, investors, credit rating agencies and the markets generally that Ireland is a safe, secure place to do banking business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell and Olivia Mitchell.  Perhaps the Chair would let me know when 20 minutes have elapsed.</P>
        <P>Most people in this country share a sense of outrage at how we have come to this pass.  That sense of outrage is apparent right across the country.  There is outrage at the political ineptitude which has been a feature of why we are in this sorry situation.  There was reckless flirtation with the property bubble over a long period.  There was a refusal to heed warnings from responsible bodies outside the State &mdash; the IMF, the EU and many others.  There were baseless assurances offered by those leading the Government that our property bubble was based on solid economic foundations, and all the while our public finances were heading on a course that was totally unsustainable and our competitiveness was being destroyed.  There is a sense in which people believe the Government is in the dock, that the sorry pass we have now come to is in a sense a trial of the way in which this economy has been managed in recent years.  That has been put under scrutiny and we are seeing its product now.</P>
        <P>There is outrage not only with those who have led us, but at the behaviour of those who have led the banking system.  There is a sense that there are many at the top of the banking system who have behaved in a wholly reckless way, who have betrayed their shareholders, the employees who work in the banks and, worse still, who have done great damage to our credibility as a country within which to manage financial institutions.  There is also outrage at incompetent oversight.  The role of auditors and regulators is in sharp focus.  There is a sense that we do not yet have all of the answers regarding what failed us, why all the honeyed assurances we got from Ministers, regulators and central bankers were so wide of the mark.  It is not enough to point to international difficulties because many of the problems we see in our banking system are the product of decisions made at home and of the way banks were managed here.  That is the background we are up against.</P>
        <P>There are many people in the country who would like to vent their fury on Anglo Irish Bank, who believe we should not be nationalising it today and that in doing so we are bailing out <Col N="35"/>those who have behaved wrongly.  We must make it crystal clear that we are not, if this nationalisation goes through, bailing out developers and bankers who behaved wrongly.  We are not bailing out any of the auditors who let us down because they were not watching.  We are not bailing out the regulators.  There is a time for accountability for all of those.  We want to see that accountability in this House.  There can be no hiding behind the cloud of confidence, as we have seen before, when the Government stated it could not possibly reveal what was going on because there was too much at stake.  We want accountability.  We want people punished if punishment is due.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something that must come out of this.</P>
        <P>People are terrified that their job may be the next to go, that they can no longer rely on their pensions, that they can no longer rely on the banks.  There is a yearning now for leadership, and that leadership has not been given.  Let us be blunt.  We have budgets that displayed no understanding of the challenge we face and now we are apparently trying to make running repairs on a budget that was hopelessly inept.</P>
        <P>There is a sense too that banking strategy is being made up on the hoof.  First, there is no question of recapitalisation.  We are told that would be completely the wrong direction to go, that the banks are adequately capitalised.  Day after day we were assured that was the case, that restructuring was what was needed.  There was a &ldquo;high noon&rdquo; when the banks were brought together to have this restructuring.  That idea was dropped.  There was no more talk of restructuring and recapitalisation was back on the agenda.  We were told that was the way forward.  Now we are told nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank is the way forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to get a sense from the Minister, which he has not displayed today, that there is a grand strategy, that he has a sense of how he can achieve his objective of nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and managing it in a way that protects the taxpayer, that he has a strategy that will successfully recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland and keep them in private ownership.  That is not what the markets believe.  I do not believe what the Minister has said today has pointed the way to how he is going to make that strategy work in the face of what is happening.</P>
        <P>One thing we could do to restore confidence is to properly debate this Bill and not rush it through on the basis of trust in assurances about the loan book, assurances about bonds that did not have a guarantee up to now and now perhaps have a guarantee, assurances about the way the bank will be run that do not have tied down accountability to the Oireachtas.  We are not having the sort of debate we ought to have in this House in order that nationalisation will be a credible, well thought out, well stress-tested part of the Government strategy.  This must be stress-tested and this is the House that does that, but it cannot do it if it is confined to a few hours of discussion.  Many of the amendments will not be reached.  Many of the sections will not be reached.  The Government has put us into such a tight framework that we cannot do the job we were elected to do, which is to hold the Government to account and, through it, those institutions that are behind it.  That is what we are supposed to be doing, but we are now being rushed into doing everything in a couple of hours.  That is totally in contrast to the relaxed attitude since 30 September when the taxpayer was exposed.  We have not had a sense of the Government designing a credible way through this.  We still do not have credit flowing.  Credit availability is worse now than it was on 30 September.  We are making survival tougher for the businesses we need, the export businesses that are to be the future of this country.</P>
        <P>Any seasoned legislator will confirm that rushed legislation is often flawed legislation.  I have been around long enough to have seen many examples of it.  I fear this legislation will be the same.  The stakes, as the Minister has rightly said, are high.  We could be revisiting this issue in <Col N="36"/>a couple of weeks time,  If we do not get this legislation right, we will not have a proper vehicle for dealing with the challenges ahead.  We need to provide the time to get this right.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s view on Anglo Irish Bank is clear.  We have articulated it from the start.  We do not believe we should be recapitalising with &euro;1.5 billion of State money in the idle hope that trust in that bank could be restored, that it is a credible banking model for the long-term future, or that it had a loan book it could manage in such a way that it would become a powerhouse for lending in the future to export businesses.  We did not see that strategy as viable.  That is why we took a view from the outset that we should not put &euro;1.5 billion into Anglo Irish Bank and that we should take it into State ownership so that we could, on behalf of the taxpayer, control the risk to which we taxpayers were exposed by the guarantee given on 30 September.  That has been our view.</P>
        <P>I support nationalisation because it is an element of meeting our requirement.  However, there are other elements I do not see here on which I want assurances.  One is whether we are unwittingly extending the guarantee we gave to depositors to a new tranche of people who were not covered by the guarantee heretofore.  It seems there are categories, amounting to at least &euro;10 billion, who were not guaranteed before, and there is another &euro;12 billion in respect of which the guarantee only goes to 2010.  There is a worry that the taxpayer is now in a position that he or she effectively will be offering a guarantee to these that was never there before.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that creditors, including bondholders of Anglo Irish, can be assured that it will continue to service its obligations and will repay its debts at maturity.  Nowhere in this Bill or in the Minister&rsquo;s statement, however, is it made clear that they will only be repaid if the management of the loan book is delivering 100% of the value so we can be in a position to meet their risk capital &mdash; that we are not offering some new taxpayers&rsquo; guarantee by the back door to people who entered into risky investments with their eyes open.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to deal with that matter and have a proper answer to it.  I am surprised that it was not dealt with in the Minister&rsquo;s Second Stage speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was dealt with in the correspondence from the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be dealt with.  This is the last time Deputies will get a chance to assess this legislation.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there is a great deal of public concern.  He may say it is frivolous and wrong-headed but there is a concern that Fianna F&aacute;il politicians could use the nationalisation of the bank to advance the interests of debtors to the bank &mdash; big property developers with close relationships to politicians.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Keep an eye on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be absolutely copper-fastened that this cannot happen.  The Taoiseach may feel that this questioning is unwarranted but it is everywhere in the media and it must be nailed.  In other words, we must pin down that there can be no unwarranted interference, that the bank will be managed entirely without fear or favouritism, that taxpayers will see the policies applied in writing down loans and that if loans come to be written down, we will see what was done.  That information is the protection, as I am sure the Minister would say, both against false accusations against Ministers, who have to protect themselves, and the protection of the taxpayer so our money will not be abused.  I do not see that sort of protection in the Bill.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P>We are told that there will be a relationship agreement, which we have not yet seen.  We do not see anywhere in the Bill the proper relationship to the Oireachtas.  We do not see it vetting the directors who will be appointed.  We do not see it when the Minister is taking the most extraordinary power of being able to sack loan officers in the banks.  He is taking that power in the public interest but we do not see his obligation to demonstrate that, when and if he acts under that provision, it is in the public interest and that it will come back to the Oireachtas so that we can scrutinise it as being so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach made an unfortunate comment when he talked about business as usual in the bank, because what people want is anything but business as it was usually conducted in Anglo-Irish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what got us where we are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>We need radical and total change.  I accept the Government now has the opportunity to bring in a fresh board.  Members of the Oireachtas deserve an opportunity to vet the suitability, appropriateness and policies that are going to be pursued.  We need to see the strategy that is to be pursued if this bank, as the Minister says, is to be made a going concern.  He knows we are sceptical that the bank can be made a going concern.  I fear that if we talk about it being made so, and continuing <i>ad infinitum</i>, it may be only on the basis of a drip feed from the taxpayer that does not protect the taxpayers&rsquo; interest to the maximum possible extent.</P>
        <P>The Minister has not articulated his strategy for Anglo Irish.  He has kicked it off into the middle distance so that someone will come back and tell him what the strategy will be.  That does not give us assurance, which is a concern.  We need to see that nailed down in the course of this debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As many people have said, we believe that transparency and accountability must be in this vehicle.  We do not see transparency, for example, concerning the loan book.  The Minister told Deputy Kenny, in an aside, that he could not possibly give the PwC report because it contains confidential commercial information.  The Minister should purge the confidential information in it and put the report in the public domain.  We, the taxpayers, now own this bank and we must have transparency concerning the state of the loan book.  We will have to manage that over the coming years and must be assured that it is managed in an aggressive way to protect the taxpayer.  We need to have that information flow coming to us regularly, about the current status of the loan book, how much of it is distressed, non-performing or in a category where there is a belief that the value can be recovered.  We need to have that sort of information and there should be a transparency section in this Bill to deal with that and many other issues.</P>
        <P>What is the future of the going concern?  If the Minister believes that a bank that has been predominantly funding on a model that most people say is broken &mdash; namely, access to the short-term money markets &mdash; and if he believes that it can now transform itself from being predominantly a property development bank into a new bank for the future, we deserve to see what his credible strategy for that is, if that is the direction in which he is going.  Otherwise, we are into managing a wind-down and working out of the strategy, not liquidation.  The contrast in my view is not between liquidation and nationalisation, as the Minister has suggested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A going concern. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a middle way, which is the one we have advocated.  The time is so curtailed that I do not even have time to mention all the amendments we will seek to make.  However, we will want to see proper operational independence in the bank and a presentation to the Oireachtas of the relationship framework so that we can vet it.  We will <Col N="38"/>want to see transparency on loan exposures and decisions on debt restructuring.  All these transparencies are essential to public confidence.  As elected representatives who are here to protect the taxpayer, we must do our job thoroughly and well.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy is to get lending going again, but that is not happening.  The Minister knows it is not happening and so do I.  Now it seems the Minister&rsquo;s next key strategy, the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland, has been punctured because the market is no longer confident in it.  Is the Minister considering a model that would refloat the capitalisation?  In other countries, we have seen that recapitalisation has been accompanied by models of one sort or another to deal with bad debts &mdash; to ring-fence them either with an insurance policy &agrave; la the United Kingdom or a bad bank policy as has happened in other institutions.  However, it gives certainty to the financial institutions as to their exposure on some of these bad debts and it allows the recapitalisation to succeed.</P>
        <P>There is a growing sense that people are in a sweat about what is happening in the financial markets and whether the Government strategy is up to it.  We need to hear from the Government very soon what the next step is and if we need to develop a model.  Let us for once lead the markets instead of reacting to what is happening.  Let us have a sense of the way in which we will go.  Most vitally, Ireland Inc. is now in the dock.  Our economic strategy is on trial and, by God, we need a proper strategy for management of the public finances and restoring competitiveness, but we have not seen it.  The effort before Christmas was a disaster, as was the budget.  We must get a grip because if we can steady that ship, we can steady many of the other elements that are going wrong in the financial institutions.  In a way, it is showing the ill ease that exists about the way in which Ireland Inc. is being managed.</P>

	<P>I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Deputy Bruton, that this legislation is being rushed.  We are getting five hours to debate something that will have a monumental impact on the way the economy is run.  I cannot understand why this legislation is being rushed, but it is.  We should be allowed more time to debate it.  The public is looking for certainty, confidence, the restoration of trust in both the banking and political systems and leadership from the Government.  A number of critical issues must be addressed to restore public confidence in Anglo Irish Bank.  I do not cast aspersions on the individuals involved but a completely new board of directors must be appointed to the bank to establish full transparency.  We shortly will own the bank and the PwC report should be made public whether that is in purged or abridged form, as Deputy Bruton said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like F&Aacute;S did.  Its report was censored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be published, similar to the F&Aacute;S report.  I cannot understand why it has not been published.  We are being asked to approve something blind.  We do not know what we are putting money into but the PwC report was supposed to outline that.  The current auditors to the bank must be removed.  This is again not personal but new auditors must be appointed.  It is absolutely critical that the existing auditors be replaced to restore trust.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government must provide a proper roadmap regarding regulation of the banking system.  The Anglo Irish Bank annual report in 2007 stated 56% of the salaries of executive directors was paid in bonuses while 61% of the former chief executive officer&rsquo;s salary, amounting to &euro;2 million, was paid in bonuses.  The banks were run on the basis of greed as they chased <Col N="39"/>unsustainable profits and nothing like this can happen again.  Ordinary shareholders, including pensioners, who attended the bank&rsquo;s emergency general meeting last Friday feel they are not getting leadership from the Government and are not being told what is the position.  The Government and the Oireachtas must restore people&rsquo;s trust, which, in turn restores trust among international markets that do not believe what is going on.  The share price of every Irish bank is still falling because the markets do not believe the reports that are coming out of Ireland.  Certainty is needed.  That is why we put forward that the bank should be nationalised in a form that provides certainty.  The loan book must be managed.  The Government has not stated how much money it will have to invest in the bank and we are being asked to agree something in five hours when the Government will not answer important questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for the appointment of an assessor.  The appointment should be scrutinised by an Oireachtas committee.  That is what we are here to do.  The Minister and the Government are missing the point.  The public is looking for transparency, accountability and the restoration of trust in the banking system and if the Government does not deal with the issues we have raised in a constructive manner, it may not provide certainty going forward for the markets.</P>
        <P>The Government guarantee scheme was introduced for the principal purpose of providing for the flow of funds throughout the economy and, in particular, to the small business sector, which provides jobs.  Like all Members, I have been contacted by small business owners over the past few days who say they will be out of business in a week if funds do not flow.  The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank does nothing to provide for this.  The Government must provide an insurance scheme for the other banks regarding their losses.  Funds must flow to the small business sector again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is absolutely impossible to overstate the rage and anger among the people about the failure of those in whom they place their trust to protect their interests.  This includes the Government, bankers, enforcers and regulators.  This issue is too important for political point scoring but somebody must speak on behalf of those who have lost their pensions, savings and jobs and who are fearful for their future.</P>
        <P>The issue we are discussing relates to confidence in our political leadership and its ability to manage and restore confidence in our banking sector.  Confidence is key.  It does not matter a jot how viable is a bank or how accurately its balance sheet reflects its asset price if the market does not believe it to be true.  I am sorry that the markets do not believe what the Minister for Finance is telling them.  He says the banks are sound but the markets do not believe him no matter how many times he says it.  However, the markets perceive Ireland to have a basket case economy and an inept Government, incapable of making decisions to deal with the banking crisis.  I am not the only person saying this.  The same story is published in every international newspaper.  No matter how true it is what they say about our Government, banks and regulators, it is heartbreaking.   The markets are reflecting this and investors are shying away from Irish banks again today.</P>
        <P>We have had four months of this and it cannot go on.  The handling of the Anglo Irish Bank issue is an example of how not to inspire confidence.  From day one, it was clear the bank was not a viable business, yet when decisive action should have been taken, the Minister&rsquo;s solution was too timid and tentative.  The suggestion that it would merge with other banks was never realistic, particularly when it was not made a condition of the guarantee scheme.  The next suggestion was to partially recapitalise it, which was followed by a proposal for part ownership but now, four months on, the taxpayer has had to buy a bank whose primary asset nobody wants.</P>
        <P>The issue is whether the Government can learn lessons from the Anglo Irish Bank scenario when dealing with the other banks.  Surely, it must be obvious that by merely throwing money <Col N="40"/>at a bank, the problem will not be solved, confidence will not be restored in the system and the agony will be prolonged.  The problem is it is perceived that the bad debts in our formerly blue chip banks are enormous.  I do not know whether this is the case and I do not know whether the Minister does but as long as the markets believe that, they might as well be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I put information on the record about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>As long as that position pertains, the share prices of our banks will continue to fall, investors will go elsewhere, the cost of government debt will continue to soar, there will be precious little lending in the economy and jobs will continue to disappear.</P>
        <P>Uncertainty is the enemy and, therefore, we need to know how badly exposed are the other banks and address that.  It is the only way to stabilise the market and restore confidence, no matter who owns the banks.  As Deputy Bruton said, the restoration of competitiveness in the economy will have to be done the hard way.  Unlike Britain, we cannot allow our currency to float.  We are facing ten years of austerity in current spending while significant capital spending is still required.  However, to do so, we must know the amount of capital available.</P>
        <P>The Government strategy of drip feeding money to banks in the hope each time that somehow the latest injection will work is debilitating for them, the economy and the public and it cannot be allowed to go on.  All the bad news must be put in the public domain and dealt with once and for all.  The only certainty is postponing action will make solutions more difficult, not easier, and the problems bigger, not smaller.  The elephant in the corner, which no one wants to discuss, is Ireland&rsquo;s ability to stay within the euro.  To do so, the Government will have to approach other European governments, including the French and German Governments, while other countries are also lined up seeking help, but if an enthusiastic reception is expected, we will have to show we can behave decisively, responsibly and, above all, deal transparently with our banks.  Restoring confidence in the banking system is not the total solution to our economic problems but there will be no solution until that happens.</P>

	<P>When we came into the House today after the Christmas recess and all the dramatic events that have happened in banking not just in Ireland but also elsewhere, I had expected the Government to show a clear sense of action and purpose to address the key issues facing the banking sector.  We are debating a Bill on the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, but the Minister is missing the main point.  The most important issue at stake and the goal, towards which Government policy should be directed, if I may advise the Minister, is the protection, sustainability and regulation of our two large banks.  They are historic banks that have existed for longer than the D&aacute;il &mdash; certainly the Bank of Ireland has.  We need those two banks for every town and village and pretty much most of the businesses in the country.  We want to sustain the bulk of the jobs in the country.</P>
        <P>It gives me no pleasure &mdash; I am sure it gives no Member of this House pleasure &mdash; to see how the markets have reacted.  Fianna F&aacute;il is the party that believes in the markets and does not much like to regulate them. One can live by the market and die by the market.  I believe the markets are wrong about both of those banks.  They are sustainable banks with a strong future and are critical to employment in the economy.  I believe the other two banks covered by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act, over and above Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, also have a future.</P><Col N="41"/>
        <P>Why did the Minister not come here today with a clear statement of his overall strategy on the critical parts of the economy and the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on those banks?  Although we are here today to discuss Anglo Irish Bank, it is extraordinary that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to set out a strategy about sustaining our whole banking system, sustaining credit and sustaining employment.  While the contents of the Bill are important, they are nowhere near as important as the sustainable future of our two big banks.  The Minister needs to express confidence.  He also needs to take aside the other Ministers who appear on radio and give them a little lesson in what is important in this economy in terms of people&rsquo;s jobs.  Yesterday morning I listened to one Minister, whom I personally respect.  I felt like weeping for the country and the people who would lose their jobs by letting out people who are ill-informed, ill-advised and carry no brief for explaining what is happening in our banking system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I heard the Taoiseach express his concern that we might have loose talk costing jobs today just as in a war loose talk might cost lives.  Let me talk to the Taoiseach about loose talk.  The Labour Party has acted with absolute concern for sustaining credit and jobs.  It gives us no pleasure that so much of our analysis was correct.  We were doing it simply on the basis of reports and information in the newspapers.  At times it feels as if we need to read tea leaves to make out what is going on.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il is being asked to make major and far-reaching fundamental financial economic decisions, not about our biggest banks, although we hope the Minister has proposals for them somewhere in his back pocket because he will need them, but about a significant bank that grew as an aberration alongside a property bubble.  There is no doubt that it produced extraordinary results.  However, it was part of a property bubble and dealings on the Stock Exchange which are not to be recommended &mdash; a point to which I will return shortly.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach sent a letter to Deputy Gilmore last night.  In April 2006 I made a statement addressed at the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  I said that the contract for difference was a form of gambling on the stock market where the purchaser does not even buy a share, but simply an entitlement to the gains or losses on a share over a particular period.  It was a particularly lucrative activity for those involved in that form of Stock Exchange gambling.  While the Minister can confirm it to us on the record of the House, I understand that central to the events in Anglo Irish Bank is that one particular group &mdash; the Quinn Group, including Se&aacute;n Quinn, members of his family and members of the group of companies &mdash; attempted to buy approximately a quarter of the bank through contracts for difference.  That attempt to buy a quarter of the bank was an extraordinary event about which our regulatory system made no comment.  In the annals of capitalism and speculation that was an extraordinary event.  That then morphed into an acquisition of 15% of the shares in the company, sustained in part by transfers from an insurance company owned by that group of companies, which employs many thousands of people and has had a highly successful diversified business history here.  Nobody in the regulatory system made any reference to any of these issues.  The Minister today made no reference to them except in the vaguest way to the actions of the former chief executive and former chairman of the bank.</P>
        <P>I felt sorry for the shareholders gathered in the Mansion House last week, many of whom had invested their pensions in the bank.  Self-employed people, including car mechanics, doctors and solicitors, got a considerable amount of advice, particularly from former Deputy McCreevy in telling people to look after their pension funds, that one of the safer places to invest a pension was in a bank.  I felt very sorry for those people.  I accept they took the risk and we know about risk.  Let us get real.  These are Irish people.  We know many of the investors are foreign and many are institutions.  Let us not forget that there are many smaller investors who <Col N="42"/>are much poorer as a consequence of what has happened in the banks.  It would be wrong to have this debate &mdash; even in the short time available &mdash; without some reference to them.</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach seeks to remind the Labour Party to be careful and watch its mouth regarding loose talk, I was probably the first person in the House to talk about toxic debt, toxic loans, contracts for difference and turning the Irish Stock Exchange into a gambling casino.  That policy was facilitated in respect of Anglo Irish Bank because it was the darling child of the Celtic tiger.  Once upon a time &mdash; not very long ago &mdash; in this country we had a man called &ldquo;Ansbacher man&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Ansbacher man&rdquo; seems to have had a son called &ldquo;Anglo man&rdquo;, and the principal and first son of &ldquo;Anglo man&rdquo; is Mr. &ldquo;Se&aacute;nie&rdquo; FitzPatrick.  It is interesting that the former Taoiseach never talked about Mr. FitzPatrick, but he used that personal name that we read in the writings of people like Padraig Pearse &mdash; not just &ldquo;Se&aacute;n&rdquo; but &ldquo;Se&aacute;nie&rdquo;.  It is cultural.  It indicates the closeness and togetherness of the family &mdash; the family of party, of business, of country.  Those who are not in the family may be critical, but we need to keep our mouths shut tight because we might damage this national family of Seanie and his friends, as described by Deputy Ahern.  Will we ever get an explanation of what happened in this bank with regard to the extraordinary attempt to acquire a quarter of the bank through contracts for difference, which morphed into a 15% shareholding?  Will we get an explanation for the fact that Mr. FitzPatrick, over a period of eight years, was able to warehouse his loans as a director of the bank &mdash; running from &euro;87 million to more than &euro;120 million &mdash; with Irish Nationwide Building Society, which was also one of the covered institutions?  Reputation is everything in banking.</P>
        <P>I am sorry that the actions of this Government &mdash; the four or five attempts to come to grips with these incredibly challenging events &mdash; have failed.  I do not deny these are challenging events.  I do not think the Taoiseach is responsible for them all and I do not think he created the international situation.  Nobody is blaming him for that.  However, the Taoiseach and Fianna F&aacute;il carry a unique responsibility for the property bubble that they blew out of all proportion long after some of the more intelligent, sensible and honest people in the party were privately telling us it was too far, too fast, too much.  In September, when I pointed out difficulties with the bank guarantee scheme, various people in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party accused me of not wearing the green jersey.  For God&rsquo;s sake, can we get real?  We must have a proper debate about protecting the key elements of our economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;our flow of credit and the jobs in this country.  That is what this is about.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister satisfied that those in his Department are able to advise him properly on this?  They managed to get almost all the forecasts wrong when the economy was doing well, and got them even more disastrously wrong when it was not doing well.  The people in the Department of Finance have many fine qualities and they are probably reasonably good administrators.  However, are they good at the business of managing a banking crisis and being the Minister&rsquo;s main advisers?  With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s strategy, why is he relying almost exclusively on those in the Department of Finance, many of whom are essentially administrators?  I do not know how many bankers or accountants work in the Department of Finance, although I know some economists work there.  However, we do not hear from that side of the Department.  If we are to restore Ireland&rsquo;s credibility and reputation, we need to put a line under what has happened.  We need to be able to say we are moving into a new era and from now on we are going to manage our banks well.  We have a very strong record in the National Treasury Management Agency of good management of the national debt.  We took that function from the Department of Finance a long time ago in order to better manage the debt.  Does <Col N="43"/>the Minister have any ideas about how to improve his command and control and the advice he is receiving in these incredibly difficult times?  This is not just for the Government but for the businesses that are at risk and the people who fear losing their jobs, or have lost them already, and who want some hope.</P>
        <P>Almost everybody in this Chamber has been impressed by the bipartisan approach operating in the United States Congress, although it can be shambolic at times.  However, the critical thing about such an approach is that one can actually get information.  The Minister stood up to make a statement about nationalising a bank.  On 30 September, his officials sent me the accounts of Anglo Irish Bank.  I thank them for this.  They also sent me a note on the breakdown in depositor numbers, for which I am eternally grateful.  Those are the first figures I got.  My background is as an accountant, and I find it astonishing that as a national Parliament we make a decision with no financial information.  The Minister reads out a list in a rapid speech.  I want to know how good the loans are, how many of them are at risk, and what is the Minister&rsquo;s evaluation of risk.</P>
        <P>Let us suppose, for example, that a developer was buying ten acres in Longford to build 100 houses.  The developer has bought the land for &euro;10 million with no planning permission &mdash; it is a speculative development &mdash; putting in &euro;2 million himself and borrowing &euro;8 million from the bank.  Who will now build the houses in that field?  Similar fields exist on the edge of every town in Ireland.  Who will build houses in them for the next ten to 20 years?  International investors want to know that the Minister has a handle on this situation.  Is that field in Longford, or in west Dublin, still worth &euro;10 million?  If it is now worth &euro;8 million, which is the total loaned by the bank, that is fine, as the only thing that happens is that the developer is down &euro;2 million.  However, what if it is not even worth &euro;8 million?  Maybe it is not even worth &euro;2 million, because nobody is going to develop that field for many years.  That is the fundamental question that international investors &mdash; who are often themselves small, medium or large business people &mdash; would ask.  With a bipartisan approach, I would have the opportunity to ask such questions, and my colleagues in the Opposition parties &mdash; and, I dare say, some of the Minister&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, who are solid business people &mdash; would also wish to ask them.</P>
        <P>If it is necessary to provide some of this information to us in private, well and good.  We can set out rules for that.  However, it is crazy that we are being asked to spend only five hours debating a Bill.  We know about the fundamental problems in this bank and we need answers about the contracts for difference and the build-up of the stake.  We need to know what exactly the loan book is like.  We know much of it is dependent on or related to construction and we are told some of it is supported by rent rolls.  However, we need answers to those questions.  If the Taoiseach feels disappointed that the Opposition Members are rather cynical and doubtful, the solution lies in the Minister&rsquo;s hands.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has just come back from Japan.  He spent a week there and it must have been the worst foreign trip experienced by anybody.  From Japan the Taoiseach suggested that it should be business as usual for the banks.  Did he not know that business as usual for the Japanese banks condemned the zombie banks of Japan, and Japan itself, to ten years as a zombie economy?  What we want from the Minister today is a strategy, not just for Anglo Irish Bank but for all the big banks, which will allow us to save our economy, sustain employment and keep business going.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to move an amendment regarding the Second Reading. This debate is occurring in the middle of what is surely the most serious economic and financial crisis in the decades of modern Ireland.  There is no need to have a tutorial on it here but it is very difficult to envisage a situation that could be more serious and for that reason we have to try to rebuild our economy.  We all know that we are not going to rebuild the economy unless <Col N="44"/>we can stabilise the banks and get credit flowing again.  This is the reason our banking system is so critical.</P>
        <P>People outside this House who are outraged at what they have seen happening at the top of the banks and at the misbehaviour, if not worse, that we have all read about are fearful of losing their jobs, fearful for their pensions being damaged and, in some cases, fearful of losing their homes and they want to know what in the name of God is causing the Government to put taxpayers&rsquo; money into the banks.  We have to answer that question because it is precisely to maintain jobs and equilibrium in the economy that normal credit lines must be restored in the banks.  For that reason, this debate deserves the full attention of this House for as long as it takes to answer the questions that require to be answered.  The intolerance that has been evident on the part of the Government, and on the part of the Ministers who have fronted for the Government, is entirely inappropriate.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the critical issue from which all of this arises, the situation on 29 September 2008 and the blanket guarantee.  Ministers and their spinners are whispering about the position taken up by the Labour Party.  The Labour Party took up the position we did for the reasons that are dealt with at some length in the debates since this crisis arose.  There are two reasons.  First, we again had a rushed piece of legislation and the law of unintended consequences followed; we were not given the necessary information and there was not the transparency that was required in such a debate.  Second, we did not necessarily take the view that every bank was of equal importance to the Irish economy.  We may well be persuaded of that, but so far I have not been persuaded that every bank is of systemic importance in the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I did not have a copy of his script at the time but I noted the Minister reached for a page to deal with this question.  The information is not in his script.  He quoted some figures but these figures do not change my view.  Anglo Irish Bank is one branch with three or four offices.  It is not engaged in retail banking.  It does not have offices on the high street.  It is not part of the essential money transmission system and is not part of credit lines to small and medium enterprises.  It is a specialist bank funded by its corporate depositors and funded from the inter-bank market.  This is a distinctly different cup of tea than the clearing house banks which are essential to this economy, to maintaining jobs and prosperity in it.  However, on 29 September 2008, the Minister went ahead and we had no real opportunity to consider whether Anglo Irish Bank ought to have been included in that blanket guarantee that bet the future prosperity of this country on the banking system.  We did not have that opportunity, but the Minister went ahead and included the bank.</P>
        <P>I heard the remarks made by the Minister and I wish to read them into the record.  The Minister has a gifted bedside manner and unlike some of his crabbier colleagues, he has a very pleasant manner.  However, when he denounces Morgan Kelly&rsquo;s latest contribution in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish</i> <i>Times</i>, I would like to hear more detail.  I would be very surprised if the Department of Finance did not have more than one strategy on 29 September and if it did not, then it should have.  It should have anticipated what was coming down the track and I am sure it did.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know that but the reason we are dealing with the Bill before the House is because of the measure the Minister took on 29 September.  The alternative facing <Col N="45"/>the taxpayers now is that the bank faced insolvency, the guarantee would be invoked and that, as a result, Irish taxpayers would have to come up with somewhere between &euro;30 billion to &euro;40 billion.  In that circumstance, this is the reason the Bill to nationalise the bank is before the House.  The Minister has asked the House to trust him and to trust him also when he changes his mind.  During the recapitalisation debate in December, I asked the Minister whether he intended to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank that weekend and what were the implications of such a decision for the two big banks.  The Minister did not answer that question but when the question was put to him outside the House, he stated: &ldquo;Were we to go from the last step before nationalisation to nationalisation itself, the taxpayer will be taking an awful risk with no return.&rdquo;  The Minister has now taken that step and in his honeyed way he has conveyed that the &euro;1.5 billion which was intended to be used to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank is now being saved and that we are very fortunate.  The Minister did not tell the House yet what is the cost.  He has the PwC report.  What is the likely cost of the step he is now taking?  What is the likely cost to taxpayers of the nationalisation situation?  These are reasonable and fair questions for us to ask and we have not been given answers yet.  Why are we not being given even an expurgated version of the PwC report?</P>
        <P>With regard to auditors, there has not been a scandal in this country since Goodman in which auditors have not been pivotally involved.  I sat across the table for seven weeks in the DIRT inquiry from the big five auditing companies and each one of them allowed what happened in the DIRT scandal to happen.  They have signed off on the Goodman affair and others and, unfortunately, the House did not take action it ought to have taken in terms of the conduct of accountants and auditors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister seems to be saying that the Labour Party was somehow less than measured in raising these critical questions.  We have been very careful and the only remark I recall that did damage &mdash; I greatly regret it &mdash; to our reputation and our international standing, was the unfortunate remark made last week, not by the Labour Party and for which the Taoiseach carries no blame.  The Taoiseach had nothing to do with it.  The remark was regrettably made in another context and it has been damaging but other than that, the questions that we are raising need to be raised.  If there is to be any real accountability, we need to know the answers to these questions.  The Minister is now asking us again because he has changed his mind.  He has gone now from recapitalisation to nationalisation and some of what we need to know about the operation of this bank we do not know.  This is not a typical bank.  The Minister had the option on 29 September not to include this bank and this is the significance and relevance of me raising that issue in this debate this evening.  I greatly regret that we do not have adequate time to discuss this Bill in the way that it deserves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s concern that there is not enough time to debate this Bill, a scandal in itself.</P>
        <P>I reaffirm Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment to a State-owned bank, long a demand of the party&rsquo;s.  We support public ownership of a major banking institution.  This Bill is not, however, nationalisation in the public interest.  It is simply a bail out for the former patrons of the now defunct Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Galway Races.</P>
        <P>The bank guarantee scheme was described by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, at the time as &ldquo;the cheapest bail out in the world&rdquo;.  With this Bill the taxpayer is now set to take on a &euro;73 billion loan book, on top of the &euro;10 billion botched recapitalisation plan and the &euro;440 billion guarantee scheme, without being given any information as to what it is all about.  What is the real size of the risk to the taxpayer?</P>
        <P>This crisis was made in Ireland.  It was created by the corrupt culture endemic in our financial system and encouraged by successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments out of their love affair with greedy property developers.  That is what everyone believes to be the case.  The revelations about the hidden loans made by Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and others have exposed the systemic fraud in Irish banking.  It has shown that senior bank managers and their auditors cannot be trusted, that our officials in the Financial Regulator are incompetent and that the Government&rsquo;s banking policy is an abysmal failure.</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank is Ireland&rsquo;s Enron, but unlike the United States there will be no criminal investigation and no one will be brought to justice.  It beggars belief that Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, who has embezzled or otherwise done away with in excess of &euro;80 million, will walk away scot free while a working class man in the Louth constituency spent time in Mountjoy Prison for having no dog licence.  It was not the Hound of Ulster he had but a small household pet.  He was, of course, a working class man living in a working class area.  Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, on the other hand, is still free to jet around the world and do as he wishes.  If there is no law in place to deal with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and his activities, that itself is a significant failure of this House.  It is a failure that needs to be quickly amended.</P>
        <P>In handling this crisis, the Government is simply making it up as it goes along.  Four weeks ago, the Government stated any nationalisation would be affirming that we have no confidence in the bank as a bank to survive.  Now, it says it will be &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; when it nationalises Anglo Irish Bank.  The last thing anyone on this island wants is Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s business as usual.  We want a proper State bank that will ensure finance streams to small and medium-<Col N="47"/>sized enterprises, secure people&rsquo;s homes and help to build our way out of this economic crisis, largely created by failed Government policies.</P>

	<P>On a point of order.  Deputy Burton had submitted an amendment for Committee Stage, the purpose of which was to require the appointment of an inspector to examine the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank.  While Deputy Burton was making her contribution, I was informed by the Bills Office that the amendment was out of order for Committee Stage as it was considered to be outside the scope of the Bill.  The only way, therefore, in which we could have this amendment considered is by way of reasoned amendment on Second Stage.  That is the amendment moved by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, this procedure was forced on us because of the truncated nature of the debate today.  It had been our intention to proceed from Second Stage to Committee Stage without division.  Unfortunately, the way in which business is being conducted leaves us with no option but to table our Committee Stage amendment as an amendment to Second Stage.  By way of courtesy to Members, I wanted to explain why this amendment was circulated in the past few minutes.  It is not the Labour Party&rsquo;s fault but simply due to the ruling out of order of a Committee Stage amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot rule on that.  I have been advised it will be dealt with by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to set out the deep roots of this real crisis.  It is a crisis in our banking system which started several decades ago when it moved from being a system that tended to lend short against short-term deposits.  It moved into the mortgage business which was using short-term deposits paying for long-term loans.  It became even worse when banks, collectively, moved towards a system where managers and staff were given quarterly and monthly targets to reach in selling products and issuing loans.  One cannot assess risk and allocate capital on such a targeted base.</P>
        <P>It became particularly flawed in the likes of the model adopted by Anglo Irish Bank.  As Deputy Bruton said, short-term funding from outside of the State was paying for very long-term property developments.  We have had a systematic failure in the systems of corporate governance, regulation, auditing and, yes, in public policy which for many years saw bricks and mortar in the property bubble as real progress in our State when it was not.  While it may have been an important supply of shelter to people, it was not wealth generation as so many public policy decisions seemed to believe.</P>
        <P>There was a fundamental reality behind the Government&rsquo;s approach.  Such is the interconnection between our banks with shared customers, there were only three options open to the Government.  One was to provide a guarantee, as was done in September.  The other was to proceed with nationalisation, which is being done today as it is seen as necessary.  The third option &mdash; that of letting a bank collapse &mdash; would have forced the other stable banks to call in their loans, like a fire sale in a burst property market bubble, which would have systematically threatened them.  It is that simple reality that was behind the decision on the guarantee in September and today&rsquo;s decision.</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P>The capitalisation issue was complex but it was better to have considered it over recent months.  The UK Government made the mistake of rushing in with a capitalisation programme which yesterday had to be completely reconfigured.  It was better to take our time and consider the PricewaterhouseCoopers, Jones Lang LaSalle and other reports.</P>

	<P>How much would it have cost?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was important and appropriate for us on an ongoing basis to take into account the evolving corporate governance issues in this institution, Anglo Irish Bank, the evolving market assessment and the advice of the National Treasury Management Agency and other regulatory bodies in taking the nationalisation step.</P>
        <P>We need, more than anything else, to bring confidence to our banking system.  To do that, we will need not just this legislation but additional legislation from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to strengthen corporate governance rules that our regulators can apply.  That failure cannot be allowed to continue.  We need hard-nosed regulation for Anglo Irish Bank and any other bank where there has been improper corporate governance.  This will require strengthened legislation which will accompany this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We have the likes of Alan Dukes and other directors on the banks&rsquo; boards to represent this House&rsquo;s and the nation&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton is correct that the international markets have got our banks and our country wrong.  As deep and as fearful as the crisis is, we will have the opportunity and ability to get out of it because we are an enterprising and capable people.  We will gain from this.  We will move away from the obsession with property prices in which young people were condemned to spend their lives working to pay off a mortgage for a stupid bank.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Deputy Rabbitte for giving me the opportunity to deal with the material that appeared on page 14 of <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  I referred to it cursorily in opening the debate on Second Stage.  The article suggested that on 29 September, when the Government decided to extend the bank guarantee to six financial institutions, a Bill was in existence to rescue only four institutions and that the sudden liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank was contemplated by the Government.  That is simply untrue.  The only legislation before the Taoiseach and I on that evening &mdash; the members of the Government were consulted incorporeally &mdash; was a Bill which, in all material terms, is the same as the Bill before the House today.  The only decision the Government had to take was whether we would proceed to guarantee all six institutions or whether we could contemplate the nationalisation of this institution, as we are doing, and guarantee the rest of them.  We took advice on this matter and had a discussion with the Governor of the Central Bank, the regulatory authority and the officials of my Department.  There was a balance in the argument, as there is in all arguments, and the balance of the argument and the unanimous view of all those who advised us was to extend the guarantee at that stage.  The reason we decided to do so was the grave shortage of liquidity in the Irish banking system at the time.  A decision to nationalise <Col N="49"/>one institution could have caused a systemic run on all other institutions.  That was the decision taken, which I subsequently explained in the House and in public comments.</P>
        <P>One of the issues that arose in the context of this legislation was whether there should be a ceiling on the withdrawal of deposits above and beyond what a bank had obtained by way of security.  That provision was in the original legislation, the Bill from last September, because of the chaotic conditions that obtained last September and the need to take such precautionary measures.  The provision was kept in the Bill as it was submitted and circulated to members last Friday but the precaution was unnecessary.  The best commercial and legal advice we got was that it should not be included in the legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputies will understand, given the conditions that obtained in late September, the necessity to include such a provision.  Deputies will say that legislation in haste is always dangerous.  While I accept that the House must deal with this speedily, the legislation has been under preparation for a considerable period and has been gone through on many occasions by officials at my Department.  While I accept that we are legislating in haste, I assure the House that the legislation has not been prepared in haste.  Members will appreciate that the existence of legislation of this character cannot be disclosed to the public without raising concerns about financial institutions.  Since September, there has never been an opportune time for me to arrive in the House and propose a nationalisation Bill that we should enact as a precautionary measure.  In current banking conditions it would not be wise for me to invite the House in the abstract to provide for a Bill that granted me power to nationalise a bank at any time I saw fit.</P>
        <P>The Danish authorities studied our guarantee scheme and were impressed by it.  The Danish finance Minister introduced legislation a few weeks afterwards providing for a guarantee but also providing for the option of nationalisation.  It is not correct to say that Government policy is incoherent but I am glad Deputy Rabbitte asked the question.  It has given me the opportunity to deal with this particular item, which caused me considerable distress.  The suggestion that I did not take the advice of my officials is untrue.  This is linked to a later suggestion that the bank existed purely as a vehicle for property speculators who are of systemic importance to my party.  I was never in the tent at the Galway races and never visited the Galway races, nor did I receive representations from developers or bankers about this particular financial institution.  I can assure the House that I have worked extremely hard on this matter since late August to ensure the stability of our financial system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for the constructive comments made in respect of this Bill.  Deputy Bruton raised the question of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the article correct in regard to the insurance for bondholders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am turning to that point now, which was implicitly raised by Deputy Bruton.  Bondholders are not exclusive to Anglo Irish Bank.  Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland have substantial numbers of bondholders as well.  The position of bondholders is that there is no extension of the guarantee to them under this legislation.  This legislation nationalises the shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank.  This includes ordinary and preference shares.  Bondholders are debt.</P>
        <P>At the time of the guarantee it was agreed that not all debt should be guaranteed so there is a share of unguaranteed debt that is not share capital.  Such unguaranteed debt in respect of Anglo Irish Bank debt remains where it has been in the bank to date.  In other words, the bank has the normal obligations that any bank has with regard to such bondholders.  To send any other signal in this legislation would undermine our reputation and our creditworthiness as a <Col N="50"/>country because similar bonds and securities are held by other financial institutions.  The legislation provides that the bank, like any other bank, should perform its obligations in respect of those bonds.  That does not mean the bonds have a guarantee.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton is envisaging a winding up of the bank.  That is the motivation presupposed by his question.  In other words, what will be the position of bondholders in the event there is an insufficiency of assets in the bank to meet them at the conclusion of the bank&rsquo;s operations?  I am not contemplating that possibility in this legislation.  What is envisaged in this legislation is that the bank is a going concern.  In opening this debate, I stated that commercial entities can either function as going concerns or as liquidated entities.  I am not announcing a liquidation in this House, I am providing for the continuance of this operation as a going concern.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In opening this debate, I outlined in great detail the position with regard to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  My difficulty is that much of the information in the report is commercially sensitive.  Deputy Burton made a good point on whether we can share some information on a confidential basis regarding the exposure of the Irish banking situation.  It was suggested that the figure of &euro;10 billion required for capitalisation, which is not a figure at risk, would guarantee the fundamentals of the banks in regard to their capital position.  That figure was not arrived at lightly.  While there are difficulties in disclosing confidential personal information to Members, I am interested in sharing the broad outlines of the report with the financial spokespersons of the other parties.  The question of the security of our system and the reputational value of the system has been damaged by revelations in recent weeks.  There is no doubt, as pointed out by Deputy Burton and I made no secret of it in opening the debate, that the position of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland is fundamentally good.  We are not supposed to disagree with market assessments but I do not agree with the market assessment that has been taken of these institutions in light of the information placed at my disposal in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, line 24, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on behalf of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns the issue of accountability.  I am trying to ensure the Oireachtas has a substantial say in the operation and in any major decisions, particularly at a policy level, of this new bank we will shortly own.  The history of banking in recent times demonstrates clearly that there is a need for such oversight of, and diligence in regard to, what is going on.</P>
        <P>This morning in the Mansion House we heard many fine speeches, almost all of which referred to accountability, transparency and the open nature of the first meeting of the first D&aacute;il on 21 January 1919.  This is an excellent opportunity to deliver on those fine words and to bring that level of accountability and scrutiny to the Oireachtas.  I hope the Minister will see fit to do so.</P>
        <P>There are examples of institutions established by the Oireachtas but which are not accountable to it.  The Health Service Executive is a perfect example.  It does not have a shred of accountability to this House, the Minister for Health and Children or anybody else.  That is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>We want to ensure there is a strong corporate policy in place to ensure a finance stream to small and medium-sized indigenous enterprises and that the credit crunch these businesses are currently experiencing is ended.  I also mention those whose homes may be under threat, <Col N="53"/>although not in the case of this institution.  The bank must follow the policy course we all want it to which is to deal with issues such as mortgages and the funding of small businesses.</P>
        <P>To facilitate debate, I will conclude by saying that my amendment represents an opportunity for the Oireachtas to have a scrutiny role in the policy-making decisions of this bank, which is only appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking to amendment No. 1.  I support this sensible amendment because it focuses on the issue of accountability, which is required in the legislation as a priority.  The public and taxpayers demand that type of accountability in respect of this debate.  It is such a serious issue we must all be responsible but we must also reflect the views of the people who elected us to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The points developed by Deputy Morgan are very relevant to the debate this morning in the Mansion House to celebrate the anniversary of the First D&aacute;il.  That First D&aacute;il was led by men and women of great vision and courage and they would want us to ensure we have accountability, transparency and a system in place that protects the interests of the people and taxpayers.</P>
        <P>I was extremely disappointed that not one Independent TD or Senator was allowed to address the debate on the anniversary of the First D&aacute;il.  This was a sad day for this country.  It was also sad that the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and MLAs from the Northern Ireland Assembly were not allowed to participate.  In talking about honouring the men and women of the First D&aacute;il we should have considered that.  The only reason I attended this morning was to honour the men and women of the First D&aacute;il but I was extremely disappointed and saddened by some of the procedures.</P>
        <P>On the amendment and regarding the broader issue, I accept the serious position the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is in.  I will support the legislation because it is in the national interest.  It is important people look at the issue in a clear and objective way and decide what is the right thing to do for our country.</P>
        <P>The Minister said earlier that Anglo Irish Bank had a balance sheet in excess of &euro;100 billion but he also made the important point, on which I agree with him, that we should focus on the customers who are providing funds for employment in areas such as retail, office, leisure, health care, tourism and other services.  I would also like to reflect and support the views of the many staff members who contacted me and asked me to do the right thing.  They are concerned and annoyed about much of what went on in the bank but they want us to make the right decision to protect the interests of the company, the country and the people associated with this bank.  I strongly support the amendment because it focuses on accountability and it is common sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Morgan proposes that the nominee should be approved by and take directions from the Oireachtas.  The nominee is a person to whom the Minister, in effect, delegates his shareholding.  The nominee could be the National Treasury Management Agency or a vehicle established for the management of the company and clearly it is inappropriate that the Minister&rsquo;s nominee should be appointed by the Oireachtas because the nominee&rsquo;s line of accountability would be with the Minister in respect of the shareholding the Minister has.  The nominee is stepping into the shoes and acting on behalf of the Minister and I would then become accountable to the Oireachtas for my actions and the actions of a nominee were I to have one.  That is the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that.  Nobody is asking that the Oireachtas would have a role in the day to day operation of the bank.  That is not the case.  I cite again the example of the Health Service Executive, which is allowed to do more or less what it likes, and <Col N="54"/>it suits the Government politically to distance itself from some of the madness that is going on.  In regard to the HSE, I need not outline to Members of this House the catastrophic position in accident and emergency departments over the Christmas period and early in the new year.  I do not want to see another financial institution on that model.  There is a reasonable case to be made for an Oireachtas input at policy level and I ask the Minister to reconsider that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot add much to the fact that under the legislation the Minister acquires the share and were there to be a nominee, the nominee would be standing in the shoes of the Minister.  We do not govern the company through a committee, and it is important we keep the various arm&rsquo;s length aspects of these transactions in place.</P>

        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) its affairs have been conducted with intent to defraud its creditors or the creditors of any other person or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose or in an unlawful manner or in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to some part of its members, or that any actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) was so prejudicial;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) persons connected with the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards it or towards its members;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>c</i>) that its members have not been given all the information relating to its affairs which they might reasonably expect; or</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>d</i>) such additional grounds as the Minister specifies in his or her application to the High Court.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(2) For the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister has all such powers as are necessary to enable him or her to apply to the High Court for an order of the kind referred to in that subsection and the High Court shall hear and determine that application as if the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, in respect of applications concerning Anglo Irish Bank, vested those powers concurrently in the Minister and in the Director of Corporate Enforcement, so as to be capable of being exercised by either of them.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(3) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister is not required to make an application under that subsection if he notifies both Houses of the Oireachtas that the Director of Corporate Enforcement has applied to the High Court for an order under the Companies Acts for the appointment of one or more inspectors to investigate the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to provide and make provision for the appointment of an inspector to examine the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank.  The Minister said there is some kind of investigation by the regulator going on into various matters regarding Anglo Irish Bank but the regulatory system as it applies to Anglo Irish Bank has failed because the regulator has been unable to answer and give confidence to the market that serious issues which pertain to Anglo Irish Bank have been addressed.</P>
        <P>There are two issues in particular to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister.  The first of the two serious events regarding Anglo Irish Bank which are in the public domain is the affair of the loans of the former managing director and chief executive officer, Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, subsequently the chairman of the bank.  We all know the sad story.  Apparently over an eight year period he warehoused his loans in another Irish institution, which the Minister also guaranteed, namely, Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The figure was not small.  These were loans that ranged between &euro;87 million and over &euro;120 million during the eight year period.</P>
        <P>First year accountancy or auditing students are introduced to the way directors can manipulate accounts and the key way directors can manipulate accounts is to move transactions off the balance sheet at the year end date.  That is the reason, in regard to Enron, people became very familiar with the notion of off-balance sheet items either in the jurisdiction or offshore.  Essentially, a few days later they go back on the balance sheet.  That is a fundamental way of misrepresenting the true and fair view in accounts and I cannot understand why this event is not subject to prosecution under the Companies Act.  It seems to me that there is a desire to protect the person involved in this in order to protect Anglo Irish Bank and the larger banking system.  Even if the Minister believes that is a noble and reasonable objective, it is a wrong objective because we will only restore our international financial credibility when we are seen to have put a line under this type of event.</P>
        <P>Why was the director of this bank getting loans of this amount?  That is a serious issue and that is the reason we need an inspector.  A regulator is not good enough.  It must be remembered that in the case of National Irish Bank an inspector was appointed while the bank continued to trade normally.  In fact, the entire culture of the bank was changed and the matters addressed.</P>
        <P>This is not a tribunal.  This is an inspector but the inspector would have the power of the courts.  It would take some period of time but it would send a message to investors internationally that we were addressing whatever has gone wrong in this bank, that there is no hiding place for unacceptable practices and that we were rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s credibility.</P>
        <P>During the period I was in Government from 1992 to 1997, first with Fianna F&aacute;il and then with the rainbow coalition of Fine Gael and the then Democratic Left, the Labour Party went into Government at a time when the fortunes of the Irish economy were very low.  Everybody in Government worked very hard in that period to build Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  Unfortunately, the succession of banking affairs, particularly the events in Anglo Irish Bank, has done unbelievable damage to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  It is very difficult to recover from a damaged reputation.  I cannot understand why the Minister has faith in the regulator and the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  These issues are much bigger than those officers.</P>
        <P>I referred to the second issue previously.  There was an astonishing financial event which started perhaps a year ago where an individual sought to acquire 25% of the share capital of the bank &mdash; it was the Quinn family or Quinn associates or the Quinn group or Mr. Se&aacute;n Quinn.  I do not know how to describe it properly but that is how it has been described in various statements and by the regulator.  Apparently, they initially sought to acquire 25% of the share capital in the third largest bank in the country by means of contracts for difference, CFDs, which is basically a form of stock market gambling.  In April 2006, I raised this issue in <Col N="56"/>the House and published statements stating that turning the Irish Stock Exchange into a casino for CFDs was crazy.</P>
        <P>Not only did the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, allow that to happen but he had a proposal to tax CFD transactions on the stock exchange to the tune of 1%.  However, he withdrew it because he was lobbied by the banks and stockbrokers.  It was a Gordon Gekko time, when &ldquo;Greed is good&rdquo; prevailed.  The Irish Stock Exchange was to be a casino; we do not have casinos in Ireland so the attitude was, &ldquo;let us make our stock exchange one&rdquo;.  It was crazy, and the system of regulation utterly failed.  Bear in mind that an ordinary investor who buys shares, be it a pension fund, a fund manager or a single individual, pays stamp duty on those shares.  In fact, the investor who was buying with a longer perspective was obliged to pay a tax while the CFD dealer did not have to pay anything.  This Government actually incentivised this crazy behaviour.  There are products in the worldwide financial markets that people do not have a description of and which are not regulated, but we broadly know what CFDs do.</P>
        <P>In this case, the bet on the CFDs appears to have gone wrong.  Instead of the share price rising, it fell.  We have heard suggestions of very large exposures and losses by that particular group in the context of the share prices.  The regulator then issued a statement about a fine being imposed with regard to a sum of more than &euro;200 million that was transferred from the insurance company in the Quinn group to the Quinn family interest &mdash; again, I do not know if I am describing them properly &mdash; to support the CFD gamble that had gone wrong.  An insurance company is almost a bank.  When one buys insurance, one pays in advance and hopes that on the rainy day the insurance company will pay out.  An insurance company is a cash cow.  It is full of the cash customers pay in advance to ensure that if there is an accident with the car, they can claim from their insurance.  It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that insurance companies are regulated in a rather conservative way and that they maintain large cash balances.</P>
        <P>Deputy Barrett is in the Chamber.  I recall when the Bill to establish the Financial Regulator and IFSRA was being discussed.  It was thought that the Financial Regulator would come down like a ton of bricks on insurance brokers because it was believed they should be regulated as tightly as possible.  Many changes were made and many of them have cost individual brokers a great deal of money.  In the long term, they are probably worthwhile but they caused much pain.  However, in this case an insurance company was removing large wads of money and putting them into a family company to shore up purchases on CFDs.  That is absolute lunacy.</P>
        <P>Before Christmas I sought a meeting with the regulator and his staff.  I met the regulator, who was accompanied by various important people in the regulator&rsquo;s office.  I asked him about the Quinn affair.  He effectively challenged me to prove what had happened in that affair.  The public papers had contained an announcement that the Quinn family had built up a stake of 15% in Anglo Irish Bank through this rather unusual method.  Normally in a publicly quoted company, particularly a bank, if a shareholding goes above 5%, it is supposed to be notified.  However, the regulator challenged me to prove how those holdings were held.  How could I possibly do that?  That is the job of the regulator.</P>
        <P>In this case, he was regulating Anglo Irish Bank on the one hand, in which a 15% holding had been built up but in ways that did not have to be advised, while on the other he had fined the other entity he regulated, the insurance company, several million euro.  It was the largest fine ever imposed by the regulator.  However, he could not helicopter his view over the two and say what was wrong with the insurance company putting money into funding share acquisitions in the bank in a particular manner.  Talk about Chinese walls &mdash; the man had a Chinese wall running down the middle of his brain, so that what he knew from the insurance company <Col N="57"/>could not transfer over.  It is no wonder the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick loan affair got locked behind some other Chinese wall for seven or eight months.</P>
        <P>We want to restore probity.  In capitalism, the big sin is to undermine the freedom of the market.  If one finds a way of doing things that essentially interferes in the freedom of the market, it is a big sin.  What else did this extraordinary arrangement do?  It sent a terrible message about this country.  What happens when the Minister does not share information with the Opposition to some degree, on a bipartisan basis, leaving personal details out of it, which I support?  Many people work as clerks in these companies.  The regulator pops around and there are people working in the bank and in the insurance company.  They are all sending out different versions of what really happened.  Those versions get picked up and end up on the media and, of course, Ireland&rsquo;s reputation gets trashed.  What type of country has that system of regulation?</P>
        <P>I subsequently wrote to the Minister and enclosed a copy of a letter I sent to the regulator after my meeting with him.  It stated that I was deeply dissatisfied with the explanation he had given me about the Quinn affair.  The only reason I am interested in that is that it comes up for mention time and again in international magazines and so forth.</P>
        <P>We are offering the Minister a mechanism in the amendment whereby he can put in an inspector to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.  My fear as an auditor is one the markets work with as well.  When one encounters the non-disclosure of loans by the senior chief executive and subsequent chairman over an eight year period where the loans are warehoused, that sets alarm bells ringing.  What happened in the Quinn affair should have set every alarm bell off.  The next question one asks is: &ldquo;If this was happening at a very senior level in the bank, what does it mean?&rdquo;  At any stage with any of those loans, either the director, Mr. FitzPatrick&rsquo;s, loans or the Quinn group transactions, were any of the counter-party transactions to do with supporting the purchase of shares in the bank?  That is another big sin.  These are the questions the international markets have been asking.</P>
        <P>This amendment offers the Minister a mechanism to have an inspector appointed without preventing the bank from continuing its operations under its new business plan as envisaged by the Minister.  It would, however, get to the bottom of the issue and stop the rumours.  The inspector would also have the authority of the court to examine other issues relating to the manner in which the loan business of the company was conducted and whether foolish and risky preferential treatment was given in connection with these loans.  I am aware of the reputation of Anglo Irish Bank for keeping records and so forth.</P>
        <P>Many bright young people joined Anglo Irish Bank in recent years.  In the past decade, rather than encouraging young people to become engineers, we encouraged them to become financial engineers.  Many of these bright, hard-working people ended up in Anglo Irish Bank.  Given that much of their pay was made in shares, their rewards have also gone down the Swanee.  We need to draw a clear, blue line under this issue and state that the disgraceful practices which took place at Anglo Irish Bank must be sorted out and explained.</P>
        <P>Many of the shareholders who attended the meeting held in the Mansion House last week were elderly people who had invested their pensions.  While they may not get their money back, they are entitled to an explanation.  The advice they received was that there was nowhere safer to put their money and they should be patriotic and invest in an Irish bank.  I feel sorry for these people.</P>
        <P>On the affair regarding directors&rsquo; loans, in most jurisdictions the practice in which Mr. FitzPatrick engaged is a five letter word, namely, fraud.  First year auditing classes are taught about moving sums off the balance sheet and parking them somewhere.  In this case, a sum of &euro;87 million was moved into another financial institution.  Unless the loans in question were <Col N="58"/>disguised through the use of other names, a number of people in the bank must have known about them.  If they were in the name of the director, members of the loan committee, credit committee and board of directors as well as senior executives in the key management group should have been aware of them.</P>
        <P>Even in Anglo Irish Bank at the height of the Celtic tiger, the amounts involved &mdash; between &euro;87 million and &euro;120 million &mdash; were significant and would not have escaped scrutiny.  This gives rise to fundamental questions.  Was Anglo Irish Bank facilitating people on the inside track?  What about the loans to other directors?  It was suggested in media reports at the weekend that directors&rsquo; loans may have averaged &euro;10 million.  It is possible that only one or two directors received much larger loans.  In any case, the markets need to have this information.  Traditionally, bank directors received loans to buy a larger house rather than to trade.  They certainly should not receive loans in any way connected to the acquisition or disposal of shares in their bank.  This should not have happened, if it did happen, and the mechanism of the inspector will offer the Government a vehicle to clear up the matter.</P>
        <P>We heard from Deputy Morgan that one of his constituents went to jail for not having a dog licence.  As the Minister will be aware, people in Dublin West regularly opt to spend a few days in Mountjoy Prison because they do not have a television licence.  I try to sort out the problem and advise such persons not to go to jail as they will acquire a criminal record which would, for instance, prevent them from visiting the United States.  If such persons get an angry judge on a bad day, they will be given a month in prison, although they will be released from Mountjoy relatively quickly.</P>
        <P>I have described the activity in which a person engaged.  The relevant sections of the Companies Act are clear in this respect.  What is wrong with the system of regulation that those involved in it, the Financial Regulator and members of the regulatory authority, did not feel anger about this or try to find a way to bring this guy to account?  Transparency and accountability are needed in this matter.  As I stated, once upon a time we had Ansbacher man.  We now have Anglo man, the principal one being Mr. Sean FitzPatrick.  I advise the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the Labour Party amendment as it puts customers, staff and the interests of citizens first.  The key proposal, to appoint one or more inspectors, is positive and constructive.  The amendment refers to fraud and other misconduct, practices which have been taking place and must be tackled head on.  The issue here is one of accountability and fair practice.</P>
        <P>During my time as a principal of a small school in the north inner city, inspectors from the Department of Education and Science regularly visited to examine the school&rsquo;s books.  If one was one penny over budget, one was hauled over the coals to provide an explanation and ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money was properly spent.  Hundreds of small schools in disadvantaged areas are coming under pressure.  They must be accountable and operate within their budgets or they will be assessed and criticised by inspectors from the Department.  I make this point to emphasise that while many people treat public money with respect, others have not treated money belonging to investors, customers and small businesses with the same respect.  Many of these people hammered politicians for the past seven years, arguing that they could run the economy without the support of politicians.  These right-wing capitalists have been out of control for the past 11 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This debate must be about stopping people from getting away with such behaviour.  There seems to be one law for the rich and one for the poor.  A number of Deputies referred to individual cases.  I recall that during the row over bin taxes a number of those who fought for <Col N="59"/>a fairer taxation system were sent to jail.  The type of carry-on which has occurred is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I welcome the sensible proposal to give the inspectors powers to go after fat cats.  The amendment refers to cases in which not all information has been provided.  In recent weeks, it emerged that people in high positions failed to provide full information.  This is not acceptable given that these same people have demanded accountability for years.  We now demand accountability.  The amendment, if accepted, would at least provide some protection to citizens as well as the customers and staff of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The substantive point in this regard is that a thorough investigation is required to get to the bottom of this matter.  If necessary, a High Court inspector must be appointed.  I support the principle underpinning the amendment.  Decisions and behaviour in the banks have exposed taxpayers to significant risk, destroyed shareholder value in the banks concerned and damaged the employment prospects of those working in Anglo Irish Bank.  We must have public accountability, whether through the vehicle proposed in the amendment or another vehicle proposed by the Minister. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is essential that we have accountability.  We should be conscious of the changing corporate status of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a declaration of interest.  Unlike many, I am in the fortunate position of not being a shareholder in Anglo Irish Bank.  In case anyone accuses me of not making a declaration of interest, I have earned no money from the dreadful debacle that has occurred.  The law firm with which I still have a connection has received inquiries from shareholders as to where they stand on their entitlement to compensation.</P>
        <P>I have had conversations with two or three journalists about the issue.  Someone may say in the future I contributed to the debate in circumstances where others in the law firm with which I am associated may act on behalf of shareholders; I do not know whether or not that will come to pass.</P>
        <P>We should be conscious of the new structure to be put in place.  It is useful to discuss this amendment in the context of the scandalously truncated debate we had on Second Stage.  It gives us an opportunity to address the conduct of those involved with this bank.</P>
        <P>This bank is going into State ownership.  As a consequence, there should be no obstacle to a proper examination of its books, its historical dealing and its paperwork relating thereto.  Regarding Mr. FitzPatrick, there should be no obstacle to a clear examination as to how it came to pass that, as shown in the books of the bank, substantial sums of money were borrowed, seemed to disappear out of sight in September each year before the bank came to the end of its financial year, found their way into the books of Irish Nationwide Building Society and were then transferred mysteriously back into the bank after 30 September each year.</P>
        <P>The usual reason for appointing an inspector is when a company has its own identifiable independent legal status and requires an external investigation to ascertain what has happened within the company.  I assume the Minister will confirm to the House that all necessary information will be accessed.</P><Col N="60"/>
        <P>We have been told the Director of Corporate Enforcement is conducting some type of investigation.  There are limits to where that investigation can go.  I understand there is a separate and identifiable function for the Garda fraud squad.  Can the Minister tell us if he envisages the Garda investigating the dealings within this company?</P>
        <P>We know of the borrowings conducted by Mr. FitzPatrick through this company, but we do not have the full details.  There were some revelations at the extraordinary general meeting held last Friday and others were discussed in the media, but we do not have the full detail.</P>
        <P>One revelation we do know is that some of the borrowings relate to the acquisition of shares in Anglo Irish Bank.  Those borrowings were off the books, never acknowledged, used to stimulate public confidence in the bank &mdash; presumably to persuade those who already held shares to retain them or buy more &mdash; and act as a catalyst to shareholders acquiring shares.</P>
        <P>A particular criminal issue arises in those circumstances.  Irish Nationwide Building Society should not be exempt from any investigation conducted.  It may be acceptable that many millions of euro borrowed from a chairman or former chief executive of a bank be transferred from one financial institution to another for one year.  There may be a business reason for doing so.  It is reported this happened eight years in a row and always coincided with the end of the financial year for the other institution.  The moneys were then transferred back.</P>
        <P>Irish Nationwide Building Society and its management have serious questions to answer and I am astonished that, to date, they have not publicly explained their conduct.  It is essential that conduct is explained.</P>
        <P>There are many people who invested in the Irish stock market and purchased reasonable, not huge, amounts of shares in Anglo Irish Bank.  Many were retired and relied on the dividend.  They assumed investing in Anglo Irish Bank was investing in a company which was blue chip as any other bank, until the recent disasters which have taken place.  I believe such people have been defrauded of their money.</P>
        <P>Anyone who invests on the stock market must accept risk and understand that the value of shares goes up and down.  By and large, if one makes the wrong judgment, money is lost and if the right judgment is made, money may be made.  Shares have been artificially boosted.</P>
        <P>Information has been excluded from accounts, there have been extraordinary failures by the auditors of the company and negligence on the part of the regulator who, even if the authority was unaware of what was happening for many years, knew exactly what the position was by December 2007.  One section of the regulatory authority did not give the other side the information.</P>
        <P>Many people face serious financial difficulties as a consequence of what has happened within this company.  It should be completely unacceptable for a chairman or chief executive to arrange a loan book in this way and engage in the type of conduct we have seen.</P>
        <P>We still do not know what assets are backing up the borrowings taken out.  We do not know if the moneys Mr. FitzPatrick was moving by way of borrowings between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were borrowed by him for his own business purposes or if he was a front for making moneys available to other persons.  We do not know the answers to any of these questions.</P>
        <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that there will be a proper investigation and follow up of these issues.  I listened to the ramblings of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and the vain attempt by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to distance the <Col N="61"/>Green Party from responsibility of any nature.  It is as if the Green Party only went into government six months ago.</P>
        <P>There was a failure of corporate regulation of enormous proportions.  The banking crisis we are confronted by continued to be stirred and contributed to by the Government in office.  During its first 12 months, it did nothing to tackle the obvious difficulties which arose regarding public expenditure and the collapse of the property market.  All of these matters are affecting our economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not want to make a Second Stage speech but I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this proposal and what steps he and the board will take to ensure the sweetheart deal Mr. FitzPatrick organised on his behalf for borrowings is investigated.</P>
        <P>Corporate misconduct has undermined not just the credibility of Anglo Irish Bank but of this State and has done damage to other banks.  What will happen to ensure those who engage in what I believe is not merely criminal but reckless conduct are fully and properly investigated?</P>
        <P>Action should be taken on behalf of the good name of this country, the shareholders of this company who have been betrayed, the pension schemes which have lost money, affecting thousands of people who have also been betrayed and the employees at lower levels in Anglo Irish Bank.  They sought to do business in a decent and honest way and were betrayed by those in charge of the company and the incompetence of directors, some of whom have now resigned and should have gone earlier.</P>

	<P>It is very interesting that the purpose of this section refers to functions performed in the public interest.  The public interest is not served by ramming legislation through the House in four and a half hours.  This is a serious matter that could have long-term effects for our other major retail banks who are concerned on a daily basis with overdraft facilities to enable businesses to survive and remain in business.  It should be remembered that we are talking about an investment bank and that throughout the world investment banks have generally been the main cause of collapse in the banking system.  As individual Members of the House representing the people who sent us here, we are asked to walk through the lobbies and vote in favour of purchasing a bank about which we know nothing, in respect of which we do not know the value of its liabilities, assets or debts.  We are asked to do that following four and a half hours of debate.</P>
        <P>If, when this debate is over, I am asked by a constituent why I voted in favour of buying this bank, whether I know something about it that the constituent does not know, I would have to say I know nothing about it.  My constituent might well ask why I voted to buy it on his or her behalf.  In effect, that is what we are doing.  We are buying this bank on behalf of the ordinary punter in the street.  I find this extremely disturbing.  Under no circumstances will I vote for this Bill on the basis that in the long term it will affect the other two major retail banks.  Nobody in business would dream of buying a business they know nothing about.  If they did they would not remain too long in business.  I have been in business for more than 35 years and I certainly would not buy a share in a company about which I knew nothing.  The first thing one would do is conduct a thorough investigation of the company.  We have not been given an opportunity to do that.</P>
        <P>I serve on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service with my colleagues here, and we have been totally misled on two occasions by bankers, including the Governor of the Central Bank who told us &mdash; I believe it was last September &mdash; he had stress-tested these banks and was happy with them.</P>

	<P>Exactly.  We are going to invest in banks blindfolded.  We do not know anything about that bank.  What a way to run a shop.  This is typical of the way the State traditionally has operated.</P>
        <P>We have got ourselves into a mess.  We sat back and allowed the PMPA to engage in indiscriminate underwriting.  Ultimately, the taxpayer had to bail it out.  A former Minister for Finance, Mr. Alan Dukes, who is now one of the directors of Anglo Irish Bank, had to bail out AIB because of its reckless trading with ICI.  There is no change proposed to regulations dealing with how banks should perform their duties.</P>
        <P>The Minister should remember that plumbing is for plumbers.  If everybody stuck to their own trade we would not be in the mess we are in.  What is wrong is that building societies want to become banks, banks want to become insurance companies, and insurance companies want to become banks.  Everybody wants to be something else and yet there is no question of introducing new regulations to confine people to the business they are supposed to perform.  Banks are there to give a service to the public, to fund development for the future of this country and to give jobs to people.  No change whatsoever is proposed to the regulations but we are asked to blindly purchase this bank without knowing how we are to dispose of it in the future, what liabilities we will inherit, how we are to fund them, how it will affect the reputation of this country.</P>
        <P>This will instil fear in people investing in the two retail banks which are vitally important.  We are nationalising one bank and now we are investing in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In a months&rsquo; time the Minister may be back here asking us to approve a further purchase of shares in AIB or Bank of Ireland.  What private investor would invest in banks when they do not know the future direction of those banks?</P>
        <P>I am sick of listening to Ministers telling us we should act responsibly as an Opposition and think of the future of the country.  Nobody gives us an opportunity to debate issues such as this.  The Minister has the cheek to come in here and ram this legislation through in four and a half hours and expect us to act in a patriotic way and look after the interests of the country when we cannot even debate a topic of such seriousness, the takeover of a bank by Irish taxpayers without knowing what its liabilities are.  This is a total disgrace and I will not vote in favour of this legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>By any yardstick, Mr. FitzPatrick, and all who were complicit in or who knew of his activities, have serious questions to answer.  It is time to call a spade a spade.  The actions we know of &mdash; and more may come to light following full investigation &mdash; were, without question, criminal.  I do not make that charge lightly.  We see the credibility of not only a single financial institution but of the combined banks and other financial entities working within this economy faced with the most serious situation presenting in our lifetimes, with all of the serious consequences that represents for ordinary citizens who have placed their <Col N="63"/>trust in these entities over the years and who are now paying a serious price for the mismanagement and outrageous conduct of the individuals who were at the helm of some of these institutions.  It is a very serious situation.</P>
        <P>I support Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment No. 2, which seeks a full investigation.  In his response, will the Minister tell us clearly what investigation is under way?  Is it intended to fully expose the facts?  We are not privy to the full facts.  The Minister is asking us to buy a pig in a poke on behalf of the citizens of this State.  He is asking us to give our <i>imprimatur</i> as elected representatives to this legislation, but that is not likely.  I have listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s contributions but has he advised the Members of this House of all the information he has and knows pertaining to the historical and contemporary affairs of this banking institution?  He should consider his response carefully.  Has he been forthright with Members concerning all the information and detail that has been brought to his attention about Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s affairs, the conduct of its business and the conduct of those in positions of trust, either engaged or as members of its board?  I am asking the Minister to be clear in his response to those questions because they are important.</P>
        <P>The thrust of the motion before us not only concerns the investigation of Anglo Irish Bank.  As regards the affairs of Mr. FitzPatrick, is it not clear and obvious that there were at least two financial institutions involved in a shadowy exercise of disguising that person&rsquo;s business affairs and whomever else he may have been acting on behalf of?  Is Irish Nationwide not equally complicit in that whole exercise of deceit?  Where would the Minister draw the line in investigating the financial institutions that have operated, and continue to operate, in this State?  He cannot do so.  If we are truly to get to a new beginning, a point where the people can have confidence in the financial entities operating in this State, we need a full and rigorous investigation of each and every one of them to affirm their adherence to absolute best practice and corporate governance now and in future.  Nothing less will restore the confidence of the people or, indeed, investors in other jurisdictions, in the financial institutions in this State.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to accept Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment and take on board the points that have been made.  He should accept and appreciate how Opposition Members feel about what is being put to them here today.  He is asking us to adopt a proposition over a truncated period of time, about which at the end of the day he does not claim to know the full facts.  I would like to hear the Minister say that he has been absolutely unequivocal in sharing all the detail he knows pertaining to the business of this entity which he now proposes to place in public ownership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Credibility is at the heart of this amendment and it is at the heart of this debate also.  It is hard to get credibility for a strategy if those of us who are making the decision do not have the fullest information.  The Minister is in effect asking us to make a decision about the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank without providing us with any information to enable us to make such a decision.  Quite frankly, I do not know whether it is a good proposal or a bad one because I do not have enough information on which to measure it.  I do not want to personalise the debate.  I think the Minister is a truthful person, but that is not the issue.  The issue in the markets is whether people believe him.  Truthfulness is not the issue either with the Central Bank, the regulator or the Government &mdash; it is whether the Minister is believed.  If the markets say that this blue carpet is pink, one will have to prove the opposite or they will operate on the basis that it is pink.  That is the trap the Administration is falling into now.  Deputy Barrett went through some of the reasons for this.  As late as last September, the governor of the Cental Bank and the regulator&rsquo;s office addressed committees of this House assuring them that everything in the banking system was fine.  They said they had stress tested the loan book and there was no cause for concern.  They said that Ireland was different from <Col N="64"/>the United States in that there were no bad banks here and no bad mortgages.  They said the banks were able to cover any bad debts we had, they were sufficiently capitalised and everything was fine.  Then there were a series of statements by various Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, indicating a strategy for a guarantee on the banks.  There was an absolute debacle when we discovered what Mr. FitzPatrick was up to and how the regulator&rsquo;s office mishandled it.  It had the information about it since last January but did nothing.  Is it any wonder therefore that there is a lack of credibility?</P>
        <P>Just before Christmas, the Government said it was not nationalising Anglo Irish Bank.  The Minister has told us today that he was preparing the legislation back in September and that one of the options at that time was to guarantee four banks and maybe nationalise Anglo Irish.  Then he decided that the guarantee was sufficient.  Before Christmas he was talking about recapitalising the bank.  He mentioned the figure of &euro;1.5 billion, yet now he is nationalising it.  It does not give any sense of credibility when the policy keeps changing with events.  I am worried about the country at the moment and I do not think I am alone in that.  It is going to be difficult to restore the economy to viability and get people back to work.  It will be difficult for the Government to bring in the necessary fiscal correction.  However, nothing of a viable, long-lasting nature can be done unless the banking system is put right.  Unless we have a credible banking system it will be impossible to rebuild this country&rsquo;s economy and restore employment.</P>
        <P>The problem is that the Minister has not put enough information on the table to give credibility to today&rsquo;s process.  The PwC report must have a lot of the information the House requires but the Minister says that for reasons of commercial sensitivity he cannot publish it.  In his speech the Minister said the Jones Lang LaSalle report supports the PwC findings, but he cannot tell us anything about what is in that either.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Anglo Irish Bank must have a draft annual report for 2008 with a full balance sheet.  I understand it was to be published in about two weeks time.  I also understand that publication of the annual report has been deferred.  The benign interpretation is that it is being deferred so that more, and fuller, information can be put into the annual report.  When the Minister replies to this section, I would like him to give us a guarantee that with the changing status of Anglo Irish Bank, the nationalised bank will still proceed to publish the annual report, that the full balance sheet will be available and that the auditors&rsquo; comments on the balance sheet will also be made public.  There should be no holding back on the information or on the bank&rsquo;s intention to provide extra information above what it would normally put in an annual report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a pity that this debate came before the publication of the annual report.  If we had that report, together with a full balance sheet, a certain amount of our questions could have been answered.  However, we might get some insight into the loan book at that stage.  What is going on in the markets this evening, as yesterday, where the main bank shares are being written down again, arises from the same credibility problem.  Bank of Ireland and AIB are good banks with a proud tradition in this country.  They are certainly not fly-by-night people and they have been prudent in their banking.  They are sound but the Minister must convince the international markets of this.  He has been unfortunate this week but he restated his position on recapitalising the banks earlier.  That will not run.  The problem faced by the Minister and the Government all the time is that they are behind the curve on the debate.  Things move and they are left behind.</P>
        <P>I will outline what is wrong with what the Minister said.  He stated he will proceed with recapitalisation, as intended before Christmas, and put &euro;2 billion each into AIB and Bank of Ireland.  However, because they were not able to raise funds on the markets, particularly in north America, the Minister intends putting another &euro;1 billion into each of them.  It is unfortunate that the announcement regarding Anglo Irish Bank was made while AIB representatives <Col N="65"/>were engaged in a roadshow in the US, as they failed to come up with &euro;1 billion from the private sector because of this coincidence.  It is also coincidental that the British authorities yesterday decided that the 12% return on the preference shares they were putting into their banks was too onerous.  It was affecting their liquidity and they were unable to fund business in the UK and, as a consequence, they are switching from preference shares to ordinary shares.  The essential difference is ordinary shares proffer ownership whereas preference shares do not.</P>
        <P>The market is taking a view on the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he will also be forced to take ordinary shares instead of preference shares in his recapitalisation programme.  If the Minister gives the &euro;3 billion he has announced to each bank, he will own approximately half of each bank.  Whether one calls that nationalisation or not, as soon as he owns approximately half of each bank, the value of shares held by existing shareholders will be diluted by 50%.  Is it any surprise the value of Irish bank shares fell by 50% yesterday?  Their value was diluted because the market is taking a view that the Minister will have to go down the ordinary share rather than preference share route and, as a consequence, he will own approximately 50% of these banks, slightly more in the case of one and slightly less in the case of the other.  Share values have reduced as a result.</P>
        <P>Since share values are so low in the banks, they do not matter a great deal in the debate currently.  If a share in one of the major banks falls from 60 cent to 30 cent, a shareholder who bought when the shares were valued at between &euro;17 and &euro;23 will lose his or her money anyway.  It might be a 50% drop from 60 cent to 30 cent but it is a 100% increase when the reverse occurs.  However, that does not matter.  The fellows on floor eight trading in the bond market matter more than the fellows trading on the ground floor in New York.  They are deciding whether to invest &euro;400 million in bonds in AIB or Bank of Ireland and they are taking a view on the banks because of the perception that has been created.  The Minister&rsquo;s earlier statement accentuates that problem and he needs to bring his thinking up to date.  Anglo Irish Bank is the third bank in the State.  There would be a great deal of grief if the bank went under but it is not fundamental to the Irish banking system.  However, if anything happened to the main clearing banks, one would not be able to cash a cheque and there would be serious grief.  We must get real about this.</P>
        <P>A significant element of the problem with the banks, the Government, the Central Bank and the regulator is the withholding of information.  If the information was made available, at least there would be a sense of reality and people could measure what is happening.  If these are sound banks anyway, as I believe, it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that the fullest information be made available in order that a false crisis is not created and we will not have to return to the House in a few weeks to take more serious action regarding the main banks.</P>
        <P>I agree with many of the comments regarding the behaviour of the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank.  If one walked down St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green tonight and threw a brick through the window of the bank, one would probably be jailed but the chairman could transfer money in and out and present the balance sheet in a way that disguised the real position while people bought and sold shares on that basis.  That has to be fraud.  On the day he resigned, the then chairman made a self-serving statement in which he said nothing illegal had occurred and by midday this was echoed by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minster for Social and Family Affairs on &ldquo;The One O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo;.  Anyone with a sense of right and wrong knows that while a section in company law might not specifically state if one rigs a balance sheet, it is an illegal act, the wider issue is a fraud and questions arise under common law.  It has to be a criminal offence, which must be scrutinised.  Whether that is done through this amendment or otherwise, it must be investigated.</P><Col N="66"/>
        <P>I would like the Minister to comment, in particular, on the annual report and to give a commitment that it will be published in due course in the fullest possible way.  Will he also make a commitment to try to get ahead of the debate and ahead of the game and announce a banking strategy that applies to all banks?  He is playing catch up but he is falling further behind.  It is a serious situation.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of Members wish to make a contribution but most of them have been denied because of the procedures forced through the House earlier.  The major shortcoming is we are debating under a shadow of ignorance because we do not know the facts and, as a result, we must exercise great caution, as legislators, in the manner in which we deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to use my position in the House to name anyone, especially when he or she does not have the opportunity to reply, but the top brass in Anglo Irish Bank is guilty of national sabotage and financial treason because they have cost the State tens of billions of euro so far and we do not know the extent of the cost.  I am surprised by the Minister&rsquo;s expression of surprise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will see developments over the next few months.  There has been a massive failure of government and legislation and a breach of criminal law, which has not been addressed.</P>
        <P>Why has the Minister not cleaned out the banks?  Why has he not demanded the resignations not only of the top brass in every bank, but also their board members?  Anglo Irish Bank is not a normal bank, as it is devoid of small every day customers and private residential mortgage holders.  However, the Minister knows its customers.  They are the big developers and friends of Fianna F&aacute;il whom he met in the Galway tent for many years.</P>

	<P>That presents the Minister and his colleagues with a conflict of interest because the chickens in the Galway tent are firmly coming home to roost.</P>
        <P>AIB and Bank of Ireland are somewhat culpable.  The chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland stated yesterday that he will retire next June.  What kind of cloud cuckoo land is the man living on?  He should retire immediately.  What will happen the bank between now and June as his fellow executives jockey for position to see who will take over?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Sack them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely that runs contrary to the commitment given by both banks to engage actively in the process of recapitalisation since last autumn, which has not happened.   I was informed by the chairman of AIB that efforts were being made.  Why did the bank not dispose of its US assets?  It did not happen because it is waiting for the Minister to act.</P>
        <P>What is the Minister doing in conjunction with the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with the company law breaches <Col N="67"/>that are alleged to have taken place?  Bank executives claim to have done no wrong.  I have read through the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990.  There are the matters of fraud, deceit, false reporting, failure to report, failure to disclose and failure to lodge papers in the Companies Office in cases specifically where directors take out loans from their own company.  It seems pretty straightforward and yet no Minister has said there might be a role for the Director of Corporate Enforcement in this regard.  Can the director act without a report or a referral?  Can he not act on his own initiative?  Has any member of Government on behalf of the people entered into negotiations with the director to ascertain what role he has in the matter?</P>
        <P>What about the auditors who failed to establish the facts?  The fundamental role of any audit company is to exercise an element of oversight and vigilance.  It seems that the big corporate group involved did not see what was going on and knew nothing.  What reportage can be undertaken to the Director of Public Prosecutions regarding these corporate criminals?  What message are we sending out as a Parliament to hard-pressed mortgage holders and people who are losing their jobs?</P>
        <P>At midnight last night I left a meeting with a man in my constituency.  When I told him I had received a summons from the Ceann Comhairle to attend a special sitting here today, he asked me whether I would have an opportunity to speak.  I told him that, subject to the Whips, I might.  He proceeded to tell me that the compensation he got from the acquisition of his farm by the National Roads Authority was invested in Anglo Irish Bank shares.  What message does the Minister have today for that man and the countless other pension holders whose pensions on the advice of accountants and financial experts were invested in bank shares?  We were told these were blue chip, guaranteed, gold plated and the best possible.</P>
        <P>The rot must stop.  It is time to put the entire financial system under the microscope.  It cannot be done by anyone other than the Minister for Finance.  However, he will need to talk to his colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and ascertain what role the Director of Corporate Enforcement has in the matter.  The champagne and chocolates are finished, but the financial future of the State is threatened.  The banks seem to be pulling the strings with the Department of Finance on occasions.  While this Bill will be passed this evening, it is far from the end of the problems and difficulties, as the Minister knows.  We cannot debate these matters under a shadow of ignorance with information being withheld.  We need to know that information and the Minister is the key to it.  He owes it not just to this House, but also to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>My dealings with banks would have involved putting money in, taking money out, trying to get a mortgage and trying to get loans for elections.  At that level, the majority of people I have dealt with are very civil, courteous and nice people, who do their level best to try to help out.  Having lost an election and gone back to them seeking more money for another election, if I had been on the other side of the counter I am not certain that I would have given that loan.  However, the banks did.  At that level there are people who are decent and hard working, and genuinely care and know their own community.  That is why they are behind those counters.</P>
        <P>There is another level in banking that none of us knows.  While some Ministers may know it, I definitely do not and I doubt if I ever will.  Comparisons need to be made.  What is the difference between Enron and Anglo Irish Bank?  The difference is that Enron was dealt with by the bastion of capitalism, America.  It was dealt with because it hid from its shareholders information it should have given them.  When it was discovered that it had done so, the US Government did not move in to bail it out.  Its directors were not protected and did not walk away with golden handshakes.  They are in jail because the one crime a company cannot commit in capitalism is to delude its shareholders.  That is what happened in Anglo Irish Bank.  The <Col N="68"/>Anglo Irish Bank board members sat before the shareholders not at the recent EGM, but at the last AGM and did not disclose the true facts to them.  If that is a crime in America, which is the bastion of capitalism, is it not a crime here?  Do people have no recourse?  I find it outrageous.</P>
        <P>Other comparisons need to be made.  Ireland has experienced a twofold whammy with what has happened in the building industry and the banking crisis.  The very people, who have put at risk the lives and lifestyles of so many of our citizens and put at risk their homes, jobs, cars and children&rsquo;s futures, are exactly the same people who are riding off into the sunset with golden handshakes.  I will not name any individual because it does not stop with an individual.  I do not believe there was just one individual in Anglo Irish Bank; I believe there were more than that.  I do not believe only one individual is involved in other areas; there are more.  The Financial Regulator is about to ride off into the sunset with a big pension and pay-off.  The man in Anglo Irish Bank is riding off into the sunset with a big pay-off and pension.  The top man in F&Aacute;S is riding off into the sunset with a big pension and pay-off.</P>
        <P>The people who are directly affected by this are sitting there, wringing their hands and asking us why no one is held responsible.  When the economy picks up, and it will pick up, those same people will be asked to pick up the tab for the golden handshakes of the people that put them into this in the first place.  Those are the things I do not understand and I am sure I am not the only one.  It is outrageous that this should happen.</P>
        <P>Putting an inspector into Anglo Irish Bank is the very least we should seek.  Someone needs to go in there to find out what happened and who is responsible.  As I said, I do not believe only one individual is responsible.  What are we going to do about the Irish Nationwide Building Society?  A director took his loan and moved it because the auditors were about to come in.  I am assuming that favour did not go unrecalled.  What are we doing about that?  I got a feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> listening to the Minister today.  Originally, the Minister said the banking system was sound, so we did not need to recapitalise.  Then we were not going to nationalise.  Then we did all those things.  There is a fundamental problem in our banking system which needs to be dealt with.  What we are doing here today, as Deputy Burton rightly said, is tinkering around the outskirts.  This is not a bank in the normal sense of the word.  It is not a bank that I go to looking for a loan for a house, my car or my children&rsquo;s education.  It is not that type of bank.  It is a betting shop, where people went and took gambles.  For some it did not pay off, but in some cases it paid off very handsomely.  When I stood up 20 years ago and said we should nationalise the banks, this was not what I had in mind.  What we are now looking at is the nationalisation of a large debt incurred by people who are now walking away, having been handsomely rewarded.  We are going to allow them to stroll off into the sunset, while the people who are directly affected by it will be paying for this for the rest of their lives.  I do not think it is good enough that the Minister can stand here and say there are sensitive commercial reasons he cannot give us the information.  That is rubbish.  We are all adults here, and if we are acting on behalf of the taxpayer we need to know that information.  We need to know exactly what we are doing.  We cannot make decisions based on no information.</P>
        <P>The other thing that struck me as interesting today was the speech of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  When he stood up to speak I genuinely felt he was reading from a chart about conflict resolution.  First, one identifies the problem.  Then one stops taking harmful action.  Next, one asks the other party how they think it should be solved.  The Minister started by telling us exactly what the problem was, although we all know what the problem is.  He then went on to tell us how we should solve it with robust legislation to ensure that the Financial Regulator has teeth and can act on our behalf.  I may not know a lot about banking, but I know a little bit about how this place works.  Is it not the job of the <Col N="69"/>Minister to bring in legislation to make sure the regulator has teeth and can take action to protect us?  The Minister is telling us what he should be doing.  The way this has gone is quite worrying.  People out there tell me every day of the week that we need a little hope and a little trust, and above all else we need to reassure ourselves that this Government knows what it is doing.  Today&rsquo;s performance gives us none of these.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this excellent amendment.  One of the reasons is that it offers the Government an opportunity to tell us exactly where it stands.  Does it stand on the side of ordinary small investors such as those we have seen on television attending the EGM on Friday last?  Alternatively, does it stand with the Se&aacute;nie Fitzes of this world and those in his gang who have been dealing with other people&rsquo;s money in the way they have for some considerable time?  If the Minister is not going to accept this amendment, there is an obligation on the Government to tell us how it will deal with this issue.  Will it send somebody after the Se&aacute;nie Fitzes of this world?  Will the Criminal Assets Bureau be called in?  Clearly this is an excellent opportunity for the CAB to examine what exactly went on.  Will the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank be pursued for the amount outstanding on the loan, which I think is &euro;82 million?  Will the Government seek to have this repaid?  Perhaps we could have some clarification on that matter.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt in my mind &mdash; I expect the Minister would agree &mdash; that this is Ireland&rsquo;s Enron.  However, the difference is that with Enron, investigators were sent after the characters involved to bring them in and deal with them.  There is no sign of that happening on this occasion.  We are hearing about the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, but why not the Garda fraud squad?  Why not the CAB?  Why not adopt this amendment, which sets up an inspector to go after these characters and examine their activities &mdash; not just in Anglo Irish Bank but also in other banks &mdash; and try to get to the bottom of this matter once and for all?</P>
        <P>We have all, including myself, alluded to the substantial investors, property speculators and so on who are clearly embedded in this bank.  However, there was another level of investors, whom we saw recently on our TV screens.  Pensioners, for example, who had invested in this bank as their pension, are now sitting in the cold in the evening, perhaps with not enough money to heat their houses as a result of what has happened.  I accept, as does everybody else, that when one invests in a bank or anything else one is taking a chance, but one should be taking a well-informed chance.  In this instance, investors were positively and actively misled.  They were told they were backing a fine filly when in fact they were backing a plough horse or a mare which was in foal and stood no chance of getting to the end of the course.  That is not fair or reasonable and it is not right.</P>
        <P>I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy Lynch, and ask the Minister whether he intends to bring in legislation to fill these loopholes if there is not already sufficient legislative provision to deal with them once and for all.  In addition, perhaps he would address the issue of the auditors, which has not been mentioned by any Government spokesperson to date.  Auditors have a legal obligation to pursue these matters.  There is always the qualification in the last sentence, which states &ldquo;the information provided to me&rdquo;.  However, the auditors have an obligation to try to establish as far as possible that the information given to them was accurate and reasonable.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this issue and on how the auditors might be held to account in this case.  This is an obvious case of corruption at several levels.  It is a matter of tying it down, pointing out exactly who was involved and holding those people to account before the courts.  That needs to happen soon.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>With regard to the overall content of the Bill, my view is that it is the right move but the wrong bank.  Anglo Irish Bank is a hopeless, poisoned institution and I do not believe it can ever be fixed.</P>

	<P>Tomorrow morning every man, woman and child in this country will wake up owning this bank as a result of the decision we are making today.  Every child born tomorrow may also be inheriting the liabilities and costs of this decision.  How we have come to own this bank may never be known, because of the way business is being conducted in the House today.  Like many people watching this debate, I do not know too much about subordinate lending or about banking governance or the discourse of banking.  However, I know about buying things.  If Anglo Irish Bank were a car, I would want to see the log book, I would want to look at the mileage and I certainly would want to look under the bonnet.  If we were to look at Anglo Irish Bank in this context, we would see that there was fraudulent reporting in the log book, that the mileage had been tampered with and that the only servicing the engine ever received was for the directors and a very select few in this society.</P>
        <P>The State is buying a banger at a forecourt price and will be paying repayments for quite a number of years.  When the House last debated the banking situation we were looking at notional costs and notional liabilities.  We are now moving into the realm of real costs and real liabilities.  We are into deep liabilities and deep costs.  The bank which the State is bailing out through a process of nationalisation is not the type of bank with which I am familiar.</P>

	<P>Deputy Lynch, I do not know how the debate developed while I was absent but I remind you that you must deal with the appointment of inspectors to Anglo Irish Bank in accordance with amendment No. 2 in the name of your colleague, Deputy Burton.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with the amendment.  This has to do with the inspection regime and I will not be too much longer. </P>

	<P>I have to deal with what is before me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not the type of banking that most people in this country are familiar with.  Returning to the amendment, this is the reason we need an assessor and a regulator for this area.  The type of bank with which most people are familiar is one with a lot of customers who have loans.  This bank had very few customers and a lot of loans which makes it unique in the banking sector.  With this liability should come a level of governance, regulation and certainly a lot of accountability.  </P>
        <P>There are very basic principles to problem solving and the first is that the problem is put on the table but the Government has been complacent at best and is probably entwined in the problem at worst.  Since the House last debated the banking crisis either nothing has been learned in that time or, more worrying, there is something in the Government&rsquo;s relationship with a certain sector of society that has not yet come into the public domain.</P><Col N="71"/>
        <P>The outcome of this debate has already been decided; the worry is that the consequences have yet to be known.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Costello will know, this amendment is about the appointment of inspectors and the amendment is in the name of Deputy Burton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It is high time that inspectors were appointed and that the Director of Corporate Enforcement should be heading for the High Court on instructions from the Minister to ensure an inspector would be established under the Companies Act and that this matter could be dealt with in a proper fashion as befits taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank was the reason the Minister came into the House in the first instance regarding the original guarantees.  Anglo Irish Bank was the bank going to the wall on that occasion.  There was a late night visit to the Taoiseach, supported by some of the other banks and legislation was passed to give a &euro;450 billion open-ended guarantee.  The situation in Anglo Irish Bank has deteriorated still further.  More information has come to our attention since that time and we are now being presented with a no-choice situation to nationalise a bank with a balance sheet in the region of &euro;100 billion, with something in the region of &euro;70 billion in liabilities in loans and other mechanisms.  We do not know to any detailed extent what are the liabilities we are taking on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The loans are the assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  We are talking about the bad debts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>They are assets of the bank but we are talking about the balance sheet and the liabilities are on that balance sheet where money has been loaned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The loans appear as assets on the balance sheet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but money has been loaned to the extent of &euro;70 billion and we do not know what return will be received on any of this amount.  We do not know the detail of any of this.  The House is making a decision on behalf of the taxpayers who elected us.  We are representatives, we are Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la who represent the citizens of this country.  How can we possibly buy a pig in a poke?  We must know the detail of what we are embarking on before we do so.  To follow bad money with good money is not an option.  It is certainly not an option to say that we are going to go down this road, pass this legislation and there will be no consequences, good, bad or indifferent, for those people who brought us to this state.  There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that fraud has been committed and <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing.  The very least both the Minister and the House owe the taxpayer is to inform taxpayers, shareholders and those with pension money, the ordinary citizen, that we will get to the bottom of this or that we will use every mechanism in our power to do so.  Other people have argued that CAB, the Criminal Assets Bureau should be called in.  I would have no problem with this suggestion but the difficulty seems to be that it is white collar crime.  The onus is on the individual who is targeted to provide the information and to provide the evidence of where the funding has gone and where the liability is.  The onus is not the other way around as is the normal rule of law.  </P>
        <P>We are not dealing with a few thousand euro here but rather with hundreds of millions which have been misused by people who were responsible for using it correctly.  It is essential that we get to the bottom of this and we would be doing a very bad day&rsquo;s work if we left this House without doing everything in our power to get to the bottom of it.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P>A toxic bank situation exists and the problem seems to become more serious every time we look into it.  I refer to the explanatory memorandum of the Bill:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0">. . .the Minister, having consulted with the directors of Anglo Irish Bank, the Governor of the Central Bank, and the Financial Regulator, has formed the opinion that the exercise of these functions is necessary to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the State and to preserve the capacity of Anglo Irish Bank to continue as a going concern.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What is meant by &ldquo;remedy a serious disturbance in the economy&rdquo;?  We are in a recession.  Those are the same people the Minister consulted the last time when he produced the guarantee.  They would say, would they not, that Anglo Irish Bank should be bailed out again?  Following on the guarantee we will bail it out in the form of nationalisation because the situation has deteriorated to a further extent.  What else would they say?  They are the only people the Minister has admitted to having consulted on this matter.  Of course, they want to be bailed out if the bank is going to the wall and liabilities are high.  The Financial Regulator has not covered himself in glory either.  The consultations must be much wider.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The banks are not the economy.  The Government&rsquo;s priority should not be saving a private bank, one that has misguided and mismanaged itself to a fraudulent extent.  The priority should be in ensuring the services the banks provided are maintained.  Anglo Irish Bank, as it stands, is in no position to do this and there is no sign of it being able to do so in the future.  The focus should be on the main banks, Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland, to ensure they are in a position to provide cashflow that small and medium-sized enterprises require.  These enterprises are the backbone of our economy and ensure jobs are created and maintained.  The Minister claimed he has a vision for the banks to serve these pillars of the economy but the banks are not doing so even with the European Investment Bank deciding it would provide funding of &euro;30 billion to Irish, as well as other, banks for this purpose.</P>

	<P>Deputy Costello, this amendment is about the appointment of inspectors to the bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This would have enabled the banks to provide a cashflow for small and medium-sized enterprises.  Will the Minister ensure this is done?</P>
        <P>The amendment is reasonable and modest.  We owe it to the taxpayer to get to the bottom of this crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I must make a declaration of interest.  A member of my immediate family owns shares in Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept this reasonable amendment.  It is not a partisan amendment but seeks to establish the facts and truth in this affair.  It seeks to investigate how we arrived at a point where a major economic institution has brought discredit on the entire Irish banking system.  The markets want certainty and to know the facts.  The domestic and international financial markets do not believe what is happening with the Irish banking system.  They have been consistently refusing to accept the assurances of various commentators on behalf of the different banks.  The Minister knows that too.</P>
        <P>The appointment of an inspector may not address the immediate issue.  However, to use the famous words of the late Mr. Justice Hamilton who presided over the beef tribunal, if Ministers had answered questions in this House, the establishment of the tribunal would not have been necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister for Finance has a large onus of responsibility during these difficult times but he must tell Members of what is happening rather than treating us like children or claiming it is commercially sensitive information.</P>
        <P>I asked the Minister how much this nationalisation would cost but he declined to answer.  If he were to say he does not know or it would range between particular figures, I would have some regard and respect for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought I had given the Deputy a figure for this earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>No, he did not.  I did not hear it.  We need to know.  Markets trade on facts and certainty.  The markets are in turmoil because there is no certainty or transparency.</P>
        <P>Deputy Burton, with our back-up team, has researched the appointment of an inspector.  It would give the Minister an instrument and a route that is legal and could be operated.  Within a period, we would find out what went wrong with this institution so that we could learn for the future.  If an inspector were to discover wrongdoing or corruption, the laws of the land could take care of that.  In the absence of facts and an inspector, the Minister is compounding the uncertainty in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>The systemic banking system we need to operate and function is not the Anglo Irish Bank model.  It was a niche bank in a particular sector.  The two main Irish headquartered banks are now in peril.  Looking at their share prices, that is what the markets are saying.  People in other markets are examining how we are conducting our affairs but the Minister is not offering any comfort of certainty or transparency.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister and the Department are working in difficult times but he must have regard to the consequences of not giving to the market what it can reasonably expect.  Far too often in the past, the Irish players in the Irish market have codded themselves into believing they were a cosy little club and that the rest of the world did not matter.  We do not live in that world anymore as the markets are globalised.  The Minister is aware what the international press, from the <i>Financial Times</i> to <i>The New York Times</i>, have stated about this affair.  We need transparency and facts.  The Minister is in possession of these facts and he must feed them out in a responsible way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall when the Minister for Finance was first raised to ministerial office, he attended the Magill summer school at Glenties.  There he made the point about this House having outsourced much of its responsibility to outside agencies which he regarded as a retrograde step because the lines of accountability were weak, if non-existent.  It is an issue on which you, a Cheann Comhairle, have reflected upon also.  Regrettably, little has been done in addressing it.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il has outsourced, in good faith, responsibilities to the Governor of the Central Bank, the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Financial Regulator.  They have all, to various degrees, failed to execute their responsibilities.  This amendment proposes that the House, in a parallel system, retains the right to act in certain respects and the powers it vests in outside agencies.</P>
        <P>The point has been made <i>ad nauseam</i> that there has been much anger among the little people who pay their taxes.  Many of them worked all their lives, gathered a lump sum and, in good faith, invested it in a portfolio of shares which may have included Anglo Irish Bank.  These people feel betrayed and exposed by what has happened under the Minister&rsquo;s watch.  The Minister referred to disappointment over Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick&rsquo;s dealings but there is also disap<Col N="74"/>pointment with the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s failure.  He allegedly stress-tested these financial institutions on foot of developments at Northern Rock some 18 months ago and gave them a clear bill of health.  This is a clear failure of the agencies in which we in good faith have vested responsibility.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes to allow the House to act along the same lines it has vested in others.  It is sensible to adopt it, given that the Minister has reflected in the past on the lack of accountability to the House.  This affair has been a massive cost to the economy and the country&rsquo;s international standing among global investors.  Our name has been sullied all over the globe.  Here is a chance for this House, as the voice of the people, to reclaim some of the high ground in respect of what is right and proper and to apportion blame where it rightfully rests.  Merely to acknowledge disappointment is insufficient in a debate as important as this.  The amendment would go some way to addressing the deficiencies exposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What lies behind the purpose of this amendment would have the widest possible public support.  People have seen a response that suggests the public is beyond understanding what has happened, that the public would not understand but more complicated people would understand.  The public understands what happened very well.  What the public is communicating to public representatives is that it wants a complete change in culture and some evidence that the Government has taken a decision that what has happened will be exposed, changed and its recurrence made impossible.  That is the test of this legislation.  Has it sufficient in it to answer the questions, to which the public is rightfully entitled?  There are some that might not excite some people who had great responsibility.  When asked about the banking system I recall Mr. Hurley, the Governor of the Central Bank, turning to the television camera and saying that some of the best minds in the world were working on it.  This was a throwaway remark from someone in an extraordinary position of responsibility not exercised.  The idea is that this is out there in the ether with great minds working on it.  What had happened is that the Chicago schools model had completely collapsed in respect of the traded economy.  A credit crisis had taken place internationally due to the departure of all responsibility and accountability in bad and virtual financial products.  On the other side, Ireland under Mr. Hurley&rsquo;s gaze had advanced in creating a property bubble within another bubble and a kind of specialist bank to facilitate the property bubble.</P>
        <P>It is a long time since I studied monetary economics but when I heard Anglo Irish Bank described as a crucial part of the Irish banking system and a systemic player, I wondered what textbook this was taken from.  There is no comparison between Anglo Irish Bank and the other two main banks.  There is a great deal of anxiety in the country to assume that one hopes the illegality, as now seems to be suggested with regard to compliance with auditing and reporting functions, does not prevail in other parts of the banking system.</P>
        <P>People ask lay questions such as, in the movement of between &euro;87 million and &euro;124 million in loans, how much is secured in a variety of ways.  It is rather like when the drunkard is asked how he spent his money and replying that he was in the pub, then the nightclub and then he met someone and they had a few more.  The response is that there was property, equities and the recycling of borrowing into shares purchase involved.  Is any of this secured?  The House is asked, blindly, to say that we will take this big batch of uncertainty, without any questions being asked, and we will go back to the Mr. Hurley argument and the arrogance of it, to the effect that the public and the House cannot be trusted with the information.</P>
        <P>The market knows the information because of the clique that was running the racket.  What else is moving money off the balance sheet, putting it onto another balance sheet and shifting it back again but a racket?  Apparently this took place under the gaze of, and supposedly with <Col N="75"/>the supervision of, auditing functions.  People send us here as politicians and if we are not to be dragged down with it, this is the issue at stake when I hear about the symbolic stuff we do in celebrating the importance of Parliament.  People elect us to insist on getting answers to questions that are rightfully in the realm of public knowledge.  When someone suggests that this is sensitive information, I could accept that argument if someone said to whom it is sensitive.  Is it so sensitive to the markets or so sensitive in terms of what it would reveal?  Is it so sensitive in terms of what is paralleled in other parts of the banking system?  The message from here should be very simple.  Those parts of the banking system that constitute Anglo Irish Bank have behaved disgracefully.  What is worse is to say that one cannot answer, that the information cannot be provided and that an inspector must not be allowed to do so.</P>
        <P>The public also knows that the person principally responsible for damaging the national interest into future generations, perhaps, in terms of trust and capacity, had the neck to go on radio and television and advise people that social welfare should be cut and that we should reduce public expenditure.  The sheer, brazen shamelessness of it.</P>
        <P>What I know, having been a sociologist for 20 or 30 years, is what it means for these little circles as they meet around town and play golf together.  That is why we had these mummies sitting in a row at the meeting to which people came.  The list of those present included the managing director of this, the director of that and the former chief executive officer.  A succeeded B, D recommended C and that disgraced clique has not had one word of condemnation from IBEC.  IBEC continually harasses teachers, garda&iacute; and those on the frontline of public services.  Every second day we get a lecture about the public service from IBEC.  From IBEC, what do we get about these people?  Total silence because they were the people lunching with them, drinking with them and talking to them.  IBEC is silent.</P>

	<P>The amendment concerns the appointment of inspectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What would the inspector do?  The inspector would draw the poison of a system that has damaged this country and create the clean conditions in which we could have an accountable culture of banking.</P>
        <P>It is not mysterious.  There was one time people understood finance clearly.  It is knowable, there is no mystery about it.  The mystery came about when right-wing thinking suggested everybody could be a shareholder and that their greed was financed by dividends, which were governed by performance in products that were running out in number.  Therefore, bonuses came from inventing fictions of risk and investment.  That is what happened internationally and few people have the courage to say it.  Bank people who had been banking and investing went on, not just speculating but gambling into the future, gambling on unsustainable levels of risk.</P>
        <P>That is why no one can answer the question I am asking.  Regarding the bank the public will now own, what is the status on the day-to-day advances made to that bank by those who have lent to it?  The Minister said it would be just like it was before but that is not much of an assurance because the inspector would have told us what it was like before.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why we are here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us hope that other agencies of the State will do it.  How is it that one can say to a board or, in preparation of documents required by company law, that one has borrowed X amount when one has transferred to oneself and moved on and off the balance sheet ten times that amount?</P>
        <P>When I think of the event earlier today, celebrating the First D&aacute;il, and the kind of people who built Ireland, can we recall what we do to someone involved in any kind of misdemeanour regarding the movement of money in a social welfare office or a post office?  Look back at all <Col N="76"/>the sanctions imposed on postmasters or postmistresses who made mistakes.  Generations of a family worry about what it has done to its reputation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Now, all of these people are too complicated for Mr. Hurley, who has the greatest minds in the world working on the future of economics and banking.  I do not know how many years ago it was but I remember giving lectures on economics.  The idea that a governor of a central bank would not know that all of this was going on is either because he is in a state of mind that all banking is a saintly activity which he cannot possibly touch or that it is so arcane that he cannot understand it.  He should have understood it.  The fact that he is still there is a disgrace.  He should be gone and the Minister should see to it that he is gone.</P>
        <P>The Minister is resisting amendments that would allow inspectors to find out what the basis of all of this was so that we might set up an entirely new system.  At the same time, Mr. Hurley sits there waiting for the storm to die down so that we can go back to the way it was.  No one in the country wants it to go back to the way it was.  They want the full lot of sanctions to fall on all those who have damaged us and damaged the name of the country irreparably.  They want them to be treated no differently from how the State has treated any other poor person involved in thievery.  This is what would happen in a republic.  Why should these people be immune from investigation, an inspector or anything else?</P>
        <P>When we are finished with them, we still have the business of intelligently structuring a financial system.  There might be a lot of dead wood who cannot think like this.  Get that dead wood out of the way.  This country is full of responsible, morally inclined decent graduates in all of these subjects.  Let the inspector in and let us find out what went on.  Let us not imagine that these people made mistakes.  It is not the malfunction of a system that was working.  It is the deliberate, corrupt and dreadful activity of people working a system that was wrong.</P>

Many harsh things were said, as were many true things, during the debate this afternoon about the banks, shareholders who lost their pension funds investing in these institutions, the quality of the management of these institutions and the specific misconduct engaged upon by the chairman of the particular institution with which we are dealing today.</P>
        <P>I avoided the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; initially and used the word &ldquo;disappointment&rdquo; which I have used frequently since.  I avoided it initially because my concern, as Minister for Finance, was for the financial stability of the banking sector.  With regard to the matter of which complaint was made, Deputy Burton began the debate by pointing to extremely serious issues of corpor<Col N="77"/>ate governance with regard to this particular company.  She referred to the loans to directors, which I know the chairman explained at the extraordinary general meeting but about which questions remain to be answered.

It does not come from this House because the Director of Public Prosecutions does not come from this House either.  Deputies should know that the director and his staff have shown a strong commitment to their compliance remit and bring parties who have not met their legal obligations under the companies legislation before the courts in appropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P>The office has secured the conviction of more than 140 company directors and other persons for company law offences.  The office has had disqualification orders imposed on more than 70 persons and approximately 800 directors have been restricted by liquidators following reports made to the director&rsquo;s office.  The director and his staff will undertake a professional job in examining the recent events in Anglo Irish Bank and I look forward to seeing the results of various examinations which he no doubt will have to make as a result of what has come to light.</P>
        <P>I have discussed the powers of the Director of Corporate Enforcement with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is essential that the director has the fullest possible powers to investigate this matter.  As an immediate measure, I have requested that the regulator, who has more extensive powers of surveillance with regard to the banking system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;should at his request provide for him any information that may be required.  It is essential that these matters are investigated and dealt with and that those responsible are brought to account.</P>
        <P>With regard to the investigations taking place, in the case of this particular institution the decision of this House to take the bank into State ownership means that a clear blue line can be drawn between the future of this institution and what went on in the past.  This affords us the valuable opportunity of dealing in an open way with everything that has passed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to touch on another matter raised in a number of contributions, which is the question of what the taxpayer is obtaining.  As I indicated earlier, following the guarantee a firm of accountants conducted a detailed analysis of the loan books of all of the institutions and, in particular, the loan book of Anglo Irish Bank in estimating the future losses of a bank.  As I pointed out several times in recent days, the position is that the current loan book of Anglo Irish Bank remunerates the deposits.  In other words, there is sufficient income derived from the loan book to pay for the operation of the bank and to pay for the deposits at the bank. <Col N="78"/> This is a fundamental and important point.  Much of the public debate has suggested that the bank is not in a solvent position.  The bank is solvent and it is now coming into State ownership.</P>
        <P>I was advised by the Governor of the Central Bank, other financial authorities and my officials.  The Government weighed up the arguments at official level with me in conference and subsequently I advised the circumstances to my colleagues that the balance of the argument favoured nationalising this institution.  The situation could potentially be a systemic risk to the Irish banking sector and the economy.  This potential has not yet materialised and this is an important point.</P>
        <P>With regard to the examination conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, having examined the loan book, the bad debts and the future potential profits that could be taken by this institution from the performing loans it had, it estimated that as a private concern to put the markets beyond doubt about its future viability required a &euro;4 billion recapitalisation.  We do not have to do this recapitalisation.  As a result of the doubts expressed by Members of this House today and which I also entertained in early December, I was not prepared to go beyond &euro;1.5 billion to give immediate confidence to the institution in the context of considerable market scepticism following the revelations about the chairman.</P>
        <P>The position now with regard to public ownership is that while there is exposure, and I have been asked frequently about this in recent days, the exposure is not to any immediate commitment to funding for the bank.  Were there difficulties, the State would have to provide working capital and were it provided the State would be entitled to extract it from any profit the bank might accrue.  This is the position with regard to the exposure of the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputies on the question of the systemic character of this bank and this raises two fundamental issues.  One is the number of depositors, which I outlined to the House earlier.  There are 300,000 retail depositors, 72,000 of whom are in the country, and 12,000 corporate depositors, 3,500 of whom are in the country.  That is a fundamental question of systemic importance in the economy and a balance sheet of such size.  There is, however, a wider issue up to which we will have to face and in regard to which the Government will perform its responsibilities in the coming days, that is, the whole question of how, to the outside world, we manage our finances.  To the outside world, Ireland must be seen as a country which honours its debts and obligations.  As a country, we cannot afford to have the message going out that we will let a bank fail and, consequently, dishonour the depositors who have invested their money in it.  We constantly point out how exposed we are to global trends.  We are equally dependent on international goodwill.  Whether in regard to the Lisbon treaty or this particular matter, we cannot afford to impair our credit in the outside world.</P>
        <P>That is a fundamental reason I proposed to my colleagues in Government, who agreed, that we had no option but to put the seal of full State ownership around this bank to ensure that the taxpayer was fully and comprehensively protected in regard to the management of this bank and in respect of the guarantee the State gave to it.</P>
        <P>I refer to the guarantee because the point was raised by Deputy Rabbitte earlier.  Irrespective of whether we had given a guarantee, we would be obliged to nationalise this institution.  Indeed, the nationalisation of this institution was a matter to which we gave some attention in September but for the reasons I outlined earlier in the debate, we decided, on the balance of arguments, against it at that stage.</P>
