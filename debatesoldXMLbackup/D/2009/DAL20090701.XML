	<P>Yesterday we got confirmation of 120 job losses in Bausch and Lomb in Waterford, 80 job losses in ICT Eurotel Marketing Limited in Belmullet and 100 job losses in Meadow Meats in Rathdowney.  The Taoiseach knows the figures that will be released by the CSO at 11 o&rsquo;clock for the live register for June.  Will he tell the House what the figures are?</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures are due out at 11 o&rsquo;clock.  When seasonal factors are taken into account, the live register for June is estimated at 413,500, a month on month increase of 11,400, up 2.8% since May 2009.  It is the slowest rate of increase since January.  Obviously it is still clear that the unemployment situation continues to be affected as we implement the three necessary aspects of recovery &mdash; bringing order to the public finances, improving competitiveness in the economy and reforming the banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Civil Service-speak, that this is the slowest rate of increase, demonstrates just where we are.  In January the rate of increase was 33,000, in February it was 26,000, in March it was 20,000, in April it was 15,000, in May it was 13,000 and in June it was 11,400.   This economy is in crisis.  It is a long time since one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessors said that if unemployment went over 100,000 the Government should resign.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday, the CSO figures also showed that capital expenditure in the economy had declined by one third quarter on quarter.  This morning the former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Tom Parlon, said that the construction industry is in crisis.  It seems the Department of Finance is in a state of paralysis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach is aware of the importance of the creation and protection of jobs.  The former secretary at the Department of Finance and historical figure, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, speaking at the commemoration for Se&aacute;n Lemass, said the protection of jobs is critical.  It now appears &euro;12 billion will be slashed from capital expenditure in the period 2009-13.  Obviously, some projects must be cut because they all require funding but these involve men and women working all over the country, subcontractors, service providers to subcontractors and providers to main contracts.  There is real crisis, exacerbated by the fact that many suppliers of service and contractors in the construction area are now in complete limbo in the pre-NAMA phase because the banks no longer care and there is no money forthcoming.</P>
        <P>The current forecast for capital expenditure projects in 2009 is &euro;7.3 billion.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that will be delivered?  For 2010 the forecast for capital expenditure is &euro;6.6 billion.  We <Col N="616"/>heard this morning from the Construction Industry Federation that all that appears to exist are promises.  This is a firm commitment, reduced from &euro;9.1 billion announced in the 2008 budget.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that in respect of capital expenditure programmes, for this year the commitment of &euro;7.3 billion will stand and that for 2010 the commitment of &euro;6.6 billion will stand?  This is about maintaining jobs, creating infrastructure and retaining some semblance of movement in an economy that is in crisis.  I am sure it pains the Taoiseach as a politician and former Minister for Finance that when he delivered his budgets, he knew the trends were heading in this direction.  Will the Taoiseach confirm those figures will stand for 2009 and 2010?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the public capital programme, it is our intention to spend about 5% of GNP, one of the largest ratios in the developed world for capital spending as a proportion of total goods and services being provided in the State in any given year.  The &euro;7.3 billion represents the equivalent of 5% of GNP, one of the highest ratios in the world.  It is important that we continue that programme over the course of this year and I expect that money to be spent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important to point out that thankfully the prices in tenders have decreased by 15% to 20% and therefore the volume of output we can get is clearly available in the same measure for 15% to 20% less.  Next year, as based on the current budgetary strategy which is outlined by the Minister in the supplementary budget, we expect a spend in the region of &euro;6.6 billion.  It is important to point out that not alone will the money that is allocated be spent this year, for next year the arrangements are in place that all Departments can arrange for committal of up to 70% of spend during the course of this year going into next year.  Many of these works are multi-annual in nature, such as roads and hospital programmes.  It is important to point out that arrangements are in place for Departments to pre-commit next year&rsquo;s spend, during the course of this year, at up to 70% of the ceiling that has been allocated to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interested to hear the Taoiseach say that unemployment was rising but rising more slowly.  That is the equivalent of saying we are sinking but sinking more slowly.  We are sinking nevertheless.  A total of 413,000 people out of work is a record, and the number has risen by about 200,000 since this time last year.  We hear a lot of talk these days about cuts in public spending and various budgetary measures; we have had two budgets already this year.  The cost of the extra unemployment can be assumed to be about &euro;20,000 per job if we consider lost taxes and social welfare payments.  All the measures taken in the April budget and the previous October budget &mdash; the income levies, pension levies and cuts in spending programmes &mdash; have been wiped out by the increase in unemployment.  We are talking about an additional cost of around &euro;4 billion to the public purse as a result of that increase in unemployment, not to speak of the personal loss suffered by each individual who has lost his or her job in terms of lost income, lost hope and so on.</P>
        <P>I now turn to what is being done about it.  If the Taoiseach is saying unemployment is rising more slowly, does he have an estimate of what it will be at the end of this year?  I recall that he made a speech prior to the local and European elections in which he told the country he expected that rapid growth would return in 2010&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Election speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;so I presume he has some idea of when unemployment is likely to peak and at what level.  Can he tell us this?  What is his answer to the comments made by the head of the Construction Industry Federation this morning that an additional 100,000 building workers were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the decline in the capital programme?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="617"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I take no pleasure from the fact that unemployment is rising in our country at any time.  People have asked what the trends are and I am telling them what they have been from January to May.  I am stating that as a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no one left now to lose his job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>One takes no pleasure whatever in anyone&rsquo;s losing his or her job, but it is important to point out the trend.  It is clear from the strategies outlined and the models that have been projected for Ireland&rsquo;s economy based on the current world situation that unemployment will continue to rise, unfortunately, before things get better.  We must do everything we can in terms of short-term measures to help people who find themselves unemployed, but we must also fix the economy, and this means dealing with the situation through NAMA, as we are doing, to fix the banking system so we can get credit flowing again.  We need to strengthen the balance sheets of the banks, remove the stressed assets from those balance sheets, and make sure investment money flows into the country to get credit going.  That is the most important way in which businesses will be able to withstand the pressures they are facing.</P>
        <P>In addition, we must bring order to our public finances; without that, external and internal confidence cannot be restored.  We must also continue improving competitiveness.  Unit labour costs have dropped by 4% in this country compared to an average increase of 3% in other EU countries during the course of the year, which has improved the competitiveness of the Irish economy by 7%.  This shows the flexibility in the Irish economy, with responses coming from the various sectors to get us back into a competitive position.  These are the facts.  There has been an average fall in exports of 20% in Germany, while in Ireland the reduction in output has been 5% or 6%.  That is a good performance compared to our competitors.  However, until growth returns to the economy we will not be in a position to create jobs on a sustainable basis.  Those are the issues we must face.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, since September 2008 we have seen a steep increase in unemployment of 197,000.  One takes no joy in that.  However, to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is clear, based on the projections, that by the end of this year unemployment will be in the region of 15% or 15.5% and could rise again going into the following year.  We must do everything we can to make sure that when the world economy picks up and demand improves, this small open economy, whose livelihood depends on the goods and services it exports, is in a position to take advantage of this in terms of competitiveness.  That is the whole purpose and strategy of the Government.  The most important aspects of our strategy are to put our public finances in order, proceed with the restructuring of the banking sector, which has received support, and improve our competitiveness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a disaster.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, we will continue to take whatever structural and short-term measures are necessary to alleviate the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that the Government is not giving sufficient priority to employment and to dealing with the problem of unemployment.  What the Taoiseach seems to be saying is that if we sort out the banks and the public finances, a recovery in employment will happen as a consequence.  There are a couple of things wrong with that argument.  First, we are pumping large amounts of borrowed money into the banks, including &euro;3 billion into Anglo Irish Bank recently, and the banks are not lending.  Credit is not flowing in the economy to enable businesses to generate employment and save jobs.  Second, the Taoiseach argues that if the public finances are sorted out, economic recovery will follow.  However, let us take, for <Col N="618"/>example, the speculation, which the Taoiseach was not inclined to pursue yesterday, that &euro;1.5 billion would be taken out of the social welfare budget.  If employment rises to the level he is expecting &mdash; 15% or 15.5% &mdash; that will wipe out any savings made on that side.  It follows that the Government cannot either help the economy recover or put the public finances back in order without dealing with the issue of employment.</P>
        <P>The difficulty I have with the Government&rsquo;s approach is that it does not seem to be sufficiently urgent.  For example, last December it announced with great fanfare a plan for Ireland&rsquo;s smart economy.  It was a plan the Labour Party agreed with; we had been talking about such a plan for some time.  However, it took the Government six months to appoint a task force to advance it.  It only appointed one last week.  If it was serious about trying to create employment and get the economy moving it would be showing a little more urgency and would not have taken six months to set up a task force to advance the proposals, many of which are good ones, to develop a smart economy.</P>
        <P>We had the same thing yesterday.  The Taoiseach mentioned a proposal, about which he has been talking to ICTU, to provide &euro;250 million in assistance, although it is debatable whether this is sufficient, to retain existing employment, but he was not in a position to tell us how many jobs it would actually protect.  The information he gave was extremely vague.  The difficulty is, on a day when we heard that record numbers of people are unemployed, that the Government is not giving sufficient priority to getting people back to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that contention whatsoever.  I will deal with the issues raised by the Deputy in the order that he raised them.  In regard to getting credit flowing again, the situation is not just about the recapitalisation issue and the bank guarantee which, by the way, were regarded by the IMF as fundamental to maintaining financial stability in the State at the present time.  The third leg to that stool is the need to provide an assets management agency to take the impaired assets off the balance sheets.  That is necessary and it has been approved and agreed.</P>
        <P>The proposal by Fine Gael on this matter involves reneging on senior bond holders.  That is the Lehman Brothers solution and we see where that got us.  The proposal from the Labour Party in respect of the banking situation is a pre-emptive nationalisation of all banks.  That is the Icelandic model and we know where that got us.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government misrepresented its policies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to do that and I am entitled to point out that a paucity of alternatives is being provided by the Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is happy to misrepresent our position.  When will he come into the House and present his proposals?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach must be allowed to answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the question about jobs, the quickest and best way to provide jobs for our economy is to return growth to our economy.  However, we cannot return growth to the economy in the context of a public finance position that has to be rectified if people are saying we must spend, spend and spend more.  We cannot do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Government did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second point I want to make in regard to the jobs situation is that, as I have pointed out, the measures we have taken, including the pension levy and other difficult decisions, which are impositions on our people and all of which were opposed in this House, were the means by which we have improved our unit labour costs <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other competitors by 7% this year alone.  This has been commented upon by everybody in the international community as a major achievement by our economy in the current circumstances.  If we are going to get into a competitive position when the upturn comes in the world economy, we have to make those decisions.  They are difficult decisions that impose difficulties for our people, but the Government is implementing these policies for those reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulties people are experiencing were caused by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>There is no alternative coming from the Opposition except to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of the Opposition would be a major improvement on this Government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="620"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that we should spend, spend and spend more.  We have an Opposition finance spokesman who says we should cut more and every other spokesman saying we are not spending enough.  That is the position of the Front Bench across from me.  That is the truth of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach unaware of what the IMF said about the Government&rsquo;s performance?  He should read its report.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should be allowed to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should stop digging.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the truth of it.  We cannot have a rational debate on this issue because the Opposition is trying to play both sides of the fence.</P>
        <P>Third, in regard to the question Deputy Gilmore asked about the smart economy, the innovation task force was set up in response to the innovation alliance which Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Dublin, came forward with some months ago.  They asked for the innovation task force to be brought forward and that was done.  Its task is to look at innovation across the economy, not just in regard to the smart economy.  Innovation is the only way in which we will be able to do things better.  We must do things in a smarter way in order to be more competitive in a way that is price sensitive to market demands.  Everybody agrees this is required.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Smart Economy document, I am glad it is now getting some belated support.  I look forward to continued support for it.  We are trebling spending on research and development, with &euro;2.5 billion allocated this year.  When we came into office 12 years ago, the research spend was zero.  Not &euro;1 billion or &euro;500 million but zero.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the real economy?  It is on the floor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the building industry, as I have outlined, it was always our budgetary strategy to provide for increased capital spend from the public capital programme in an effort not to replace but to alleviate the downturn that was coming in the residential construction sector in any case.  The seismic change that occurred since last August when Lehman Brothers collapsed meant that the industry has now come almost to a halt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government created a property bubble.  We are now seeing the consequences of the bursting of that bubble.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see in due course that residential construction will increase from 25,000 or 30,000 units per annum to 45,000 into the future, which is the sustainable level.</P>
        <P>In regard to the statements by the chief executive officer of the Construction Industry Federation, I have just made the case, explained what the situation is and how it works.  There will be &euro;7.3 billion in public capital spend this year.  We have allocated &euro;6.6 billion for next year as things stand pre-budget.  There will have to be some contribution made from the capital spend towards the correction in the public finances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>How much will that be?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="621"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be a budgetary decision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is asking the question which she herself will not answer in respect of the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>How much is involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy either wants a reply or she does not. The full output will be<?oasys _jy ?>20%, allowing for the change in tendering prices so that output and volume can be maintained. Of what is currently committed, up to 70% of next year&rsquo;s budget for the capital programme can be provided for by Departments during the course of this year. That is the factual position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously in the House, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to use the coming period to afford the Government partners the opportunity to look at how we are progressing in achieving the goals set out in the programme for Government.  We will pursue this work throughout the summer recess.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government makes clear that its delivery is based on a growth rate of 4.5%.  It was negotiated prior to the worst global economic downturn since the 1930s.  Our review is about ensuring the programme for Government reflects current economic realities.  There is also a precedent for such a review, as has been the case in previous Governments.  Along with reviewing the existing programme, a review will also allow us to see where the various policies we have developed over the past two years can be better integrated into our plans for developing Ireland up to 2012.  I particularly refer to the ambitious Smart Economy document which we published before Christmas.  The review will also underline the considerable amount of the programme for Government that has already been achieved.</P>
        <P>To date, organisations such as the IMF, the European Commission and the ESRI have broadly recognised that the policies we are pursuing are the right ones to get Ireland working again.  The review will be informed by the five-year economic plan as agreed with the European Commission, the work of the Commission on Taxation which is due to report next month, and the analysis and advice provided to Government by the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  We are determined to undertake a comprehensive review of the programme and we expect to have this process brought to a conclusion in the autumn.</P>

	<P>I understand Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s partner in government, the Green Party, is to have a party conference on 18 July to discover whether party members can find it within themselves to support the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  I understand members will also discuss their views on a review of the programme for Government.  Has the Taoiseach had any discussions with the Green Party about the programme for Government following the European and local elections?  Has he put in place a process for a review from his own perspective?  What timeline does he envisage for a review of the programme to be completed?  In other words, following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s discussions with the Green Party, when will we have a revised programme for Government. </P>

	<P>As I stated, the existing programme continues to be implemented.  We are simply taking account of the fact that we have had a serious downturn in the world economy, the worst, as I noted, since the 1930s.  This means we have to review the assumptions that underlie the programme, define our priorities and move forward with the review, the Commission on Taxation and the various reports coming to Government and feeding into the Estimates and budgetary processes.  This will be an important aspect of the Government&rsquo;s work in the coming months, quite apart from the fact that we wish to conduct this review in any event.  An internal party consultation is taking place and as soon as the D&aacute;il rises we will be able to put our minds to engaging in a review process over the summer and into the autumn.  We will return to the House with a revised programme when the D&aacute;il resumes. </P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question in respect of a matter of concern to people all over the country, namely, the capital programme.  In 2008, some 300 schools were in planning and 1,000 in the pre-planning process.  The school building programme for 2009 has been reduced by &euro;30 million.  The Government has scrapped the minor works programme for 2008 and 2009, while the summer works programme, which was abolished in 2008, was partly restored this year.  There is a lack of transparency and effectiveness in the entire school building programme.</P>
        <P>As has been pointed out on numerous occasions, 41,000 pupils are being taught in 2,253 prefabricated buildings in 900 schools nationwide.  The Taoiseach and I have evidence &mdash; it has also been produced by Deputy Quinn on numerous occasions &mdash; that the cost of building with blocks and concrete using generic designs is now cheaper than the cost of providing prefabricated buildings.  In Ratoath, County Meath, more than &euro;1.08 million was spent on prefabs in 2008.  This is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>May I assume that the school building programme will not be axed in the review of the programme for Government given that we know better value is available because tenders are coming in 20% lower than previously?  This will provide thousands of jobs as well as facilities for children for the next 50 years.  If we are serious about being competitive when the upturn in the global economy takes place, we must have facilities which teachers, pupils and parents know are capable of meeting demands.  This is a mechanical and structural position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Taoiseach assure me that the review of the programme for Government he will conduct with his Government&rsquo;s partners, the Green Party, will not result in the school building programme being axed?  Will the Government take some interest in pushing forward schools building projects which can now proceed given that increased value can be achieved through decreased costs, contractors are available and jobs can be created?  Will the Taoiseach give me that guarantee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know from where Deputy Kenny is getting his information because he is totally wrong.  More than 110 major school projects are being conducted this year.  A <Col N="623"/>summer works programme is taking place this year, of which 1,100 schools are beneficiaries.  I do not know what the Deputy is talking about when he states there is no summer works scheme.  The summer works scheme was introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To be fair to Members, it is not something we have had to do on many occasions because there is usually co-operation across all sides of the House.

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny raised a number of questions about the programme for Government.  He asked about specific issues and the status of policies in the programme.  He sought a commitment that we were not going to axe school-building next year.  There is a rule in the House that specific questions are referred to the relevant line Ministers.  However, I have no problem in dealing with the questions to the best of my ability, as I always seek to accommodate the Deputy with the facts.</P>
        <P>The facts concerning this matter are that the capital programme for all three levels of education last year was &euro;859 million.  This year it works out at about &euro;841 million.  When one takes into account that tender prices have dropped by 20%, the output in 2009 for the money that is being allocated will be greater than the output obtained for &euro;859 million last year.  There was a premise in the question which suggested that there was a cutback in our school building <Col N="626"/>programme this year, which is not correct when one looks at the output itself.  What is not being taken into account in the contention made by Deputy Kenny is that tender prices are reduced by 20% this year compared to last year.  That being the case, I was refuting the contention being made by the Deputy in his questions, first, that we were cutting back on school building and, second, in seeking a commitment from me that we would not axe it &mdash; in other words, that we would not eliminate school building from our capital programme next year.  We have no intention of eliminating school building from our programme next year.  Approximately &euro;650 million has been spent this year on first and second levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy then went on to ask about temporary accommodation, which has been a feature of providing for school buildings.  One of the policy objectives is to reduce the number of temporary buildings we have over a period.  In fast developing areas we have thankfully seen the Department&rsquo;s ability to cope by way of modular buildings which are more easily and quickly constructed.  In that way it is possible to provide school classrooms under that arrangement within a 16-week period.  That has been achieved in various locations, particularly in fast-developing areas around Dublin.  It is true that we continue to have prefabricated buildings, but of the total number of classrooms the percentage is quite low.  It is a continuing priority for successive Governments to deal with that matter, but there will always be cases for temporary accommodation because of increased enrolment over a short period.  Such accommodation, which can still be good and adequate, is provided pending a capital project being prepared for such schools for the purpose of extensions.  That goes though the various phases, as the Deputy will know, since I recall that on one occasion he was a Minister of State at the Department of Education.  I had the pleasure of going on many deputations to his office along with former Deputy Tom Enright.  There may not have been a lot of success because there were not many resources around at the time.</P>

	<P>I wish to go back to the earlier part of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply with regard to the programme for Government.  Did I hear him correctly as saying that the Government will publish a revised programme for Government before we come back in the autumn?  Perhaps he will clarify that for us.  Who will be a party to the revision of the programme?  Will there be a bilateral discussion between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party or will there be any involvement by the former Progressive Democrats?  Are they still considered to be part of the Government?  Will the Independent Deputies on the Government side have any involvement in renegotiating the programme?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will this be a total revision of the programme for Government?  I noticed that the Taoiseach was talking about revising the economic assumptions which underlay the programme, including the assumption of 4.5% growth which was the basis of the programme.  Therefore will there be a total revision or does it only concern those aspects of the programme that arise from the changed economic circumstances that will the subject of revision?  Has there been any exchange of papers by any of the parties in Government in respect of a revision of the programme?  What is the status of the programme <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s an bord snip nua?  Does the Taoiseach expect that the report of that body will comment on the commitments in the programme for Government?  In respect of the arrangements that were made with Independent Deputies &mdash; which the latter say they have in writing and which relate to commitments on public expenditure, but which were never published &mdash; was the McCarthy group given access to the written documents the Independent Deputies claim they made with the Government in respect of certain expenditure items?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s questions, first, the review of the programme for Government will be formally undertaken when the D&aacute;il rises.  It will be based on prior consultation that has taken place within the parties themselves to progress the review of the programme over the course of the autumn.  When the D&aacute;il resumes for the next session, as envisaged in late September or early October, I am hopeful that we will have a reviewed programme in place.</P>
        <P>Second, the committee to look into spending programmes and public service numbers is reviewing all spending programmes.  It is examining every area of expenditure and Government activity.  It will be reporting to us and making recommendations.  Ultimately, what recommendations are accepted and how we proceed will be a matter for decision by Cabinet.</P>
        <P>Third, as regards the review of the programme, the discussions will take place between ourselves and the Green Party, and the Cabinet will be involved.  I will keep those who support the Government briefed on the outcome of those discussions.  In addition, I will ensure that we maintain the support of those Deputies who are supporting the Government on the basis of our commitment to bringing growth and restoring order to our public finances.</P>
        <P>Fourth, all areas of policy will be reviewed in the programme.  All social policy objectives are predicated on financial resources.  With regard to changes in the supplementary budget figures, the capital spend between 2009 and 2013, for example, envisages over &euro;31 billion in expenditure.  That is a modification of the original spend envisaged in the national development plan, which was predicated on 4.5% growth.  These adjustments in policy objectives and priorities are already part of the ongoing  Estimates and budgetary process. The review of the programme, however, will take into account what our economic strategy will be, in light of the current economic circumstances which are quite different from those that pertained in June 2007 when the programme was first negotiated.  The assumptions therein were similar to those by all parties in respect of the manifesto commitments they made when going before the people in 2007.</P>

	<P>Who is involved in the review of the programme for Government?  Is it a case that each Minister has been asked to address his or her respective areas of interest within the programme?  Does that involve an appraisal of the cost of measures that the Government wishes to see continued?  Is it a process that is solely between the two parties in Government, and between the Taoiseach and Deputy John Gormley?</P>
        <P>What is the situation between the Government and independent Deputies Harney, Grealish, Lowry and Healy Rae?  What is the position on their respective areas of interest and agreements, beginning with the role of the Progressive Democrats in the negotiation of the programme for Government after the 2007 general election and continuing with the commitments which the other independent Deputies claim to have secured from the Government?  They keep these commitments under wraps and away from public scrutiny.  Is it the case that all of these matters will be addressed and that the detail of a new programme for Government will be published?  Will it be debated in this House after the summer recess?</P>
        <P>The section on social affairs in the current programme for Government states that the Government will continue to maintain the value of the lowest rate of social welfare payments, as agreed in the national action plan on social inclusion.  Does the Taoiseach accept that such a commitment is crucial?  Any tinkering with the supports for people dependent on social welfare will lead to the risk of poverty, especially among young people who are in family arrangements that are dependent on social welfare.  There is currently a softening up effort of the electorate in advance of December&rsquo;s budget, particularly those who are dependent on social welfare.  Can the Taoiseach give an assurance this morning that the commitment to the national action plan on social inclusion will be honoured after the agreement on the new programme for Government and after the budget expected later this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The working method to be decided by the parties will emerge, based on the political discussions that will take place between now and the autumn.  We will come forward with a reviewed programme before the return of the D&aacute;il in late September.  The method to be adopted is a matter for the parties concerned, and we will proceed on a pragmatic basis.  We intend to maintain majority support for the programme, including the support of Independent <Col N="629"/>Deputies for which we are grateful, in the interest of bringing stability back to the country&rsquo;s finances and ensuring that we work our way through the biggest economic crisis to the hit the world economy since the 1930s.  That is the work that will be undertaken over the next three years and we hope to have the support of sufficient Members of this House to do so.</P>
        <P>Subject to the availability of resources, we will continue to give the greatest possible priority to continue with the school building programme, as I mentioned to Deputy Kenny in a previous reply.  The amount of resources that provide for social welfare is at a record level.  Apart from the recent phenomenon of rising unemployment, the rates and provisions for social welfare recipients is a record of which I am very proud, as a member of successive Governments.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has asked about maintaining basic rates, but we have exceeded the rates to maintain standards of living for those on pensions in those periods when we had resources available to us.  In some cases, the rate of increase in social welfare in any given year was four times the rate of inflation.  That is rightly the case because we were seeking to achieve social objectives arising out of the success of the economic policies that were being pursued at the time.</P>
        <P>We are now in a new situation but I do not accept the allegation that the public is being softened up.  This is about confronting the magnitude of the problems that the country faces and which will require difficult choices.  All areas of expenditure have to be examined in an objective fashion, in an effort to bring us through this period.  We need to know the sustainable level of expenditure that this country can provide, given the current level of our revenues.  We need to know how soon we can return growth to the economy and bring more revenues to the Exchequer so that we can rebuild and go further again.</P>
        <P>As a member of the euro area we are required under the Stability and Growth Pact rules to bring our deficits back to less than 3% by 2013.  That is an agreement we have with partners in the EU and this set of rules applies to any Government in the coming years.  It is not a question of softening up anybody, but a question of making sure that everyone has a clear understanding of the magnitude of the challenges that face us, the choices confronting us and how we are going to proceed.  That is a matter of political choice about which there will be much political debate.</P>
        <P>This is not a cynical exercise.  It is about bringing to the attention of the people the state of the public finances, the choices we have, and the spending programmes that must be examined.  Ultimately, it will be a decision of the Cabinet and of this House.  That is the democratic nature of our politics and is the serious task that the Government intends to undertake in the coming months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With the announcement this morning that 413,000 people are on the live register, does the Taoiseach accept that the current level of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at &euro;204.30 as a basic payment for those over 20 is barely set at survival levels?  No one in this House could anticipate surviving on &euro;204.30 per week.  This is against the backdrop of there being no jobs available because the Government has clearly failed to address that critical need not only in terms of job retention but job creation.  That is the critical failure of this Government to address holistically the challenge that has presented itself over the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>How in heaven&rsquo;s name does the Taoiseach believe a further reduction in social welfare supports will, in any way, be a contribution to addressing the needs of our people?  We will further penalise the least well off in society, remove from them any modicum of survival levels and further restrict their potential to contribute in terms of turnover in spending power in their respective communities.  The whole thing is a cycle of decline which will continue to be fed by this Government if it pursues this course.</P><Col N="630"/>
        <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to recognise that this will lead to major social upheaval and great pain for the least well off in society.  As he has done in regard to the schools building programme, will he put to rest and give peace of mind to the 413,000 people and their families who are dependent on social welfare that they will not face an even harder and more straitened Christmas following the budget later this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy that when we came into office the rate about which he spoke was equivalent to &euro;93 per week.  We increased it.  I never suggest social welfare rates provide a great standard of living for people who are dependent on them and that is why we must be very careful about how we proceed and protect the most vulnerable in our society to the greatest extent we possibly can in the context of where we are.</P>
        <P>We will borrow &euro;22 billion to &euro;23 billion this year.  We need &euro;72 million per week to maintain the current level of services.  The Government is not in a position <i>ad infinitum</i> or over the short term, never mind over the medium term, to maintain that level of deficit budgeting because it will not be able to provide it.  Look at what people in employment must face in terms of reduced pay, increased levies or taxes or the various policies we have had to implement to take cognisance of the new situation the country is in, which is not unique from other countries.  However, we must deal with our issues in a responsible way.</P>
        <P>People&rsquo;s standards of living are going back to 2004-05 levels.  One should consider the standards of living people enjoyed ten or five years before that.  I am trying to bring a sense of perspective to what we are being asked to do.  Of course, no one wants to go back; everyone wants to forge forward.  We have been doing that for ten or 12 years.  During that time hundreds of thousands of working families were taken out of the tax net and hundreds of thousands of people paid less taxes.  Some 800,000 more jobs were created during the course of the Administrations in which I served since 1997.  We are now seeing some job losses because of the current situation.</P>
        <P>Rather than paint an apocalyptic picture, we must try to maintain a sense of perspective because we must be able to communicate to the people the level of the challenge and what we are asking of them.  The reason we must consider these options, difficult though they may be, is that it is not a sustainable position in the context of the current public finances to suggest, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has done, that there are areas of expenditure which are immune from consideration.  If the total level of funds are coming in at &euro;32 billion or &euro;33 billion this year and the total spend is &euro;55 billion, for how long or how often does the Deputy believe we can tell the people that can be maintained?  It cannot be maintained and we must be honest and straightforward with the people.</P>
        <P>We must then decide on the political choices within those realities with which we must contend.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in can argue his case if he wants to see protection of  the &euro;21.3 billion social welfare spend in all respects and in every circumstance.  That is one third of spend, another third is public sector pay and pensions and the remaining third is the cost of providing public services.</P>
        <P>Does Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in want to take the amount of money, which we must take out, totally out of the delivery cost of providing public services to the exclusion of everything else?  What impact will that have?  The Deputy often speaks about the need to maintain service levels in the public service.  He cannot have it every way.  One cannot count twice or not count at all.</P>

	<P>We must set out challenges and debate these issues in the coming months.  Let us do so on the basis that we are trying to come forward with an outcome which gets us through this.  The current financial position would not be accepted by anybody taking up the responsibilities we hold.  If that is the case, the clear implication is that one cannot maintain this level of spend on the basis of the revenues currently coming forward.  What one must do is cut back in some areas.  We will come forward again when growth returns.  Growth will play its part in bringing forward further revenues into the economy.  Certain major structural changes must take place for that to happen.</P>

	<P>I do not object to hearing the Taoiseach speak but we get a 20 minute lecture on each occasion.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the Taoiseach spoke about being honest and straightforward, about the democratic politics we have here &mdash; 75% of the people might have voted against the Government in the recent elections &mdash; and about being straight with the facts.  When he spoke about the unemployment figures on Leaders&rsquo; Questions, he said this was the lowest rate of increase in a long time and he spoke of seasonally adjusted figures.  I beg to differ with the Taoiseach because I am speaking about people signing on the register.  The figures for January, February, March, April, May and June were 36,498, 26,576, 16,384, 13,177, 12,423 and 21,721, respectively.</P>

	<P>A slight increase last month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said this was the slowest rate of increase and that it was actually decreasing.  It means 21,721 extra men and women signed on the dole.  In the first six months of the year, 127,000, that is 1,000 every day, have signed on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we are to be straightforward and up-front with the facts, these are the figures that must be recognised, not the seasonally adjusted figures.  They refer to people, men and women, who go every week to the social welfare exchanges to sign on.  For June, this is 21,721 extra men and women yet the Taoiseach lectured us this morning on seasonally adjusted figures with a Department of Finance response claiming this is the slowest rate of increase.  If we are talking about getting out of this national crisis and dealing with it in an air of reality, will the Taoiseach accept it is 21,721 more people unemployed, an increase of 1,000 people every day?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the position concerning the debt-to-GDP ratio?  In the past 12 months, the Taoiseach frequently gave the House figures stating it has increased from the 20% mark to the 40% mark.  At one stage he stated it was rising beyond 49% and suggested it may reach 100% before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>It is the political issue, not the exact details, that are of concern.  Has there been a Government decision on using this window of opportunity for borrowing?  For example, the latest tranche of money provided to Anglo Irish Bank came from the Central Bank&rsquo;s surplus funds.  Does the Taoiseach intend to allow the debt-to-GDP ratio increase to service his first priority, banking stability, and then his second priority, fiscal stability, at the cost of using this window of opportunity to impact on the rising unemployment figures?  If that is the case, will the Taoiseach indicate what is the State paying in addition on external borrowing rates as a result of reputational damage?</P><Col N="633"/>
        <P>On the unemployment figures, if the Taoiseach were to repeat the answer he has already given, it would mean he has tacitly rejected any suggestion of introducing a stimulus package.  While I would like to be wrong, as I read it, the Taoiseach has given priority to banking stability followed by a conservative fiscal statement in the short term.  He is hoping at the end of this to have a better trading environment and then will be looking at tackling the jobs situation.  If this is the case, he should state that because it is a huge political difference between us.</P>

	<P>The answers he gave on all previous occasions he was asked this question were for the actual live register figure.  The Taoiseach should take the opportunity to correct the record.</P>
        <P>The difference is that for the seasonally adjusted figure the month-on-month increase in the number unemployed is 11,400.  However, for the actual live register figure the month-on-month increase is 21,721.  On the basis of the seasonally adjusted figure, the Taoiseach claimed the rate in the rise in unemployment was falling.  That is not the case; it is rising.  The increase was 21,721 between May and June as against 11,000 between April and May, 13,000 between March and April and 16,000 between February and March.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach was obviously giving a reply that was designed to make the figures look as attractive as possible from the Government&rsquo;s point of view.  He should take the opportunity to tell the House the truth about the live register figures.</P>

	<P>We are entitled to have a discussion on what they have to say.  If we fail to do one or two of the three things I have mentioned, our approach will not work.  All three have to be done simultaneously.  I would like to speak about the question of borrowing and the extent to which there is room for a stimulus package.  The stimulus package being provided by the Government is in excess of the stimulus packages being provided by other national governments.  Our capital programme provides a stimulus of 5% into the economy.  If one examines the severe contraction of over 8% that took place in the first quarter of this year, one will find that 4% of it related to the construction sector and 4% related to the rest of the economy.  I have been asked whether there is additional room for borrowing on the part of the Government, in order to stimulate the economy further.  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We do not have the capacity to increase our deficits from 10.5% or 12% this year to 13% or 14% in 2010 and 15% thereafter.  We do not have that room.  We have to use the resources that are available to us, including significant borrowings.  Of every &euro;5 of current expenditure this year, &euro;1 has been borrowed.  In addition, this year&rsquo;s entire capital expenditure of &euro;7.3 billion has been borrowed.  Approximately 11% of tax revenues are being used to service the national debt, and that figure is rising.  If we are to ensure that a greater proportion of the resources we are creating on the tax side is not used to pay for our rising debt, we must control our deficits.  As Deputies are aware, our deficit has spiralled way beyond what was projected, as a result of the real economic impact the whole global downturn is having on us.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will speak about the stimulus that is being provided.  It is not a question of taking a sort of monetarist approach.  It is a question of providing a stimulus through the public capital programme, the investment in which is one of the highest in the world.  We are continuing to invest in the programme at a specific rate of our total GNP, even at a time when we are very stressed on the financial side, in terms of where our deficit is.  That is a fair assessment of the contribution the Government is making to increasing economic activity.  It is in addition to the fiscal adjustments we clearly and evidently have to continue with.  By the way, those adjustments were agreed by the social partners when they analysed the situation.  The need to reduce deficits to below 3% between now and 2013 is a fundamental fact of life that is agreed by all.  The choices we can make within our limited room for manoeuvre are matters for debate.  Sometimes our discussions involve deciding whether it is a relevant factor at all.  That is the constraining factor.  That issue provides us with a means of financial stability in terms of our examination of the banking situation.  In return for the stability we enjoy within the euro currency area, we have undertaken certain obligations in line with the rules of the Stability and <Col N="637"/>Growth Pact.  That is where we are at.  If we can have a discussion on that in the coming months, we will do this Parliament and the people proud.  At least we will all be in the real world of where it is at.  Those who continue to suggest there is an easier way of doing it are prepared to forget about the figures.  We have to be honest with each other and face into that.  I would like that debate.  There is a great deal of collective wisdom in this House to contribute to that debate.  In three years time, we will have a general election.  We will have the election whenever we have it.  Deputies on the other side would like it to take place tomorrow.  I think it will take place in three years time.</P>

	<P>This House has a set of rules for the examination and scrutiny, and acceptance or rejection, of legislation.  The rules in question have stood the test of time in this House.  They have given us a good body of legislation that serves the people well.  These rules are being set aside on a regular basis by Government.  The rules by which we operate are agreed by all sides of the House.  We have the power to change them, of course, but they are being set aside regularly by the Government, which is abusing its majority in this instance. </P>
        <P>The first item states,  &ldquo;It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders...&rdquo;.  That means it is being proposed by the Executive that the rules of the House are set aside to allow it make its own rules and impose its will on this legislative assembly.  The next part of the statement is to the effect that everything in the Bill, irrespective of whether it is debated, and every proposal from the Minister to amend the Bill, will be accepted by matters being brought to a conclusion through the mechanism of one question from the Chair.  Again, the Government, using its majority, will force that through.  That is an abuse of the majority the Government holds and it is not a democratic use of that majority.  A set of rules exists that is adjusted over a long period of time so that there is fair and proper examination of legislation.  This is simply setting that aside and I believe it is an insult, not just to the Opposition, but to the people who elected us.</P>
        <P>It is one of eight items of legislation this week that will not be discussed.  It simply is legislation by diktat from the Executive, which is supposed to be responsible to and subject to the will of this House.

	<P>This Bill has to be enacted as soon as possible for a number of reasons, the most important of which is that the stamp duty and additional age-related tax credits provided for in Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill are to apply from 1 January this year.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has recommended, having regard to the risk of challenge to the provisions, that early enactment is advisable.  Some of the insurers have indicated they could be pursuing all avenues open to them to prevent the measures from coming into effect. </P>
        <P>Priority is required also in the context of moves to support inter-generational solidarity in the market and to limit perverse incentives to engage in what is known as product segmentation, which would be contrary to the common good objectives.  In addition to the financial <Col N="640"/>measures, the Bill contains a number of provisions that strengthen the regulatory framework, so that it supports community rating and inter-generational solidarity, with which I should have thought the majority of Deputies in the House would agree.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the same principle.  There is no reason this has to be rushed through today.  I have already said we are opposed to the principle of guillotines here and I oppose the proposal for dealing with No. 25 on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I withdraw any inference I made previously that the Taoiseach was speaking nonsense.  I regret that statement and withdraw it.  I did not agree with him, but it was not nonsense.  It is a level of mutual respect.</P>
        <P>The argument on this is the same as the previous argument.  There is no need for a guillotine on this Bill.  There is no urgency on it.  It could have been done months ago or can be done months in the future.  There is no urgency on it and we oppose the guillotine.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a crisis in the pre-NAMA period.  There is serious concern among a range of enterprises over banks declining to give any credit or overdraft facilities because they assume that particular developers and so on will be taken over by the NAMA regime.  This is a crisis in the intervening period.  In the light of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments this morning, let us have a debate about the different proposals to sort out our fiscal and banking difficulties.  When can we expect the NAMA legislation to be introduced?  Will it happen in September?  Has the Government any fixed date as to when the legislation will be prepared?</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are to carry out a review of the programme for Government.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, the leader of the Green Party, has said on a number of occasions that he would support holding a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  Is that part of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s thinking given its importance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We were given indications some time ago that we would get the heads of the NAMA legislation before the D&aacute;il rose, including the all-important head dealing with the issue of the valuation of the impaired loans and the price the State would pay to bail out the banks and take over the impaired loans.  Is it likely that the NAMA legislation will be ready before the middle of the autumn?  I understand there are serious difficulties with arriving at a reasonable basis of valuation that does not imply enormous extra costs over and beyond what we have been already told about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the Taoiseach on the NAMA legislation and children&rsquo;s rights referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the NAMA legislation, Deputies will be aware we are working to a schedule in respect of this urgent legislation, which is complex.  We hope to bring it forward for publication in July.  That is the target set by the Minister for Finance.  If necessary we will arrange for its enactment by a recall of the D&aacute;il in, perhaps, September.  The Minister is working hard on the matter as is the Attorney General who plays a key role in drafting the legislation and ensuring the legislative model of NAMA is robust and will withstand all legal and constitutional scrutiny.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Deputy Burton, we are taking advice on the matter.  Also, the legislation will require EU Commission approval in terms of arrangements that will be set up in regard to valuation methods and so on.  The whole purpose of this is to reduce exposure for the taxpayer than would otherwise be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>On that issue, is it proposed to take all Stages of the Bill in September?  What is the purpose of publishing the legislation in July if it is not going to be dealt with until September?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of publishing legislation at any time is to allow adequate time for people to assimilate, examine it and to prepare for debate of the important issues set out in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion was made that the heads of the Bill would be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to allow outside opinions to be obtained by the committee which would then prepare a report on the Bill prior to its being debated in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for another day.  I call Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="645"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Deputies Kenny and Burton is unsatisfactory.  It is now three months since the Government announced its intention to establish NAMA.  We were informed through the Budget Statement at the time that legislation would be introduced as a matter of urgency.  We are still no clearer in regard to when this legislation will appear.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer today is vague in terms of its stage of preparation.  I am surprised to hear at this late stage, three months after the announcement of the initiative, of outstanding issues in regard to its constitutionality and EU approval.  I would have expected those issues to have been clarified at this stage.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has already told the House the D&aacute;il will go into recess on 10 July 2009.  When is it intended to reconvene the D&aacute;il and will the NAMA legislation be before the House in the first week of its being reconvened?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I said, the drafting of this legislation is proceeding as a matter of urgency and priority.  It is important legislation.  I was making the point that the Attorney General is ensuring that the legislation being brought forward is robust and will withstand scrutiny.  That is normal criteria in respect of the preparation of any legislation and is an important consideration in this case also.  As I mentioned to the House already, the Minister for Finance intends to have this legislation brought to Government, approved and published during the course of this month.  That is the target he has set himself and those working on this issue and he is hopeful he can meet that target.  However, he has also indicated that he is prepared, given the urgency of the legislation and the priority being afforded to it by Government as part of its effort to get credit flowing back into the real economy as quickly as possible, to bring forward this legislation by way of an early return of the D&aacute;il.  No decision in that regard will be made until such time as the legislation has been prepared and approved by Government.</P>

	<P>Last week, I asked the Taoiseach about promised legislation from the Minister for Education and Science from whom I received a note in respect of one of the issues raised, namely, the student support Bill.  Another piece of legislation has been outstanding for more than a year.  There are two primary schools acting without any legal basis, both of which have just completed their first year.  When will the VEC patronage legislation be drafted and moved in this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the Bill were cleared by Government at its meeting on 23 June.  Detailed preparation on the legislation will commence later this year.</P>

	<P>I wish to inquire again of the Taoiseach if work has progressed on preparation of the financial services regulation Bill.  Has final drafting of that legislation been completed and when is it proposed to introduce it to the House?</P>
        <P>Another Bill on which I would like clarification is the criminal justice (cybercrime and attacks against information systems) Bill, which is listed No. 76 in section C of the legislative programme.  A number of parents have in recent times expressed concern in regard to the use of the Internet by sexual predators and those intent on bullying in terms of young people and <Col N="646"/>children.  Does the Government intend to broaden the scope of that Bill or will it be brought before the House with a view to addressing the issues and concern of parents?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The financial services regulation Bill is a consolidation Bill.  No date has yet been fixed for its publication.  The relevant Department is currently dealing with other legislative priorities, including that which we have just discussed.</P>
        <P>On the second issue, no date has been set for publication of that legislation either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise another issue on which the Ceann Comhairle may be able to assist me.  One of the pillars of democracy is the ability to obtain replies in the House to parliamentary questions.  I am concerned about a reply I received from a Minister, whom I will not name at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan cannot raise such matters on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reply states, &ldquo;You will be aware that information in relation to any applicant other than to a duly authorised legal representative can only be issued by the Refugee Tribunal with the written approval of the applicant&rdquo;.

        <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that it is sensible, from a cost and convenience point of view, to have the by-election held on the same day as the Lisbon treaty referendum which he has signalled for early October?  If he is open to giving due consideration to the holding of both on the same day, it will be necessary to move the writ at the conclusion of next week&rsquo;s business to allow that to happen.

        <P>The European Commission will publish new guidelines on rights of movement within the EU for non-EU partners of European citizens in durable relationships, creating a chasm in terms of the rights of non-EU partners of Irish citizens and of EU citizens.

	<P>I had hoped the Ceann Comhairle would stay because I take issue with this.  I have been informed the amendment is in conflict with the principle of the Bill but I fail to understand how.  One of my colleagues explained to me that it might not be included in the Long Title or something of that nature but this is clear: &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister for Health and Children my appoint by order or orders but not before the requirements of the Voluntary Health Insurance Act 2008 have been fulfilled.&rdquo;  I see no conflict there.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Long Title of the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to amend the Health Insurance Act 1994, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 and the Insurance Act 1936, in particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>No, it is not agreed.  I want to make clear that I will not co-operate in any shape or fashion with this process unless I get satisfaction on this.  This is key to the Bill.  We will be in breach of EU competition law and we will be taken to the European Court of Justice and fined.  The Spanish were fined &euro;20 million for their breaches and a daily amount thereafter.  Is the Minister going to proceed with this in such a feckless manner?  We will receive a fine that will increase with each day this Bill is enacted before the provisions of solvency are met by the VHI.  That is how we are in conflict with Europe and that is what has been ruled out of order in a most tenuous way.  I cannot accept that and I will not co-operate in any way <Col N="650"/>with business in this House for the remainder of the debate if this is not addressed.  It is scurrilous that the key point we are making is to be ignored.</P>
        <P>I can hear the advice being given to the Acting Chairman but the point is that the EU Commission had not ruled on this before this debate and had not stated it was going to take us to the European Court of Justice.  This is not a rehash, new facts have come to light and they must be discussed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously the EU has decided to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice between Committee and Report Stages.  It is pertinent to the debate and the Minister should explain the relevance in terms of the timing of the legislation.  It was intended that the VHI would have an exemption up to 1 September.  The European Commissioner, who happens to be Mr. Charlie McCreevy, has now referred this to the European Court of Justice, having indicated his intention of doing so at an earlier stage.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As the Minister explained to us on Committee Stage, the VHI does not have the capital at the moment to comply with the requirements of the EU, and getting the capital may be dependent on this legislation, although I do not know whether that is true.  My understanding is that the VHI is expecting to receive funding on the basis of community rating through this interim mechanism but at the moment it is not in a position to comply with the EU directive until it gets an injection of capital, which, as the Minister explained, could come by way of privatisation or from the Government.  The Labour Party is vehemently opposed to the privatisation of the VHI.  The Bill now has all these implications, although it did not before, because of the actions of the Commissioner.  To be helpful, the Minister needs to make a statement on this matter before we can proceed with the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I expect the Minister, if she responds &mdash; as she should &mdash; to refer to her press statement of 25 June, which specifically referred to the European Commission decision.  She stated: &ldquo;The Government had already decided that the VHI should be in a position to attain authorisation as an insurance undertaking from the Financial Regulator and satisfy its prudential requirements as soon as possible.&rdquo;  The Government had already put in place a legislative basis for this in the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008, and the timetable for achieving authorisation was, as she stated, adversely affected by the Supreme Court decision in July 2008 striking down the 2003 risk equalisation scheme.</P>
        <P>We need the Minister to address these matters properly.  The Commission had given approval to the interim scheme in the previous week &mdash; that is, the week before the Minister&rsquo;s statement on 25 June.  Deputy Reilly is correct in his request to have this matter substantively addressed before we proceed from the first amendment validly before the House for consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>From my understanding, we can only have a discussion of the amendments that are tabled.  That is specified under Standing Orders.  This amendment, as I told Deputy Reilly, is out of order as it is in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  When we have a sos at 1.30 p.m. Deputy Reilly will have an opportunity to discuss this with the Ceann Comhairle.  The Bill is being discussed until 5 p.m. today and there will be ample opportunity to raise this matter again if the Ceann Comhairle allows it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 4, line 36, to delete &ldquo;enter into&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;effect&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I will deal with the issues raised and I will discuss my own amendments also.</P>
        <P>I do not say this, as I mentioned last night with regard to another matter, in a complaining way, but when the market was opened up, rightly, on foot of EU directives regarding other health insurers, the issue of the VHI should have been dealt with at that stage.  Unfortunately, it was not.  Since then it has remained the case that the VHI is not in a position to be authorised.  It could not and would not be authorised unless, in a community-rated market, there was a transfer of resources from younger to older people.  That is precisely what this legislation is seeking to do.  It is a prerequisite for the authorisation of the VHI.</P>
        <P>The EU approved this legislation and regards it as a justifiable state aid.  It made the point that the issue of authorisation is dealt with differently under Internal Market rules.  I brought legislation through this House to provide for the authorisation of the VHI, and it was to be authorised by the start of this year.  However, because of the risk profile of its members, it is not possible, without the provisions of this legislation, even to apply for authorisation.  In addition, as I said at the committee, it needs capital, and if this is to come from the State, EU approval is required.  The process of approval could take 18 months because that too comes under state aid rules, and it may be found not to be appropriate.  The Government must discuss all these issues with the company.</P>
        <P>I agree it is unfair that the company is not authorised but it is not possible to do that without a transfer of resources from younger to older people.  That is the policy that has been supported by successive Governments.  The initial risk equalisation scheme was brought in by the parties opposite, not by me.  We have sought over many years to try to introduce it and we have been stopped at every opportunity because companies have engaged in litigation.</P>
        <P>This Bill is seen as the most appropriate way to achieve our ends; it is time-limited to three years and is being done by way of a stamp duty on the companies and a tax credit to the individual members.  I appeal to Members to co-operate with the passing of this legislation because not doing so will serve no purpose if they want to support community rating and the concept of younger people supporting older people.  Even in the USA insurers now want a form of transfer, as they do in the Netherlands, which is held up as an example here, and other countries.  There is no country that has community rating without risk equalisation and younger people supporting older people.  It would be impossible otherwise.</P>
        <P>There are two separate issues here.  What the Deputies opposite seem to want is that the provisions of this Bill would not be enacted until authorisation takes place.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  They cannot be authorised without the provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>All Deputies opposite do not take that position. That is a misrepresentation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>All right.  I misunderstood the Deputy and I apologise for that.  However, that is certainly Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s position.  The purpose of his amendment is that the provisions of this Bill should not take effect until such time as they are authorised.  I can tell him that is impossible.  It could not happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to respond.</P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>The VHI has not reached the required solvency level.  On Committee Stage I asked the Minister who set this level at 40% when the international standard is closer to 25%, and she told me she did not know.  Perhaps she might tell me now whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not tell the Deputy that.  I do know who set the level and I have known for years.  It was set by the independent Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify this issue.  The record of the proceedings on Committee Stage will show that this is an independent function of the regulator, who is not subject to any political influence.  I have said on the record here and at committees that I regard the figure as extremely conservative and I wish it were lower.  However, that is what the regulator, who is responsible for regulating financial services companies, has decided.  In recent times we have, if anything, been critical of a liberal approach to regulation, but that is the approach the regulator adopted.  There is no political function.  The regulator reports to the Minister for Finance, as it happens, but he has no function with regard to this issue, as is the case around Europe.  The solvency II directive from Europe will change this, but it will not be enacted for another couple of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister on Committee Stage why the level was set at 40% here when it is 25% elsewhere.  Perhaps that is what the Minister said she did not know.</P>
        <P>Anybody looking in from the outside will see a country applying a very high solvency requirement for any new companies coming in and insisting they meet the requirement while giving a derogation to its own company in this regard.  This would be clearly construed as a form of protectionism, which is bad for the country&rsquo;s reputation.  I still do not understand why the requirement is set at 40%.</P>
        <P>Let us not go down the road of talking about regulation.  The Minister is right; it leaves much to be desired.  If the solvency requirement were not set at the level it is, the VHI could be authorised.  There is more than one way of authorising it.  It is not a chicken and egg situation.  Why is the same rule not applied to all our insurers?  That is why we do not have more competition in the market.  This is an indirect means of blocking proper competition.  Has our own Competition Authority been asked for its views on the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill?  Could the Minister outline what these views were?  How does she now purport to address the issue of the VHI, given that the reserve fund seems to be falling rather than rising?  We were told last year the fund would soon reach the required level but it fell from 33% to 27%.  Are VHI customers sufficiently protected?  Will we have regulation by 30 September?  How much will it cost the State when we are fined by the European Court of Justice for being in breach of competition rules?  What is the view of the Competition Authority on this?  Was it asked for an opinion or did it request the opportunity to offer an opinion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made an appeal earlier for support for the passage of this legislation.  I remind her that in the earlier exchanges across the House on the Order of Business, I indicated clearly that I did not intend to oppose the passage of the Bill.  This is not in response to her appeal but because, although I am not an advocate for private health insurance at any time, I accept the broad principle and merit of this legislation and its necessity at this time.  I am prepared to make that independent judgment.  I wish to clarify that we are not all of one mind on this side of the House and that we have independent thinking processes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to reiterate, as I made clear in my initial contribution, that the Labour Party supports community rating.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="653"/>

	<P>As does Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The referral to the European Court of Justice has taken place since we last discussed the Bill.  Clarification is required in this regard.  Do we need this legislation to be implemented so that funding can be transferred under community rating to the VHI in order to save it from the European Court of Justice?  When can we expect the court&rsquo;s ruling?  Is it envisaged that the VHI will have obtained enough funding in the meantime to satisfy the regulator and be included under the directive?  In other words, will this legislation protect us from the European Court of Justice judgment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given substantial latitude to Members thus far and I ask for their co-operation so that we can work through the amendments.  Deputy Reilly can bring the issue he has raised to the Ceann Comhairle during the sos.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>These related amendments clarify an issue that was raised on Second and Committee Stages relating to contracts and the renewal of contracts.  The definition of &ldquo;effect&rdquo; covers both entering into a contract and any renewal of a contract.  The definition of &ldquo;information return&rdquo; is also provided.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputies opposite.  The solvency ratio is determined by the independent Financial Regulator, and the corresponding figure is substantially lower in other countries.  It is the case that any company regulated in any other European Union country can do business in Ireland and be regulated at a lower solvency ratio.  Neither I nor the Minister for Finance has any role in this matter.</P>
        <P>It is a prerequisite for authorisation that VHI or any other company with an older membership profile be able to obtain transfer payments by way of the provisions in this legislation from those with a younger membership profile.  That is the first step.  However, even with those measures in place, if we maintain the 40% solvency requirement VHI will require an injection of capital.  I anticipate that the authorisation issues will have been dealt with before the infringements take effect.  I do not know what the gestation period will be but generally, in regard to issues such as these, we are looking at a period of 18 months to 24 months.</P>
        <P>We have provided in legislation for the VHI to be authorised by 1 January 2009.  If I had not extended that timeframe, the VHI would have gone under, with serious consequences for its 1.5 million customers.  These provisions are necessary to ensure that younger people support older people and healthier people support sicker people.  There is nothing more than that involved in this legislation.  Its provisions will be valid for three years and we hope in that period to put into effect appropriate risk equalisation legislation.  However, given the decision of the Supreme Court, this is the only way we can effect change in the short term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has stated on two separate occasions that these measures will only apply for three years, yet we will deal with an amendment later which extends that validity to four years, to 2012.  Will the Minister answer my question as to whether the Competition Authority was asked for its opinion on this issue or sought to give such an opinion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for providing a degree of clarification.  However, she indicated that it will be 18 to 24 months before there is a decision by the European Court of Justice.  Presumably, on that basis, it might be possible to extend the timeframe further in September, if necessary.  Does the Minister intend to do so?  She has indicated that the VHI will require an injection of capital in any case.  Has she any proposals in this regard?  I understand the House will not return from its recess before 1 September which means we will not have an opportunity to express a view on this.  The Labour Party is completely opposed to the <Col N="654"/>possibility of privatising the VHI.  Moreover, we would like to see more non-profit insurers entering the market.  I am not sure how likely that is given the requirement for 40% of capital to be set aside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no issue with these amendments.  However, it would be helpful for all parties&rsquo; understanding of the Minister&rsquo;s intended outworking of her proposals if she would provide a timetabled outline of how she expects the VHI&rsquo;s risk equalisation needs can be assured into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Reilly that it is unfair and uncompetitive if one company is obliged to put 40% of its premium towards its solvency requirements while another is not.  That is why we have moved to introduce legislation to end that.  Equally, however, if we did not extend the authorisation time from 1 January until September, the VHI would not have been authorised and would have gone under.  The consequences of that for its 1.5 million customers are obvious.  It is something of a chicken and egg situation.  Without this measure there is no question of the VHI being in a position to submit a business plan proving its viability and sustainability. Therefore, this legislation is necessary as a first step towards authorisation.</P>
        <P>I hope shortly to be in a position to answer Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s question and, before September, to enter into discussions with the company after this legislation is passed, after which I will bring proposals to the Government.  Any proposals for an injection of capital, from whatever source, will require legislation.  I hope to do so in order that the path can be cleared as quickly as possible.  These measures are required for our own reasons and to satisfy the requirements of the regulator and the European Commission.  The company itself needs to know the position, as do its members and competitors.  We cannot delay outlining how we propose to inject the capital that is required to facilitate the authorisation of the company.  I intend to do that between now and the autumn session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister answer my question regarding the Competition Authority?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>When the VHI obtained a derogation from the European Union at the time of the opening up of the market, it did not have to meet the solvency requirements of its competitors.  I am not certain whether the Competition Authority has ever been asked for an opinion on this.  My view is that the situation certainly does not represent fair competition.  We do not need the Competition Authority to tell us that.  For example, a company regulated in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland, whether in the United Kingdom or continental Europe, may sell health insurance products here but is subject to much less strict requirements than those imposed on companies regulated in this country.  This is grossly unfair and it is the reason I seek to end the inequity and unfairness of the current system as quickly as possible.  We cannot achieve this objective without the provisions of the Bill given the age profile of VHI members and the capital injection required. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated that one has long gestation periods before cases are adjudicated in the European Court of Justice.  Nonetheless, the court&rsquo;s decisions have retrospective authority and apply from the date on which the initial breach took place. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is possible, therefore, that the issue will have been addressed by the time the court case commences and we will have incurred major expense as a result. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="655"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree.  It is unfortunate that the measure we are introducing was not taken years ago.  I would be pleased if the Financial Regulator were to reduce the solvency requirement.  While I do not normally criticise independent regulators, as I have stated publicly, the approach adopted here is incredibly conservative given that health insurance is much more predictable than other forms of insurance.  Unfortunately, a conservative approach has been adopted in an area that has considerable capacity for predictability and reliability, whereas a liberal approach appears to have been adopted in areas which are not characterised by such certainty. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated it was unfair that insurers regulated outside the State compete on a different basis from insurers regulated here.  Will she clarify how this issue will be addressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue cannot be addressed.  A company regulated in the United Kingdom where I understand the solvency requirement is 25% or any other European country can do business here.  As it happens, all the main competitors in the Irish health insurance market are regulated here and meet the 40% solvency requirement.  I understand one of the companies in question had to meet a 50% requirement when it was first authorised.  A company regulated outside Ireland would have a significant advantage over a company regulated here.  Each company has the capacity to be regulated in its home state, which is clearly unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position will not change unless the regulator acts. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>While the solvency II directive will bring greater clarity and lower the solvency requirement level to between 20% and 30%, the timeframe for its implementation is 2012-13.  As to the timeframe for the Commission&rsquo;s recent decision, we expected it to issue within three months of notification.  We notified the Commission in October or November last but the decision was not issued until the past two weeks.  While I am not certain a decision will take 18 to 24 months, that has been our experience in the past.  I hope the VHI will be authorised much sooner than that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies are aware of the rule that they may only speak twice to each amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments were grouped.  While I have tried to co-operate, if I am to be restricted to speaking twice on each amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the rule and changing it would require an amendment to Standing Orders. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments have been grouped which truncates the debate.  If I am restricted, I will insist on discussing amendments individually which is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest. </P>
        <P>If the VHI was unable to meet the 40% solvency requirement when it was making significant profits and enjoyed a massive share of the market, it begs the question as to whether it will ever meet the requirement without additional help from the State.  None of the Opposition parties, in particular the Fine Gael Party, has a problem supporting the principle of community rating.  However, my party has problems with the manner in which the matter has been addressed.</P>
        <P>On insurers, will the provisions of the solvency II directive supersede the powers of the Financial Regulator?  While that would be positive news in this case, it may not be so positive in other cases.  What is to prevent Hibernian Avivas Health, a large international company, <Col N="656"/>from deciding to be regulated in the North?  The same applies to BUPA, now known as Quinn Healthcare.   Can these companies decide to be regulated in another country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>BUPA was regulated in the United Kingdom when it was doing business here.  At the time, it operated under a solvency requirement of approximately 25% and made profits of 17%, an unheard of figure in health insurance.  The company did incredibly well.  I am stating a fact rather than criticising it as the company provided excellent competition.  BUPA also initiated all the early legal action on the issue before us.</P>
        <P>Any company regulated in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland can do business in this State.  The solvency II directive will be applied by all the national regulators.  As an EU directive, it must be applied across the European Union.  I welcome this as I understand the solvency requirement will be substantially lower than it is at present.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p1- ?>&lsquo;cumulative net financial impact&rsquo;, in relation to a registered undertaking or former registered undertaking which has furnished one or more information returns to the Authority in respect of a period, means the difference between&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) the total amount of the age-related tax credits recorded in accounts for that undertaking in respect of that period as extracted from accounts furnished pursuant to section 7F(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to the Authority by the undertaking in respect of that period, and</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) the total amount of the stamp duty referred to in section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 recorded in accounts for that undertaking in respect of that period as extracted from accounts furnished pursuant to section 7F(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to the Authority by the undertaking in respect of that period;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">To be fair to the Bills Office, the amendments in this group are all related and technical in nature.  While the European Union is willing to agree to the proposed measure as a justifiable state aid, the Commission and Government do not want excessive compensation to arise.  The insertion of a definition of the expression &ldquo;cumulative net financial impact&rdquo; in amendment No. 5 provides a basis for the health authority to assess on an annual basis whether the cumulative effects of the credits and stamp duty payments result in a positive or negative amount for the undertaking concerned.  The definition relates primarily to section 7F of the Bill inserted on Committee Stage.  Most of the amendments in the group are in this section.</P>
        <P>Under European Union state aid requirements, insurers which are net recipients may, if they make excessive profits, have to repay to the Exchequer any over-compensation granted for providing the services in question.  The amendment to the section recognises further the decision of the European Commission to approve the notification made in November, as announced on 18 June.  While a framework was inserted on Committee Stage to assess whether over-compensation would arise under the provisions of the Bill, the amendment being made at this stage will ensure the framework more precisely mirrors the Commission&rsquo;s decision.  Section 7F provides for the submission of accounts to the health insurance authority by insurers to enable an assessment by the health insurance authority of whether the measures provided for under the Bill resulted in over-compensation.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 provide for the authority to determine the extent, if any, to which an insurer&rsquo;s profit, the insurer being a net beneficiary under the provisions of the Bill, constitutes over-compensation.  The authority will consider what will be the norm as regards profits in the insurance sector generally and whether the transfer of money under the provisions of the Bill will over-compensate an insurer or generate profits that are above the norm in the sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the purpose of the amendment.  We do not want any provision of the Bill to confer additional profitability beyond the norm to an insurance company.  What will happen to excessive profits if it transpires that an insurer has been over-compensated?  Will moneys taken from the VHI in such circumstances be redistributed to the companies from whence they came or will they be allocated to the Exchequer coffers?  If the latter eventuality is the case, it would be grossly unfair on the other insurance companies. </P>
        <P>Can the profits accruing to the company in question, VHI, which is being given powers to enter other areas of activity, be used to subsidise these new activities?  The Minister is shaking her head but will she guarantee that she will be able to determine what income arises and whether it has been slipped under the door into other activities such as travel insurance, life insurance, SwiftCare clinics and so forth?  I understand these activities are losing money.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>   her plans to roll out a national colorectal cancer screening programme in view of the fate of the cervical cancer vaccination, which was also recommended by the Health Information and Quality Authority; when the first phase of roll-out will be implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[26719/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Approximately 2,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed and around 950 deaths occur from this disease each year in Ireland. Due to our ageing population and the long period in people&rsquo;s lives over which risk factors are built up, we can expect an increase in the numbers of colorectal cancer cases in the coming years.  The national cancer registry has projected that approximately 3,400 new cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed per annum by 2020.</P>
        <P>As with many cancers, early detection and treatment is one of the most effective measures of avoiding premature death.  This is the reason population based screening programmes are so important and it explains why the national cervical screening programme was accorded a higher priority than the HPV vaccine programme.  CervicalCheck is being implemented at a full year cost of &euro;43 million.  There are between 250 to 300 new cases of cervical cancer per year and 70 to 100 deaths.  The successful implementation of CervicalCheck will result in a reduction of up to 80% in deaths from this disease.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 17 June, two reports were published on screening for colorectal cancer.  The first was a report by the national cancer screening service board on the development of a national colorectal cancer screening programme.  The second was a health technology assessment carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Both reports confirm that a properly organised screening programme would have huge public health benefits and that population based colorectal cancer screening would be highly cost effective.  Notwithstanding the current budgetary situation, I am anxious to introduce such a programme at the earliest opportunity.  Accordingly, I have requested HIQA to explore ways of delivering a high quality colorectal cancer screening programme within existing cancer screening resources and based on the range of advice contained in the two expert reports. That work will be overseen by an expert advisory group comprising representatives of key stakeholders, including my Department, the national cancer screening service, the HSE national cancer control programme, the National Hospitals Office, the Irish Cancer Society and clinicians.</P>
        <P>HIQA&rsquo;s report is to be provided to me by the end of September and I will decide how to proceed when I examine it.  The national cancer screening service has advised that based on previous experience it would take in excess of two years to proceed from policy and funding approval to the commencement of a national screening programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s figures are correct.  We have been told that we could save more than 340 lives annually by rolling out screening for colorectal cancer.  However, I <Col N="659"/>am concerned that she has delayed implementation of the programme even though HIQA has advised that it provides value for money and the national cancer screening service wants to proceed with it.  </P>
        <P>Cervical screening was first introduced as a pilot project in late 1999 and early 2000 but ten years passed before it was rolled out nationally.  The national roll-out of BreastCheck has been similarly protracted.  Colorectal cancer screening, which has been costed at approximately &euro;15 million, should be available sooner rather than later.  What price is put on lives?  When will the Minister make screening available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly will have to become accustomed to the reality that not every new service or initiative can come with a new price tag.  Given that additional moneys will not be available for health services for the foreseeable future, it is a question of reprioritising resources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme recommended to me had an upfront capital cost of &euro;14 million but I want to see it done within existing capital infrastructure.  The programme envisaged that doctors would perform colonoscopies but within Cork University Hospital nurses are already performing such procedures.  The most effective programme involves sending individual kits to the population being screened, of whom about 6%, or 11,000 people, would require follow up colonoscopies.  At present, we conduct 50,000 colonoscopies nationally.</P>
        <P>I have met representatives of the Irish Cancer Society, which like me regards this issue as a priority.  If we have to make choices, this will have to be next.  The society has generously offered to provide funding from its private voluntary fundraising activities for the initial roll-out of the programme.</P>
        <P>Screening programmes are substantially more expensive here than across the Border or in other countries because of the fees paid to professionals.  In an environment where money is extremely limited, we have to explore the most innovative ways of introducing new programmes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The big cost arises not from colonoscopies but from screening through fecal occult blood tests.  I have no problem with finding money from within existing services given the huge level of waste that obtains.  This has to be a priority and should be introduced sooner rather than later.  </P>
        <P>Last December, the Minister indicated that she wanted to see colonoscopies being performed within one month of referral.  In April, however, the HSE revealed waiting lists of two years and more for colonoscopies in certain areas.  I again ask her when we can expect the roll-out of this programme, irrespective of how it is funded.  The money can be found, even if it has to come from the existing health budget of &euro;16 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Every week a new priority is identified.  Last week it was Crumlin and the previous week it was orthodontics.  Everything has to be an exception or involve additional moneys.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an important issue.  The home kits will cost approximately &euro;4.5 million but that is not the biggest element of the programme&rsquo;s cost.  Between 75% and 80% of colonoscopies are performed within one month in respect of urgent cases.  Professor Drumm has established a group to make that a reality for all cases.  Challenges arise in two hospitals, Tallaght and Letterkenny.  The group appointed by the professor will report directly to him on the issue.  The two year waiting list to which the Deputy referred was for repeat colonoscopies rather than urgent referrals.  We are making significant improvements and when I receive the report from HIQA at the end of September I will be in a position to make a decision.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>   the proposed co-located hospitals which will qualify for tax relief; the projected amount of that relief; if she has been informed as to the timeframe within which these hospitals will be operational; the number of private hospital beds which will be provided in co-located hospitals; if it is intended that health insurers will be charged the full cost of treating private patients in co-located hospitals; the way public hospitals&rsquo; budgets will be adjusted to compensate for the funding they currently receive for treating private patients; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[26456/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance Act 2009 provides that the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities will be terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development.  Provided that a co-located private hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.   The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure.</P>
        <P>The HSE estimates that from the start of building, the overall construction and commissioning period for the projects will be about 28 to 36 months.  To date, project agreements have been signed on four co-located private hospitals involving a total of 976 inpatient and day case beds and of these, planning permission has been granted in respect of the Beaumont, Limerick and Cork projects.  Preferred bidders have been approved for two other projects.</P>
        <P>The HSE estimates that the loss of private health insurance income to the hospitals in respect of the six projects would be about &euro;100 million, or an average of &euro;16 million per hospital.  This is in the context of their combined current budgets this year of &euro;1.322 billion in public funding.  This loss of income will be mitigated in part through income from the lease of lands and a potential share of profits from the co-located facilities.  The question of the net impact on the budgets of participating public hospitals will be examined at an appropriate juncture.</P>
        <P>Net losses of income are factored into the overall cost-benefit and value-for-money analysis for each project.  It always has been an essential requirement that each co-location project demonstrates clear value for money to the taxpayer.  The prices charged by private co-located hospitals in respect of private patients will be a matter for the hospitals concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This project was announced four years ago, in July 2005, on the basis that it was a fast way of getting 1,000 extra beds into the system.  Does the Minister accept that the project has been a failure from that point of view?  We are four years on but not a single bed has been provided.  Not a single brick has been laid for these co-located hospitals.  Will the Minister consider abandoning the project at this stage, as it has not fulfilled its original intention?  One of the criteria was that the HSE must be satisfied that all co-location proposals represent better value for money than building, commissioning and operating beds in the traditional way.  More than 1,000 public beds are currently closed in Irish hospitals because of cutbacks.  Would it not make more sense to provide funding to the public system to open those beds, rather than going through the whole process of building more beds at this particularly difficult economic period?  According to what the Minister has just said, it will be 31 December 2013 before we can expect all these beds to be provided despite the fact that four years ago we expected they would all be provided by 2010.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Among the reasons for the delay was the fact that planning applications were opposed and appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, mainly by a former Deputy who is now a member of the European Parliament.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>And by the Minister&rsquo;s Cabinet colleague from Cork.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="661"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not think he was involved in an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  He may have had issues concerning location.  At around 1.30 p.m. Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan said her party wants to keep the VHI &mdash; which provides private health insurance and guarantees people preferential access to public hospitals and super-dooper hospitals &mdash; in State ownership, yet when we try to reduce the level of private activity in public hospitals by building these facilities there are also objections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The representatives of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital came to me recently to make the case for the co-located facility.  I invite the Deputies opposite to meet them and hear the compelling case they made.  They said it would make such sense for their public hospital to have this facility provided.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Health and Children would consider inviting them in.  There is no other plan.  There is no public money available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not use the 1,000 beds that were closed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a lot more expensive.  The reality is that when we put private patients into public hospitals, we pay for all the staff and all the diagnostics, yet only insured patients or those who can pay themselves can get into those beds.  The State is paying all the overhead costs, including staffing, so that does not make sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it does not.  It would mean changing the whole system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to see people admitted to our public hospitals on the basis of medical need.  Although it does not concern a member of Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s party, it is ironic to see that I am being criticised in a County Louth newspaper by a public representative because a doctor who signed a public-only contract will not get a fee for private patients.  That public representative of the Sinn F&eacute;in party calls it &ldquo;ludicrous&rdquo; that there will not be preferential access for these private patients.  There is a mishmash of hypocrisy in all of this.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of it is emanating from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>All our current hospitals are co-located.  Some 20% of the beds within them are ring-fenced for private patients only and I do not think that is acceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow a brief supplementary question from Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows very well that the Labour Party policy is that there should be no two-tier health system and everybody should be treated the same way.  We should not have private beds in any public hospital, nor should we have the kind of system we have at the moment.  It is disingenuous to state, on the one hand, that I am saying the VHI should stay in public ownership, while, on the other, the Minister is somehow suggesting that because of that I support private beds in public hospitals.  Has the Minister considered how she will end the two-tier health system whereby we have private and public patients?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A major contribution to that is the new consultant contract where there will be a one-for-all list of diagnostics and there will not be preferential treatment.  Under the Deputy&rsquo;s model of supporting private health insurance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my model.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whether it is public or private, a VHI member has preferential access to public hospitals and super-dooper hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="662"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not the system we currently have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy wants to preserve that in State ownership, but I do not understand the strategic reason.  They have preferential access to super-dooper clinics as well as private and public hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We want a universal health system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The new consultant contract greatly improves matters, as we will see.  It has only been in operation for a few weeks and there have already been complaints in Louth because of the one-for-all access.  Co-location means that one will have virtually no private preferential access to public hospitals which have a co-located facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Because all the private patients will be in super-dooper private clinics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In this city we have two co-located hospitals, the Mater and St. Vincent&rsquo;s.  The St. Vincent&rsquo;s project, which was commented upon by a member of Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s party on the radio recently, is not even part of the co-location.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s is a not-for-profit, private institution, which provides an outstanding service. It is building its own new co-located facility, which has nothing to do with this whatsoever, yet that was thrown in here.  We need to inform ourselves of the facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are very well informed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts are that we need a lot of investment in our public hospitals.  We are moving to an environment where more single rooms are required for hygiene and infection control.  There is a huge capital expenditure involved.  The tax regime we have had in place both for private hospitals and nursing homes has been very beneficial in delivering capital.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>   if her attention has been drawn to the fact that 133 terminally ill patients are seeking access to hospice care and are being forced to wait days for inpatient, home care and day care services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[26720/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, cannot be here to respond to this question.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that when people are diagnosed with a terminal illness or when they are in the last stages of their treatment, it is so important that they receive the appropriate care in an appropriate setting.  This is important not only for patients, but also for their families.</P>
        <P>Last year, 2,655 people were treated in specialist inpatient palliative care units.  Some 7,575 people received home-based specialist care.  Some 729 people received intermediate palliative care and a further 1,865 received day care services.</P>
        <P>I am aware of a recent newspaper article in which the Irish Hospice Foundation suggested that 133 patients were awaiting hospice care.  The Department and the HSE work closely with the Irish Hospice Foundation to develop these services.  Historically, there have been parts of the country where inpatient palliative care services are underdeveloped and other areas of the country where the services are well developed.</P><Col N="663"/>
        <P Just="Left">The aim of the Government is to develop these services by prioritising areas in the country such as the Louth-Drogheda in the north-east, Laois-Offaly in the midlands and Waterford in the south-east for the capital development of specialist inpatient units, and other areas where the home-care service is underdeveloped, including Wicklow, Laois-Offaly and Longford-Westmeath.</P>
        <P>Additional inpatient palliative care beds have been opened in the past few years in existing hospices, including six in Blackrock and an additional ten beds opened in Milford Hospice, Limerick, in 2006.  The Department is also working with the HSE to open four beds in the Athlone hospice later this year.</P>
        <P>The provision of appropriate end-of-life care has been, and continues to be, a priority for the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Irish Hospice Foundation&rsquo;s figures do not suggest, but show, that there is a palliative care shortage of 610 and a bed deficit of 237.  It points out that the palliative care budget needs to be doubled to meet this shortage.  I find this poignant because money was allocated by the Oireachtas to palliative care in the past.  We found out subsequently, however, that the HSE siphoned that money off to use in other areas.  Since that time the Minister has given us an undertaking that this cannot happen again, which I welcome.  The reality, however, is that people now have to queue to die.  It is something none of us could have envisaged in the past.  They cannot get into an appropriate service for the last days of their lives.  What does the Minister or Minister of State propose to address this matter?  In particular, why are we now means testing terminally-ill patients for medical cards?  This is something that was not done in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly cannot compete with that nonsense about queuing to die.  I am not into the quotes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should say that to the 132 patients who are currently waiting for services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will come to that.  Each week there is a tear jerker.  I will respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s assertions, but I will not be saying things like &ldquo;queuing to die&rdquo;.  I did not want to mention this in my initial response.  I wonder about the 133 patients.  The HSE cannot substantiate this figure, and I wonder about creating this impression and I am worried about families that have to read this sort of stuff.  It is not the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>They can never substantiate the numbers on trolleys either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister of State to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may laugh and sneer, but I am just presenting the facts.  For those who are genuinely concerned about this, funding is ring-fenced and has been committed already.  I will not go into the detail for the record, but it is important to look at the yearly funding from 2004 to 2008.  Nobody should suggest that we are trying to park the huge demand for funding.  The additional funding has doubled each year from &euro;1.2 million in 2004 to an extra &euro;3 million in 2008.  I can also show the levels of funding by way of commitments to hospice funding.  The monthly average number of people receiving palliative care treatment for the past year was 286, which is again an increase.  Therefore, I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s claims.  An average of 133 people received immediate palliative care, and a further 291 received day-care services.  Funding has been increased, funding is ring-fenced, and I do not buy for a second the claim that people are queuing to die.</P>

	<P>I do not accept HSE figures regarding trolleys, and I would have much more faith in Irish Hospital Foundation figures than I would have in HSE figures.  The Minister of State alludes to funding figures between 2004 and 2008, but this was the same period in which the HSE siphoned off funds for other areas of activity.  Again, that is sleight of hand and misrepresentation.  The Minister of State did not answer my question as to why terminally-ill patients are currently being means tested for medical cards.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I apologise for not answering that question.  It slipped my mind because I was so carried away with the initial statement made by the Deputy.  Everybody over a particular figure is means tested for a medical card.  As the Deputy knows well, once medical evidence is presented to the HSE, that is taken into account.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>   her policy position on the allocation of resources to publicly funded hospitals; her views on whether there is a need to change the way in which money is allocated on the basis of historical patterns rather than work done, efficiency and response to the needs of the cohort for which the hospital provides service; if she will ensure that an assessment is carried out on Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, so that the extra demands on its services as the primary tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital here are adequately funded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[26457/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of health policy is to achieve the best health status and health outcomes for the whole population.  We are succeeding in Ireland in many respects.  Life expectancy is now at the highest level it has ever been.  Infant mortality is one of the lowest in the world.  Survival from many cancers is improving.  Death rates from cardiac disease are falling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are now allocating &euro;16 billion in current funding across three health Votes.  Even if there was scope to increase this, it would be vital that we allocate resources so that the clear focus and the economic incentives created are about achieving the best health status and health outcomes for people, within affordable limits.  Many health care systems are seeking to achieve this.  It is not about changing the funding basis from tax-based funding to insurance-based funding.  It is about how resources are allocated.  There is certainly every reason we should avoid changing to a system dominated by fee-per-item payments to doctors and hospitals,  where simply more activities, such as tests, investigations and surgeries, get more money for the providers.  This system has a cost dynamic that can bankrupt either insurers or the State or both, and worst of all, can result in worse health outcomes for patients.  However, I do want to move away from the tradition in our country of allocating resources to public hospitals on the basis of incrementally adjusted historical block budgets.</P>
        <P>I want to allocate resources to support the best outcomes for patients, in a way that would avoid unnecessary hospitalisation, reduce the lengths of stay in hospital, manage chronic conditions in the community, and reward better preventive primary care.  This is what we mean when we talk about making money follow the patient.  For this reason, I established an expert group on resource allocation and financing in the health sector in April this year to do the complex, detailed work required.  This group is being chaired by Professor Frances Ruane, director of the ESRI.  It includes many independent experts who will bring their experience and judgment to bear on how to achieve the objectives I have set in practical ways.  The group is to report to me and the Minister for Finance by April 2010.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I fully support the work being done by the HSE in conjunction with the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals.  The real challenge in paediatrics is to maximise the efficient <Col N="665"/>use of all our health care capacity, both in Dublin and across the country.  The paediatric services in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght need to be increasingly working in a co-ordinated, shared and efficient fashion to prepare for the eventual merging of the three institutions in 2014 into one national paediatric hospital.  In the meantime, the HSE is actively pursuing ways in which services across the three hospitals can best be co-ordinated, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Minister accepts that we need to move away from the historical pattern of providing a small increase or decrease to hospitals every year, irrespective of the demands put on them.  In measuring outcome, surely Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin must measure up well.  The Minister is talking about taking action that will give children a better outcome for the future.  In many cases, pain and suffering will be avoided because of early intervention.  Yet through no fault of their own, as the birth rate has gone up, the rate of serious illness among children that can be treated has also gone up, and the demands on the hospital have gone up.  In the last four years, day activity has gone up by 30%, outpatient activity has gone up by 23%, and theatre procedures have gone up by 34%.</P>
        <P>While the Minister may be right in stating that savings can be made through co-operation among the three hospitals, there needs to be intervention among children in order to address the fact that waiting lists are growing due to increased demand for the most important sector of our population, namely, children with serious illnesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct and we have substantially increased the budget in Crumlin by 39% since 2004.  However, I believe that many initiatives can be taken and are being taken by the hospital, such as the decision by the board last week not to have any further ward closures this summer.  That is to be welcomed, and it was done without any additional money.  There is no system in the world with an unlimited source on which we can continually draw.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody must be allocated a budget.  The reduction in the allocation to Crumlin was less than many other places.  Professor Drumm will be addressing the health committee next week on the children&rsquo;s hospitals, specifically regarding the issues on Crumlin.  He is familiar with them, having been a clinician there for many years.  There is a 17,000 day overtime bill in Crumlin.  By the end of this year, we hope to move to a single surgical department between the three children&rsquo;s hospitals, with seven surgeons.  That will greatly cut down on on-call overtime and so on.  We hope to move to a single, clinical critical care department between Temple Street and Crumlin.  Professor Des Bowen from Canada has been brought in to help with this.  All of these initiatives can greatly reduce overheads in the hospital and direct more activity to patient care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all very well for the future, but children are currently waiting for unacceptable lengths of time with very serious conditions such as scoliosis, which is generally not dealt with by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Will the Minister find some measure in the meantime which accepts the kind of models on value for money, but which also accepts that the demands on the children&rsquo;s hospital in Crumlin have greatly increased in recent years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, but the resources allocated to Crumlin have also increased.  There was an 18% increase in medical staff and there are also more day cases, which <Col N="666"/>is much less expensive for a hospital than overnight stays.  We are hoping to arrive at a situation in Ireland where about 85% of surgery will be done on a day-case basis.  We are at about 62% at the moment.  Professor Drumm will address all of these issues.  I do not believe seriously-ill children cannot be treated within the budget framework for Crumlin hospital in 2009.</P>

        <Quest>   her views on whether it is satisfactory that a patient suffering from cystic fibrosis, in need of medical care due to their condition, was admitted to St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dublin, on 23 June 2009 and placed in a small room with five other patients all suffering chronic illness; if her attention has been drawn to the inadequate conditions around the bed of the patient; her further views on whether it is appropriate that a cystic fibrosis patient be so treated and placed at a risk of infection; the action she will take to ensure that appropriate facilities are available to all cystic fibrosis patients who require inpatient treatment; the progress made to date with regard to the long promised new hospital wing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[26656/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis in the State attend St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital for their treatment due to the expertise established there.  The hospital is also designated as the national referral centre for all other hospitals providing treatment for people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital is undergoing a process of complete redevelopment.  The new ambulatory day care centre opened in 2006 provides dedicated ambulatory care facilities for people with cystic fibrosis.  A new ward, St. Christopher&rsquo;s, comprising eight single en-suite rooms was opened at the hospital in August 2008 &mdash; these rooms are occupied only by people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the hospital that the patient in question was admitted under the cystic fibrosis team and moved to St. Christopher&rsquo;s as soon as a room became available.  I have been informed by the HSE that cleaning is carried out twice a day on the ward to which the patient was initially admitted and also a deep clean is carried out once a week.</P>
        <P>The next stage in the development of St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital will involve the construction of a new ward block to replace existing accommodation.  It is estimated that the construction, equipping and commissioning will take approximately 18 months and the new facility is to be operational as soon as possible in 2011.  All of the rooms will be single and en-suite, significantly enhancing the hospital&rsquo;s capacity to provide appropriate isolation facilities for patients.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Over the past number of years, I have prioritised the development of services for people with cystic fibrosis with a total revenue investment of &euro;6.78 million and complementary capital investment.  The development and enhancement of specialist teams in a number of other hospitals, in particular Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital, University College Hospital, Galway, Limerick Regional Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital, means that some people with cystic fibrosis currently attending St. Vincent&rsquo;s may choose to attend another centre where this is closer to home and meets their needs.  This should, in time, balance demand for accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis across a number of hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that the young man who is the subject of this question and who is 23 years of old and suffering from cystic fibrosis was admitted to a ward with five chronically ill elderly patients?  Will she acknowledge that, because of the risk of <Col N="667"/>cross-infection, it is an entirely inappropriate way in which to treat any cystic fibrosis patient who comes into hospital?  Will she acknowledge it is unsatisfactory that this young man&rsquo;s family, who have already lost one son to cystic fibrosis, felt the need to sanitise the floor area around his bed and scrub down the bed frame because they found signs of blood on it?  Will she acknowledge that is completely inappropriate and scandalous treatment of any cystic fibrosis patient?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that it should not be necessary for a question of this nature to be raised by a patient?  This question was tabled on Thursday of last week and the patient was moved into an isolation room on Friday.  I do not believe that was a coincidence.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister explain why she made an absolute commitment in this House in January 2008 that 14 new isolation rooms for cystic fibrosis patients would be established in St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital by September 2008 but that, to date, only eight such rooms have been established?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been in touch with the hospital and the clinical nurse manager did the work the Deputy suggested was done by the family.  She confirmed that.  She also confirmed that she spoke to the patient on foot of the question tabled by Deputy Shatter, which was unusual &mdash; I would have thought it more appropriate that the question would have been raised and dealt with privately in the hospital &mdash; and that he had no complaint in regard to the matters the Deputy mentioned.  </P>
        <P>I accept the patient was in a room with other patients and, in an ideal situation, that should not be the case.  That is why we are moving as quickly as we can to provide the additional facilities at St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.  Notwithstanding the tight budgetary situation, we have found an innovative way for the facility to proceed with the Exchequer paying at the end of the project construction period rather than on a phased basis, which means it will be paid for at the start of 2011.</P>
        <P>We have done an enormous amount over the past number of years for cystic fibrosis patients.  When it met me recently, their association recognised that.  However, I accept we still have quite a way to go to reach a situation where every patient will be directly admitted to a single room and, therefore, minimise the capacity for cross-infection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the long promised new facility at St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital go to tender?  When will construction start because the date has been a moveable feast?  In January 2008, the Minister informed the House it would be open by 2010 but in the recent debate in this House in April, she said 2011.  Will she clarify when it will go to tender and when construction will start?</P>
        <P>It is my information that two weeks ago, 34 cystic fibrosis patients were accommodated in St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital, primarily in St. Christopher&rsquo;s ward, which includes the eight isolation units, and in St. Paul&rsquo;s ward, which has accommodation for 22 patients.  It is my information that St. Paul&rsquo;s ward, which deals especially with respiratory patients, is scheduled to close today.  Will the Minister clarify what facilities will be available to cystic fibrosis patients in the coming weeks if this ward closes as of today in accordance with the information received by me?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The delay arose because of dialogue between the architects nominated by the association, or the people involved in the cystic fibrosis community, and the architects and design team for St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.  As I said in the House some time ago, that delayed it.  I am not blaming anybody but I understand from the HSE that added to the timeframe.  I am advised by the HSE that it will go to tender shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether it means next week or the week after but contracts will be signed this year, the facility will be constructed next year and will be paid for at the start of 2011 and commissioned at that point.  I am not aware of the plan to close St. Christopher&rsquo;s ward.  I will have that matter checked and revert to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 79 together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recently published report by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs which includes workforce planning analysis for selected health care occupations, including general practitioners.  Among its findings, the report indicates that the current gender distribution in general practice will be reversed in the future with a ratio of 65 females to 35 males.  It also predicts that by 2020, almost 30% of female and 5% of male general practitioners can be expected to work part-time.  There are 12 general practitioner specialist training programmes currently in operation in the State.  They are all of four years duration &mdash; two years spent in hospital posts under the supervision of hospital consultants and two years in an approved general practice under the supervision of a general practice trainer.  The total number of places available is 120.  The report predicts that this figure will not be sufficient to meet the demands of a growing and ageing population into the future.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive and the Irish College of General Practitioners are currently in discussion with a view to increasing the number of general practitioner trainees by streamlining existing programmes in a cost-effective manner.  In addition, the college has identified a number of doctors who have not had formal training in general practice but who are interested in pursuing a career as a general practitioner.  The provision of a programme of training for these doctors is also being examined.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is also taking steps to increase the number of general practitioners who can take on patients with medical cards.  A rule which allowed doctors who currently have patients who hold general practitioner visit cards to also take on medical card patients after five years has been amended to allow such doctors to take them on with immediate effect.  Nationally, there are in excess of 50 doctors in this category, 20 of whom are in practice in the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Recruitment of general practitioners to provide services under the GMS scheme has been made simpler with a list of posts being advertised centrally on the HSE website.  Proactive <Col N="669"/>management of upcoming retirements by local health offices is in place to flag potential general practitioner vacancies at an early stage.  Articles have also been placed in UK medical magazines highlighting general practitioner opportunities in Ireland.</P>
        <P>It has been my intention for some time that any restrictive rules preventing fully qualified general practitioners taking on patients under the GMS scheme should be ended.  In that context, a consultation group involving my Department, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation has been reviewing the provisions relating to entry to the GMS scheme.  I understand that considerable progress has been made and that detailed recommendations from this group will be presented to me shortly, with the objective of increasing the pool of general practitioners who can take on medical card patients.</P>
        <P>My Department will discuss the contents of the expert group report with the HSE and other appropriate agencies in the coming months to ensure we continue to have an adequate supply of general practitioners available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Does she accept that the ratio in this State of 0.6 GPs to every 1,000 of the population is a major problem?  This ratio compares to an EU average of one GP to every 1,000 of the population.  This ratio falls even further in more disadvantaged areas such as north Dublin where its stands at one GP to every 2,500 of the population.  This issue was also recently raised at Carrickmacross Town Council where a Government party councillor highlighted the fact that some locals had been forced to travel as far away as Dundalk to attend a GP.  A 2007 study found that one in every four of paying patients in the 26 counties who had a health problem did not attend a GP because of the issue of affordability.  That is another alarming fact that must be taken on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concluding with this point.  The shortage of GPs restricts the time a GP has to engage with a patient and the opportunity he or she has for health promotion.  While acknowledging some steps have been taken as the Minister&rsquo;s reply indicated, what further steps are proposed?  Will the Minister agree it is alarming the HSE has had to recruit GPs outside of Ireland to meet the current shortfall?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is correct that Ireland has a lower GP-population ratio of 58 GPs to 100,000 people when it is 67 to 100,000 in Northern Ireland and the UK, a difference of nine.  Notwithstanding that, we also have restrictive work practices with up to 400 doctors not being allowed access to the GMS lists because of an industrial relations agreement.  While we want to provide practice supports to practices with relatively large numbers of patients &mdash; otherwise it would not be cost effective &mdash; I do not believe it is sustainable or fair to those general practitioners.  The 50 doctors on the doctor-only medical card scheme will be allowed to have access to the full GMS list.  That will increase the number of GPs in the Dublin area, where there are particular shortages, by 20.</P>
        <P>Since 2004, the number of training places has been significantly increased from 84 to 120.  A number of doctors who work in general practice have not done the GP-training programme.  I have encountered several of these cases where they were working with a general practitioner for years but when he or she retired they were not qualified to take over the practice.  It is a sore point and I understand the colleges are examining the possibility of a training programme for doctors affected to increase supply.</P>
        <P>The main challenge with changes in gender distribution, family and lifestyle commitments and so on is to ensure the numbers in general practice increase.  It is essential for the move from hospital to community care to place more emphasis on general practice.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="670"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members will agree having an adequate number of GPs is crucial in treating more people in a primary care and community system rather than an acute hospital one.  The Minister stated in her reply the current graduate supply is 120 GPs per year and hoped to increase that figure by &ldquo;streamlining existing programmes in a cost effective manner&rdquo;.  Will the Minister decode this HSE-speak?  Does it mean training more GPs for the same amount of money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of trainees has increased from 84 to 120 since 2005, a significant increase.  Discussions are under way between the Health Service Executive, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Department on many of these issues and they will report to me presently.  While I do not like using the word &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; in an inappropriate way, we need to be innovative, particularly with those doctors already working in general practice who have not done the original GP-training programme.  We need to provide an opportunity for them to qualify for a GMS list.  It is unfair they are already dealing with all other patients, including GMS patients, but they cannot take over the GMS list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acknowledgement of doctors working in general practice who have not completed training but are quite experienced.  It would be laughable for them to have to undergo full training.  We must, however, be careful about maintaining the quality of general practice.  I also welcome that those doctor-only visit card doctors will be now able to take on all GMS patients.  When was the rule amended?</P>
        <P>The Minister must acknowledge there is an increased need for training.  While the number of trainee GPs has increased to 120 since 2005, with changing demographics and working practices the whole-time equivalents of those currently qualifying will actually turn out lower.  While the Irish College of General Practitioners sought 150 graduates a year, up to 200 are needed.  What plans has the Minister got to address this matter?  The HSE has also been suppressing this by allowing doctors to amalgamate lists when the doctors&rsquo; organisations opposed it.  I certainly oppose it, wanting more, not fewer, doctors in the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The restriction on access to the GMS scheme was an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation, representing general practitioners a long time ago.  I have had many young doctors ask me why they cannot have access to the GMS scheme.  I put a group together to examine this and it will report to me shortly.  I see no justification for restricting access to GMS to any doctor.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that for supports such as practice nurses to succeed, critical mass is needed.  France has 164 general practitioners for every 100,000 people.  Last year I met a group of French general practitioners.  Before Deputy Reilly gets a fright, I am not advocating their pay rates.  However, I learned they earn &euro;60,000 a year; they were amazed at how much our doctors earn.  They get no practice supports whatever, do an incredible amount of work and greatly alleviate pressures on the acute hospital system.  I am all for increasing the number of general practitioners.  As we are doubling the number of medical students, I would hope we will be able to retain as many of them as graduates in medicine, particularly in general practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of the trainees are being retained in Ireland and how many leave the country?  I am concerned with the aging population of doctors in the north east and the need for their replacements.  With the new services proposed by the Minister, their replacement will be necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister used the French example.  The figures she cited for the North of Ireland and Britain do not reflect the EU average, which stands at <Col N="671"/>one GP per 1,000 people.  I would like to ask the Minister about access to medical education.  Places are critical in terms of the number of general practitioners we turn out.  We also need to examine the issues of affordability.  Access to medical training continues to be affected by elitism.  I do not mean any disrespect when I use that word.  Very few families can afford to pay for the many years of training a young person needs to become a doctor.  The course that is followed during the period of training is quite intense.  We need to bear in mind that fine young people from many families across this country who could become excellent general practitioners are not able to access what they see as their natural calling as a consequence of the exorbitant and prohibitive costs involved.  I would like that aspect of the matter to be addressed so that we can achieve equality of access.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke earlier about the number of locums working in general practice.  I understand that the Irish College of General Practitioners, in conjunction with the HSE, recently published an advertisement seeking expressions of interest from practitioners who would like to qualify to be on the specialist register.  The Irish Medical Council requires doctors to be on the specialist register in order to work as general practitioners.  I understand that 219 people have responded to the advertisement, which is very satisfactory.  If the number of general practitioner training places, which is approximately 120 at present, can be increased by a further 219, that would be very welcome indeed.  I accept that the people in question are currently working in general practice.  However, they are not in a position to hold general practice registration with the Irish Medical Council.</P>

        <QRef>[26318/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 53 and 71 together.</P>
        <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund was established to tackle the issue of excessive waiting times for hospital treatment for public patients.  The fund has been successful in fulfilling this remit.  It has arranged treatment for more than 145,000 patients to date.  Public patients now wait an average of 2.6 months for operations, compared to between two and five years before the establishment of the NTPF.  For reasons of patient safety, highly specialised and complex paediatric cases like scoliosis cannot be provided within the private sector.  The NTPF has arranged for a limited number of patients with scoliosis to undergo surgery in a public hospital.  No additional remuneration accrued to the treating consultant in respect of these exceptional cases, which involved patients whose medical condition was deemed clinically suitable for treatment in another hospital.  The NTPF will continue to work with the HSE and the public hospital system to identify and agree cases suitable for treatment through the fund.  In <Col N="672"/>doing this, regard will be had to the patients&rsquo; medical conditions, to suitability and safety issues and to the length of time the patients have spent waiting for treatment.</P>
        <P>Each hospital funded by the HSE is required to deliver services within the financial allocation provided to it.  Like all hospitals, Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin must deliver a high quality service to its patients while remaining within budget.  The priorities of the HSE and the hospital management at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital are to ensure that services at the hospital are maintained at an optimum level and to protect patient care.  Following a meeting between the HSE and the three Dublin paediatric hospitals last week, it was agreed that Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital would revert to the HSE with its proposals to specifically address the needs of scoliosis patients between now and the end of the year.  The HSE will consider these proposals within days and form a plan of action with the hospital.</P>
        <P>The incidence of sickle cell disease has increased significantly over the past ten years.  Earlier this year, a consultant was appointed to a full-time consultant haemophilia post at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, covering inpatient and outpatient haemophilia services for children.  Prior to this appointment, another consultant covered inpatient haemophilia services, in addition to covering sickle cell and other red blood cell disorders and other benign disorders.  The new appointment has allowed one of the consultants concerned to focus virtually full-time on treating patients with sickle cell and other red blood cell disorders in Crumlin.  Patients who had procedures funded by the NTPF at home or abroad, and require ongoing treatment, are treated within the overall annual funding allocated to the hospital.</P>
        <P>The most effective way of providing the best possible tertiary care involves the creation of a single national paediatric hospital, alongside a major teaching hospital.  The concept of bringing together all three present services is widely accepted.  A report commissioned by the HSE, Children&rsquo;s Health First, indicated that the population and the projected demand in this country can support one world-class tertiary paediatric hospital.  It recommended that the hospital should be in Dublin and, ideally, should be located with a leading adult academic hospital to optimise outcomes for children.  Following detailed consideration, it was decided that the most appropriate location for the new paediatric hospital was adjoining the Mater Hospital.  The development of the new hospital is being overseen by the national paediatric hospital development board, which was established in May 2007.</P>
        <P>We must move towards a model of care that involves closer integration and co-operation.  More than &euro;250 million has been provided for the running of three paediatric hospitals in Dublin in 2009.  Significant cost savings can be achieved if services and practices are more closely integrated across the three hospital sites, even before the new hospital has been completed.  With this in mind, the HSE is pursuing ways in which services across the three hospitals can best be co-ordinated to avoid unnecessary duplication and achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.  The areas of possible increased co-operation that are being examined include paediatric surgery, paediatric critical care services, renal services, genetics and dermatology services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has said that great savings can be made by amalgamating the three hospitals, or by providing for greater co-operation between them.  It is important to point out that in September 2007, representatives of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin asked for a meeting with HSE officials on this matter.  The prospect of a meeting being arranged as part of this debate did not re-emerge until recently.  On a previous occasion, the Minister argued that &euro;4 million could be saved on blood products.  However, Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital spends an average of just &euro;6 million on blood products each year.  It returns all unused blood product to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, where it is used.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital is not <Col N="673"/>reimbursed for that blood.  That shows that the Minister&rsquo;s argument is fallacious.  The comparisons she previously made with a hospital in Birmingham are equally null and void.  How many children are waiting for scoliosis surgery?  As the Minister knows, the longer they are left without surgery, the more operations they will need and the more disabilities they will suffer.  How many children have had scoliosis treatment under the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  How many of them will get such treatment?  How many children have had scoliosis surgery under the fund this year?  How many more operations are planned before the end of the year?  How many children are on the waiting list at Crumlin?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We should all get on with doing what we are supposed to do, rather than trying to fight battles day and night.  The saving of &euro;4 million that I mentioned previously did not relate solely to blood products.  I agreed with what the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, had said on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, which was that &euro;4 million could be saved if the hospital worked with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital on blood products and with the other two hospitals on the procurement of medical devices and drugs, etc.  That is where the figure of &euro;4 million came from.  I stand over that.  Professor Drumm will address these issues when he attends a committee meeting next week.  I stand over all the facts I have mentioned.  Somebody said today that there is one physiotherapist in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, even though 17.5 physiotherapy posts are filled there.  I do not suggest that more posts are not needed.  I am simply saying it was not accurate to say that just one post is filled at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not hear that contribution.  Just one physiotherapy post in rheumatology is filled at present &mdash; that is for certain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  A total of 17.5 physiotherapy posts are filled at the moment.  It is a question of the manner in which physiotherapists are allocated.  I understand that the person in question will be replaced when she goes on maternity leave.  I do not have the figures on scoliosis in my head.  I think I had them for an earlier question.  I understand that 11 operations were postponed, of which nine were rearranged.  It was something in that order.  If I cannot find the figures, I will give them to the Deputy after this debate.  As I said in my initial reply, the HSE is working with the hospital on the issue of scoliosis, which is a serious condition.  As I see it, the money we are allocating to the three hospitals in 2009, for the treatment of children with these serious conditions, should be sufficient to deal with those who most need attention.  I acknowledge and welcome the fact that, notwithstanding the current budgetary constraints, the level of activity at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, this year is already ahead of that for last year.  If the three hospitals work with the HSE, they will be able to deal with the issues that are concerning them all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to an earlier priority question, the Minister referred to an article in a County Louth newspaper, <i>The Argus</i>.  She suggested that a representative of Sinn F&eacute;in had expressed a particular view on public-only general practice.  I have to say she misrepresented the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if the Deputy addressed the question we are dealing with. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In line with Sinn F&eacute;in policy, my colleague in County Louth has very clearly indicated that a two-tier approach does not work, and that is wholly in line with the position I have articulated here, time and again.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to clarify that point. </P><Col N="674"/>
        <P>Regarding the grouping of questions before the House, the Minister has never given us a breakdown of the alleged &euro;20 million to be generated from the proposed co-operation or amalgamation of the three existing child-related hospitals in the greater Dublin area.  Can the Minister give such a breakdown and the facts and figures on the &euro;20 million she alleges is the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow, which, in real terms, represents the end of Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital as we have known it?  It is very important that the debate is informed of the full facts.</P>
        <P>While the further cuts at Crumlin were deferred for the summer period, there is, nonetheless, the restraint created as a result of a &euro;9.5 million budget cut already at that hospital.  As the national children&rsquo;s hospital, which is supposed to be a centre of excellence, how can the provision of services be allowed to be so restricted, where young people in need of major operative procedures are having access to them denied or deferred, resulting in great pain and potentially life-debilitating consequences?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a large number of questions there.  That is the article I am referring to, from <i>The Argus</i> newspaper, with the headline, &ldquo;Private care is curtailed&rdquo;, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have it here.  It states: &ldquo;Public only consultant can&rsquo;t admit VHI patients.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Sinn F&eacute;in public representative was critical of that.  I very much welcome the contribution from <i>The Argus</i> newspaper to this debate because it displays the hypocrisy that exists.  We curtail private care and we are all entitled to access to public hospitals, and that is being criticised. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no hypocrisy.  The hypocrisy is on the Minister&rsquo;s side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot have it every way. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and proves, once again, that co-existence of private and public service provision in the one system does not work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Minister should stick to the facts. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I should not have allowed the Deputy to raise the matter at all.  It was in order in the question, but it is not in order now.  I call on the Minister to respond to the questions that are in order. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in can tell his colleague that the public hospital is for all patients. </P>

	<P>The Minister can tell him herself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pretty sure the Deputy will tell him. </P>
        <P>I want to clarify what I said regarding the point I was making to Deputy Reilly.  The numbers of scoliosis patients&rsquo; appointments cancelled was 13, not 11, as I said, and I am sorry.  Five of those had their appointments immediately rescheduled.  I believe Professor Drumm will deal specifically with that issue when he addresses the Oireachtas committee on Tuesday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>How many are waiting overall? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the &euro;20 million, I am satisfied this is true and in fact a minimum figure when four catering departments are combined as well as four HR departments, four payroll systems, four central sterile units, waste management and all of these things.  One does not need to have four CEOs, although two directors of nursing are required, one for children and one for adults.  There are very significant savings to be made, I have no doubt, and part of this relates to the &euro;4 million figure I mentioned regarding single procurement, just to make matters clear.  I do not want to be accused of double counting. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister circulate the details? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will leave it to the CEO of the HSE to deal with that when he addresses the committee next week.  He is a distinguished paediatrician of world renown who worked in Crumlin hospital and knows it well.  He will be addressing all the issues. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>He is an excellent paediatrician, but what about his management skills? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>He is an excellent CEO as well, a man of substantial vision, who had the guts to take on the job and not merely be a hurler on the ditch. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Guts are not needed to be a CEO, but specific managerial skills. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister, please. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>One needs to have lots of guts to be a CEO, and vision too.  I believe the sum of money allocated within the resource constraints we are living within should be adequate to provide the tertiary services for the sick children from the country and the other services for the children in the Dublin area who require that their secondary care be provided in the three hospitals that exist in the city at present. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, in reply to Deputy Reilly, said that there were five scoliosis surgery patients appointments rescheduled.  In the earlier part of her reply she said, basically, that the private hospital system could not do this operation and, therefore, they were all rescheduled in public hospitals.  I believe that is what the Minister said, in any event.  That puts a hospital such as Crumlin at an unfair funding disadvantage to other types of acute hospitals which can farm out much of their waiting lists to the NTPF.  Obviously, Crumlin cannot in these types of situations.  Does that not make an argument to the effect that Crumlin should be treated differently in terms of funding, since it does not have the outlet that other hospitals have? </P>
        <P>On the question that was grouped with this one, from my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, specifically about sickle cell disease, again, that is something that Crumlin has taken <Col N="676"/>on as an extra, without any funding stream.  Should it have refused to deal with sickle cell cases on the grounds that it did not have the money?  What is a hospital such as Crumlin supposed to do in those circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not correct that there have been no additional resources.  In my response I said that Dr. Beatrice Nolan was appointed as a consultant haematologist to Crumlin in March.  She came from the national tertiary centre at St. James&rsquo;s and relieved the doctor who was working with haemophiliacs and sickle cell patients to allow that other consultant to deal exclusively with sickle cell cases, because it is a big issue.  We know the cause of sickle cell in a large percentage of births relates to people coming here from African countries.  A large percentage, some 20%, of births in national maternity hospitals relate to people from that continent and there is no doubt it will be a growing problem.  However, the resources of the hospital have increased significantly.  We would love to have more money for everybody.  The reality is we are living in an environment where resources are very constrained and, therefore, we have to do our best with what is available, in the way we organise services and how we prioritise things within the hospitals. </P>
        <P>Regarding the private system, Cappagh is not a State hospital but a voluntary not-for-profit facility and is in a position to do scoliosis cases.  However, there is no question of the treating consultant being paid a fee to perform the surgery there.  The NTPF has procured surgery there, I understand, for a number of patients, and two are scheduled to happen at Cappagh within the next couple of weeks.  Clearly, we have to use whatever resources we have, whether from the NTPF or the direct allocation to the hospitals, to treat the patients who require medical attention most.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to point out to the Minister that 75% of the increased funding went on wage increases approved by her Government, through benchmarking and social partnership.  I asked the Minister how many patients would be and have been operated on through the NTPF and I have not been told.  The waiting list for scoliosis surgery is much longer than the Minister has indicated.  She is just talking about the cancelled cases.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say she has a gut feeling about catering and four of this and four of that, etc.  We were told that with the HSE when ten health boards were amalgamated and the shared services unit.  All we got was a mess.  Has a cost-benefit analysis been done to justify the Minister&rsquo;s figure of &euro;20 million? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Contrary to the Deputy&rsquo;s impression, there has been an significant reduction in the number of people working in management and administration since the HSE was established, and I can give him the data on that. </P>
        <P>Crumlin hospital has had an increase of 18% in medical and dental staff and 29% in nursing staff.  Extra people provide extra services, so when the Deputy says it goes on pay, that is true of 80% of the health budget.  It goes on recruiting extra people or to pay increases to existing staff.  There has been a substantial increase.  The day before the decision was made that the location for the new children&rsquo;s hospital should be the Mater, it was clear that the three choices were the Mater, Beaumont or St. James&rsquo;s.  There was no choice as regards a site on the Naas Road.</P>
        <P>I recall talking to the current chairman of the medical board at Crumlin, and he was very excited.  In fact, he was very complimentary to me, and then it all fell apart once the site was chosen.  It is bigger than a site.  It is about a service.  I had a very good meeting recently with the chairman of the medical board and one of his colleagues at Crumlin with Professor Drumm and I very much welcome the fact that serious engagement is taking place.  I salute that and <Col N="677"/>welcome it.  Long after all of us have gone &mdash; clinicians, Ministers or politicians &mdash; there will hopefully be a state-of-the-art facility for sick children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2006 the Government confirmed the decision to develop a new Central Mental Hospital, CMH, at Thornton Hall, County Dublin.  Since then, a draft project brief has been prepared and a cost-benefit analysis completed.  None of the work undertaken to date has been site specific but a number of difficulties have emerged with the Thornton Hall site.  The HSE has identified a need for an intellectual disability forensic mental health unit and a child and adolescent forensic mental health unit.  Neither of these units would be viable as a stand-alone facility and they should be co-located with the CMH, but the 20-acre site at Thornton Hall is not large enough to allow for these additional developments.</P>
        <P>The construction of these additional units at a location separate to the CMH would incur increased capital and revenue costs.  The planning and design process for the CMH redevelopment project will soon need to become site specific and all of the issues involved are being considered.  The Deputy can be assured that if the Government decides to change the location of the new hospital, the HSE will, in due course, undertake a consultation exercise with stakeholders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly the Thornton Hall site is no longer a runner.  Is that correct?  Is it the case that the CMH is no longer going out there and the PPP is no longer a prospect?  I am trying to interpret what the Minister of State has told me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>The response goes on to make the point that it was never site specific, but a time is arriving when it needs to be site specific.  I had a meeting with Dr. Harry Kennedy and his people in the hospital some months ago and I made it clear that the Government&rsquo;s priority is to fast-track the building of a central mental hospital.  Nothing has changed since then.  The Government must decide on a site specific location and the Government is doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Forgive me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I thought we had a long debate in this House about how we did not consider that Thornton Hall was an appropriate site although the Government was intent on making it the site.  Clearly it has now moved position and I welcome that.  I equally welcome the fact that we need to fast-track a new central <Col N="678"/>mental hospital.  However our interpretation of the word &ldquo;fast&rdquo; when it comes to central mental hospitals or co-locations seems to be at variance with one another.</P>
        <P>It was recently reported in the newspapers that the Central Mental Hospital is no longer in a position to take new admissions because it is so full.  Would the Government consider proceeding with the original plan the Central Mental Hospital had for using the existing grounds in the area to build a new facility which would overcome many of the difficulties and issues which had been originally raised by Schizophrenia Ireland, Friends of the CMH and Amnesty International, to mention but a few from a long list?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to be definite on this.  When I held the meeting in Dundrum at the invitation of Dr. Kennedy some months ago I made it clear that Dundrum would not be a runner.  I also made it clear that upon taking up my role in the Department of Health and Children,  the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, never made an order to me that it had to be Thornton Hall, although I was asked to proceed as quickly as possible with a new central mental hospital.  We are coming to a time when we must be site-specific but the real issue has been to ensure we build a new central mental hospital.  The only change is the fact that we are coming to a site-specific decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this, the cleverest U-turn I have heard announced in a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It was so subtle the Minister of State did not even realise it himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand why we were all brought out to look at this site.  What sort of planning is this?  How did these two units that will no longer fit suddenly appear on the horizon?  Did the Minister of State not know he needed them before this site was suggested?  It is extraordinary that we are casually being told this site is not big enough after all the trauma the various groups and families have gone through in the he last couple of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to welcome what the Minister of State has said but to add that it does not arise from a recognition on the part of the Department, Minister, her colleagues or the HSE that the proposition to site at Thornton Hall was wrong in the first instance.  It is a quirk of fate.  Welcome though it is, it is important to recognise that is the case.  Question No. 30 asks the Minister her &ldquo;plans to relocate the Central Mental Hospital to an existing psychiatric institution (details supplied)&rdquo;.  At no time in the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments or Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s remarks were these details supplied.  Can the Minister of State share with the House the site-specific existing psychiatric institution to which the question refers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many questions but I will try to answer them.  First, this is not a U-turn.  Dr. Kennedy will confirm that I made a visit on my first day in office.  I made it clear to him that my instructions were to proceed as quickly as possible to build a new central mental hospital.  I told him the only commitment I could give him was that it would not be Dundrum, for many reasons, including the fact that the sale of the property could provide value towards providing further mental health services.  It is not by way of coming to a decision quickly, dishonestly, by a U-turn, or whatever the Opposition Members want to say.  It was always a matter of the Minister making it clear that we needed a new central mental hospital.  Thornton Hall was picked because it would expedite that process.</P><Col N="679"/>
        <P>When leaving after a two-hour meeting I told Dr. Kennedy that he would not wake up some day and read in the newspapers that the central mental hospital was moving to Thornton Hall.  It was the only game in town at that time and I was working with the Minister to locate a site.  I am working on that.  I am not in a position to say where it will be located except to say that I had the opportunity to present the case to Government last Tuesday.  It is not a matter of waving flags and saying we did something because we responded to pressure.  It is a matter of doing the right thing to provide a central mental hospital as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make the point, which I was not allowed to make and which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might take with him when he leaves.  It states at the end of the Long Title &ldquo;and to provide for related matters&rdquo;.  I cannot accept that the amendment is against the spirit of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, but this is very specific.  It relates to our incurring costs at the European court.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><b>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</b> I will have that issue raised with the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office.  I call Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan to speak to amendment No. 5 and the grouping agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek more clarification on this matter.  The Minister has introduced some substantial amendments on Report Stage, which we obviously have not had a chance to discuss before.  They are amendments we need to get right because we are already falling foul of EU Commissioner McCreevy.  We need to be careful not to fall foul of him further in amending this legislation.  I regret that we must deal with such detailed and technical amendments at this point in the debate.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, amendment No. 5 relates to how an insurance company might gain more from risk equalisation than the risk justified and what should happen to that money.  Schedule 2 deals with that matter in detail, under the heading &ldquo;Community framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation (2005/C 297/04)&rdquo;.  It covers &ldquo;case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities&rdquo; and so on.  It behoves us to take note of that and ensure that the contents of this legislation comply with EU regulations and what the EU Commission considers to be an interpretation of EU regulations.  The schedule on page 31 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">22. Any over-compensation may be used to finance another service of general economic interest operated by the same undertaking,. . .  23. The amount of over-compensation cannot remain available to an undertaking on the ground that it would rank as aid compatible with the Treaty</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am flummoxed as to whether I am competent to accept or reject the Minister&rsquo;s amendments, which is why I am asking these questions.  On the one hand, that is already contained in the Bill and, on the other, we have amendments addressing the same issue.  They may or may not be contrary to Schedule 2.  I ask the Minister to provide more background information on the reasons for introducing these amendments.  Do they arise from discussions with the EU <Col N="682"/>Commission?  If so, are the amendments, particularly Nos. 41 and 44, inserted on its advice?  As the Minister has said they are all related to that issue.  In order to be competent legislators, we need more information on the background to these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said before the lunchtime break, the purpose of the legislation is to provide by way of a tax credit by the Exchequer the support of older sicker people by younger people.  That has been done by way of a stamp duty on the companies.  Clearly, there can be no intention here of overcompensation.  That is not only our view, but also very much the view of the EU Directorate General for Competition.  This is a competition matter and not one for Commission McCreevy who deals with the Internal Market.  We cannot distort competition by taking from one to give to another in circumstances which are not fair.  Therefore, the requirement is for this to be a justifiable state aid.  There is an assumption that state aid is never allowed.  State aids are allowed if they are justifiable in the public interest &mdash; in this case in the interest of the older and sicker people in the insured population.</P>
        <P>The HIA would be required to return each year to the Minister the details &mdash; we will deal later with the periods and so on &mdash; on these matters and recommendations on the tax credit so that it can be addressed in the context of budgets.  These are technical provisions to address that point.  I believe Deputy Reilly asked me what overcompensation would be.  Clearly, the HIA would seek to ensure that the return for the companies would be the general return one would expect in the market.  The return in the general insurance market is approximately 4% to 5% and one would expect that kind of return.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why have all these amendments been introduced on Report Stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I flagged on Committee Stage that I would be introducing them on Report Stage.  Some of them are clarifications from our own perspective and some of them are on foot of our engagement with the EU on the matter of justifiable state aid.  I flagged that matter, because otherwise I would not be able to introduce them.  We had been in dialogue with the EU for quite some time and I had expected a decision from it that morning.  I think the positive determination may have come the next day.  Clearly, these provisions are to ensure that there is no question of any overcompensation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, I seek further clarity on matters like &ldquo;age-related tax credits recorded in accounts&rdquo;.  I am sure there is nothing major in this and I do not want to make a bigger deal out of it than it deserves.  We need reassurance and further explanation as to the technicalities.  Most of the amendments are simple enough.  However, I have concerns about amendments Nos. 5, 30 and 31, on which I seek clarity.</P>
        <P>Before the break I asked what happens to the excess profit if excess profit is adjudged to have accrued.  Does it return to the Exchequer or is it redistributed among the other insurance companies?</P>
        <P>I seek more detail on the report by the authority setting out the information it has received from the insurers and the provision whereby the Minister may request a further report or information.  Is there any particular reason the Minister needed to get further information from the companies as proposed in amendment No. 44?  I do not have a major problem with it, but I wonder why it was inserted at such a late date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also seek more clarity.  These provisions are quite complicated.  In particular, amendment No. 41 states:</P><Col N="683"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Where, in respect of a period, the Authority has determined under subsection (5)(<i>b</i>) that the cumulative net financial impact of the relevant financial provisions on a registered undertaking or former registered undertaking was positive, and determined under subsection (6)(<i>a</i>) that the undertaking has made a profit which is in excess of the reasonable profit determined under subsection (4), it shall prepare a report</P>
     
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It continues to provide that the Minister can ask for a report even if it did not need to be prepared under that subsection.  If the report is prepared, who looks at it and determines whether it is an appropriate reward?  Deputy Reilly asked what then happens to the money.  Why are such detailed changes necessary?  We are dealing not with one amendment that will clarify that one cannot make excess profit in risk equalisation but with many complicated amendments.  I am seeking a little more clarity on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the amendments have the approval of the EU.  Others arise out of issues raised on Committee Stage in respect of the provision of greater clarity.  We are seeking to make insurance affordable to older and sicker people through what was previously risk equalisation and is now a tax credit.  For example, where a company, in this case the VHI, is over-compensated that money will go to the taxpayer.  We are dealing here with taxpayers&rsquo; money and not the money of any individual other company.  It would be ludicrous if such money were to go to a company.  Where there is over-compensation in respect of a tax credit, then it is the taxpayer who should benefit.  We do not believe we are doing so; we believe we have got it right but only time will tell.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Insurance Authority, HIA, will submit a report to the Minister who will then publish it.  The matter will then be considered in the context of the budget in terms of adjustments to the tax credit and so on.  Currently members get a tax break at the standard tax rate.  What we are doing is taking money that would go, and has for a number of years, to a company.  The amount is taken from a person&rsquo;s premium and goes directly to the companies.  The tax break is payable at the standard rate of tax and we are reorganising this between younger and older people.</P>

	<P>I cannot accept this amendment which would allow an insurance company to offer a product for 24 hours.  In other words, an insurance company could offer a product to a particular company, many of whose members are young people, and give them 24 hours to make up their mind about it before anybody else has an opportunity to hear about it.  Competitors of the VHI made a complaint to me on this issue.  It is completely unreasonable and is not in the interests of consumers or others who would like to avail of those products to have the period deleted.  I am proposing that companies cannot withdraw their product after one day and that they must have it on the market for a period of no less than 31 days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has misconstrued what I am attempting to do.  The amendment does not seek to allow a company to put a product on the market for 24 hours.  We want the period reduced to four or five days for the simple reason that under another part of the legislation no other company can offer the product for the 31 day lead-in time availed of by the first company.  That is the problem with this section, as I interpret it.  The amendment seeks to afford more rather than less competition and does not seek to promote sharp practice such as that suggested by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to misrepresent the Deputy&rsquo;s motives but the effect of his amendment would be that a company could offer a product for only one day.  While I accept it would be offered at community rating those who do not know about it will not be able to avail of it.  I mentioned earlier that there is in this city a company that employs 1,200 to 1,400 people.  As I understand it, that company has not had a claim for the past 18 months to two years because all those involved are young, healthy people, which is a healthy situation for any insurance company.  We want to ensure that products that are available are available for a reasonable period to all persons.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already shortened it from 20 to ten days, which I believe is reasonable.  What we are seeking to do is ensure the products offered are fair and provide community rating.  I believe ten working days, which is two weeks, for the health insurance authorities to assess those products is not unreasonable.  Previously, they had 20 days within which to do so and would prefer if they still have that length of time to carry out the assessments.  I have halved the length of time provided.  I do not believe three days is a realistic timeframe within which to do the type of job that needs to be done.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

I accept the law has changed and that from now on they will have those numbers.  However, there is retrospection involved here.  The Bill places an additional onus on insurance companies to chase people for their PPS numbers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="686"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners require the insurance companies to have PPS numbers to make tax credits to individuals.  The Bill refers to &ldquo;all reasonable efforts&rdquo;.  In other words, we are asking them to do only what is reasonable.  Clearly, the Revenue Commissioners require the PPS number to be able to allocate the tax credit to the individual company.  This would be a cop-out.  The words &ldquo;reasonable effort&rdquo; are included in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect, I do not believe it is unreasonable to say &ldquo;where that information is held by the health insurance business in respect of insured persons&rdquo;.  If they have the information, they should hand it over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We require them to obtain the information and to take all reasonable steps to do so.  If they cannot get it, that is a different issue.  They are required to make every effort to get the information.  In other words, they should ask the people they are insuring for their PPS numbers at the time of renewal or on taking out new contract so that it can be transmitted to Revenue who in turn can allocate tax credit to them.  That is all that is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there any obstacles to insurance companies getting PPS numbers?  When HIQA announced that there should be new health numbers, it pointed that in many cases it is not appropriate to use the PPS number for health information.  Has that been considered?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The jury is out on the appropriate electronic patient identifier.  The general view is that the PPS is not appropriate for it, something else will be needed and the sooner we get it the better, not least for patient safety issues.</P>
        <P>We are discussing the matter with the Data Protection Commission and we must satisfy the commissioner.  The Revenue Commissioners require the PPS number to give the tax credit and the steps proposed in the legislation are not unreasonable.  We are asked for our PPS numbers at present.  I was looking at my health insurance renewal recently and there was a reference to the number on that, perhaps in preparation for this legislation.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">This addresses the appointment of further advisers.  There is enough advice within the Department, the HIA and the HSE without seeking outside advice.  We are trying to reduce costs &mdash; there are cutbacks in hospitals and we have debated Crumlin Hospital, medical cards, palliative care and people lying on trolleys &mdash; so I see no need for further advisers, and certainly not for them to be enshrined in legislation, which predicts it will happen whether it is necessary or not.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are a lot of advisers already, the Attorney General and other legal people who worked on the drafting of the Bill.  We are trying to save money.  There are many people working in the Department,  in spite of the fact that most of its functions were given to the HSE.  The facility should exist already within the Department to provide the advice necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 475 people working in the Department of Health and Children but it is the second largest Department in terms of legislation and the busiest in answering parliamentary questions, with the second biggest budget.  That is not to say there is not room <Col N="689"/>for further reductions.  Two thirds of the staff in the Department are at the lower grades, with a third in the higher grades.</P>
        <P>This provision was introduced by Deputy Howlin when he was Minister and used by his successor as Minister, Deputy Noonan.  We do not have actuarial staff in the Department and it would not be cost effective to employ such staff full-time because they are expensive and rarely needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are asked to evaluate submissions by companies who have actuarial expertise.  I must evaluate them and advise the Government.  It is not realistic to ask me to do so using regular civil servants.  If I wanted advice on colorectal cancer, I would go to a colorectal cancer expert.  This is a specialist area and the skill is not readily available.  We go to tender when we are recruiting expertise in the area.  This is not about appointing advisers, it is about appointing experts to advise on technical issues related to health insurance.

	<P Just="Left">What is the role of the HIA?  Are there no actuaries in the Department of Finance or the HIA who could be called upon?  What are they doing in the Health Insurance Agency?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no actuarial advice in the Department of Finance.  The HIA is a regulator and will be part of the financial regulatory environment.  It is financed by the industry and will have a role in the regulation of health insurers and a further role in assessing the effect of the tax credit and reporting to me.  I then have to assess if I am to advise the Minister for Finance if tax credits should be altered and the Government must consider that in a budgetary context.</P>
        <P>If necessary I must have a lot of advice.  We were in court on a number of occasions on risk equalisation and had to bring in expertise from outside the State.  We were up against huge expertise from the different interests.  The Deputy is being unreasonable, we do not get outside expertise for the sake of it, we have greatly reduced the amount of money spent on consultancies in the Department and the HSE.

	<P>Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s amendment has the effect of deleting one of the purposes of the Bill, so I clearly cannot accept it.  Amendment No. 53 makes a necessary syntactical change to facilitate the insertion of new definitions into subsection (1) of section 112A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and inserts new definitions for &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;employer&rdquo; into subsection (1) of section 112A of the same Act.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 54 deletes the proposed amendments to subsections (2) and (3) of section 112A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as provided for in the Bill as initiated, and inserts a new subsection 2A into that section which ensures that where an employer pays a health insurance premium on behalf of an employee the employee is charged to income tax on the full value of the perquisite &mdash; i.e., the gross premium paid by the employer to the authorised insurer plus the age-related tax credit due in respect of the premium and the amount payable by the employer to the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with section 112A(3); that is, the standard-rated tax relief due on the premium.</P>
        <P>The amendment also deletes the proposed amendment to subsection (3) of section 112A of the Act as provided for in the Bill as initiated.  This refers to a charge to tax on employers that pay health insurance premiums on behalf of their employees, equal to the amount of the age-related tax credit due in respect of premiums paid, and is to deal with benefit-in-kind issues raised by the companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to understand what is happening here.  The Bill amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  As I understand it, we are talking about cases in which the employer is paying the health premium. It happens in many cases that a person&rsquo;s health insurance is paid for by his or her employer.  We are talking about the tax associated with the levy to achieve risk equalisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="696"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify who is paying the tax?  Is it the employee or the employer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing changes here.  At the moment, if one&rsquo;s employer pays one&rsquo;s health insurance, that is considered a benefit-in-kind and a tax is applied by the Revenue Commissioners.  I have forgotten the amount, but one must pay a sum of money in lieu of that.  It is the same if one has a company car or any other such benefits.  What we are seeking to do in this legislation, as a result of representations from companies, is not to impose any further burdens on companies as a result of the tax credit or in terms of their corporation tax.  It is to be factored out before they pay their corporation tax.  In other words, they will not pay more taxes by virtue of the way in which we are shifting money from younger to older people.  That is what these amendments seek to do.  This also applies to companies&rsquo; capital requirements.  What we are doing in the legislation does not affect any of those things.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify that it will not impose an additional tax on employees?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Under section 19, the proposed new subsection 1(<i>a</i>) of section 112A states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In this section&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) as respects so much of a payment that qualifies for relief under section 470, &lsquo;appropriate percentage&rsquo;, &lsquo;authorised insurer&rsquo;, &lsquo;relevant contract&rsquo; and &lsquo;relievable amount&rsquo; have the same meanings, respectively, as in section 470,</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Minister has reassured Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan that nothing herein incurs an additional cost either to the employee or the employer.  How can that be?  Surely one or the other will face an additional charge.  Is the Minister saying this will negate any additional payments from either the insured or the employer who is insuring him or her?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>This purpose of the legislation is to transfer the sum that is given by way of a tax credit to the benefit of older people from younger people within the group of insured persons.  How the insurance companies deal with this requirement is entirely a matter for themselves.  In other words, it is a decision for individual companies as to whether health insurance premia will increase on foot of this.  That is not what we are seeking to do in the legislation.  It stipulates that the sum of money allowed by the Revenue Commissioners for health insurance will be redistributed as between older and younger people.  Fundamentally, these measures are a case of transferring money.  We had sought to attain our objective by way of risk equalisation but instead it is being done through a tax credit.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">My party opposes the insurance levy because we are of the view that it has increased and will continue to increase the cost of insurance.  It is pushing younger people out of the market, the very customers the Minister seeks to retain in order to pay for the insurance needs of the older generation.  I will not get political about the current recession but there is no doubt that fewer people are now in a position to afford health insurance.  This measure is the nail in the coffin <Col N="698"/>for many families who have tried desperately to continue paying their premia.  People are desperate to retain their insurance because they have lost faith in the public health service to deliver timely and efficient care.  That lack of confidence arises from the manner in which the service has been managed, which is primarily a matter for the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not particularly support Deputy Reilly in objecting to the specifics of the legislation.  However, the Bill essentially proposes an awkward measure to deal with risk equalisation.  It is not what any of us would consider ideal, and we will have to wait some years before we have appropriate legislation.</P>
        <P>The fundamental problem is that people are obliged to take out private health insurance because they do not trust the public health system.  Many do so while disagreeing with the concept of the separation of private and public patients and the dual system which incorporates that concept.  They feel obliged to seek private cover because they are fearful of the consequences of not doing so.  That is not an acceptable system.  This conglomerate arrangement is different from what pertains in every other civilised country.  The Labour Party accepts this legislation because we consider it essential that there be a rebalancing between younger and older clients of health insurers in order to ensure that insurers receive some form of compensation to allow them to continue to provide a service to older people.</P>
        <P>However, this does not mean we are in favour of the current system.  This legislation is necessary in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, but we do not support the mixed arrangement whereby more than 50% of the population take out private health insurance because, as Deputy Reilly observed, they have no confidence in the public system.  That is not the case in any other jurisdiction.  I am sure the Minister agrees to some extent that the public health service is currently subsidising the private system.  That is unacceptable.  We must find an alternative system.  I acknowledge that the Minister is setting up a group to examine this, but it will not report until some time next year.  Both of the main Opposition parties have already put forward proposals for an alternative one-tier system that would involve people paying into a universal system of health insurance.  As I said, my party supports this legislation because it is necessary, but we do not support the mixed health system in operation in the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are about to have a philosophical debate.  When the Progressive Democrats Party was formed many years ago, we advocated universal health insurance.  However, we changed our minds after being presented with the prospective consequences by a group established to examine the issue.  What Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan is proposing is compulsory universal insurance whereby some would pay the full commercial cost of health services while others would be entirely subsidised and still more would be somewhere in the middle.</P>
        <P>I read an article in <i>The Economist</i> today which set out various models of health provision, including the Dutch model under which there have been rising prices and consolidation of insurers.  The reality is that there is no perfect model.  I do not mean to be critical of the Opposition proposals, although I would like to see them costed.  When Professor Charles Normand, who is a member of the expert group we have established, put forward the universal proposal for the Adelaide Society, he estimated it would cost a minimum of &euro;300 million per year for hospital cover alone.  There will always be better-off people in society who will be willing to purchase more.  There is no doubt about that.  Even under a universal model such as that proposed by the Deputy, there will be people who wish to avail of extras in addition to the basic cover.</P><Col N="699"/>
        <P>The State health insurer was established by the then Minister, Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Higgins, because the better-off did not have universal access to hospitals.  It was envisaged that 10% to 20% of the population would take out insurance and thus cover their own costs for hospital care.  When universal cover was introduced in the early 1990s, we began to see the consequences of having this mishmash in hospitals where doctors receive a public salary as well as a top-up for insured patients.  In any normal situation, economics play a part in all our lives.  Those types of incentives inevitably cause unnecessary problems such as the case of the late Susie Long who was told in a hospital funded by the State, in which all the staff and services are paid for by taxpayers, that she could have a colonoscopy the following week if she had health insurance, otherwise she must wait.  In her case, unfortunately, the consequences were fatal.</P>
        <P>Under the new consultant contract, some 25% of consultants now work full-time in the public system.  While I wish the figure was 100% and everyone would be seen on the basis of medical need, at least we have made a start.  As I indicated, someone from a different party was critical that one cannot secure preferential access to a named consultant in County Louth because he no longer does private work.  The consultant is obliged to see everybody because everyone has cover.</P>
        <P>Deputy Reilly is trying to fillet the Bill.  The purpose of the legislation is to make sure health insurance continues to be affordable.  Regardless of what arguments one makes, companies have a way of defining products to attract members of a particular age group.  For example, sports injury and maternity benefits are only attractive to younger people.  Even active 80 year olds do not generally suffer from sports injuries and will certainly not find themselves in maternity hospitals.  In the autumn, after the Bill has been passed, I hope to address the issue of minimum benefits.  I am concerned that services such as rehabilitation, stroke care and so forth are being limited by the insurance companies.  I do not want such circumstances to prevail.</P>
        <P>Other people introduced risk equalisation, which is a principle I support.  I tried to implement such a system but the legislation was struck down by the Supreme Court.  The Bill marks a time-limited effort, over three years, to transfer from the young to the old and from the healthier to the sick by way of a tax credit skewed in favour of older people so as to make insurance more affordable for them and make older people more attractive to insurance companies.</P>
        <P>A great deal of ingenuity and effort has been invested in this legislation by public servants, actuarial advisers and many others.  Having discussed at length and with numerous people means of achieving our objective in the short term following the Supreme Court decision, I have concluded that this legislation is the only way to do so.</P>
        <P>The purpose of Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s amendments is to fillet the Bill.  If they were accepted, we would never be in a position to secure authorisation.  We must implement our objective in this calendar year.  This can only be done through the tax credit model and stamp duty on insurance companies.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to a philosophical discussion and I am certain we could have one.  She also indicated the Bill was time-limited to three years.  I note amendment No. 60 refers to &ldquo;the year of assessment 2009, 2010 or 2011&rdquo; and states &ldquo;where a payment made to an authorised insurer is a monthly or other instalment towards the payment of the total annual premium due under a relevant contract, and the payment of such an instalment becomes due and is made in the year of assessment 2012&rdquo;.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an accounting issue.  The provision is in respect of 2011.  The legislation will not be applicable in 2012.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="700"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The House has been informed the legislation will only apply for three years.  Deputies were also informed that the VHI would be authorised by 1 January and, thereafter, 1 March.  The most recent date we have been given is 1 September.  We have little faith in the ability of the Government to adhere to the initial timeframes it expresses, often with a view to bringing this side of the House with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fine Gael Party staunchly supports the VHI, a company that has served many people very well and has been an integral part of the health service since its establishment more than 50 years ago.  We also fully support the concept of community rating.  Let there be no confusion on that issue.  The problems my party have are with the manner in which risk equalisation is being introduced, the extent of the levies and manner in which they have come about as well as the decision to take a soft option rather than addressing the substantive issue, namely, the requirement to establish proper support for community rating to allow the system to work as opposed to putting the issue on the long finger.</P>
        <P>Other countries have managed to introduce community rating.  The Minister referred to <i>TheEconomist</i>.  She is also correct that no system is 100% perfect.  A perfect system will not emerge anywhere but we can strive for a major improvement by examining the models in place in other countries where levels of equality are much greater.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the late Susie Long.  We still do not have equality, which is not a matter of precluding those who have done well in life from using their money to add comfort to their medical care but one of ensuring that everyone has access to basic standards of medical care with which everyone can be satisfied in terms of securing timely access to life-saving and life-altering treatments which make the difference between longevity and not achieving one&rsquo;s full potential.  My amendments address the core of my disagreement with the Bill and I will stand over them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>None of us, including the Minister, regards the Bill as perfect.  It is a stop-gap measure.  Will it be possible to introduce the proper legislation sooner than the three years suggested?  Perhaps we will have moved to a universal system into which everyone must pay within three years, although no one knows what lies ahead.  No one likes the idea of transferring moneys from one company to another, in this case through a complicated system of levies and so forth.  Having a central fund into which everyone pays a certain amount, depending on age mix and so forth, and from which companies with a larger proportion of older policyholders are paid, appears to be a preferable system. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  The model the Deputy describes is risk equalisation which proved to be a bone of contention.  All companies or practices would find contentious a requirement to transfer money to a competitor.  Under the model proposed in the Bill, moneys will be transferred by the State through the tax system.  From that point of view, the proposed system is preferable to direct transfers.</P>
        <P>One cannot have community rating while filleting the Bill to the extent Deputy Reilly seeks.  While I do not doubt the Fine Gael Party supports the VHI, the Deputy must not understand what we are doing in this legislation &mdash; I do not mean to sound arrogant &mdash; as he would not otherwise have proposed the amendments before us.  If accepted, his amendments would fillet the Bill and we would be unable to continue with a system of community rating.</P>
        <P>The Bill will apply for three years.  If, however, a person takes out a premium in mid-2011, it will run into 2012.  The year 2012 is referred to for accounting purposes.  The legislation will apply in 2009, 2010 and 2011, but 2012 is included because premiums taken out in 2011 will <Col N="701"/>run into 2012 as they are normally taken out for one year and paid in monthly instalments.  The inclusion of the year 2012 in the text of the amendment is to address issues that arise as a result.</P>
        <P>I do not believe for one moment that risk equalisation will be in place in three years, even if the Government were to change in the morning.  Even Deputy Reilly acknowledges it would not be in place until year five.  At least the Labour Party, when it last proposed its model, put a price of &euro;4 billion on it.  I invite Deputy Reilly to have his proposal costed by the Department of Finance.  It is comic politics to suggest everyone will secure access to free primary care and 2 million more people will gain access to insurance without incurring additional costs.  I would do this in the morning if that were the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The health budget was only &pound;5 billion when we made our proposal.  It has increased significantly since that time. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it has increased to &euro;16 billion, which amounts to 40% of all the tax we will raise this year.  To explain some of the reasons health is so expensive in Ireland, <i>TheEconomist </i>article to which I referred notes that doctors are paid 3.7 times the average wage in the United States, 4.2 times the average wage in Britain but seven times the average wage in Ireland.  We are all paid much more than our counterparts elsewhere which is the reason money does not go as far here as it does elsewhere. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That applies to the Minister too. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I am not paid seven times more. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder if the figure the Minister cited refers to general practitioners or consultants.  In any event, it is a red herring.  The main point is that the Minister maintains we cannot have a system of risk equalisation.  Of course we can and it is available in other countries.  The Minister is merely fiddling with the margins instead of addressing the real issue.  We will take a Mickey Mouse approach for three years even though she does not believe it will be possible within that timeframe.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to the possibility of introducing universal health insurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>She used the words &ldquo;risk equalisation&rdquo;.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was responding to Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, who thought we might have universal health insurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the Minister meant to say &ldquo;universal health insurance&rdquo;, this can be achieved within a five year period and without additional costs.  We are spending &euro;5,000 annually on health for each man, woman and child in this country compared to &euro;4,000 in Holland, which ranks first in terms of quality and second in terms of value for money.  If it can be done in that country, it can be done here.</P>
        <P>The Minister might not formerly have wished to do it and perhaps she has since changed her mind but she has had a long time to introduce change.  The people made their judgment in the last local elections and they shiver when they look at our health services.  They do not have confidence in her or the HSE to deliver.  I do not have confidence in this Bill because, while I would like to accept its <i>bona fides</i>, I do not believe it is the correct way to achieve its stated objectives.  Addressing the substantive issues will require a different type of legislation.  What <Col N="702"/>is the Department, the HSE and HIQA doing if they cannot address these issues once and for all instead of introducing interim measures which hurt people, increase the cost of insurance to young families and push people out of the market?  I intend to press my amendment to a vote because it lies at the core of my disagreement with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to comparisons with the Dutch health care model, a visit to a general practitioner in the Netherlands costs &euro;24.80 whereas it would cost &euro;50 or more in this city.  We should compare like with like.  Hospitals and insurers have closed or consolidated with the result that prices have risen very rapidly.  This is not a perfect world.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I discussed health reform in the United States with a doctor and US Congressman who was here as part of a visiting delegation.  These reforms aim to move away from procedure based medicine because of the rising costs involved.  I have not met any health Minister in the developed world who is not concerned about costs.  Equally, we have one of the best health care systems in the world, regardless of how often the Deputy rubbishes it.  Significant advances have been made in cancer and cardiac care, infant mortality and life expectancy.  We are not perfect but we are improving at a fast rate.  That is nowhere more evident than in the area of cancer.</P>
        <P>The scheme of risk equalisation was introduced by the former Ministers for Health, Deputies Howlin and Noonan.  It was a good idea but, unfortunately, it has been litigated out of existence and was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court.  It will take some time to go back to the drawing board and I do not doubt that we will again face litigation.  In the meantime, older people will not be able to afford insurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a supposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I triggered risk equalisation in 2005, there has been nothing but litigation.  That is a fact.  I do not know how many times we have been in the courts but we have not been able to transfer payments.  We are now addressing the matter by way of the tax system, which I believe is fair.  This is a short term measure which has been approved by the EU as a justifiable state aid because it serves the needs of older and sicker people.  I appeal to the Deputy not to press an amendment which effectively fillets the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. <i>a</i>1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 15, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The operation of this Act shall be reviewed by the Minister and a report shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas five years after the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0" el="5">Having regard to the late amendments that have been introduced by the Minister and to the highly technical nature of this Bill, I ask that this matter be reviewed.  The history of this kind of legislation is such that it is visited by us in this House on a very infrequent basis.  Given the extensive changes that we are now enacting in law, the highly complex nature of the Bill, and its importance in the context of electronic conveyancing and modern methods, it is not sufficient for the Minister to review this matter by way of legislation or consultation with his colleagues form time to time.  Reports in the form of a review of the changes this Bill proposes should be laid before the House.  A five-year period is not unreasonable and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Deputy tabling this amendment and understand the motives behind it, but I am not inclined to accept it because of the relatively broad nature of the legislation and the fact that it is, in effect, a very substantial updating of our laws in regard to conveyancing.  It is probably unlikely that there would be adequate experience over a five-year period to warrant a full review of every section in the legislation.  Therefore, I propose an alternative amendment.  </P>
        <P>In amendment No. 1 to section 5, I propose, following consultation with Attorney General, a provision which will permit the Minister, during a five-year period following commencement of the Act, to deal with any difficulties which may arise either in the bringing into operation or in giving effect to a provision.  Such regulations will be made with a view to removing that difficulty.</P>
        <P>Those regulations would be on the basis that it would be required that a draft of the regulations would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in advance and that both Houses would approve the draft by means of a resolution.  I believe that will take care of what Deputy Charles Flanagan is trying to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to accept what the Minister said.  I take it he is referring to amendment No. 1, which I accept.  I would have thought both amendments were sufficiently connected.  Perhaps we could have discussed them together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  This is the way it is.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="706"/>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is take it or leave it.  I will withdraw my amendment.  I thank the Minister and acknowledge what he said.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of the Minister while amendment No. 2 is related and an alternative.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 20, to delete lines 21 to 40 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) A regulation under <i>subsection (1) </i>shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation is annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(3)(<i>a</i>) If in any respect any difficulty arises during the period of 5 years from the commencement of any provision of this Act (including a provision that amends another Act), either in bringing into operation or in giving full effect to the provision or the Act as amended, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) In <i>paragraph </i>(<i>a</i>) a reference to another Act is a reference to an Act falling within either paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) of the definition of &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in section 2(1) of the Act of 2005.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(4) Regulations under <i>subsection (3) </i>may, in so far only as it may appear necessary for the removal of such difficulty, modify a provision referred to in that subsection provided such modification is in conformity with the purposes, principles and spirit of this Act.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(5) Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under <i>subsection (3)</i>&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) he or she shall, before doing so, consult with such other (if any) Minister of the Government as the Minister considers appropriate having regard to the functions of that other Minister of the Government in relation to the proposed regulations, and</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) he or she shall cause a draft of the regulations to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(6) A regulation under this section may contain such consequential, supplementary and ancillary provisions as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment responds to an issue raised by Deputy Tuffy on Committee Stage discussions on section 5.  I indicated I would look at it and ask the Attorney General about it.  Amendment No. 1 is the outcome of those discussions.</P>
        <P>It provides for a new subsection (3) for the making of regulations during a five-year period following commencement to remove any difficulty encountered in bringing a provision of the Act into effect.  It may do so, however, only on condition that any modification is in conformity with the purposes, principles and the spirit of the Act and that a draft of any such regulation shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in advance and shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by both Houses.</P><Col N="707"/>
        <P>I believe that will take care of what Deputy Tuffy was endeavouring to do and that it answers Deputy Charles Flanagan&rsquo;s point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for taking on board the issue I raised.  He obviously accepted the point we made about the constitutional problem which would arise without this amendment being made.  That is welcome.  Was that the Minister&rsquo;s reasoning?  Was he trying to deal with the constitutional issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that and will withdraw amendment No. 2 on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is rather novel.  It is broadly similar to what the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, did in regard to the Nursing Home Support Bill 2008 and it is important.  I am not sure if the Minister was in the Chamber but I had the opportunity last week or the week before to refer to this issue of a Minister changing the law by way of regulation rather than primary legislation.  I have a concern about it and wish to voice once again my concern about the manner in which changes to our laws are being made by way of regulation without appropriate or adequate scrutiny and debate.</P>
        <P>I note this is similar to the mechanism contained in the Nursing Homes Support Bill 2008 and I look forward to monitoring it and seeing how it works.  I also see a role of Oireachtas committees in this and perhaps the draft regulations could be referred to an Oireachtas committee for some form of agreement prior to being finally approved.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 3 is in the name of the Minister while amendment No. 4 is related and an alternative.   Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 21, to delete lines 10 to 16 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) Subject to <i>subsection (1)</i>, and without prejudice to section 26(2)(<i>f</i>) of the Act of 2005&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) any reference in an enactment to&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">(i) the Settled Land Acts 1882 to 1890,</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">(ii) an Act included in that collective citation, or</P>

        <P LI="3" el="5" FLI="0">shall be construed as a reference to this Act or to the equivalent or substituted provision of this Act, as may be appropriate,</P>

        <P LI="4" el="5">(i) the Conveyancing Acts 1881 to 1911, or</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">(ii) an Act (other than an Act repealed by this Act) included in that collective citation,</P><Col N="708"/>
        <P LI="4" el="5" FLI="0">shall be construed as including a reference to this Act, and</P>

        <P LI="4" el="5">(i) an Act that is included in the collective citation &ldquo;the Conveyancing Acts 1881 to 1911&rdquo; and that is repealed by this Act, or</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">(ii) any particular provision of such an Act, shall be construed as a reference to this Act or to the equivalent or substituted provision of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Again, this amendment relates to a matter raised by Deputy Tuffy on Committee Stage in regard to section 8.  I said I would ask the Attorney General about it.  The more comprehensive interpretation amendment I propose is the outcome of those discussions and it will replace the provisions to which Deputy Tuffy drew attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no issue with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 21, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(3) In so far as they survive, titles of honour or dignity arising from feudal baronies and manorial lordships are abolished.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(4) If after the commencement of this section a person purports to sell or offer for sale a title of honour or dignity abolished by <i>subsection (3)</i>, he or she shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is another issue the Minister said he would examine before Report Stage.  We had a good discussion on it on the last occasion and the Minister said that if we included this provision in the legislation, he was afraid it could give rise to the impression that these titles were land interests.  At the same time, he said he would ask the Attorney General to review the point raised by this amendment to see if legislation could be brought in.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party raised this issue in legislation I brought forward in the Seanad a couple of years ago but nothing has happened since then.  It is an issue of concern to the Genealogical Society of Ireland.  Has the Attorney General looked at it since and, if so, what is his view?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>My view in regard to this issue has not changed since Committee Stage.  I made the point that the types of titles to which the Deputy refers, titles of honour or dignity arising from feudal baronies or manorial lordships, do not, in any way, amount to an interest in land.  To include them in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 would give a misleading impression that, to some degree, they amount to having an interest in land.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage I said that, after the passing of this legislation, I would bring the issue to the attention of the Attorney General to see if it could be dealt with elsewhere but not in a Bill dealing with interests in land.  As Deputy Tuffy knows, titles do not adhere to the land and should not be included in a Bill dealing with conveyancing issues.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="709"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Attorney General propose to deal with this by way of legislation?  Rather than putting it on the long finger, there was an opportunity with this legislation to deal with it fairly speedily.  If it is not included in this legislation, will it be put on the long finger?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing on the agenda.  These are personal rights and are personal to the people involved.  They are not property rights.  They cannot be included in a Bill which deals with real property issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 21, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(3) Subject to this Act a fee simple shall be freely alienable by the owner thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">On Committee Stage, the Minister said he would examine this amendment.  While section 9(2) does not rule against inalienability, the rule itself is contained in an Act repealed by section 8(3), thus the rule is not stated in the Bill.  The Labour Party believes this has the potential to cause confusion and it is necessary to state the actual rule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendments Nos. 7 and 8 have the same intent as Deputy Tuffy&rsquo;s amendment.  Amendment No. 7 drops the indirect reference to the rule against inalienability from section 9(3)(<i>c</i>) while amendment No. 8 reinstates the rule in a more positive way with a new section 9(4).</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

Section 11(3) allows for a leasehold estate for an uncertain term which would seem to include a tenancy at will.  In any event, there is no clear policy reason to abolish a tenancy at will.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment No. 9 proposes to insert a reference into section 11(3) to a tenancy for any period whether specified or unspecified.  Section 11(3)(<i>c</i>), however, already refers to a leasehold estate for a term which is uncertain and the proposed amendment would be superfluous.  There is a risk that including a reference to an unspecified period, in addition to the existing reference to an uncertain term, would be likely to cause confusion as to the respective meanings of the terms.  I believe it would be better to leave this out.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 24, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(4) Where on the commencement of this section, or on a person becoming entitled to a fee tail after such commencement, another person&rsquo;s estate or interest in land is extinguished by virtue of <i>subsection (3)</i>, the second-mentioned person may apply to the court within 12 years of such extinguishment for an order determining the amount of compensation if any that should be paid to the second-mentioned person, and such order may make provision for charging the payment on the land subject to such conditions as the court sees fit.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">On Committee Stage, I pointed out the UCC academic, Professor John Mee, believed section 13(3) may be unconstitutional as it provides for the abolition of property rights without compensation.  This amendment is designed to save the section from being unconstitutional by allowing a court to determine whether any compensation should be paid.  The Minister said the consent of fee tail is required but that misses the point.  The issue we are concerned with is the rights, if any, of the persons who would inherit the fee tail.  Their rights are being extinguished without compensation by this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill was amended subsequent to the article to which the Deputy refers which first raised this matter.  Section 13 prohibits the future creation of a fee tail estate.  Any future attempt to do so would create a fee simple instead.  Going back to our time in college, it is good to see this procedure prohibited because it caused many law students difficulty when slaving over property law.</P>
        <P>Section 13(3) goes on to convert existing fee tails into fee simples.  Under a 19th century statute it already is possible, under certain conditions, to bar the entail, that is, to terminate a fee tail estate.  One such condition is that the permission of the protector of the entail is given.  This condition is carried over into section 13(3), which will ensure interference with any existing interest in the land is avoided.  Since the provisions in section 13 will continue to protect any existing interest in the land, I do not discern a need for the provisions proposed by Deputy Tuffy.</P>

Having considered the matter, I am proposing amendment No. 14 to ensure there is coherence between sections 31 and 116.  The amendment incorporates a provision already set out in section 116(2)(<i>a</i>).  It will allow the court to make &ldquo;an order for the taking of an account of incumbrances affecting the land&rdquo; under section 31, as is already the case under section 116. <Col N="712"/> Amendment No. 33 which will incorporate a cross-reference to section 31 in section 116(1) will alert a judgment mortgagee to the fact that in the case of co-owned land, an application must be made under section 31 rather than section 116.

        <P FLI="0" el="5">These amendments result from the Committee Stage discussion on the acquisition of easements by means of the doctrine of lost modern grant.  As I indicated to the select committee, the reforms contained in the Bill in relation to easements were recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  Following a review of the relevant provisions following our select committee discussion, I am proposing to reintroduce an element of flexibility which has been available under the doctrine of the lost modern grant.  The proposed new section 35(3) provides that where the required relevant user period was not immediately prior to the proceedings establishing the existence of an easement, the court may nonetheless make an order declaring the existence of the easement, as long as it is satisfied that it is just and equitable, in all the circumstances of the case, to do so.  This will permit the courts to have regard to factors such as long use of easement, even if that use has been discontinued prior to the commencement of the action.  Allowing courts to make such orders, if they are satisfied that it is just and reasonable to do so, will provide a degree of flexibility in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to give the House a practical example of what he is talking about.  It seems we are vesting in the court the power to make an order in respect of, for example, a right of way that may be in dispute and heretofore would have remained in dispute or could not have been clarified because it did not fulfil the requirements of the appropriate common law doctrine.  Am I right in saying that in such cases, the court will now be in a position to make a declaration or order not on the basis of any legal precedent or principle, but on the basis of what is deemed to be just and equitable in the circumstances?  Perhaps we could be given a practical example of how this might go before the courts, for example, in the event of a right of way dispute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that an easement such as a right of way is normally expressed or implied.  There are three ways of acquiring an easement, the first of which involves the prescription at common law.  In such cases, it is necessary to establish the use of an easement from time immemorial which in practice is deemed to be 1189.  In general, the courts are willing to presume enjoyment of an easement since 1189 if proof of at least 20 years, or for as long as witnesses can confirm, is available.  It is obvious that squatters&rsquo; rights apply in certain circumstances.  However, this presumption can be rebutted by any evidence which shows that the right could not have been enjoyed since 1189.  </P><Col N="713"/>
        <P>The second means of acquiring an easement involves the prescription under the doctrine of lost modern grant which is the subject of the amendments before the House.  It was developed at the end of the 18th century.  If one can establish that an easement has been used for at least 20 years, the court is willing to assume, on the basis of a legal fiction, that a formal grant of the easement by deed was made at some stage but the deed has been lost in the meantime.  However, this assumption can be defeated if it can be shown that during the period of use, there was no person who could lawfully have granted the easement.</P>
        <P>The third means of acquiring an easement involves the prescription of the Prescription Acts.  It appears that the Acts were intended to replace the prescription at common law and the prescription under lost modern grant but failed to do so.  The main difference is that under the Prescription Acts, the user period must run right up to the time of the proceedings in which the right is claimed.</P>
        <P>A report on the acquisition of easements and <i>profit &agrave;prendre</i> by prescription was produced by the Law Reform Commission in 2002.  It stated the law in this area was unnecessarily complicated and recommended that it should be updated and simplified.  It identified that the principal defect of prescription at common law and prescription under lost modern grant was the uncertainty to which they gave rise for the purchasers of property.  In other words, a purchaser of property could find himself or herself bound by rights which he or she had no means of discovering by making reasonable inquiries or inspections.  The risk arises from the fact that it is possible to claim an easement by these means, even though the right is not being exercised at the time and may not have been exercised for many years.</P>
        <P>Many of the complexities in this area in Ireland and probably in the United Kingdom also relate to the acquisition and exercise of rights of way over property.  I suppose these complexities have been the source of much litigation during the years.  I was involved in a famous case which received national publicity.  It proved beyond doubt the idea that &ldquo;once a right of way, always a right of way&rdquo;, even if the right of way has not been used for many years.  In the case to which I refer, evidence was procured and produced in the High Court to show that the right of way in question had been used in the times of Fionn MacCumhaill.  That is what was said, at least, although I am not sure if the evidence stood up.  It was argued that according to the Brown Bull of Cooley, the pass in question &mdash; the b&oacute;thar maol, as it was called &mdash; was used to arrange a retreat back to Sligo.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission concluded that there was no virtue in retaining prescription at common law or prescription under lost modern grant and recommended their abolition.  The new scheme proposed by it, to which statutory effect is being given in the Bill, is based on continuous use over a 12-year period.  When the lack of flexibility this would involve was discussed by the select committee, it was agreed to reconsider the matter.  Following a review of the relevant provisions, it is now proposed to reintroduce an element of flexibility which was available in the case of prescription under lost modern grant.  The proposed new section 35(3) provides that &ldquo;where the relevant user period was not immediately before the commencement of the action&rdquo; to establish the existence of an easement, the court may nonetheless make an order declaring the existence of the easement if it is satisfied it is just and equitable to do so.  As I said, this will permit the court to have regard to factors such as long use of an easement, even if that use had been discontinued prior to the commencement of the action.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment arises from issues raised by both Deputy Tuffy and Deputy Charles Flanagan, on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Section 44 provides a new mechanism by means of which a building owner may carry out works to a party structure.  However, if the builder fails to make good any damage done to the property of the adjoining owner or to pay reasonable costs for having the damage repaired, the adjoining owner must have the appropriate remedy.  The amendment I am proposing makes it clear that the adjoining owner may apply to the court for an order requiring that any damage be made good.  If the building owner fails to do so within a reasonable time or alternatively if <Col N="715"/>the building owner fails to reimburse the costs of expenses for doing so within a reasonable period, the adjoining owner may recover the costs and expenses as a simple contract debt.</P>
        <P>The new element in this revised text refers to the possibility of an adjoining owner obtaining a court order requiring that any damage done by the building owner be made good.  I believe it takes care of the issues raised by the two Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for amendment No. 17.  He deals with an  issue I raised when I was a Senator when we were discussing this Bill.  I also raised it on Committee Stage.  I made the point that while various remedies were available to the building owner, if he or she did not put right the damage there was only a provision whereby the adjoining owner could get costs through the courts.  He or she could not get the damage remedied to which the costs were applicable. </P>
        <P>I am grateful the Minister has taken on board the issue I raised and that he has tabled amendment No. 17 to address it.  We put a great deal of work into this legislation in the Seanad and at the D&aacute;il select committee.  There is much talk to the effect that amendments are never accepted by the Government.  I saw a television programme where a former Minister said that amendments from the Opposition were no longer accepted by the Government.  That is not true.  This case shows that the Minister is taking on board a point that has been raised by the Opposition and he is dealing with it in an amendment, and I acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>However, in amending section 44(4), the Minister has now created a situation whereby if the building owner fails to make good the damage, then the adjoining owner can apply to court for the building owner to do works to undo the damage.  The Minister has removed the provision whereby the building owner could, at his discretion, offer compensation to the adjoining owner.  I make this point in case it is an error on the part of the Minister.</P>
        <P>The situation now is to the effect that if the building owner fails to make good the damage within a reasonable time, then the adjoining owner may apply to the court for an order requiring the damage to be made good.  On such application, the court may make such order as it believes fit or, as provided for in the subsection already, the adjoining owner may recover such costs and expenses or compensation as a simple contract debt in a court.  The possibility no longer exists for the building owner to offer compensation in lieu, instead of making good the damage.  That was written into the legislation before but now it has been changed.  While the Minister has dealt with our issue, something which had previously been written into the legislation has now been taken out.  Perhaps it does not matter.  Perhaps it is implicit that the building owner could offer compensation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for her comments about my accepting her argument.  The purpose of this amendment  is to be as simple as possible so that everyone has a fair crack of the whip.  Building owners have obligations to comply with the statutory provisions and where they cannot do this without interfering with what is termed the party structure, they must then make good the damage, pay costs and reasonable compensation.  If they fail to do so then this is catered for in the legislation.  There is provision whereby the occupier or affected person can proceed with the works and, in effect, go after the builder for the costs. </P>
        <P>This tends to be a source of much complaint among neighbours.  It is an area of the law that is somewhat unclear, so we are trying to introduce some clarity, while not making it too complicated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that the issue I was raising to the effect that the adjoining owner should be able to look to the court for the building owner to undo the damage, has <Col N="716"/>been dealt with by the Minister.  I am happy enough with that, so I intend to withdraw amendment No. 18. </P>
        <P>Unless I am mistaken I do not believe the Minister has dealt with the issue raised by amendment No. 19 in his amendment, whereby the building owner may get access to the adjoining owner&rsquo;s land.  When we were discussing that at the D&aacute;il select committee, the Minister accepted I had a point, namely, that it was very important the building owner should be able to have access to the neighbour&rsquo;s lands.  I wonder why the Minister had not dealt with that issue in his amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is provision in the legislation for a building owner to get what is called a works order, under section 45, in order to enter land if this is not being allowed by the adjoining owner.  As regards this, we are creating a new jurisdiction.  Heretofore, a jurisdiction was not specified.  The jurisdiction is the District Court, and this makes it simpler for people to litigate, in effect, about contentious issues. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister is saying and I withdraw amendment No. 19.  On another point, there is still the issue of trying to get people to mediate such issues.  The best place to deal with these issues is not necessarily in the courts.  I hope that down the line, the Minister will look at the whole area of alternative dispute resolution for issues such as this. </P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment was also tabled on Committee Stage and, as I recall, I raised the issue in the Seanad.  We had a good discussion on this at the D&aacute;il select committee, about leylandii hedges, and what a big issue that is for people, because they are so fast-growing, especially if neighbours are not happy about it.  This is not dealt with by legislation, although it is an issue that often comes up regarding the issue of public works.  It is not solely concerned with leylandii hedges.  Other types of hedges, trees and so on are often the reasons why public representatives are contacted by residents who may be distressed because of neighbours&rsquo; vegetation growing into their property.  It is overgrown to such an extent that it affects the resident&rsquo;s enjoyment of his or her own property.  Very often the type of people who contact one about this issue are older people who feel they cannot take on their neighbours themselves.  As public representatives there is very little we can do on their behalf because it is a civil matter.</P>
     
         <P>There is legislation in the UK to deal with this issue, whereby an order can be issued asking somebody to cut their hedges and if it is not obeyed the people concerned can be fined up to &pound;1,000 and a further &pound;50 for every day they defy a court order.  This is covered in the recently published diaries of Mr. Chris Mullin, MP.  He was the Minister of State who introduced this <Col N="717"/>legislation in the UK.  In his diaries he talks about how he quickly grasped that, being the lowest form of life in such an enormous Department, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, he was unlikely to have much influence.  He therefore decided to concentrate on a couple of issues, and this is one of them.  He talked about how leylandii hedges had become the scourge of middle England and he set out to bring in this legislation.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue and it would be a positive thing to bring in this legislation because it would send the signal to people who allow their gardens to get out of hand to be more considerate of their neighbours.  That is what this legislation would be about.  If matters got really bad people would have recourse to the courts.  Mr. Mullin talked about how the fast-growing leylandii tree had become a &ldquo;weapon of war&rdquo; and neighbours who for years had lived peacefully alongside each other suddenly found themselves locked in mortal combat.</P>
        <P>The Minister felt strongly about this on Committee Stage and there is much he can do as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, much more than Mr. Mullin could achieve.  He might consider doing something about this issue and possibly supporting the Labour Party amendment or coming up with an alternative amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Tuffy on this amendment, which typifies the sort of problems we come across as public representatives.  It is somewhat similar to noise pollution where people are pestered by a bad neighbour.  Very often one finds this in a housing estate where somebody does not mind their garden but has these large trees that interfere and it causes untold hassle.  As Deputy Tuffy said, older people are often the butt end of all this.</P>
        <P>One of the great innovations in the Minister&rsquo;s Department over the past number of years was the establishment of the Small Claims Court.  The Small Claims Court could be used in such situations where somebody has easy access to a decision without having to go through enormous expense and hassle.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the remit of the Small Claims Court to deal with such small matters which cause much trouble and hassle to the lives of ordinary people.  Neighbours are falling out and residents&rsquo; associations are getting involved and these matters could be solved very quickly by the Small Claims Court.</P>
        <P>Even the registrar could be empowered to issue an instruction to somebody to take action; very often what is needed is for somebody to tell the person to do this within the next seven days, or else.  That is the simple solution to the problem.  In his reply could the Minister outline to me whether it is possible to use the Small Claims Court in such situations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage I had substantial sympathy with what Deputy Tuffy is trying to address.  I may have referred to the fact that when I was on the county council and we were reviewing the development plan I proposed that we would put in a condition that all future planning permissions would not allow trees to grow higher than 6 ft. because there was an exemption on the building of walls up to 6 ft. or whatever.  I am not sure what it is today.  I was unsuccessful because I was told we could not do that as it would interfere with people&rsquo;s rights on their properties.  However there is some justification for examining this.</P>
        <P>After Committee Stage we asked the Law Reform Commission drafting group, which is headed by Professor John Wylie, to examine this.  It took the view that unreasonable interference with enjoyment of a property right caused by high trees on properties is a matter in any particular case for tort law and, more generally, for planning and environmental law.  It stated it was unaware of any jurisdiction which regulated trees and hedges within the land law code, and that is what we are dealing with here.  It was saying this is not the appropriate legislation.</P>
        <P>The issue of removal of trees or hedges is a tort of nuisance so somebody can seek damages or an injunction in the courts.  I thank Deputy Barrett for his acknowledgement of the Small <Col N="718"/>Claims Court procedure but it is not the type of court that would be able to enforce the removal or cutting of hedges because it relates mainly to monetary issues.  We are examining the issue of extending the court but more in the sense of monetary claims than anything else.  After Committee Stage we contacted not only the drafting group of the Law Reform Commission but raised it with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, drawing attention to the fact that this discussion had taken place on Committee State and suggesting there might be a possibility of dealing with it in planning or local government legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Tuffy referred to the English experience.  I would hazard a guess that they did not deal with the issue of trees in land law but in some local government legislation.  While I have great sympathy with the effort on this, my advice, particularly from the Law Reform Commission and my officials, is that this land law code is not the legislation where we should try this.  I strongly suggest we raise it in the context of planning or local government legislation the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley will be bringing through.  I will continue to discuss the issue with him as a matter that has arisen in the context of the examination of the Land Law and Conveyancing Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>When this was brought forward in the UK it was added onto a Bill on anti-social behaviour.  It is unfair to expect people to wade through tort law to solve this problem and consider taking an injunction.  That is way above the capacities of most people; they just want to get on with living their lives.  The UK solution was very simple.  One can apply for an order, the judge can make a decision and if the people do not comply with the order a fine can be issued.  We are talking about the little people.  The people who experience neighbours who will not reason or mediate with them on this are likely to be quiet and vulnerable while the others are stubborn and inconsiderate.</P>
        <P>If it is an anti-social matter in respect of which people have recourse to court it would not be appropriate for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to deal with this, but it would be appropriate to the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is the little things like this that matter.</P>
        <P>We are here as the public representatives of the people.  There is all this talk about legislation as if it is some high-minded thing we do.  We are elected by the people and as public representatives are in touch with them.  They tell us their stories in order that we can go and do something about the matter by way of legislation.  Why does the Minister not introduce a Bill dealing solely with this issue, given that he feels strongly about it, as we all do?  It is a matter that is raised with most public representatives.  Rather than saying he will refer it to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or that we will discuss it, this issue can and should be solved.  It is the kind of measure that would restore the faith of the people who elect us and show them that legislation is about the little things that matter and is relevant to their daily lives and the problems they face.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be familiar with trees from previous expeditions he undertook in London and north County Dublin regarding his former colleague, the former Deputy, Ray Burke.  He should talk to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, about this issue.  It is a real issue in the context of a citizen not having an immediate right of redress in circumstances that can be regarded as causing a significant nuisance.  Seeking a right of redress in the courts is lengthy, off-putting and expensive and should be simplified.  We did it in the case of noise to good effect where a simple application to the District Court can give rise to an order being made to cut trees or hedges.</P><Col N="719"/>
        <P>There is another difficulty I ask the Minister to address in his departmental deliberations with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  In some new housing estates green areas are reserved in ownership that can best be regarded as doubtful.  Developers complete estates and plant trees in areas where ownership of the land is not easily identifiable.  Those trees grow and flourish and can overhang house owners&rsquo; land giving rise to restrictions of light as well as vision and can be most unsightly.  These are estates without a formal legal entity or management company.  Residents of the estate may not have the nuisance visited upon them and as such, have no interest in the matter, nor do they have ownership or legal title to the land in question.</P>
        <P>It is a consequence of planning law where oftentimes developers are mandated to engage in a process of planting trees without any follow up once the trees are planted.  Developers may have long since left the estate and the local authority has taken over responsibility for services, roads, footpaths, pipes and lighting, but not the open spaces.  It pleases the authority to have no responsibility because it will only claim it does not have the resources to engage in the appropriate maintenance or landscaping.  It is an issue to which there is no answer and I am pleased that Deputy Tuffy has returned to it again.  I know she has raised it before.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As public representatives and legislators, it is important to find an appropriate form of redress which, as Deputy Barrett said, is not expensive or lengthy.  It needs to be such to give people confidence in a system of governance that will allow them to seek redress for what can be a very frustrating problem.  To many it might seem a very straightforward and simple issue in the context of other matters to which we will advert.  However, it is one that can be frustrating for some individuals in that they do not have a straightforward remedy.  The option of issuing proceedings in the Circuit Court is not one that is taken lightly.  It is also not immediately advisable because of the length of time, expense and risk involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the interest the Minister has shown in the matter in his reply to Deputy Tuffy and others.  It is a very serious issue and needs to be addressed either through this Bill or other urgent legislation.  Last Friday a lorry driver drew my attention to the fact that he needed to go down a narrow country road to get to his house.  He regularly loses the side mirrors on his lorry on trees along one particular stretch of the road.  All other landowners along the road cut their hedges to allow considerable road clearance for lorries, etc.  However, one individual who does not live in the jurisdiction completely ignores any pressure exerted by the county council.  I was advised that if this took place across the Border, he would need to adhere to the law.  I was interested to hear what Deputy Tuffy said.  In such circumstances we need to have some legal redress.  The same thing happens on Carn Lane outside Clones, a walking area in which one of the landowners refuses to maintain his hedges.  I hope we can find a mechanism to address the matter through this or a dedicated Bill.  Bills are taken through the House on which the debate is guillotined sufficiently frequently that there is no reason it cannot be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crawford has more or less confirmed the view I have expressed that this is not the Bill in which we should be dealing with this issue which is really one for local government.  People on private property are entitled to cut overhanging trees.  That is not the issue in this instance which addresses the height of trees.  The issue to which Deputy Crawford refers appears, in the first instance, to be one for local authorities which have the responsibility to maintain the highways and byways to ensure they are clear.  Regardless of what legislation contains such a provision, in order to enforce a right an individual would need to take proceedings.  It is a matter of including it in the correct legislation.  I would hazard a guess that it is an environmental or planning issue.  I will undertake to raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in order to include it in some impending legislation.  However, <Col N="720"/>I suggest the Deputies raise it directly with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It is not one that would sit easily in a Bill dealing with land law and rights.  It is one regarding the regulation of planning and environmental aspects, not for civil law.  Deputy Tuffy mentioned that the British Government had tacked it on to legislation dealing with anti-social behaviour which is dealt with here in criminal law legislation.  Mentioning the height of trees in criminal law legislation would not sit easily either.  It is a matter that should be taken up with the Minister, Deputy Gormley, as I have done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Here, as in the United Kingdom, anything to do with anti-social behaviour is covered by civil law.  If someone did not comply with an order, it became a criminal offence, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform dealt with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We would have to define domestic disputes and literally everything, including the kitchen sink, as anti-social behaviour were we to include the height of trees.  I respectfully suggest it would be better to define anti-social behaviour in terms of criminal activity.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not necessarily suggesting it is anti-social behaviour although there is an element of that involved.  The amendment mentions the height of trees in terms of their interference with easement, the enjoyment of property and interference with light.  In that sense, it does fit into this legislation.  However, Deputy Ahern is Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and this relates to giving people a right to apply to court to solve a particular issue.  Issues such as mediation and so on come within the Minister&rsquo;s remit.  I would not like if this were thrown into a black hole or passed over to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is concentrating on issues such as climate change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett made an important point in regard to the small claims court.  Many of my constituents have raised with me issues of nuisance noise.  One can make an application in the District Court in respect of noise regulations.  People are reluctant to go to the District Court or even to a solicitor, who must draft the papers for the District Court, to deal with noise issues that arise with their neighbours.  </P>
        <P>As far as I am aware, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is reviewing the noise regulations.  Perhaps this issue should be included in that review.  It is an issue of concern throughout the country.  Perhaps we could provide that a District Court judge in the Small Claims Court setting could deal with these issues.  This might go a long way towards addressing the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is introducing legislation, which I support, on gangs and the nuisance they cause to ordinary members of society.  These are irresponsible people who annoy ordinary decent people who want to live their lives without any hassle.  There comes a point where a person must be told by another that he or she has, say, seven days to deal with an issue or will be fined.  I do not believe the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is in a position to deal with these types of issues.  </P>
        <P>Call it what one may, the Small Claims Court setting is an ideal venue for dealing with such matters.  Members may be aware of the television programme &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; which deals with <Col N="721"/>disputes in ten minutes.  The judge, having listened to the complaint, makes a judgment on the matter within ten minutes.  Many issues arising in society today require to be addressed in that manner.  I believe the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the ideal Department to deal with these matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is introducing legislation to deal with membership of a criminal gang.  It is all very well for people to speak about civil rights but what about the rights of ordinary decent people who want to walk the streets and live their lives peacefully?  There are times when simple matters require to be dealt with quickly.  I urge the Minister to consider this matter.  This provision can be extended not alone to include hedges but other matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Just because I am Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not mean everything that is enforceable in court must come from my Department.  Other Ministers bring forward legislation relevant to their Departments which people are obliged to go to court to enforce.  That is the nature of the democracy in which we live.  It is unfair to lump everything into the justice area and say that we must deal with it.  I accept all of these issues are irksome and are a nuisance.  However, that is what they are.  There is a law of tort on nuisance.  </P>
        <P>Deputy Byrne stated that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is reviewing the noise pollution legislation.  It will deal with issues of nuisance.  I respectfully suggest that it is not in the criminal law but in civil law relating to property rights that this issue should be dealt with in terms of proper planning and development.  A number of other issues arise such as whether one should be cutting down certain types of trees and so on.  The expertise in that respect is not in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

The text has been redrafted to make this clearer.  In addition, a subsection (4) has been added which confines the application of the section to house loan mortgages.

They state how such a form of mortgage can be used as security for other borrowings from the lender, including overdraft, and any other sums requested by the borrower such as credit card debts.

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 64, line 10, after &ldquo;taking&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not more than 7 days prior to such taking&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Amendments Nos. 25 and 30 address a concern raised on Committee Stage.  In cases of default, sections 96 and 99 require a lending institution to obtain a court order before taking possession of or selling the mortgaged property unless the borrower has already given consent to repossession.  A fear was expressed on Committee Stage that the consent provision might be circumvented by requiring the borrower to give such consent at the outset in the mortgage deed.  To prevent any such circumvention, I propose to include a provision requiring that any consent be given within a seven day period prior to the taking of possession or a seven day period prior to exercise of the power of sale, as the case may be.</P>

	<P>I have tabled an amendment that would have a similar effect.  I raised this issue some years ago in the Seanad and again on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I argued the point on Committee Stage and I am glad the Minister has accepted my point and has inserted an amendment to deal with the issue that I raise in amendment No. 26.  This shows how helpful it is to debate amendments.  We put down the amendment a number of times and the Minister has now taken it on board, demonstrating that the Opposition does make a difference to legislation, contrary to perception.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 64, to delete lines 44 and 45.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment will delete section 97(5).  In so far as this subsection suggests it may be possible to apply to a court for an order for sale of a house which is subject to a house loan mortgage other than by applying for an order under section 99, it is misleading.  An application for a court order to exercise the power of sale must be made under section 99 by the lending institution to exercise the power of sale in such cases.  To avoid any doubt on the point, I have decided to drop subsection (5) entirely.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is consequential on changes already made to section 95 on Committee Stage.  Section 95(3), as amended on Committee Stage, provides that the mandatory provisions in Chapter 3 of Part 9 relating to the powers and rights of lending institutions apply to a house loan mortgage but in other cases, i.e. commercial mortgages, the terms of the mortgage deed apply.</P>
        <P>The consequential amendment to section 98 means that where the lending institution has taken possession of a dwelling under sections 96 or 97, it must take steps within a reasonable time either to sell the property under section 99 or to let it under section 111.  It cannot hold on to the property indefinitely.  In cases other than house loan mortgages, the mortgagee may act in accordance with the terms of the deed of mortgage.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">On Committee Stage, Deputy Charles Flanagan queried the continued use of the term &ldquo;one of 2 or more mortgagors&rdquo; in sections 99 and 107.  In practice, these words mean that if a mortgage is in the name of more than one person, the lending institution is required to serve notice on only one of them if the repayments are in arrears and that it is contemplating exercise of powers of sale or the appointment of a receiver.  Having reflected on the point made by Deputy Flanagan proposing to drop these words, the result will be that the lending institution will be required to serve notice on all those mentioned in the mortgage when it is serving notice under sections 99 and 107.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 66, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(4) Subject to <i>subsection (5)</i>, an application under <i>section 96(2)</i> or <i>section 99(3)</i> may be made to the High Court.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(5) Where an application under <i>section 96(2)</i> or <i>section 99(3)</i> concerns property which is subject to a housing loan mortgage the Circuit Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the application and the application shall not be made to the High Court.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(6) The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to hear and determine applications under <i>sections 96(2)</i> and <i>99(3)</i> concerning property which is subject to a housing loan mortgage shall be exercised by the judge of the circuit where the property or any part of it is situated.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is a new subsection on court jurisdiction.  This was brought to my attention by a family member some time ago.  Since then, when I saw what was happening with house repossessions, I asked the Department examine this.</P>
        <P>Since the issue was raised a couple of months ago, it became clear that there are some lending agencies that are bypassing the Circuit Court.  Some constituents who got into trouble with lending institutions and found themselves in arrears were taken to the High Court, an alien environment for most ordinary people.  The newspapers have carried reports on substantial numbers of people being taken to the High Court for repossessions, particularly by sub-prime lenders.  There is an agreement among most of the major lending institutions on repossessions and that is why the majority of substantial home loan lenders do not have many repossessions despite the adverse publicity about banks.  The major banks and lenders do not go for repossessions unless they absolutely must.</P>
        <P>It has been the practice, however, for sub-prime lenders generally, even when people default on very small sums, to immediately run to the courts.  The question must be asked why and how these lenders were allowed to give such loans to people who could not secure them from the major institutions.  The borrowers are now being taken to the High Court.  Having spoken to some of my constituents, receiving a High Court order is so unusual that some people tended to ignore the issue and then found themselves subject to a repossession order.</P>
        <P>I asked my officials to examine this and we discussed it with the Attorney General.  We are now introducing this proposal which will insert new subsections into section 100 that will make it obligatory for lending institutions to commence repossession proceedings in the case of house loan mortgages in the Circuit Court rather than in the High Court.  Proceedings for repossession other than those for a house loan may continue to be taken in the High Court or the Circuit Court.  The allegation was made on the Order of Business this morning that we were guillotining this legislation, although we probably will not end up guillotining it because we will finish it <Col N="727"/>before the end of business tonight.  The reason I wanted this Bill is that if we can get it passed and implement it before the summer, all repossession orders on household loans that take place subsequent to its passing will have to be taken in the Circuit Court and not in the High Court.  That is only right and proper.</P>
        <P>When I raised this originally it was said to me that if the amount involved was within the Circuit Court jurisdiction but the order is taken in the High Court, the lending company and its solicitors can recoup only the costs of a Circuit Court order.  However, that is still not good enough because many of the repossession orders taken in the Circuit Court are taken, in effect, in the county registrar&rsquo;s court, and the county registrar has more discretion than, for example, the Master of the High Court.  The Master of the High Court has mentioned on a number of occasions that something should be done about this, but I was already doing something about it.  It is quite a number of months ago that I asked my officials to see if we could find a Bill in which we could include this and I am glad we have been able to do that here.  I realise I am pushing on an open door with colleagues around the House.</P>
        <P>This provision will make life somewhat easier for those people who are subject to repossessions in that they will be able to go to courts in their own localities where there will perhaps be more discretion with regard to such orders.  I do not mean this as a slur on the High Court, but whereas there is little or no discretion in the High Court with regard to such orders &mdash; once it is established that money is owing &mdash; there is a certain discretion within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, particularly in the context of such applications&rsquo; going before the county registrar&rsquo;s court, as it is known.</P>
        <P>I strongly recommend this amendment to the House and I hope it will make life a little easier for those who are subject to repossession orders and ensure there is more understanding.  It is wrong that some lending agencies &mdash; not the major ones &mdash; have taken people to the High Court even with relatively small amounts of money owing and a relatively short period into the mortgage.  It is unfair to drag people &mdash; particularly those who live outside Dublin &mdash; up to the High Court to enforce repossession orders when it could be done in the Circuit Court, within the person&rsquo;s own locality and where there is a little more discretion.  For the people involved it may be their first time in court and at least they would be in their own locality.  Because of the types of costs and the discretion available in the Circuit Court, it would make much more sense to use this court.  Once we pass this legislation all lenders will have to commence applications for repossession on house loans in the Circuit Court and not in the High Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome what the Minister is doing here, which is important and practical.  I am not sure, however, whether the Government appreciates the extent of the problem.  More than 700 new repossession cases were initiated in the High Court in the nine months to March of this year, compared to less than 350 during the same period last year, according to the Courts Service.  A breakdown of these figures shows that 207 repossession cases were taken in the High Court in the first three months of this year compared to a mere 95 in the first quarter of 2008.  There is a real problem here for Government.  A voluntary code of practice has been entered into by some of the financial institutions, which needs to be constantly monitored by Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned that applications are being brought to the High Court for repossessions in cases in which the sum in arrears is quite small.  I recently saw a case in which GE Money took an application for possession of a house in the High Court when the sum outstanding was a little over &euro;4,000.  This is a real problem being faced by people in financial difficulties.  As the Minister said, these people are at the mercy of a High Court judge and in some cases there is no appearance because they are feeling hopeless and desperate.  This is a difficulty.</P><Col N="728"/>
        <P>I agree fully with what the Minister said about the difficulty with people responding to notices from the courts.  They are served with notice to appear in the High Court in Dublin, usually in the following eight or ten days.  One of the reasons put forward for not taking such actions in the local Circuit Court was that people were reported to have said they did not want to attend a court where they would be readily identified, where there may have been neighbours sitting near them or watching them going in or out, and where the local papers might carry reports of the story, which would not necessarily happen in the High Court.  However, on balance, what the Minister said is correct.  It is important that we as legislators are prepared for what will be a very difficult year in terms of repossessions.</P>
        <P>I wonder about the mortgage code that has been drafted and agreed between the parties and which gives guidance to lenders, urging them to deal sympathetically with borrowers in times of difficulty and facilitate escape routes if they wish to short-circuit the code, as they will.  However, there is an issue with regard to responsibility of lenders or building societies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was informed of a particular case in my constituency recently.  I am sure every Member of the House can recount such details but it is important that we appreciate the extent of the crazy lending practices that went on.  A man came to my clinic with a notice for repossession of what was originally a council house belonging to his mother which had been left to him on her death.  Like many during the course of the boom years, this man was encouraged by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and others to get a top-up mortgage, although it was not in fact a top-up because he did not have one before.</P>
        <P>This man had no accounts and clearly did not have any capacity to repay the mortgage because he was not working.  He got a mortgage of &euro;120,000 from a building society but fell into arrears, and the building society took an action for repossession after a mere six months.  It transpired that the man had never had a PPS number.  How that could happen I do not know.  I inquired of the lender how a sum of &euro;120,000 could have been advanced to a person who did not have a PPS number, but the correspondence was passed from Billy to Jack.  They were not interested in the manner of negotiation of the loan but rather in how the money was to be repaid.  This man faced his ruin.  The money was spent.  His favourite football team was Liverpool and he did something he had never done before, visiting Anfield six or seven times in the course of a season, courtesy of the building society.  Now his home which was originally a local authority property and has been in the possession of his family for generations will be taken from him and sold on the open market at a price substantially less than the amount borrowed.  The building society does not care that this man will be on the street.  It is absolutely essential that proper codes are in place to ensure citizens are protected from such reckless lending on the part of building societies.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister intends to have the legislation in force by mid-July.  If so, I do not intend to delay the House beyond what it is necessary to say.  What the Minister proposes will reduce the element of cost.  It has been common practice for banks to take a case to the High Court, issue a summons, follow up with the paper work, get the order for possession and then tack thousands of euro in court costs onto the sum of mortgage arrears, thus ensuring in many cases that people who provided their family home as security would not be in a position to pay.  Several High Court judges have expressed their dismay in recent times at cases in which borrowers do not make an appearance.  By allowing such cases to be heard in the Circuit Court, there may be a higher rate of attendance whether by those against whom the order is made or by their representatives.</P>
        <P>The manner in which financial institutions have dealt with loan applications has given rise to a process that is now inevitable, with more than 700 new cases currently before the courts <Col N="729"/>and hundreds of High Court actions ready to be initiated.  The prospect that they will now be taken in the Circuit Court in the autumn session will probably not ease the pain to any great extent.  A warrant for repossession of a person&rsquo;s home is a most serious engagement.  It is important that the people against whom warrants are outstanding can be dealt with in a way that is absolutely sympathetic and that the repossession of a person&rsquo;s home shall in all cases be the absolute last resort.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points made by Deputy Flanagan.  I agree with the Minister that the proposed amendment has a good deal of merit.  However, it is also a recognition by the Government that there will be many more of these types of cases, with growing numbers of people facing repossession of their homes.  This is one of the most serious consequences of the rise in unemployment numbers, with an additional 11,000 people signing on in June.  It is bad enough to lose one&rsquo;s job, but it is absolutely devastating to lose one&rsquo;s home.  In recent years many substantial mortgages were taken out on the basis of two incomes.  I spoke to many couples in the course of the local elections campaign where one partner had recently become unemployed and the other may have been on a reduced income.  A person came to my clinic recently who was making mortgage repayments of some &euro;800 a month on a property purchased under the affordable housing scheme.  This person is now unemployed and although he is managing to cope for now, his long-term prospects are not hopeful.</P>
        <P>The Minister has observed that some people in difficulties deal with the situation by going into denial rather than facing up to what seems like a hopeless predicament.  It is important that the Government offers such people options.  For example, a scheme should be introduced whereby the Government or local authority can step in and take a share of a property that is about to be repossessed by a financial institution.  People who have a home loan that they can no longer afford to repay because they or their partner have become unemployed should be able to convert their ownership into some form of shared ownership.  This need not necessarily correspond to the existing shared ownership scheme, but it would be something along these lines.  In the United Kingdom, for instance, such a scheme has been introduced to allow people to convert their housing loan.  It is important that we introduce something similar and that it is well publicised.  People must have options in order that they do not simply give up when faced with pressure from lending institutions.</P>
        <P>What are the statistics for those who are simply letting their lender take back their property without the matter being brought to court?  Many of the home owners facing difficulties have been making their mortgage repayments for years.  It is because of the financial downturn that they are now in a situation where their homes may potentially be repossessed.  As they worked hard during the years to meet their repayments, they were encouraged and facilitated by Government policy.  For all that effort to be wiped out and their homes taken from them is unacceptable.  As I said, people must be given some hope.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal is worthwhile, but it must go further.  The Government must afford people options in order that they can be sure, in so far as possible, that their homes will not be repossessed and that they will be allowed to get through their current difficulties and work towards obtaining new employment in the future.  I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s views on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister is dealing with this issue.  It is one I have raised with him on several occasions.  I understand he was initially told it could not be done, an opinion also expressed to me by another Minister.  I thank the Minister for pursuing it with such vigour.  I was shocked on first discovering what was going on, when a person who came to my clinic told me that High Court proceedings had been initiated in respect of that person&rsquo;s smaller than average house as a consequence of mortgage arrears of some &euro;4,000.  It is outrageous that such persons should be dragged to the High Court.</P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>My views on the prospect of these cases being heard in the Circuit Court are shared by FLAC, with which I have discussed the proposals.  The issue has also been discussed by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  Compassion must be shown to people in difficulties.  In my experience, proceedings in the Circuit Court move at a much slower pace than those in the High Court.  The message must go out from the Oireachtas in enacting this legislation that it will help to ensure people have time to get their affairs in order.  The Circuit Court sits quite infrequently &mdash; perhaps more frequently in Dublin and Cork- but in my own and the Minister&rsquo;s constituency the registrar&rsquo;s court sits perhaps once a month.  We must emphasise that we are trying to slow the process down.  In addition, as the Minister said, registrars in the Circuit Court must show compassion to people who are in court on foot of a repossession order.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We can go further in seeking to assist persons in these difficulties.  Family homes should not be subject to repossession other than in absolutely extreme circumstances.  Increasing numbers are subject to such orders.  In my experience of these issues being dealt with in local courts, civil court proceedings are generally not covered by local media.  In the course of my previous job, I found that repossession cases in the registrar&rsquo;s court could be delayed almost indefinitely.  Such a delay may be exactly what people need as they seek new employment.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this proposal.  I urge him, as soon as this legislation is passed, to commence the section as soon as possible.  I am not sure whether existing applications must be taken in the High Court rather the Circuit Court.  If that is so, there may be a rush of applications in the coming days and weeks.  For this reason, it is very important the Minister commence the section as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate, although I deeply regret that a division will be forced by the Government&rsquo;s refusal to support the joint motion agreed between the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  The motion seeks to provide counselling for the victims, to establish a commission of investigation and to ensure proper procedures for the future.  I cannot fathom what part of the motion is so offensive to the Government that it cannot accept it.  We need to support the victims, we need to know what happened and we need to ensure it does not happen again.  Even at this late stage in the debate, I urge the Government to withdraw its amendment.</P>
        <P>There is a terrible familiarity about the experience of victims at the hands of a medical doctor.  The people at the heart of this debate have had their lives blighted by a man who used his power, medical training and position of trust for his sexual gratification.  On the one side, young innocent men and boys were abused and damaged for life.  They have known what it is like to be isolated, stigmatised and not believed.  On the other side, a senior hospital consultant was protected by the hospital, the law and his professional colleagues.  In such a dysfunctional hospital, he was free to roam at will and prey on vulnerable patients.  By using delaying tactics, he was then able to retire and to this day continues to enjoy a good pension.</P>
        <P>This case has resonance of the Michael Neary saga.  In that case, a doctor in the same hospital was able to mutilate women at will by carrying out unnecessary hysterectomies.  The victims in the Neary case were also isolated, stigmatised and at times not believed.  I recall that when I raised the case in the House I received abusive telephone calls from supporters of Mr. Neary.  The victims persevered, however, and when the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, decided to establish an inquiry into the case, I applauded her.  The Minister did the right thing.  It is disappointing, therefore, that she has not come in to the House and made a clear unequivocal commitment to an independent inquiry in the case of Mr. Shine.  It is inconceivable that she would deny the victims and irresponsible for her to deny future patients the new dispensation that would arise from such an inquiry.</P><Col N="733"/>
        <P>Dignity 4 Patients has pointed out that not only does hospital practice need to be scrutinised, so too does the practice of the courts, criminal justice system and State agencies.  For example, questions arise about the 2003 trial in which Mr. Shine was found not guilty.  Why was the trial held in Dundalk?  Why did the State&rsquo;s lawyers not object to three jurors who were, respectively, a former patient of Mr. Shine&rsquo;s, the daughter of another patient and an employee of the North Eastern Health Board?  Why was Mr. Shine allowed offer medical advice to a member of the jury when she fell ill?  Why were expert witnesses not called to give evidence on behalf of the victims while 15 professional colleagues testified on Mr. Shine&rsquo;s behalf?  Why have some of the charges relating to other complainants never been activated?  How could the Medical Council find against Mr. Shine in two specific cases when the State failed to bring them to trial?  Other questions remain unanswered.</P>
        <P>While everyone understands the independence of the courts &mdash; that is not at issue &mdash; an inquiry needs to be empowered as a wide-ranging review to ascertain the full truth.  This House has correctly spent time debating the victims of institutional abuse.  There is a real desire from all sides to respond appropriately to the evil uncovered and suffering caused, even though we know in our hearts we cannot make up for what was done.  In this instance, however, the abuse was also real and persistent and protected by those in authority.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated yesterday that she was impressed by the deputation from Dignity 4 Patients and I believe her.   A weak, inadequate, ineffectual response from her would be worse than no response.  The victims have set out clearly what they want, namely, a commitment from the Minister to hold an independent inquiry.  It has taken 15 years for them to be vindicated.  Surely they should not be expected to wait any longer for justice.</P>
        <P>Even in the most dysfunctional system, there are individuals who stand apart because they refuse to collude in wrongdoing.  The heroism of Bernadette Sullivan must be acknowledged and given respect.  Nurses, in their work, do not tend to question doctors.  They work in a hierarchical structure.  To stand up in defence of one&rsquo;s patients and against a hospital establishment is a tough call.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In her report on the Neary case, Judge Harding Clarke describes the culture in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital as one &ldquo;of fatalistic acceptance&rdquo;.  Bernadette Sullivan was a remarkable whistleblower.  What protections and safeguards are in place for those who find themselves in similar or different circumstances who want to do the right thing and live by their integrity?  Bernadette Sullivan was told if she persisted she could lose her house and reputation, yet persist she did.  She stayed true to the ethic of patient care and is a role model for the nursing profession.  It is important to note this in this debate.</P>
        <P>Those who were abused by Michael Shine came to a hospital, not far from here, seeking care and healing.  Instead they suffered because of a pederast doctor and a systemic failure to keep them safe.  There is an imperative now for the right political response to be made.  The Opposition parties have played their part in raising this matter for debate.  It is now up to the Minister who will be negligent unless she makes the right decision without delay.</P>
        <P>In paying tribute to Bernadette Sullivan and to those who have been badly affected in the Michael Shine case, it is important we do not leave only words.  A much more appropriate tribute could be made if all parties were to agree to recognise that action must be taken to discover and explore the record and to ascertain how people viewed what took place and what people did in terms of concluding a process that has taken so long.  This is the appropriate response for the Minister.  None of us underestimates the cost issues which arise in this regard, particularly as there is so little money available to spend in the health service.  While costs present difficulties, they must not serve as an obstacle to doing the right thing.</P><Col N="734"/>
        <P>Previous commissions of inquiry established by the House have been successful and delivered much that is good.  In particular, I cite the commission established to inquire into the Neary case, from which we learned a great deal.  In terms of public policy, I hope we never unlearn what was stated in the commission of inquiry&rsquo;s report, specifically its recommendations which remain unfinished business.  They have at least provided us with an important road map and the progress made in this regard needs to be recognised.  A similar approach must be taken in the case of Mr. Shine.</P>
        <P>The Minister frequently refers to standards in the health service.  She must judge herself by the same standards.  It would be beneath her role as a Cabinet Minister to ignore the requests and imperative to establish a commission of inquiry to deal with this issue in a fair manner and protect patients who come after those who suffered so terribly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Wallace, Flynn, Kirk, Dooley and Conlon.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, five minutes does not give one much time to speak on this issue.  As a Government Minister and Deputy representing the constituency in which Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, is located, I am very concerned about the allegations in this case.  In December 2008, I spent considerable time discussing the issues arising from the case with some of those involved.  Like the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who met them for the first time last week, I was struck by their intensity and the unease with which they spoke about what went on in the hospital.  Wearing my hat as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and given that so many people were coming forward, I advised them that the Garda investigation should be allowed to continue.  To the best of my memory, nine fresh complaints had been made at the time.  I urged them to ensure anyone who came forward made a complaint and provided a written statement for the Garda.</P>
        <P>I subsequently consulted the Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General and the Minister, Deputy Harney, on what was necessary in the context of a criminal investigation.  I am happy to say the Garda Commissioner and his force have been assiduous in liaising with the people involved.  He informed me today that 64 new complaints have been made, most of which were subsequent to the decision by the Medical Council to strike this doctor off the register.  Further complaints were made in the aftermath of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  I understand a number of medical records have been obtained from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The Garda has been in contact with the Medical Council regarding an expert who could help the investigating team&rsquo;s examination of these reports.  Interpol has also been contacted regarding some of the issues raised in the programme.  A full investigation is ongoing.  Garda&iacute; from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit are heavily involved in the case and hope to bring a comprehensive file to the Director of Public Prosecutions as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the request from Opposition Deputies for an independent inquiry.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and his colleagues from surrounding constituencies approached me several months ago in this regard and I repeated to them what I had said at my meeting with those concerned in December 2006.  They accepted that the primary focus should be the criminal investigation in order that nobody will avoid criminal sanction for the new allegations which have been made.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd stated recently on a radio programme this is not a political issue.  The Government has not ruled out an inquiry but we need to take it one step at a time because we do not wish to prejudice a criminal trial.  We are in effect dealing with somebody who in 2003 was acquitted by a jury in a court of law, and we must be careful in deciding whether we can pursue a public inquiry in advance of or alongside a criminal trial.  We know to our detriment <Col N="735"/>that when criminal investigations are ongoing, the redaction of names can be such as to produce an unsatisfactory response to inquiries.</P>
        <P>An examination was originally conducted in 1995.  Like the Minister, Deputy Harney, I am not casting aspersions on that examination but it is clear that some people were gravely dissatisfied with its focus.  Ultimately the Government and the Oireachtas will have to decide on whether to hold a public inquiry.  I ask that we be allowed time for a discussion in that regard.  I do not wish to divide the House when I ask that the matter be addressed step by step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for meeting representatives of Dignity 4 Patients to discuss their request for an inquiry.  Having attended that meeting, I can attest to her genuine concern for the victims and their devastating stories of betrayal and abuse.  It is all the more shocking that the abuse took place in the setting of an acute hospital.  During the meeting, the Minister indicated that she would need time to discuss the issues with the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner but committed to a further meeting with the group in three to four weeks&rsquo; time.  In such circumstances, it is difficult to be sure of the value of this debate other than in terms of the opportunity it provides us to show solidarity with the victims and the Minister in her anxiety to make the correct response.</P>
        <P>While progress has been made on developing a complaints procedure, we must never lose sight of our ultimate duty of protecting patients from abuse.  We need to further examine a culture and system which allowed Michael Shine to abuse patients for 25 years despite the many complaints that had been made since 1970.  The victims have many questions but three in particular stand out.  First, how could so many people, including in particular teenage boys, be sexually abused in an acute hospital setting?  Second, how could 70% of this abuse occur in broad daylight and in an outpatients department?  Third, who knew what was going on and why was nothing done to protect these young people?  These questions need to be addressed within the hospital system.</P>
        <P>I understand that more victims have come forward since the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme was broadcast.  Dignity 4 Patients has given these people the courage to speak up.  For more than 30 years, Dr. Michael Shine abused the patients in his care.  His victims were betrayed by him and by a society and culture which revered doctors and allowed people to turn a blind eye.  Our priority is to assist the victims because they cannot be let down again.  I understand a Garda investigation into these complaints is ongoing.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, is committed to ensuring transparency and accountability in our hospitals.  The correct solution for the victims is her main concern.</P>
        <P>We all wish to see an inquiry into what happened at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital but we must be mindful of the concerns expressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about prejudicing a possible future trial.  However, while the criminal investigation should be our primary focus, serious questions nonetheless arise.</P>
        <P>The victims&rsquo; stories have truly shocked and appalled us but their strength and dignity in speaking publicly is remarkable and their determination to keep this issue in the public domain is admirable.  They rightly want to expose the regime which allowed Michael Shine to abuse his position in a horrific way.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s second meeting with Dignity 4 Parents and I am confident that every effort is being made to address victims&rsquo; concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Deputy Beverley Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I do not regard this as a political issue and would hate to see the House divide on the motion.  We are all horrified at the activities that took place at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Harney, has met the members of Dignity 4 Patients and listened to their horrific stories. <Col N="736"/> I commend the victims on their bravery in relating those stories because it takes a lot of courage for a person to come forward and do so.  I am delighted the Minister met them, received their submission, listened to their request for an inquiry and has agreed to give that request the detailed consideration it deserves.  I also welcome the fact that she has committed herself to getting back to the group within a matter of weeks.</P>
        <P>This is the second time the House has had to debate the appalling misconduct of a consultant at this hospital in Drogheda.  It is clear that the appalling misconduct was well known.  It is terrible that money had to be set aside from the sale of the hospital because they knew that claims were inevitable concerning this consultant.  Some of my colleagues from the constituency, who are more familiar with the situation, made the point that the first complaint was made in 1970.  That the consultant was allowed to practice at the hospital for so many years afterwards, while abusing so many people, is a horror story that shames everybody.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, the House has debated the Ryan report.  It was shameful that this type of activity was carried out in this country for so many decades and was known to so many people, yet nothing was done about it.  In her 2006 report, Judge Maureen Harding Clark spoke out about the pervasive culture concerning consultants in that hospital.  It was a culture of acceptance and compliance with the activities of these consultants who went around the hospital with a God-like complex and nobody could question them.  Patients and hospital staff lived in fear of them and were not in a position to do anything about it.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that in recent years we have seen Part 9A of the Health Act 2007 come into effect, which allows whistleblowers to come forward.  It is a protection for patients and staff who can now make the type of complaints we saw brave people in Drogheda making against Dr. Michael Neary.  On that occasion, a midwife from another jurisdiction was the first brave whistleblower to come forward.  The new legislation gives protection to employees to blow the whistle, and we can only hope there will be no recurrence of this type of activity.</P>
        <P>Changes have taken place at the Medical Council which now has a lay majority and, in addition, its fitness to practise committee must also hold hearings in public, which is a welcome development.  When Dr. Shine was investigated all the hearings were held in private, which gives no comfort to victims of the terrible conduct in which he engaged.</P>
        <P>In yesterday&rsquo;s debate the Minister said she had spoken to the Garda Commissioner and that new complaints are being investigated.  I welcome that development.  As a public representative my concern, and that of all other Members of this House, is for the victims who are the injured parties.  All appropriate support services must be provided for the victims in this case.  Serious consideration must be given to their request for an inquiry.  Having heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform earlier, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s openness in listening to that request, which I know will be given full consideration.</P>
        <P>Victims should be informed of the support services available to them.  Many of them have been already in contact and are availing of those support services.  I commend them on their bravery and I hope we will see justice for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, said last night, the assault on patients which is at the heart of the Medical Council&rsquo;s decision to strike Mr. Shine off the medical register was truly a betrayal of his patients&rsquo; trust.  It attacked the special, privileged relationship between doctor and patient which should never be compromised, as patients allow themselves and their vulnerabilities to be placed in the confidence of doctors.  We all expect such trust when we visit a doctor.  It betrayed the culture of assumed and expected responsibility which is needed in certain professions.</P><Col N="737"/>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister met with the support group, which gave her a comprehensive document and requested an independent inquiry.  The Minister indicated that she will be discussing the issues raised with her Government colleagues and will revert to the group in July.  I commend her on the compassionate and humane manner with which she dealt with the people concerned and listened to their tragic stories.</P>
        <P>We live in a culture and environment which is totally different from that in 1995-96 when these issues first came to public notice.  The deference to religious orders in that era was nationwide &mdash; not only in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  This was a hospital run by a religious order and deference was shown to consultants who could do nothing wrong.  Nobody was prepared to criticise them.  Mr. Shine betrayed his patients and broke that vital link of trust which is absolutely necessary in our hospitals.  I encourage the Minister to contact the group as soon as possible after she discusses the issues involved with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Attorney General.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The length of time that Mr. Shine ruled is horrendous.  He ruined people&rsquo;s childhoods and they, not to mention their families, are still suffering the effects today.  The ramifications of that are still being felt.  Protect, deny and circle the wagons seemed to be the policy that ruled the roost in hospitals all around the country.  However, as Deputy Johnny Brady said last night, this culture pervaded all sections of society from parishes to churches to hospitals and everything in between.  It was wrong.</P>
        <P>The health service is now committed to promoting a culture of openness and accountability in order that employees can report any concerns they may have about their workplaces.  That is to be welcomed.  Part 14 of the Health Act 2007, which amends the Health Act 2004 by inserting a section which allows for the making of protected disclosures by health service employees, commenced with effect from March this year.  The purpose of this new section is to facilitate employees to disclose matters of concern to them to an authorised person and to provide statutory protection against penalisation in their employment and against civil liability.  This procedure applies to all employees of the HSE and agencies funded by the HSE, as well as bodies established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961, such as the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and the Women&rsquo;s Health Council.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is not politically divided on this issue.  The Minister&rsquo;s interest in this matter is genuine and I look forward to her reporting back to the group as quickly as possible.  I acknowledge the challenge that Dignity 4 Patients had in highlighting this important issue.  I can only imagine how difficult it is for abuse victims to tell their stories to anyone privately.  It must be tougher to have to do so publicly, and worse again to try to put them on paper in chronological order.  I truly admire and salute the victims in this case for doing what they have done.  It is obvious that many of them are continuing to suffer, and the Government must respond with due care and diligence.</P>
        <P>We are discussing this matter very soon after the Ryan report, the effects of which are still very raw.  These two debates underline the fact that it is not that long ago when certain things were hushed up and swept under the carpet.  We will have the Archdiocese of Dublin&rsquo;s report soon, which will focus again on another period when these activities were allowed to take place.  We continually say &ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t get any worse&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard it all&rdquo;, but then something new and more gruesome is revealed.  Let us hope that era is well and truly over.</P>
        <P>The victims need and deserve answers to their unanswered questions.  I am satisfied the Minister has listened attentively to their stories with compassion.  She will give their request the detailed consideration it merits.  I understand the Minister will revert to the victims&rsquo; group as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="738"/>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Like others in the House, I have been approached by a number of victims who have sought our intervention to ensure they receive the justice they deserve.  They also wish to ensure the practices of Mr. Shine are brought to the fore publicly in a way which seeks to address their concerns.  They also want to ensure justice is done and that somebody like Mr. Shine is dealt with appropriately.</P>
        <P>As the facts emerge in this case, just like they emerged in the Ryan report or in other cases, we are provided with a frightening insight into what happened in a period of time in Irish society which I hope has passed and we will never revisit.  It was a time when people who were privileged by virtue of their education or ability to attain a certain status in society sought to abuse their position.  They were in an untouchable position.  Clearly, nobody can be above the law, nobody can manipulate it and nobody can find a way of weaseling out of responsibility for their actions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was very disturbed by the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates progamme,&rdquo; some of which I had the benefit of watching.  Watching an individual explain in a perverse way his actions or reject facts that had been established must have been a source of much pain and suffering for those victims who have been mentioned this evening.  Seeing somebody like that walk freely on the streets and allegedly continuing to participate through visits to orphanages outside the State must have been so hurtful to the victims.  The person concerned was still at liberty and able to continue to abuse and break the trust between a patient and his or her doctor.  It must be a great source of pain, annoyance and anger for the victims.  The people with whom I spoke shared their feelings on the matter.  It is particularly disappointing that we have seen so many affected in such a negative way.</P>
        <P>I can understand why some see a need for an inquiry.  However, we must be careful in that regard.  I have no doubt that due consideration will be given by the Government to it.  We have to know the ultimate outcome of that inquiry.  The difficulty we have had in the House is we have not found an effective mechanism to ensure the victims can seek the appropriate redress, the inquiry would not become an elongated, protracted legal battle in which the perpetrators of a crime such as this would ultimately find a capacity to avoid facing justice.  I hope that whatever deliberations the Government has on the matter, it wants to find an outcome to ensure some level of redress or acceptance of wrongdoing and ensure the victims will be at the centre.</P>
        <P>What happened must be most damaging to the lives of young men or women who were abused at an early age.  They carry that burden throughout life.  We have seen the victims mentioned in the Ryan report vent their frustration and anger in recent weeks.  When one listens or talks to victims later in life, one can see their pain and suffering.  Until such time as we get it all out in the open, it will not bring the comfort they need.  It is not enough to say our society has changed and that this practice no longer happens.  We have to show the victims and their families that we are prepared to prosecute the perpetrators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to contact the Garda Commissioner on the issue.  It is a critical part of the healing process for the victims that the perpetrators are brought to justice.  There is a difficulty, however, because of the passage of time and the need for corroboration of evidence and so on.  However, when evidence starts to stack up &mdash; we see from the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme that Mr. Shine appears to be divesting himself of his assets on the basis that he might be called to account at some stage &mdash; that in itself is almost an admission of guilt.  The Minister has brought forward what might be considered to be draconian legislation in any other time, namely, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  We need to look at legislation under which the burden of proof that might be necessary in other situations can be set aside in some way, based on the actions of the perpetrators in their efforts <Col N="739"/>to create what could only be a false defence.  Anything the Government could do in that regard would be most welcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies McEntee, English and Crawford.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the heart of this case is the fact that evidence was put before the Medical Council that is required to be of the same standard as that needed in a criminal court for a conviction and that Mr. Shine was struck off and found guilty of professional misconduct.  The same evidence was presented in the courts, but the prosecution was not successful.  The reason we need this inquiry is to find out why that happened and how we can make sure it never happens again.  The criminal justice system failed to secure a conviction on evidence that was presented to the Medical Council where he was found guilty of professional misconduct.  That is why we need an inquiry &mdash; to find out where the mistakes were made and where we have to learn.  That is why this inquiry supersedes everything else.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to pursue the matter with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Interpol.  All of these investigations can proceed in parallel with this inquiry which can continue in private.  There is no conflict between the two because that is what happened with the Ryan inquiry and what should happen now.</P>
        <P>The victims of Mr. Shine and their families are at the heart of this issue.  We have met them and are saddened and deeply shocked by what happened to them.  What went on in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is unbelievable.  It is a hospital in my town in which 1,500 people work.  I know hundreds of people there.  I know the nurses and the nuns and of their commitment, honour, dignity and absolute resolution to make sure they provide a proper service.  There was a rotten core at its heart that must be and has been exposed.  The reasons it happened must be exposed to ensure it never happens again.</P>
        <P>If there is no inquiry, only one group will suffer &mdash; the victims.  Until and unless they have an inquiry, they will not have closure with regard to the pain and hurt they and their families have suffered for some decades.  Primacy must be given to their needs and wants which must be satisfied by the State and everybody else.  Every single effort must be made to have an inquiry.  I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but we are presenting the Minister for Health and Children with new arguments which should help to tip the balance in favour of holding an inquiry and in favour of those who have been disadvantaged most by Mr. Shine.</P>
        <P>People ask how could this have happened in a hospital.  I live in Drogheda and have visited the hospital many times.  The truth is that Mr. Shine was always deemed to be an excellent surgeon.  Late at night one would see him going around the wards.  Everybody considered he was a tremendous, dedicated man, but none of us knew what was lay at the heart of his activities and about the evil that was driving him in his work.  That is an absolute shame.</P>
        <P>I have hard things to say about the Medical Missionaries of Mary and its administration.  However, I accept the integrity of the Medical Missionaries of Mary and the work it has done, <Col N="740"/>as well as the people I have known who have worked at home and abroad for the order.  The nuns were not locked up in a convent every night; they worked in the hospital and on the missions.  The order must tell the truth, as it knew it.  If it knew it in the 1970s, let us have all the facts.  At the end of the day, it will benefit the order and do justice to the memory of Mother Marie Martin and all those who established the order, as well as all the doctors, nurses and staff who worked in the hospital.</P>
        <P>The inquiry must ask how much information the Medical Missionaries of Mary and its administrative staff had on Mr. Shine.  Will they make all the information available immediately?  What reports, if any, did the order have on Mr. Shine?  What reports did it make available to the North Eastern Health Board child care division?  When did it make them available as it was obliged under the Child Care Act to do?  What advice did it give in overseas locations in which Mr. Shine had worked as a missionary?  How did it discharge its duties there?  When did it inform the Garda of the allegations?  When did the Garda receive its first report on Mr. Shine?  When did it inform the North Eastern Health Board about the matter?  In 1995, 60 to 80 cases were forwarded by the health board to the Garda and the Medical Council.  Between 1995 and 1997, before the hospital came into the ownership of the health board, what action did management at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital take on child protection issues in regard to Mr. Shine?</P>
        <P>Is the Garda fully satisfied that its investigation accorded with best practice?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred to the Garda Commissioner and whether the Garda would need specialist knowledge and skills in following up the allegations.  That may have been what was missing in the original Garda inquiry which did not have the benefit of an outside person investigating the matter.  I refer to specialist investigators; people with access to forensic psychiatry services and psychologists.  That did not happen in this case and is why the inquiry must ensure that in the future this must never happen again.</P>
        <P>This is a very complex case.  The Director of Public Prosecutions was unable to obtain a conviction with the same evidence on which the Medical Council convicted Mr. Shine.  That is at the core of the matter.  Is the Director of Public Prosecutions satisfied that he should have relied so much on local evidence?  Should he not have made sure there was an outside inquiry?  Was too much emphasis placed on local and national medical experts who gave evidence about Mr. Shine but who may have known him?  Would it not have been better to seek external professional advice in the case, as happened in the Neary case?  That was the difference between the two.  The evidence of Irish consultants who spoke for Mr. Neary was completely overturned by the strong independent, authoritative evidence from another jurisdiction.  That is what was needed in this case, but it did not happen.</P>
        <P>The Medical Council found Mr. Shine guilty of professional misconduct.  However, what was the point of the professional evidence given about Mr. Shine at the trial?  There are serious questions in that regard.  There are also serious questions at which the Royal College of Surgeons must look in regard to the clinical standards and protocols which were not met but on which it had insisted.  Does the Medical Council stand over the evidence given on behalf of Mr. Shine by medical people in the court?  That is a core question because, clearly, there was a big difference between what they said he was doing and what he did.  Medical people have serious questions to answer, as has An Bord Altranais.  An inquiry must also look at these issues because this must never happen again.  This evil must be rooted out forever.</P>
        <P>We reject the claims made by the Government Deputy that an inquiry would interfere with the criminal process.  The idea behind having commissions of investigation is that they take place in private, evidence is given in private and the legal rights of defendants or those who <Col N="741"/>appear before them are absolutely respected.  They can appeal to the courts when a decision is made, if they so wish.  There is no diminution of their legal rights.</P>
        <P>At the heart of this case is an evil perpetrated in our society which must never be allowed to happen again.  The absence of an inquiry will hurt those who were victimised most.  There is one person, Bernadette Sullivan, who shines like a beacon of light in all of this.  She was a whistle-blower who worked with might and main for many years to highlight the truth and seek justice.  Another person I wish to mention is Dr. Ambrose McLaughlin who at the time was chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board.  As a member of the health board, I was involved in dealing with many issues relating to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Dr. McLaughlin&rsquo;s integrity, professionalism, commitment and dedication have been acknowledged independently, as in the Mr. Neary case.  In this case an examination of the files will exonerate and show that public servants such as Dr. McLaughlin need to be very much involved in the administration of health services because his absence is a massive loss to us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak.  Some of my speech will be directed at the Minister for Health and Children, but I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present because he is a man for whom I have much time.  I thank him for arranging the meeting at which he outlined to us how he felt this should run.  I very much respected and listened to everything he had to say.  He did what he said he would do and his earlier report gives everybody hope things will follow on in this way.  However, it is crucial that we continue with this debate and that an inquiry is held.  That is what the people want.  The decision to table the motion and put it to a vote was not taken lightly.  Nobody would do anything to jeopardise the case and I would not like to say anything that would do so.</P>
        <P>It is very important the issues involved are addressed at this level.  People in the north east have lived with the case for 30 years.  The difference now is that they are better educated and they will not take no for an answer.  Therefore, the mindset is very different from what it was.  The one great thing which has happened in the past 15 years, through the education system and modern technology, is that people no longer feel they cannot speak out against figures in authority.  A number of months ago all Deputies were asked to attend meetings on this issue and much has happened since.  The fact that we are debating it is evidence of this.</P>
        <P>Some people must be complimented on the way they have highlighted the plight of those affected.  I refer to Bernadette Sullivan and her great team who have carried the burden for a long time.  She acted not only as a responsible nurse but also as a concerned person for the victims who had found it hard to come forward.  I refer also to the excellent and responsible journalism which led to the the case being highlighted continuously, in particular by Michael Reid and the LM FM team and all our local newspapers, without mentioning any in particular.  I congratulate sincerely Deputy James Reilly, my party&rsquo;s health spokesperson, for the genuine offer of an apology on behalf of his profession on the day Dignity 4 Patients held its press conference.  People with issues can achieve what they have set out to achieve by political lobbying.  Dignity 4 Patients has worked tirelessly in the political process to bring the issue to attention.  It has acted alone without resources or backing.  The fact that we are debating the issue and calling for an inquiry and that the Minister for Health and Children met the group last week shows how far we have come.  However, it has taken too long to reach this point.  To be fair to the Minster, one could see in her speech last night how genuine she was in trying to meet the needs of the people affected.  However, everybody knows that when the House goes into recess, things will not happen.  It would be unforgivable of the Minister to allow the people concerned to wait another day, month, six weeks or three months for further action to be taken.</P><Col N="742"/>
        <P>One thing I find frustrating as a Deputy is that Ministers and persons in responsible positions cannot make a decision on their own initiative.  The facts are clear.  The Medical Council has acted and almost 200 people have come forward.  Living in the area, as I do, I know there is a similar number who have not come forward.  One more day is too long for the people concerned to wait.  Those who head the campaign on behalf of so many want unanswered questions dealt with and to be assured that this will not happen again.  I respect the views expressed by the Minister for Health and Children last night and her sincerity.  While she did not forget to mention that the same proposal had been made to a Minister from my party in 1995, owing to the fact that Mr. Shine was struck off the register by the Medical Council in recent years and that almost 200 people have come forward with complaints, a person in her position should be strong enough to order an inquiry into how this had continued for so long.   The people concerned have waited long enough.  I call on the Minister and members of all parties to support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said this matter was not political.  I take issue with this.  It may not be divisive, but it is political because it is down to politicians to put this right.  Other systems and procedures in the former health boards, hospitals and the justice system have failed the victims in this case.  It is down to politicians to put this right or at least try to ease the pain of the victims.  All Members present have met the young men who were badly affected.  One can see in their eyes the hurt they have endured and their families and friends have had to live with.  It is up to all of us to use the political system to get results.</P>
        <P>A debate calling for a proper inquiry has been a long time coming.  I accept the Minister on first meeting the victims could not have immediately agreed to an inquiry.  However, she could have given a guarantee that she would ensure, no matter what it took, to get the answers, be it an inquiry as proposed in the motion or whichever way was best.  From day one, I have said whatever way is best must be used to get answers and justice.  Mr. Shine must feel what justice is all about.</P>
        <P>We believe it will require an inquiry because much happened in this case.  It was not just the abuse of young male patients but also the subsequent cover-up.  Even if a small percentage of what the patients claim about the cover-up case is true, there are some serious problems facing us.  The case was dragged out with barrier after barrier and delay after delay to prevent justice being done.  That is what is also wrong, just as much as what went on in the hospital under Dr. Shine, a title I will no longer use for him.  It was an abuse of power and we must ensure it does not continue.</P>
        <P>The victims are not asking for much as an inquiry would not cost a fortune.  If it is a funding issue, we know there is money left in the kitty by the hospital&rsquo;s previous owners.  It must be put to good use to get results.  The victims need answers and all sections involved in the case must be investigated.  There was a problem in this country of protecting people in powerful positions and who were well educated.  I hope those days are gone.  It can be proved by going after all those involved in the cover-up of this case.</P>
        <P>Being a small country, we must go the extra length to protect whistleblowers.  The health service is dysfunctional; it is a system in which people are afraid to speak up about wrongdoing.  I know this from when I worked in the health service from 1995 to 1997.  People were afraid then and still are to speak out; they were afraid the walls had ears.  I spoke to Professor Drumm about HSE staff being afraid to share their opinions and point out wrongs.  We must do away with this veil of secrecy and fear to speak out in all Departments, especially in the health sector.  We need people like Bernadette Sullivan to know they can come forward to point out wrongs <Col N="743"/>and even give an opinion without their careers suffering as happened in the past.  The latter is not encouraged in our system and we suffer as a result.</P>
        <P>What occurred in the hospital in question was an abuse of power and could have happened to any one of us.  For too long consultants have been given too much power.  They must realise, like all those who provide a service, that they are only a cog in the wheel and need a team.  While many of them may have come to realise this, those who have not must recognise nurses and other staff are just as important as they are.  We must stop bowing to people because of their position.  I accept we should respect it, but we should not shy away from them, letting them away with wrongdoing.  I hope what went on with Mr. Shine and the way he treated and abused people does not happen any more in our hospitals.  Procedures may be in place, but we must ensure they work.  Just because a person is educated and in a top position we should not shy away from him or her.  They are only part of the system.  Without the nurses and other hospital staff, the consultant cannot do his or her job either.</P>
        <P>The delay in having this case dealt with is another issue.  The Minister must agree to an immediate inquiry.  We hear all these compliments, thanking the Minister for meeting the victims.  That is what is wrong with this country.  She should have picked up the telephone to arrange to meet them rather than being asked by numerous Members on all sides of the House to do so.  This matter has been ongoing for years but last November it became clear that it could be tackled, yet today, 1 July, the Minister is still scratching her head, going to talk her colleagues and think about it.  She has had long enough to think about it.  It is time to act, not to pretend it is great she is meeting the victims.  This country will only learn from its problems when Ministers take direct action to deal with them.  It should not be a case of being hounded into taking action.  They should lead the way in ensuring such cases are investigated and will not recur.  That is real justice and would go some way towards helping the unfortunate people concerned, the 150 about whom we know, and their families who suffered greatly because of this abuse.  We must go the extra length to ensure this case is explained as best it can with no stone unturned.  What went on and the delays in investigating these events were wrong.</P>
        <P>Apart from an inquiry, the victims&rsquo; group also needs financial assistance and secretarial backup.  So far, it has only had one woman and a small team putting in serious hours to get justice.  The least we can do is to release some funding to allow the group to do its job properly.</P>
        <P>Last night Ministers referred to counselling services being available to the victims.  They need specific counselling by those trained to understand their situation, not a general helpline service.  Members on the other side also spoke about the guidelines introduced to ensure the safety of children.  However, not enough use is made of soft information.  Its use was debated many years ago at the education committee and it needs to be determined.  There are stories, but abuse seems to continue in places.</P>

	<P>I cannot say I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is not a matter on I wish to speak but I feel I have to.  I did not say anything when the Ryan report was published and, in a similar way, this issue of Mr. Shine is extremely serious and has had some serious effects on many people.  I have not had the same contact with as many people in this case as colleagues from both sides of the House from counties Louth and Meath have had. I have had direct contact with people who are extremely worried and annoyed about this issue.  One cannot help but feel for them and wonder how they have survived over so many years without getting any consolation or help.  I pay tribute to nurse Bernadette Sullivan of the Dignity 4 Patients group.  She has played a major role in helping many of these people to deal with the situation.</P>
        <P>Like my colleague from County Louth, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, I pay tribute to Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, who was an absolutely committed gentleman.  He has been a tremendous loss to <Col N="744"/>the health system.  We all know why that has happened.  He approached me and quietly warned me about what was coming down the tracks in this case, as he did in the Dr. Neary case.  It is obvious that these extremely serious issues were not treated seriously by the management of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital at the time.  I have some respect for the hospital, especially as I was born there a small few years ago.  It has given the people of the north east a tremendous service, in general, down through the years.  The hospital authorities turned a blind eye to this type of thing, however.  Perhaps their religious beliefs meant they could not accept that anything like this could take place at the hospital.  I do not believe they ignored it on purpose.  They just could not believe it.  Perhaps they thought people were telling stories to get money or for some other reason.</P>
        <P>I would like to refer to an e-mail I have received from one of the people who contacted me about this matter, in which exactly what happened is simply expressed.  When the man in question was young, he was brought to hospital when he injured one of his limbs.  It was not his actual limb that was handled by Mr. Shine, but his private parts.  Can anyone explain the logic or medical reasoning for that?  It is unforgivable.  That is just one of many examples.  It happened on more than one occasion in very difficult circumstances.  The man who contacted me has lived with this for his whole life.  He did not tell his nearest and dearest about it for many years because he felt he could not do so.  His immediate family now knows about it.  As a result of the help of his wife and other people, including Bernadette Sullivan, he can now talk about it, at least, and be helped through it.  Like the rest of those involved, he wants this to be dealt with quickly by a public inquiry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened with interest last night to the speech made by the Minister, Deputy Harney.  It is great that she extended her sympathy to this group.  She gave a commitment to examine the matter and have it dealt with as quickly as possible.  She mentioned the possibility of establishing an inquiry.  I remind the Minister that I have been dealing with these issues for some time.  I am not talking about the situation at Monaghan General Hospital, as I would have to stay here all night.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not allow me to speak about it.  Like Deputy Johnny Brady, I was deeply involved in dealing with the Neary case.  We got good success for a large number of people in that instance.  There is a group that has not been dealt with, however.  We were promised on many occasions that it would be dealt with.  As I understand it, we have not yet received a ministerial commitment in this regard.  It raises questions about the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to finalising these things as quickly as possible.  We recently learned that the Neary case cost approximately half of what it was initially expected to cost.  There is no justification for not using additional moneys to finalise this case.  In that context, I question the guarantee given to the House by the Minister, Deputy Harney, last night.  I welcome the fact that her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, added something to it tonight.  The pressure felt as a result of this means it has to be dealt with.</P>
        <P>I would like to conclude by referring to an issue I raised on the Order of Business this morning.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, used the &euro;2.1 million cost of the Leas Cross inquiry to defend her argument that rushing into inquiries might not be the best thing to do.  I urge the Government to deal with the justice system as it has dealt with the rest of the public service.  Public servants at the lowest grades have had to accept income reductions as a result of levies and charges, etc.  For years, we have been promised that a Bill will be brought before this House to reduce legal charges.  Despite the cost of all the tribunals, etc., nothing has been done.  If something were done about legal charges, we would not have to worry as much about the cost of an inquiry into this affair.  I thank Deputies Reilly and Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan for jointly tabling this motion.  It is an example of the unity that is needed on this side of the House and across <Col N="745"/>the floor.  An inquiry must be established if these people are to be given the justice and peace of mind they need, after 30 years in some cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not have a local connection to this issue, I understand the concerns of many of the Deputies who have spoken and acknowledge the substantial difficulties they face.  I dread to think that the same issue could arise in my local hospital.  Rather than waffle on with a prepared statement, I will address some of the points made by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and others.  I welcome the remarks made by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, a few minutes ago.  When I read some documents in recent days to try to understand the background to this debate, I learnt that the Irish Medical Council spent 12 years pursuing this man.  That, in itself, underlines the need for urgency.  In that context, I accept the point made by Deputy Crawford about the need to bring this issue to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>I will try to deal with some of the issues that have been raised during this debate.  I recognise the need for closure.  I believe the Minister for Health and Children acknowledged that in the D&aacute;il last night.  I take the point that it is important for Ministers to meet groups.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has met the relevant group in this case.  I am sure she brought her sincerity to that meeting.  The unity of purpose in this House has been evident this evening, as it was last night.  While I take the point that a political decision may be needed, at the end of the day this is not a political or adversarial issue.  It is a question of recognising that this issue has gone on for a long time.  When those of us who are removed from this case watched the episode of &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; that dealt with it, we started to wonder how it has remained unresolved for so many years.</P>
        <P>I was struck by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s summary of the views of the people of the local area.  Some of them have praised Mr. Shine for working so late at night and for being so hands-on, in the medical sense.  It seems that people believed he was up to good practice.  It is unfortunate that it has taken so many years for people to realise that the Minister, taking into account all she has heard over recent days, weeks and months, is of a mind to bring this issue to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  Obviously, I am not in a position to say what the Minister&rsquo;s final decision will be.  Last night, Deputy Reilly quite properly made the point that accountability and transparency are important.  Every Deputy has recognised that throughout this debate.  We totally agree with it.  I accept Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s point that people of goodwill and good practice might find it difficult to believe such a thing could occur in a hospital.  I do not say that as an excuse, but it partly makes me understand why people ignored certain submissions, including private calls to the effect that wrongdoing was afoot.</P>
        <P>It is worth mentioning a specific report in the context of the debate on accountability and transparency, or the lack thereof.  In her report Judge Maureen Harding Clark said there was a culture of unquestioning respect towards the hospital consultants by the Medical Missionaries of Mary.  Medical facts and knowledge could be questioned but the handling of the management of a patient could never be broached.</P>
        <P>Openness and transparency will have to form the cornerstone from here on, in ensuring that the patient is protected.  More importantly, if medical staff have an issue regarding the management of a patient there should be a process that ensures such questions should not remain unanswered and nothing happens.  While the vast majority of medical practitioners are best practice professionals, it is important to emphasise that it was necessary to deal with some issues by implementing provisions regarding accountability and transparency.  Complaints officers will be installed in every hospital and while this might not be seen to be strong enough, it is nonetheless an attempt to ensure there is a process in place to allow patients to make complaints.</P><Col N="746"/>
        <P>As we are all aware, under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, for the first time the Medical Council has a lay majority, with 13 members and 12 medical practitioners.  The fitness to practice committee comprises a majority of persons who are not medical practitioners and the Act provides for fitness to practice inquiries to be held in public.</P>
        <P>Deputies may say that was then and we are now speaking about changes for the future.  By way of the points made this evening by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, particularly regarding practice in the hospital, the fact that the Minister has listened to the debate first-hand will bolster her submission to Cabinet regarding when the inquiry begins.  I also want to stress the health service&rsquo;s commitment to promoting a culture of openness and accountability now so that employees can report in the future regarding any concerns they may have in relation to the workplace.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 was amended so that from March 2009 the law provides for the making of protected disclosures by health service employees.  Again, it is HSE policy that all incidents when identified should be immediately managed in accordance with the incidents management policy.  Lessons that are applicable nationally will be applied nationally.</P>
        <P>Last night in the debate, Deputy Catherine Byrne made a point about the need to restore trust.  We all have to acknowledge that trust is precious.  However, trust cannot be restored unless the people legitimately making those complaints and who were ignored for years see that trust restored.  I must also express my disgust at the shocking betrayal of his patients by the consultant.</P>
        <P>The issue of counselling came up in the debate.  The Minister, Deputy Harney and the HSE are anxious that all former patients of the consultant are made aware that free counselling support is available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the proper counselling that is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not too sure about that.  My information is that the HSE has made arrangements for counselling support using the national counselling service which provides services for individuals, couples and family groups.  Persons affected by these issues who do no wish to avail of such counselling can speak with a psychologist or counsellor in confidence.  In addition to those concerns, the then Minister for Health at the time of the purchase of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in 1997 ensured that the previous owners, the Medical Missionaries of Mary, set aside a process of the sale as a fund, which is now available for addressing claims arising from incidents of alleged sexual abuse by the former consultant referred to.  When, as Minister of State, I took the Adjournment some time ago I said at that stage no consideration was being given to holding such an inquiry.  Since then, however, matters have moved on in the light of further evidence.  Notwithstanding the crucial evidence given by Opposition Deputies, things have moved on.  I firmly believe the Minister has good intentions in this regard. </P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and commend Deputy Reilly for tabling the motion.  I saw the television programme and it was shocking that such a level of abuse could be inflicted on such young people, affecting them so deeply. </P>
        <P>Mr. Michael Shine was struck off the medical register as a result of a Medical Council fitness to practice committee inquiry, which found him guilty of professional misconduct in respect of <Col N="747"/>three patients and of the following allegations: making sexual advances to patients; making indecent suggestions and-or behaving indecently; assaulting and-or indecently assaulting patients; undertaking inappropriate or improper medical examinations and-or treatment of patients; and failing to treat patients with due dignity and respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to deal with the effects of child sexual abuse.  A common myth that many people hold is that men cannot be victims.  The thinking is to the effect, &ldquo;This is a guy and he could have stopped it if he really wanted to&rdquo;.  It is assumed that the survivor must have consented in some way because sexual abuse does not happen to &ldquo;real men&rdquo;.  The very nature of sexual abuse and its associated stigma causes humiliation, shame self-blame, fear and secrecy for survivors.  It can be hard for them to speak openly about their experiences.  Survivors of male to male sexual abuse have to contend with the additional stigma and impact of homophobia, which increases their shame, isolation and secrecy.  Equating the abuse with gay sex leaves most survivors confused and conflicted about their sexuality.  If they identify as &ldquo;straight&rdquo;, they may experience homophobic fear and panic, when perhaps they  are not.  They may take desperate measures to prove to themselves they are not gay.  Some men may behave in a really macho way, for example, having sex with a number of women or trying to get women pregnant and harassing gay men.</P>
        <P>It is not uncommon for survivors of abuse to blame themselves.  However, men blame themselves for different reasons to women.  Men often believe, and quite strongly, that they let it happen, simply because they are men.  Males are supposed to be all-powerful, never victims, even when they are children.  This places an incredible burden on boys and men, often leaving them feeling guilty, ashamed, depressed, self-hating and conflicted about their gender and sexuality.</P>
        <P>The level and severity of the effects often depend on a variety of factors, including the age of the child, when the abuse first occurred, how long it lasted, the developmental status of the child and the relationship of the abuser to the child.  In this case it was the physician who abused the child.  Other factors include whether force was used to ensure the child&rsquo;s participation and the degree of force used will affect the degree of shame or guilt experienced by the child.  Then there is the reaction of the child&rsquo;s parents and other professionals if the child reveals the abuse or it is discovered by another person, which has an implication for this case.  Children who have been sexually abused may display negative behaviour and attitudes.</P>
        <P>Sexual abuse in childhood increases the risk of suicide in men up to ten times, according to research carried out by the University of Bath.  A recent study of Australian men has found that those who were sexually abused as children are more likely than women to contemplate taking their own lives.  While gender and mental health problems are the most important risk factors in those contemplating suicide, it is being increasingly acknowledged that traumatic experience such as childhood sexual abuse is a significant risk factor.  A report on the study stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">They found the men who were sexually abused as children were up to ten times more likely to have suicidal tendencies; many of these men had not been clinically diagnosed as depressed...Men are particularly vulnerable because they do not like to talk to others about their problems.  It&rsquo;s difficult for anyone to come terms with traumatic experiences such as childhood sexual abuse but for men the stigma is worse because they don&rsquo;t tend confide in their friends as much.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Many suffer feelings of failure and isolation and think that it is a sign of weakness to discuss their past abuse with others.  Men also tend to visit their doctors less frequently, so those who are risk of suicide often slip under the radar of the health care system.  Men are <Col N="748"/>particularly vulnerable to suicide and are three and a half times more likely than women to end their own lives.</P>

	<P>To a great extent the topics we pick for debate in here, apart from legislation, are dear to our hearts more than anything else.  I am glad tonight&rsquo;s joint motion in the name of the Labour Party and Fine Gael is about a topic everybody is interested in.  The majority of people in Ireland are very interested in this motion because they have some connection with some child, whether a niece, nephew, child, grandchild or family friend.  Most people are asking themselves how this litany of abuse could have continued for so long.  It defies logic.  In this case of Mr. Shine the abuse continued through the 60s, 70s, 80s and into the 90s.  How could it have continued for so long?</P>
        <P>One can consider where it took place.  There is the awful barbarism of the women who are still suffering as a result of symphysiotomy and the Michael Neary case.  How did that happen?  Listening to the previous speaker, Deputy Neville, more people than the victims need counselling.  These people thought it was more than likely that they were individual cases and nobody else was affected, because it is not something one readily goes out at night and speaks about to the person sitting next to one, man or woman.  It must have come as quite a shock to them to discover quite a number of people were involved and there is a huge number of victims.</P>
        <P>We should think about the parents of those young boys.  We all know as parents we consider it our job, although it is an impossible task, to protect our children 24 hours a day.  No matter what their age we expect that is our job.  Yet the very person to whom these parents took their children to care for them abused their children.  They must feel deeply hurt and must be remembered and taken into the equation on counselling and helped to get over this trauma.</P>
        <P>Why did it happen and why did nobody stand up and say, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;?  These are questions we ask about the Ryan report, Michael Neary and, now, Michael Shine.  I do not believe this happened in only one hospital.  We have had our problems in Cork with a GP.  There was no prosecution and it was drawn out for so long that eventually the DPP allowed it to drop.  Women were, if not physically abused, psychologically abused by this man.  We had a priest who was a chaplain and abused children in hospitals.  We all heard the rumours telling us not to go to that guy or to go to another guy.  Why do people not simply stand up and say they have their suspicious about a person?  The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; show told us very clearly why it did not happen: the one person who brought it to the attention of the authorities was ostracised.</P>
        <P>When will we have protection for people who have suspicions and are prepared to come forward?  When will we have whistleblower legislation?  The Labour Party introduced it a number of years ago and the Government took it on board and buried it in committee.  The people here tonight who are directly affected by this issue, which is only one of many, need to know.  They are not here to ask that we shine a light on this, although it is very important.  They seek an inquiry to ensure this never happens again.  That is what it is about.  We are all great on hindsight.  It is about ensuring no child ever again has the experience these people had, and that if it does happen there is enough protection for people who suspect something might just be wrong so they can stand up and go to the authorities and report that they suspect something.  They must be protected.</P>
        <P>I hope the days of the deference, nodding and hiding when a consultant comes into a ward, no matter what that consultant is, are long gone.  These are people who treat us when are sick; they are not gods.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Moloney&rsquo;s contribution.  It is right that we do.  I was going to say the reason we put this motion forward was the ambivalence and <Col N="749"/>confusion with Deputy Moloney having made a statement a few weeks back and the Minister then having a change of heart.  I fully acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s right to do that and I welcome his comments.  I had hoped, as others had, we would not divide on this issue, and maybe we will not.  The motion is simple and I will not read it again because Deputy Neville did that for us a couple of minutes ago.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children has told us she must consult with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General and the Government and that nothing can move until this happens.  I find this not really believable in some ways given that the Government meets weekly and that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is local to it and is familiar with the case.  He must talk with the Attorney General weekly if not daily.  Where there is a will there is way.  I do not say this to score points, but there is enough opportunity to have a meeting of minds if there is a will to do this.  I hope this will can find its way in an expression that the Minister will go ahead with this.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge all the other Deputies who have contributed here.  There has been a good history of co-operation between the Deputies in the north-east from all sides of the House regarding the many catastrophes and injustices that have emanated from that one hospital.</P>
        <P>Criminal trials can proceed in tandem with an inquiry and report after a trial so they do not prejudice it, so that is not really a reason not to do this.  The issues around the case have to be examined, including, as has already been said, how complaints are dealt with by the Garda, the health boards, now the HSE, hospital management, the Irish Medical Board and the DPP.  Last night and many times I said we must have transparency, accountability, and the Minister has mentioned this, and fairness in all State activity whether carried out directly by the State or on behalf of the State, as in this case.</P>
        <P>The victims of Mr. Shine may all have suffered in the north-east of this country but the whole country is concerned it should not happen again.  We must have an independent inquiry and a commission can do that in a private, cost-effective way.  We need a new culture where investigating complaints is the automatic response rather than ignoring or suppressing them as has been the case in the past.  There can be no more circling of the collegiate wagons in these situations.  If we do not pass this motion and ensure an inquiry we make a mockery of the Ryan commission and all that flowed from it.  Virtually all Mr. Shine&rsquo;s victims were children at the time of the assaults and abuse.  We said we would cherish all the children and this inquiry must be part of achieving that.</P>
        <P>I have found it particularly difficult as a parent and a doctor that such things were done to hurt children, particularly by a fellow doctor.  I am ashamed of him.  I have apologised and I will apologise again on behalf of my profession that these things were done by one of ours.  He has damaged the profession and the entire basis of the doctor-patient relationship, which has at its heart trust.  However, it is nothing compared to the damage he has done to the victims, many of whom have suffered in silence for decades.  I pay tribute to them, to Dignity 4 Patients and to Bernadette Sullivan, who was the whistleblower and who suffered as a result.  However, she has persisted in her fight for justice for the victims.  We owe it to her and to them to ensure this inquiry takes place.  We need whistleblower legislation, but we also need legislation to protect people&rsquo;s good names from vexatious complaints.  I do not profess to have the automatic answer &mdash; the inquiry can do that for us.</P>
        <P>These victims have suffered for decades.  Last night, I mentioned the man who could not walk down West Street in Drogheda but feels he can now because he has been vindicated to a certain extent.  However, let him be fully vindicated.  I ask Members on the other side of the House to try to put politics aside tonight.  If they feel they cannot vote in favour of the motion, at least they should abstain.  Let tonight be the night for the victims.  Let victory be theirs <Col N="750"/>tonight.  Let justice and truth be theirs tonight.  Most importantly, let us never allow this to happen again in such a lengthy fashion.  As I have said before, we know there will always be perverts among us, but what is important is that a system is put in place to protect people from them and catch them quickly so they cannot continue their evil ways over three decades.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this amendment.  The Master of the High Court and several senior High Court judges have expressed dismay at the cases where borrowers have not appeared or lodged a defence in respect of repossession orders.  The Circuit Court is a more appropriate place to deal with this issue rather than the High Court.</P>
        <P>The whole area, however, is something that the Minister and Government will have to tackle in the future.  With the number of repossessions, this country will be in a difficult situation.  Now that we are creating NAMA, I do not know what will happen to these properties when they are repossessed.  What will the banks do with them?  Once NAMA takes them over there will be empty houses with no one to buy them.  The taxpayer will pay for the house that has been repossessed, creating a vicious circle. The matter has not been thought through.  There is a huge difference between repossessing an investment opportunity that went wrong &mdash; in those circumstances, it is reasonable that those who lend money should seek repossession or the money back &mdash; and a person&rsquo;s home  That is completely different and this House will have to deal with that matter.</P>
        <P>If a person&rsquo;s home is repossessed, as distinct from an investment property, what happens to the family?  They go on the housing list.  There will be a ridiculous roundabout where a home is repossessed, the family signs on the local authority housing list, the local authority must find accommodation for them, they will be placed in rented accommodation before being allocated a dwelling and we will subsidise the rent and, in the meantime, the bank has repossessed the house which will lie vacant.  The family becomes clients of the local authority which must secure rented accommodation, subsidising the rent that is being charged, and ultimately the person and his family might be rehoused by the local authority.</P>
        <P>It would make more sense where it is clear that a person, because of extreme circumstances cannot afford to maintain repayments, for the local authority to take over the mortgage, with the title deeds being transferred to it, allowing the person to become a tenant and pay the appropriate rent.  That would prevent the whole merry-go-round of repossession and houses lying vacant in the ownership of a financial institution that will be passed on to NAMA, which must then hold on to them until someone eventually might buy them.</P>
        <P>This is not just an issue in terms of this legislation, although I appreciate the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not be involved in NAMA or the allocation of dwellings for homeless people.  Transferring responsibility from the High Court to the Circuit Court, however, is only the beginning.  A new way of thinking is needed to deal with this so that,  instead of the court making the decision for repossession, there would be a connection between local authorities and the court to allow an arrangement to be made with the housing authority to let the individual and his family remain in the dwelling.</P>
    
        <P>It is important that this matter be discussed.  I ask the Minister, as a member of the Cabinet, to tell us in his reply whether the issue has been debated at Cabinet level.  As the Minister has held many portfolios he is quite capable of understanding exactly what I am talking about.  It is a real problem.  As I said at the outset, if a person has bought different properties &mdash; apartments, houses or whatever &mdash; for the purpose of investment and has failed in his or her <Col N="754"/>responsibility to make repayments, that is a different issue.  We are talking about people&rsquo;s homes.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is another aspect to this.  It will not make much difference whether it is the High Court or the Circuit Court if the family becomes homeless and the responsibility falls on the State to find accommodation for them.  The cost of all this to the taxpayer will be substantial.  While I support the amendment being proposed by the Minister, which makes a lot of sense, there is another issue that should be discussed &mdash; although perhaps not in the context of this legislation &mdash; and which we as a society will have to come to terms with.  The chances are that in many cases the houses that are repossessed will end up in the ownership of the State through NAMA.  There will be a whole process of maintaining and looking after those houses.  What will happen to them I do not know.  I am sure nobody in this House at the moment knows either.  There will be many boarded up, empty dwellings the length and breadth of the country if we allow this situation to continue.  We must address a real problem: what do we do when people, due to loss of employment, find themselves genuinely unable to continue making repayments?  Financial institutions will not hang around.  We must find a solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the intent of this amendment.  In the Minister&rsquo;s response to other speakers and to my own contributions I ask him to explain in detail what he means by exclusive jurisdiction in the context of the Circuit Court.  Is there a constitutional matter arising such that a person may not have recourse to appeal to a higher court?  Can it be provided for in legislation that a matter must be dealt with exclusively in one court and no further appeal can be taken in any other court?  If that is what the Minister is actually proposing, it is a significant measure.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Minister that this could be broadened out.  The Minister will be well aware of the Laragan developments in Dublin in which more than 100 people who had placed deposits on properties recently found that the developer had gone into examinership.  The examiner is currently offering 1% of these &euro;20,000 deposits as walk-away money.  The Minister will be aware, as are other Deputies in the Chamber, that if those people took the developer to the Circuit Court and won they would quickly find themselves on appeal in the High Court.  If such a thing as an exclusive provision for one court can be put in place, it could perhaps be broadened out.</P>
        <P>The issue being addressed by the Minister&rsquo;s amendment is something we will be seeing far more of.  In the autumn of last year around 14,000 households were in danger of mortgage default and the Labour Party proposed that a two-year moratorium be put in place to protect mortgage holders.  As the Minister is aware, a mortgage agreement is simply a lending agreement no different from any other.  The only thing that makes a mortgage unique is that one&rsquo;s home is the surety on the loan, but it is still a loan by any other measure.  Perhaps what is being signalled by the Minister this evening is a long-term intention to ensure that loans acquired to buy homes are treated differently in the eyes of the law.  They should have a particular significance which does not exist at present because under current legislation a mortgage is just a loan.  It is no different to borrowing money to buy a car or go on a foreign holiday.  Perhaps the door can be opened up on this.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister envisage the voluntary code about which we have spoken this evening actually being implemented by bankers?  What is absent here is a mandatory code whereby a set procedure, laid out in legislation, is adhered to when people default on mortgages.  Voluntary codes are all very well in times of prosperity but with the danger of so many people losing <Col N="755"/>the roofs over their heads we need something else.  The voluntary code will ultimately result in people being brought to court.</P>
        <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned earlier the possibility of dealing with these cases <i>in camera</i>.  I do not know if this is something that will require further legislation; perhaps the Minister can deal with it in secondary legislation.  However, there is a significance to somebody walking into the Circuit Court and having their debts exposed for all and sundry to witness.  In addition, the local media are in the court on any given morning, reporting that six or eight householders in a particular region are in danger of losing their homes.  This is one of the shortcomings of the Bill and I ask the Minister to deal with it at a later date, if not sooner.</P>
        <P>What advice has the Minister received from the Office of the Attorney General with regard to ensuring that jurisdiction over these matters can be given exclusively to the Circuit Court?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will confine myself to discussing the amendment because it deals with a specific issue.  As I said earlier, it is designed to ameliorate the situation of people who are subject to proceedings for repossession.  Of course, none of us wants to see people&rsquo;s homes being repossessed.</P>
        <P>As has been mentioned, there is a code subscribed to by the larger banks.  All the major lending institutions have subscribed to that code and it is accepted by all involved, whether consumer agencies, the banks concerned or those in this House, that the major banks act reasonably with regard to repossessions.  I do not have the figures here, but they prove that small numbers of people undergo repossession on foot of loans with the large institutions &mdash; the ones whose names trip off the tongue when one thinks of the main lenders in this country.  This provision is designed to stop sub-prime lenders &mdash; I do not have to name them here as most people know who they are &mdash; from effectively circumventing the procedures in court in order to bring people to the High Court in the first instance.</P>
        <P>Deputy Lynch mentioned exclusive jurisdiction.  Under a Supreme Court decision, the Tormey case from 1985, the Oireachtas is entitled to confine jurisdiction to a particular court in the first instance.  In fact, if the House accepts my amendment there is more of an opportunity for somebody to appeal to the High Court, although if the case is initiated in the High Court there is less likelihood of anyone appealing, and even that would only be on a point of law to the Supreme Court.  I do not think anyone would have the wherewithal to embark on that.</P>
        <P>I understand what people are saying about the possibility that hearing such cases in the Circuit Court might open people to more scrutiny at a local level, but in the context of the way in which the Circuit Courts operate, they are not, in effect, public courts.  Although members of the public are allowed to enter them, they are not public courts in the sense that they are not generally populated by the media.  To be fair to the media, the practice thus far, even in the High Court, has been not to identify these people in any way.  That is as it should be.</P>
        <P>I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(4) A <i>lis pendens </i>registered under section 10 of the Judgments (Ireland) Act 1844 which has not been vacated before the repeal of that section continues to have effect as if that section has not been repealed and such registration shall be deemed to form part of the register to be maintained under <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment arises from further discussions between my Department and the Courts Service regarding the new <i>lis pendens</i> provisions.  The specific provision will ensure that a <i>lis pendens</i> already registered under the 1844 Act and not vacated when this legislation comes into force will continue to have effect as if the 1844 Act has not been repealed, notwithstanding the provisions in the Interpretation Act 2005.  Such a <i>lis pendens</i> will be deemed to form part of the register of <i>lis pendens</i> to be maintained under subsection (1).  This will avoid the Courts Service having to re-enter it into a new register.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume this will save on administration costs for the Courts Service.  Otherwise, there would probably be an unfair burden in terms of administration.  How will people have notice of the existence of a <i>lis pendens</i> if the Courts Service does not know about it or is not in a position to administer the registration?  How will we know of the continued existence of the <i>lis pendens</i>, and where will one be able to find that information?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is already an existing register of <i>lis pendens</i>, and any such to which I have referred would remain on that list.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent the Courts Service from having to transpose all those which have not been vacated into a new register.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">In recent months, considerable attention has focused on the difficulties being encountered by the retail sector, particularly as a result of current economic circumstances.  One element of these difficulties is the level of rents payable arising out of a rigid adherence to upward-only rent reviews.  I said some months ago that no legislation is in place which mandates the operation of such clauses.  Parties are perfectly entitled to agree that more neutral review clauses be included in their leases.  Even where upward-only clauses are present, the parties are free to agree that a flexible approach should be taken both as to the amount of rent payable and as to the way in which that rent is to be paid.</P>
        <P>The advice I have received suggests it would be problematic if not impossible to interfere with existing leases.  There is a presumption that these agreements have been fully and willingly entered into and that wholesale interference into such agreements inevitably carries with it the risk of acting in an unfair and disproportionate manner.  Having given careful consideration to this matter, I have decided that the best and safest way forward is to deal with rent reviews in the context of future leases.  Accordingly, subsection (2) makes clear that leases entered into prior to the commencement of the section, or agreements for such leases, will not be subject to the new regime.</P>
        <P>The point in regard to agreement for leases is the subject of a Fine Gael amendment.  I hope the text I am putting forward will address the concerns which underlie that amendment.  The amendment will mean that, in practice, upward-only rent review clauses will no longer be possible in respect of such leases.  All future rent review clauses will be subject to the construction that the rent payable on review may be fixed at an amount which is less than, greater than or the same as the amount payable immediately prior to the date on which the rent falls to be reviewed.  This applies even if such a clause were to be couched in terms of upward-only movement.  This will mean that when the rent becomes subject to review, full account can be taken of the prevailing realities as they affect the individual lease agreement.  There will be a neutral starting point for negotiations as to the new rent which is properly payable.  There will no longer be a presumption that the rent can only go in one direction.</P><Col N="758"/>
        <P>I am aware that my proposal does not deal with some of the difficult cases that have arisen.  However, I am strongly of the view that I have moved as far as is legally and practically possible at this time.  I hope that the effective prohibition on upward-only rent review clauses in future leases will have a persuasive influence on current market behaviour.  This amendment gives a clear signal to economic operators that a change in practice should seriously be contemplated.  I once again urge that a rational and balanced approach be taken in regard to rent negotiations within the retail sector.  I have already referred to the Fine Gael amendment.  As I said, I spent considerable time discussing this proposal with my officials and with personnel in the Office of the Attorney General.  For strong legal reasons, we cannot interfere with existing agreements which were validly entered into and in respect of which people took legal advice.  However, we will be on much sounder constitutional and legal ground when this provision is enacted, ensuring that all future leases can contain downward or no-change rent reviews as well upward reviews</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete subsection (2).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s direction on this matter.  He has proposed to amend the Bill in order to enshrine the principle whereby downward rent reviews can be availed of.  One might have thought this was an issue which warranted a Bill in its own right.  As Labour Party spokesman, I have brought a Bill before the House on this matter.  However, the Minister has decided to rectify some aspects of this issue via one amendment to the legislation before us today.</P>
        <P>The Minister is well aware of the issues pertaining to this and has received several submissions from persons in the retail sector and from organisations such as the Society of Chartered Surveyors.  It is interesting to note the submission made by the Society of Chartered Surveyors.  In an item of correspondence received by the Minister, a Mr. Macdonald refers cogently and poignantly to the view articulated by the society that &ldquo;in the majority of cases landlords are agreeing some form of concession notwithstanding the terms of the lease, to assist the tenant in getting through the current economic difficulties, where such a flexibility is warranted&rdquo;.  The society&rsquo;s view reflects that of the Minister that the option of having a downward rent review is available if both parties are agreeable.  That is not the case because the consent of both parties is required.  While the tenant may be willing to engage in a downward rent review, such a review will not take place if the landlord is unwilling to engage.  The Minister is correct, however, that downward rent reviews are not facilitated under current legislation.</P>
        <P>Mr. Macdonald, in his correspondence to the Minister, also states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>One thing is certain, he is not the burger king. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand The Body Shop has a business on Grafton Street.  Referring to the statement I cited from the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Mr. Macdonald writes: </P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">This sounds like the type of statement that might have been made in Westminster in 1845 in defence of Irish landlords&rsquo; response to the plight of tenants during the Famine.  It reads well but is not a true reflection of reality on the ground.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">What is the reality on the ground?  It is that the job is only being half done in this legislation.  Total employment in the wholesale and retail sectors in the first quarter of this year was 285,000 employees or 14.5% of the working population.  According to the latest recorded figures, the Exchequer received &euro;4.5 billion from the sector in 2007 under the headings of VAT, taxes paid, <Col N="760"/>PAYE, income taxes other than PAYE, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Given that retail and wholesale are significant players in the economy, the rent issue needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The House has heard that costs are undermining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  In the retail sector, the problem is not the costs of employment but the cost of leases which are a multiple of labour costs.  As the Title of the Bill I have introduced indicates, we face an emergency.</P>
        <P>I propose to outline what will occur should the Minister refuse to accept the Labour Party amendment.  The measure proposed by the Minister does not have a retrospective element.  Given that few leases are for five years and the vast majority are for 25 years, it is possible that many leaseholders will wait for up to 24 years before the measure proposed by the Minister will come into play.  We have many more Celtic tigers and recessions in the next 24 years.  A mechanism is required to allow retailers who are pinned to their collars and in danger of laying off staff to renegotiate their leases from next week onwards.  This will not be possible under the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P>What signal is the Minister sending out to the market?  What specific message does he have for retailers?  Given that most lease cycles are for 25 years, how will landlords and tenants in the private commercial sector interpret the Minister&rsquo;s actions this evening?  Is his message that further legislation, whether primary or secondary in nature, will be introduced if the proposed measures do not produce the desired results?</P>
        <P>Intervention is required in the market because it is distorted.  Leases are the only area where it is not legally permitted to reduce prices.  Will the Minister outline the nature of the legal difficulties to which he referred?  They cannot relate to property rights, as outlined in the Constitution, given that this issue has been addressed in other legislation.  Compulsory purchase orders, for example, are one mechanism under which the State may determine the value of land or property.  Part V of the Planning and Development Act provides that 20% of a development may be set aside for social and affordable purposes.  The State has, therefore, intervened in the market.  In light of these precedents for State intervention, I fail to understand the reason for the Minister&rsquo;s legal concerns.</P>
        <P>What does the Minister expect commercial landlords to do next week?  Does he hope they will take an altruistic view in response to his request to review rents and approach their tenants for discussions?  As the law clearly protects landlords, they have no reason to engage.</P>
        <P>The Minister is effectively creating a two tier system.  From next week onwards, new leaseholders may avail of a downward rent review.  While I acknowledge that the measure provided for by the Minister establishes a precedent and breaks new ground in terms of how rents in the commercial sector operate, it also creates a second tier for existing businesses trading on the streets of Dublin, my city of Cork and high streets in towns and villages across the community.  These companies are locked into 25 year leases and may not benefit from the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.  One possible outcome will be that businesses will go to the wall in the next couple of months because they cannot secure a downward rent review, new tenants will assume their lease and avail of this mechanism and jobs will be lost in the meantime.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party amendment proposes to delete three lines of the Bill.  If it is accepted, the Minister will ensure that current and future tenants will benefit from the measure he has proposed.  This is an issue of critical importance.  This morning, Deputies heard once again that jobs are being lost and Ireland is not competitive.  Given the figures from Revenue showing the number of people working in the retail sector and the income it generates for the State, it would be wise of the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>On amendment No. 38, correspondence from the conveyancing committee of the Law Society of Ireland notes that the use of the Landlord and Tenant Act definition will mean that a lease or tenancy of residential property, a small part of which is used for philanthropic or sporting purposes, will be liable to seizure.  I ask whether the Minister cares to comment on that point.</P>
        <P>The conveyancing committee also believes that the new section 131 will create problems for the drafters of leases in multi-unit developments where it has been common to insert a nominal rent with provision for a review by reference to the consumer price index or a fixed increase in order to ensure that lessees do not acquire rights to a fee simple.  For the record, I have in the past practised as a solicitor but I no longer do so.</P>

	<P>This important amendment provides that new agreements for leases will be neutral as regards rent reviews.  Having listened carefully to the arguments put by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, I am not sure whether the Minister can go any further than he already has.  I assume retrospection is not an option and that the legislation will affect agreements which have not yet become leases.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the Fine Gael amendment to amendment No. 39.  However, the Ceann Comhairle has not asked me to move that amendment and it does not have a number.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>That is a consequence of rushed and unco-ordinated procedures.  I can only respond to the Ceann Comhairle and he can only deal with what he has been told by the Clerk.

I would have thought that I should have been informed as a courtesy, particularly given that I went to the trouble of visiting the office this afternoon to inquire into the matter.  I am a bit annoyed that the operation of the House&rsquo;s systems means that I was only informed when I asked the Ceann Comhairle the position on the amendment.  Perhaps he will enlighten me further.</P>
      </Speaker>

    </Speaker><Col N="762"/><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will accept the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s word.  The Minister appears to have grasped the import of what I was suggesting in my amendment and I hope he will confirm that in his reply.  Agreements for leases are, in effect, leases and it may be unduly harsh on those who have already concluded agreements but not yet leases.  I would welcome confirmation of that point from the Minister and would be reasonably happy if it was indeed the case.</P>

        <P>I wish to refer to the points raised by Deputy Tuffy regarding difficulties for drafters of leases in multi-unit developments, of which there are many.  The provision for rent review is almost always made by reference to the consumer price index or a fixed increase.  I ask the Minister what device he intends to use in dealing with such leases.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that it may not be possible for parties to contract out of this section.  Even if both parties to an agreement desire an alternative arrangement to suit their business needs, they cannot now give legal effect to it.  I have some sympathy with the points raised by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch in this regard but I am not sure if that is sufficient in circumstances where parties have entered into agreements for leases with the benefit of expert advice.  I do not know of anybody who would engage in the drafting or conclusion of an agreement for lease, particularly one involving high street retail outlets, without the benefit of legal, accounting and tax advice.  If these agreements may be set aside under law, the advice received and the commitments entered into would be left in a precarious position.</P>
        <P>The Minister may have received correspondence from the Irish Association of Investment Managers regarding unintended consequences for landlords, tenants and the property market in general.  As he will be aware, investment managers invest in property on behalf of pension funds.  Has he taken advice on the consequences of the change on the valuation of investment properties?  The valuation of property assets is dependent on the multiplier assigned to a particular income stream and a lower multiplier is used in the event of uncertainty.  It may have the effect of further increasing pension fund deficits.  As my colleague, Deputy Barrett, noted earlier, this is important in the context of NAMA because that agency&rsquo;s ultimate cost to the taxpayer will depend on its ability to generate a profit through the eventual sale of its assets.  I am mindful of Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s advice because the ultimate sale of the asset may well realise an amount which is significantly smaller than envisaged.  It is unknown territory as to what might happen in terms of valuation.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s reassurance that this new proposal will not have the effect of reducing the value of properties even further and will not have an unintended increase for the taxpayer, which may well be a consequence of NAMA.  In addition to the reduction in the value of assets, it may be more difficult for NAMA to find purchasers for the properties.  That point was also referred to by Deputy Barrett.  There are large unfinished estates, apartment blocks and commercial developments in every constituency in the country, including my own, which will become health and safety hazards.  I can foresee a situation where, under health and safety regulations, NAMA will have to engage demolition contractors to remove such developments.  It could well be, therefore, that upwards-only rent reviews will reduce the risk of defaulters on bank loans by property investors as there is no risk that the income stream may fall at rent review and be insufficient to meet mortgage repayments.</P><?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>With no certainty on the future minimum income stream, banks will be less likely to purchase the NAMA assets.  An unintended consequence of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal may be the discouragement of foreign investment in the Irish property market as income streams will be less secure than in the United Kingdom, for example.  I trust the Minister has taken these issues into consideration.  Going back to the initial point raised by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, it may have been wiser to have a stand-alone piece of legislation, rather than attaching this at the 11th hour <Col N="763"/>to a Bill that has been knocking around for many years.  It was a surprise to see the new-found speed with which the Minister wishes to have this legislation enacted.  I am conscious of the Minister&rsquo;s earlier point about mortgages and repossessions.  However, if there was a doubt, and there may well be a doubt, as to the unintended consequences of the Minister&rsquo;s action, it could have been better to leave the matter to a stand-alone Bill of a type produced by the Labour Party, although I cannot say that Bill was perfect.  No doubt Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch would not say it is perfect either, but if it were examined by the Minister&rsquo;s experts and those of the Attorney General, they may well come up with a Bill to meet people&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>Professionally advised tenants may feel they wish to set aside the lease but may not have an opportunity to do so under the Minister&rsquo;s unduly restrictive measure.  With regard to the retrospection sought by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, the Minister should give the House the benefit of his best advice in that regard.  I accept that there is an obligation on a tenant to pay the rent as agreed.  The implied obligation of a tenant to pay rent goes back to section 42 of Deasy&rsquo;s Act of 1860.  That obligation will always be expressly stated in the lease in any event.</P>
        <P>I refer the Minister to the case of Charlton <i>v</i> . Kidney and McNamee involving a special summons application for the appointment of a rent review arbitrator.  In that case the Master of the High Court expressed the view that upwards-only rent reviews might be invalid in the current financial climate.  In the High Court, Judge Laffoy took a completely different view when the final hearing of the case took place.  She expressed the view that a tenant who has signed up to an upwards-only rent review clause was bound by it.  That can only be changed by legislation, which is what the Minister is doing, but it will only refer to leases or agreements that will be entered into following the passing of the legislation.</P>
        <P>To go back to my earlier point, I do not have to withdraw my amendments at this stage.  I look forward to receiving the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s letter, which I hope will meet the concerns I have raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is obvious from the detailed presentation made by Deputy Charles Flanagan on behalf of Fine Gael that this party has dealt comprehensively with the various requests put to us on this issue.  While everybody has sympathy for retailers at a time when the economy is in the current state, it would be irresponsible of us to try to achieve something which ultimately could cause more problems, rather than solving the mess we are trying to sort out.  One must accept that the Minister is acting in good faith and that an attempt is being made to deal with a difficult situation on behalf of retailers.  As Deputy Charles Flanagan said, however, it would appear that if an attempt was made to interfere with existing leases we would probably end up with somebody challenging this legislation.  It will end up in the Supreme Court and God only knows when a decision will be taken.  In the meantime, new leases will be entered into and no change will have been made.  Having accepted in good faith that the Minister is attempting to deal with the problem and can only go so far, I accept what he says &mdash; that on the advice he has received, we can only deal with the future and not with existing lease agreements.</P>
        <P>Given the contributions made by Deputies Ciaran Lynch, Joanna Tuffy and Charles Flanagan, this matter should be re-examined to see if we are correct in saying that it would be impossible to deal with existing leases.  What happens when there is a break clause in the existing lease?  Can an agreement be reached at that stage if it is agreed by both parties that a rent be reduced?  At the end of the day, one may have a piece of paper that says this or that is what will happen on rent, but if two people agree to something I cannot see that an agreement cannot be reached.  If a tenant says &ldquo;I cannot afford to pay the rent&rdquo; and the owner says <Col N="764"/>&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll agree to a 10% reduction&rdquo; the world will go on.  There are going to be an awful lot of vacant units one way or the other.</P>
        <P>One must go into detail in examining this type of legislation because the value of property is often based on the actual or anticipated rental income.  I repeat that the whole area of NAMA has tremendous consequences down the road.  The Minister attended the Committee on Finance and the Public Service to discuss the NAMA proposals.  We also had Mr. Bacon and the gentleman from the NTMA, who will be in charge.  The Minister did make a very peculiar point at that committee meeting.  When asked if NAMA purchases a piece of property at a certain price and subsequently discovers that it paid too much and later sells it on at a loss, the Minister seemed to be of the opinion that he can go back to the bank in question and seek the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.  I doubt that very much, but it goes to show that when we get into the territory of buying and selling property, much depends on the circumstances of the economy at any particular time.  The market will dictate the price.</P>
        <P>What about a neighbourhood shopping centre where individual units are owned by different landlords?  If I am in a unit that is exactly the same size as the unit next door occupied by my colleague, and his lease is renewed and he is paying a lower rent than me, that is a set of circumstances that will be extremely difficult in the future.  This is just not a simple issue of making a change in the law and hoping for the best.  This has long-term consequences for the future value of property.  We are inclined to think of the single shop, but if this applies, it will apply to all leases of all properties, be it a major office development, a major shopping complex or even an individual shop.  There is a tremendous difference in value between large developments and shops on the street corner.</P>
        <P>Given the Minister&rsquo;s advice, if we were to push this it could end up being challenged in the Supreme Court.  Given the strong submissions made by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party on this matter, and the difficult circumstances in which retailers find themselves at the moment, the Minister should take a look at the whole issue.  Perhaps he could discuss with the Minister for Finance, in the context of the NAMA legislation, the changes these arrangements will have on the value of properties that come under the ownership of the State.  I would warn against taking the NAMA legislation too lightly.  It has huge consequences for the taxpayer.  I would like to know what will happen as a result of any change in this area in terms of the long-term value of properties and the liabilities that will rest on the shoulders of the Irish taxpayer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Flanagan put his finger on it when he said that while there might be sympathy around the House for the plight of people in existing contractual arrangements, sympathy does not put bread on the table.  While Deputies can say we could have another look at it, the reality is that I have received no advice at all that would suggest I can in any way interfere with contractual arrangements validly entered into without any question of fraud or coercion where people have taken legal advice.  The Labour Party is trying to give retrospective effect to this.  While we have sympathy, we have to deal with the reality.  We cannot hoodwink people and bring in a law which would clearly be open to challenge and would probably leave the situation in worse flux than it is for those people who were led up a garden path.</P>
        <P>We are dealing with rent on commercial premises.  Some people referred to multi-unit developments, but multi-unit development legislation only refers to residential property.  There may be an issue regarding mixed use, but that is something that can be arranged in the context of the agreements that are made subsequent to the passing of this legislation and which refers to commercial or residential.  For the purposes of what we are talking about here, &ldquo;property&rdquo; is <Col N="765"/>commercial property.  No more than non-commercial property, it is subject to the Constitution and its rights and protections.  It is also subject to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Both the convention and the Constitution give strong protections on the right to private property and property ownership.  My advice is that there is a real constitutional difficulty with legislative restrictions that affect property rights retrospectively, especially where it has an impact on completed legal transactions.</P>
        <P>I have not received any legal advice to the effect that it would be safe to apply my proposed rent review provisions to existing leases.  The Oireachtas has a duty to proceed with caution and to act within the parameters set down by the law.  I have strong advice to the effect that the wholesale interference with existing leases along the lines contemplated by the Labour Party amendment is simply not feasible.  It would not be possible to take on these matters any further.</P>
        <P>We have looked at the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill, which purports to address the issue of retrospection.  That Bill is deeply flawed, both from a legal and a practical perspective.  It avoids dealing with the difficult issues which retrospection creates by simply assigning to the Government, on the basis of an opinion as to the fairness or otherwise of existing rent levels in the commercial sector, a sweeping power to freeze rents at market values.  In effect, this is tantamount to rule by decree by the Government and it amounts to an attempt to capitalise on what is undoubtedly a very serious problem for some within the retail sector.  The Bill offers the illusion of hope, but the reality of legislating in this area is virtually impossible when it comes to the issue of retrospection.</P>
        <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the issue of land that is subject to mixed use.  It is possible for the parties, after the passing of this Bill, to enter into a rent review agreement which would take care of the situation.  I accept the point made by the Deputy on future investments and the possible adverse effect that neutralising the rent review would have on commercial decisions that are being contemplated or are being made as we speak.  I have decided that it would be prudent to allow a period of time to elapse before bringing in this particular section.  We have to bring it in subject to a commencement order, so I will be allowing a period of time so that people are on valid notice as to how future clauses can be drafted in order to accommodate their individual means.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The attachment to upward-only clauses has been extraordinarily pervasive.  It is one that seems to have crept in very much in recent years.  Tenants have gone along with it and some people would say that they had no option.  They had to get into the premises, so they had to accept this clause, even though they were advised that the rent would go up all the time.  There is a need to educate people, both landlords and tenants, that this is something coming down the line and that it would be unfair to bring it in immediately.  We need to leave a time lag to allow people to adjust so that they can make the necessary changes and factor them into their future leases, but also into their future investment decisions.  Parties would be put on notice that a change in the law was imminent, so it would be up to them to decide how best to order their affairs.  They would have to factor this into their ongoing investigations.</P>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>As I indicated earlier, I sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General in regard to retrospection and it causes considerable difficulties.  All of us have great sympathy for the existing people but I do not believe we should try to suggest that we can wave a magic wand and pass a law which would circumvent and strike down a contractual arrangement freely entered into.  The point was made that perhaps there can be no review for 24 years but that is the reality of the leasing arrangements into which people have entered.</P><Col N="766"/>
        <P>The reason I brought this forward is that I am aware from my own knowledge and the knowledge of people who have made representations to me in my constituency in regard to what is going on in the rental market that people are being put under considerable pressure by landlords who, in turn, are being put under pressure by perhaps the investors in their operation.  There is a chain of people putting those lower than them on the chain under considerable pressure.</P>
        <P>There are tenants in commercial properties who are finding it extremely difficult to meet a rent agreed at the top of the market.  It is easy for us to say landlords should accept a lower rent on existing leases on the basis that half the rent is better than no rent and that one should not turn these people out.  Equally, if one goes further up the chain, one will find that the landlord is subject to an arrangement with somebody up the line who has invested on the basis of a particular understanding and expectation that there would be a rate of return out of it.  He or she may well have borrowed on that basis.  It is not an easy issue in which to try to intervene from a legislative point of view.</P>
        <P>I believe it is accepted that it is better to have a neutral position in regard to rent reviews for the future.  However, we need to give some time to allow that to enter into the psyche of the tenant and landlord market and the equity funds and pension funds market as well so that they understand the scenario once this is put in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I make no bones about the fact the Labour Party proposes to introduce an element of retrospection to deal with existing leases of companies which are trading, contributing to the Exchequer and employing people, not 24 years down the line when one of these leases might come up for review again.  This is the elephant in the room.  These companies are in real danger of closing and that is why the Labour Party proposes this amendment.  The Minister has started it and we are asking him to finish the job.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about constitutional positions and so on.  I remind him of something done by another Department.  On 1 June of this year, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs introduced a measure whereby 80,000 rent supplement payments have been reduced.  The money given to the tenant has been reduced and he or she has been told to negotiate a lower rent with the landlord.</P>
        <P>The State is already intervening directly in the rental sector which in this case is in the private residential sector.  The State also needs to take cognisance of what is happening in the private retail sector and intervene.  We face a crisis and to say this can be deferred for 24 years or more does not recognise where we are.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the National Asset Management Agency and the concerns stated by some Members.  These products, which will be held by NAMA, were part of a pyramid scheme.  The property bubble was facilitated by policies and decisions initiated in this House in recent years.  There was a pyramid scheme and rents were based on the peak of that scheme.  People who took out leases in the past two or three years were at the apex of that pyramid.  They had no choice.  Make no mistake about that.</P>
        <P>The only provision for rent in the private retail sector is for upward rent reviews.  The only lease one can get is with a provision for an upward rent review because if there was a provision in law for a downward rent review, the Minister would not be bringing forward this provision.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal, I am reminded of Mandy Rice-Davies, the Profumo affair and the phrase &ldquo;He would, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;.  The Minister would say that, would he not?</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>Let us be clear about this.  Price control has already been interfered with by the State in the case of the private residential sector.  That was necessary because when rent allowance was first introduced, it drove rents up.  I have some sympathy for the position the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has taken with her Department.  I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take a similar approach with his Department and ensure trading companies do not go to the wall because they have been informed by the Minister that they must wait for 24 years.  I implore the Minister to accept the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In public life, as a Minister and when I was not one, I have always been of the view that one should not hoodwink the public because people are not fools.  I suggest strongly to Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch that this is an opportunistic attempt on the part of the Labour Party to try to show cause for something.  I have no doubt any legal advice it has received is similar to the advice I have received and to which I have no doubt Deputy Charles Flanagan is privy and from his knowledge of this area.</P>
        <P>The ability of the Legislature to rewrite contracts is almost impossible.  The Deputy referred to compulsory purchase orders.  There is an opportunity for Government, in the interests of the common good, to acquire property by CPO.  That is in the context of legislation already passed and CPO legislation not being able to rewrite existing contracts at the time of its passing.  CPO is possible in the common good in a very restricted sense but only in a way in which it cannot rewrite existing contracts.</P>
        <P>I would like to go as far as I can in this regard, as I know Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and Members of the House would too.  We can only do what is possible.  When the valid point was made &mdash; clearly Deputy Charles Flanagan received the same representations we did &mdash; that our proposed amendment was somewhat silent on agreement for leases, we tabled another amendment to take care of that situation in that agreements for leases entered into prior to the commencement of this are as good as leases.  We are taking care of that but we cannot do more than that.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ciaran Lynch may call a vote but I respectfully suggest to him that he should not leave this House, tell people his amendment was voted down and that he could have achieved this change if the Government had agreed to it.  I respectfully suggest Deputy Charles Flanagan does not claim his Bill was voted down or it could have been achieved if the Government had sanctioned or agreed to it.  Even if his party were on this side of the House, it would have received the same advice I did and would not be able to insert this provision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to see a prohibition on upward only rent reviews in commercial leases.  The Minister mentioned there is a difficulty with the commencement order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no difficulty with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yet there is a delay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a significant delay and we do not know when this commencement order will begin.</P>
        <P>It goes back to my original point that it may have proved to be a hasty intervention on the Minister&rsquo;s part to tag on this new section.  It was reported, and sources close to the Minister&rsquo;s office intimated it, that this prohibition on upward only rent reviews would be law by the middle of July.  This, however, will not now happen because of a delay due to a difficulty arising from the Minister not knowing the measure&rsquo;s consequences.  Earlier I pointed out unintended <Col N="768"/>consequences that may well result in problems.  Will the Minister inform the House what his revised timetable will be for this new legislation?</P>
        <P>During the week, I spoke to a commercial tenant in my constituency who informed me he takes in less than the rent he is charged.  That is before any overheads or staff costs are taken into account.  Such is the nature of the economic climate that people engaged in business are suffering severely.  Up to six main street commercial premises in Portlaoise have closed since Christmas, many of them due to the high rents payable to landlords.</P>
        <P>Commercial tenants have made representations to me in the same manner as they have to Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.  I hope landlords will exercise a certain amount of realism in negotiations between all parties to revise rents in the context of the current economic climate.  I have heard cases, as I am sure every Member has, of keys being returned to landlords due to the inability to pay rent or an increased rent from a rent review clause.  I urge landlords to adapt to these economic realities, having regard to the fact that if they do not, there may not be an alternative tenant &mdash; hence closed premises may remain closed for some time with no rental income earned for the landlord.</P>
        <P>I disagree with the Minister on the markets and those who have received legal advice on leases that have been agreed for some time.  I can appreciate how, at the stroke of a pen through a ministerial order or the approval of the House, leases of considerable long standing could be set aside and parties sent back to the drawing board.  While I accept the Minister claims the Attorney General has a difficulty with this area, I am not entirely sure about it.</P>
        <P>Where stands the new initiative at this stage, having regard to the delay in introducing the promised ban on upward only rent reviews?  I acknowledge the Minister has extended that to accommodate agreements for leases which have not been set in place.  It is important for those watching this change that we introduce an element of certainty by flagging when the Minister anticipates the period for consultation might elapse.  I hope it is not an indication on the Minister&rsquo;s part that the measure was less considered than it ought to have been.  I hope those who look to this initiative to save jobs and maintain the viability of a business do not feel doubly let down because of the position regarding Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch&rsquo;s initiative or that the Minister&rsquo;s initiative is less than it was intended.  I hope it is not just a bottle of smoke.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to the representations and points validly made.  When I set out to change the law in this respect, I did so on the basis that some traders are having grave difficulty in meeting the rent for commercial premises they leased at the top of the market, of which all Members are aware in their constituencies.</P>
        <P>It is important the House sends out a strong signal to the market, and particularly to those renting commercial premises, that it is better to get some rent than no rent at all.  Putting people out on the street is in no one&rsquo;s interest.  I accept some landlords are circumscribed as they can perhaps be part of a chain with a banker, for example, putting pressure on them about their rate of return.  When I became aware of the difficulties occurring on the high streets across the country, I believed it was right for the Oireachtas to send a signal to exhort landlords to be as reasonable as possible in cases where traders were locked into, for example, a 35-year <Col N="769"/>lease with upwards rent reviews.  I wrote to all the professional bodies in the property sector to exhort their members to deal reasonably and rationally with such cases.  Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that the vast majority of landlords are accepting lower rents from tenants, if they can, and thereby easing the situation.  As I have said, there are circumstances in which landlords cannot reduce rents because of the organisation higher up the chain.  I believed it was opportune for us, as an Oireachtas, to send a strong signal to the market.  That is why I introduced this amendment.  Obviously, I had to introduce it on the basis of advice from the Attorney General.  I was trying to ensure that the Oireachtas, when it agrees this change, does not distort the existing market.  It was always my intention to have this legislation passed before July to ensure that those who pursue repossession orders in respect of houses have to start in the Circuit Court, rather than the High Court.</P>

I will not accept any criticism from Deputy Flanagan in that respect.</P>

I do not doubt that all the advice that has been given to Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch has suggested that it is virtually impossible to do what he is trying to do.  I suggest that this is as much as the Oireachtas can do.  I strongly urge the Deputies to support this amendment.</P>

	<P>I would like to deal with another issue before I put the amendment to the amendment.  Deputy Charles Flanagan indicated earlier this evening that he was seeking an explanation of what happened to an amendment he had intended to propose during this debate.  He said he would prefer to receive an explanation in the Chamber this evening, rather than in writing at a later stage.  I asked the staff of my office to clarify precisely why Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s proposed amendments to amendment No. 39 were not on the third list of additional and substitute amendments.  Having had the matter checked, I understand that the Bills Office approached the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s liaison officer, or contact point for all amendments, when the second substitute version of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment No. 39 was circulated.  The liaison officer was told at that point that Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendments should not be tabled to the latest version of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which is now before the House.  It appeared at that point that neither of Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendments to the amendment could be addressed to the latest version of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.  When it subsequently became clear that the second of Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendments to amendment No. 39 could be addressed to the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, the Bills Office approached the liaison officer again to ascertain <Col N="770"/>whether, in such circumstances, Deputy Flanagan wished to table the second amendment to the amendment.  The liaison officer did not revert to the office, however.  Given that my office extends every assistance to all Members at all times, I am sure Deputy Flanagan will appreciate that no discourtesy was intended in this case.  In fact, it appears that an opportunity to resubmit the amendments to amendment No. 39 was provided, but not availed of by his party&rsquo;s personnel.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <sTitle>Long-Term Illness Scheme.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this matter in 2007, when it would probably have been easier to achieve a positive result.  Notwithstanding that, I was told it was not envisaged that the 1970 Act that specified the list of illnesses covered by the long-term illness scheme would be added to or reviewed.  I have been contacted by a couple of young people who have Crohn&rsquo;s disease.  It is a lifelong illness and has no cure.  It can be contained and managed and people can live as ordinary and as normal a life as possible, but it cannot be cured.  It is defined as an auto-immune illness, as are arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and yet of the three, only multiple sclerosis is on the list.  Given that it has the same long-term consequences, it seems strange that Crohn&rsquo;s disease is not included.</P>
        <P>Last November, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, ruled out any chance of Crohn&rsquo;s disease being included in the long-term illness scheme, claiming sufferers have to pay only &euro;100 per month, so it would be of no benefit to them given the cover available under the drugs payment scheme.  Unfortunately, she did not think of the number of GP visits sufferers have, at &euro;50 to &euro;60 each, and the number of routine blood tests they have to undergo to monitor their disease.  If it comes to the stage where young people, particularly young women, neglect their visits or blood tests because they cannot afford it, there are consequences down the line.</P>
        <P>The Minister is probably correct that this does not affect many people but an alarming number of young people are getting it for some reason which has not been established.  Given the fact that it affects so few in the context of the national population its addition should be considered.  It would be cost-negative because if people are forced not to look after the illness the consequences are dire by way of long-term medical needs, persistent admissions to hospitals rather than outpatient visits and subsequent operations that will be necessary.</P>
        <P>It is manageable, not curable, but needs to be monitored regularly.  The amount of money involved in including Crohn&rsquo;s disease is minimal.  There is no point saying that we should give here and there but it is cost-negative.  I would appreciate if the Minister would undertake a cost-benefit analysis of it and take medical advice on the long-term consequences of not taking care of it and of the number of people who have the disease but are not attending as they should.  The number of visits people should make and the amount of care they should take to monitor this illness are fairly well laid down.  If it must be looked at coldly, which, unfortunately, it probably will be, with that in mind it could be possible to include it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and I thank Deputy Doyle for raising this issue.</P>
        <P>The long-term illness scheme arose from a non-statutory scheme, established in 1967, to supply free of charge certain products to persons for the treatment of diabetes.  A statutory scheme was introduced in 1971 under section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970.  It provides that a health board, now the HSE, may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.</P>
        <P>The conditions which have been prescribed are mental handicap, mental illness for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, <Col N="773"/>diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.</P>
        <P>From 1971, a separate scheme was introduced to refund the cost of drugs above a certain threshold for non-medical card holders.  This evolved into the drugs payment scheme in 1999.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;100 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The drugs payment scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>When the drugs payment scheme was introduced, it was decided to continue the long-term illness scheme for the conditions already covered, but it has not been extended and there are no plans to do so.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

      <sTitle>Sports Funding.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The first time a player puts on the county jersey is always a very proud and special day for that player, his family and the club.  For all players that moment happens only after an enormous effort by that person.  It may have taken years of training and playing before reaching that memorable day.  Playing for any county requires tremendous commitment and sacrifice.  The fitness levels of many of our inter-county players is on a par with that of the premiership footballers.</P>
        <P>In Ireland we take a very keen interest in how our county hurlers and footballers perform.  Many people live for the championship; it is what the summer is all about.  With the arrival of the &ldquo;back door&rdquo; the dreams of many counties stay alive that little bit longer.  While there may be very little between having a successful season and not, the commitment and dedication required are generally the same.  Irish people simply love their Gaelic games and very much appreciate the major effort the players make and the great joy and pleasure they bring.</P>
        <P>In recognition of that major commitment made by players, a grant scheme for Gaelic players was agreed.  Last year was the first year of that initiative.  The grant provided &euro;3.5 million to the Irish Sports Council to fund the scheme and it was very well received by the inter-county players with footballers and hurlers from the 32 counties all receiving their share.  It took much negotiation to agree the grant scheme and it is pitiful to see and read reports casting a doubt over the future of the scheme.  The fact that economic circumstances have changed cannot be used as an excuse for discontinuing the scheme.  Many inter-county players are experiencing the realities of the downturn and find themselves out of work.  For others in employment it means having to negotiate time off with their employers or having to forgo the opportunity for overtime.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the enormous benefit of sport, the Government has in recent years provided enormous resources for sport.  Sporting organisations have received reduced funding this year, but funding continues to be provided for many of our sports stars and athletes.  In recognition of the economic challenges facing the Government the GPA has indicated its willingness to accept a reduction on the allocation it received last year.</P>
        <P>A case has been made that not all county hurlers and footballers can continue to expect the grant, particularly those from the weaker counties.  I strongly disagree with this argument.  We cannot draw a distinction between the successful and so-called &ldquo;unsuccessful&rdquo; ones.  Every effort must be made to ensure players get every encouragement and assistance to play regard<Col N="774"/>less of their county.  We all love to be part of success.  The thought of training with a potential provincial or all-Ireland winning team will always be attractive.  For a player to put his heart and soul into training with a team with a poor championship record and little chance of improving on it can often require much more commitment and dedication.</P>
        <P>Gaelic games are very special.  We are very lucky to have so many people who are prepared to make great personal sacrifices to play for their counties.  The grants scheme is simply an acknowledgement of that contribution.  Tonight I call on the Minister to find the money to allow the grants scheme to continue.  The players do not need this type of unnecessary distraction as they prepare for the championship.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter for us and let the players get on with what they do best &mdash; playing our beautiful games.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and giving me the opportunity to address the issue.</P>
        <P>In the agreement reached in November 2007 between the then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Irish Sports Council, the GAA and the Gaelic Players Association, provision was made for the introduction of two schemes to recognise the outstanding contribution of senior Gaelic inter-county players to our indigenous sports, by meeting additional costs associated with elite team performance and to encourage aspiring teams and players to reach the highest levels of sporting endeavour.  In return it was agreed that the players would involve themselves in a number of social responsibilities, including working in close co-operation with the local sports partnerships on a programme of visits to schools and club facilities as a part of an overall policy to increase participation in their sports.</P>
        <P>It was agreed that the schemes would be funded through the Irish Sports Council and would be administered through the council and the GAA.  An amount of &euro;3.5 million was provided to the Irish Sports Council in 2008 to fund the schemes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I indicated recently in response to parliamentary questions in this House that the drastically changed economic circumstances mean that the taxpayer cannot continue to fund the entire cost of schemes such as the Gaelic players schemes as the resources are no longer available.  I have discussed this issue with the Irish Sports Council and the GAA.  I met Dessie Farrell, chief executive of the GPA together with his colleagues Kieran McGeeney and Donal &Oacute;g Cusack on Monday last with a view to agreeing a sustainable new scheme that would recognise the outstanding contribution of Gaelic players to our indigenous sports.  We had a robust exchange of views in an honest and open atmosphere.  I explained to the GPA the difficulties that both my Department and I faced in the current economic climate.  It fully understood and accepted those difficulties.  I explained my view that the scheme as originally constituted was no longer viable.  However, I am anxious to address the main concern of the players, which is recognition of the contribution that they make to the culture and traditions of this country.  In that context I want to put in place a scheme that is sustainable and will provide that recognition.</P>
        <P>I want as many sports as possible to be funded within the limits of the resources available to me to ensure the continued strategic development of sport.  I would like to see a scheme agreed with the GPA that would reflect that ambition.  To put this in context, as the Deputy knows we funded athletes directly.  The total cost of the other 16 sports that we fund, which is quite extensive and goes directly to athletes and not NGBs, is &euro;2 million.  What I have proposed to the GPA is a very generous and worthy scheme.  I hope its members will reflect on that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the need to take steps immediately to ensure that those added to the register of <Col N="775"/>electors in the run-up to the next election, whatever that may be, are full-time residents at the stated address.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to consider the use of PPS numbers along with a proof of address as the minimum requirement.</P>
        <P>On 16 June I received an answer to a parliamentary question regarding the number of people added to the electoral register on a county-by-county basis leading up to the local and European Parliament elections.  The Minister admitted that 72,000 names were allowed nationally.  I appreciate that the law allows this but I believe that not enough time is allowed between the closing date and the need for publication.  The additional lists are made available to candidates to allow them to canvass.  It was at this point that some of my party&rsquo;s candidates and workers raised some questions with me regarding difficulties in finding some of these new voters at their addresses.  I wish to make it clear I have never made any statement on this issue other than to answer media questions based on my original parliamentary question.</P>
        <P>The staff of Monaghan County Council do a good job, adhere to all the regulations and are above reproach.  I am sure that the same goes for all other local authority personnel.  My only interest in this issue is that proper structures be put in place for the future to allow everyone who has the right to vote, from whatever background or country, is ensured of having a vote but that no one else is.  It is very annoying for people who have lived in the country all their lives and were previously on the electoral register to find on arrival at the polling booth that they cannot vote because their names are not on the register.  Nor is it acceptable that people can vote because they have been added to the register inappropriately.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government promised the introduction of an electoral commission to run elections and compile registers.  Fine Gael agrees with this in principle, but allowing the council staff to use PPS numbers and proper proof of address would suffice.  There is no point in change for the sake of change.</P>
        <P>From personal experience I know how every vote is important.  I won a seat in the 2002 general election by one vote in every box in County Monaghan.  Fianna F&aacute;il lost a local authority seat in west Cavan in the recent local elections by only one or three votes, depending on which count we consider.  Many comments and much media coverage have been generated by this election in County Monaghan.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, cannot ignore the general anxiety on all sides of the political divide.  I want to ensure the Minister and others that I want to encourage all newcomers from eastern Europe or elsewhere to take part in our political and electoral systems.  The Minister&rsquo;s party gained a town council seat in Carrickmacross by nominating a non-Irish national to the Green Party ticket and that gain was against the national trend.</P>
        <P>We have debated the electoral register in the House on many occasions.  Students are often registered at the address where they live when attending college and also registered at home.  The same applies to some people working away from home.  The PPS number should address this issue.  If I telephone a social welfare office in Dublin, Sligo or elsewhere and give a PPS number the official can confirm the information I want.  If I telephone the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and give a herd number, the official can advise me on the herd status or payment, or where each animal tag number should be.  In 2009 we should be able to trace our voters to ensure that all those and only those entitled to vote can do so by right and by law.</P>
        <P>This issue has caused considerable discussion and reaction.  It is important to come up with a foolproof system that guarantees the right to vote, but only for those residing in this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.  I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this important matter. </P><Col N="776"/>
        <P>As the House is aware, electoral law provides that the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority.  It is its duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.  Authorities were required to publish the final register for 2009-10 by 1 February last. To help people exercise their right to vote, individuals not on the register can be put on the supplement to the register up until 15 days before polling day.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To safeguard against abuse, the law provides that each application for entry on the supplement must be signed in the presence of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person&rsquo;s identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant is unable to go to the local Garda station and sets out the reason in writing, the form can be signed in the presence of an official of the registration authority.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate.  Applications must be made directly by the applicant to the registration authority.</P>
        <P>The Electoral Act 1992 provides also that a person is entitled to be registered where he or she is ordinarily resident on the qualifying date and that the registration authority may for the purposes of its duties in relation to the preparation of a register require a person to give any information in their possession which the registration authority may require.  Returns received from registration authorities by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicate that more than 72,000 names were included on the supplement before the recent elections.  The Minister believes the current legislative arrangements relating to the inclusion of persons on the supplement strike a reasonable balance between having a flexible facility to allow people to exercise their right to vote while ensuring that there are adequate provisions in place to counteract possible abuse.</P>
        <P>Detailed implementation of these legislative provisions is a matter for registration authorities, returning officers, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others involved in the electoral process at local level.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has no role in these matters and it is not appropriate that the Minister should be involved.  The Minister is aware that the question of alleged irregularities in the Register of Elections in the recent elections in the Ballybay area of Monaghan has been referred for investigation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the registration authority.  That investigation must be allowed to take its course.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent electoral commission and states that the commission&rsquo;s responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  The House may be assured that the question of the use of PPS numbers for electoral registration purposes will be considered fully in this context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue for students, parents and teachers in south Sligo.  Carn national school is a two-classroom school which was built in 1885, 124 years ago.  In 1995, a portable classroom was made available to the school.  Current enrolment is 70 children and projected enrolment for 2010 is 80 children.  Currently, the school employs three teachers, one learning support teacher and one resource teacher on a part time basis.  Resource teaching is held in the hallway or a small area partitioned off from one of the original classrooms, which is the principal&rsquo;s office.</P><Col N="777"/>
        <P>The school is located on a small site, described by an official from the Department of Education and Science as a postage stamp.  It is located on the Ballina-Dublin Road, which is a busy road close to a dangerous junction.  There are no parking facilities for staff or parents dropping off children at school.  The school is served by a septic tank located on the land of an adjoining farm and is currently causing many problems.  There is no green space where children can play.  This year there has been 14 near accidents at the school when parents were dropping off or collecting children from the school.  The board of management has expressed grave concern for the children as a result of these near accidents.  It is also concerned that responsibility in this regard may fall back on them as board members.  It is unfair to put people in such a position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the work done by the board of management which has obtained a site on which to build a new school.  The site is adjacent to a football pitch, is of ample size and safe.  The parents of the children attending the school have raised funds to provide for construction of a 100 yd. long road into the site.  While that might not sound like much it took a great deal of hard work and commitment by parents, many of whose children may never use the school as they will have gone through the system.</P>
        <P>I implore the Minister to take on board the difficulties being experienced by these students, teachers and parents.  This issue must be addressed.  The Minister during his last visit to Sligo visited Carn national school and is aware of conditions there and of the difficulties experienced by teachers while trying to work in such an environment and by the children being educated in this environment.</P>
        <P>I implore the Minister and his officials to prioritise this school which is, I believe, one of the worst in this country today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am happy to take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe who, unfortunately, cannot be present.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the current position in relation to Carn national school, Gurteen, County Sligo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Carn national school applied for a new four classroom school and the project was assigned a band rating of 2.2.  The existing school site is very restricted at 0.2 acres and is not suitable for expansion.  The school authorities have advised the Department that a parish site could be made available.  The Minister for Education and Science visited the school late last year and noted the pressures on its current accommodation which is more than 120 years old.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to progress this project in the current economic circumstance.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity and so on leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  For example, band one projects include the provision of buildings where none currently <Col N="778"/>exist but there is a high demand for pupil places while a band four project makes provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Each band rating has several sub-categories which more specifically describes the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.  A band rating of 2.2 has been applied to the project for Carn national school under this process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will also be aware that the allocation for school buildings in 2009 is &euro;614 million, which represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.  However, the level of demand on the school building programme is such that all projects cannot be carried out together.  They will have to be carried out over time in a structured and coherent manner and this is the reasoning behind the Department&rsquo;s published prioritisation criteria.  The project for Carn national school will be carried out consistent with this approach.  In the intervening period, the school can apply for temporary accommodation to meet its needs if this is necessary.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, this matter has been on-going for many months now and dialogue with the Vietnamese Authorities is continuing. </P>
        <P>At this juncture, all options, including an interim intercountry adoption agreement, are actively being pursued by the Government to allow for the conclusion of discussions on a strengthened bilateral agreement and to facilitate continuity of the strong and positive relationship between both jurisdictions.  Many Deputies have sought guarantees and specific timeframes for the conclusion of a new agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  However, it is not possible for me, or indeed any of my Government colleagues, either to give a timetable or anticipate when discussions on an agreement will be finalised.  Discussions on a new bilateral agreement remain live and the request regarding the negotiation of an interim arrangement has been made.  It is now a matter for the Vietnamese authorities and, as such, it would be improper for the Government to seek to influence or interfere with this decision-making process.  Officials of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs are in constant contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and with the Embassy on the ground in Hanoi.  Furthermore, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs was recently in direct contact with the Vietnamese authorities regarding the matter.</P>
        <P>At present, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is visiting the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  An itinerary for this visit was compiled with the assistance of the Irish Embassy in <Col N="780"/>Hanoi.  The Minister will be issuing a statement on the visit upon his return from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to concluding discussions on the text of the bilateral intercountry adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has explained, on numerous occasions, the reasons for the renegotiation of the existing agreement.  The overriding policy objective is the protection of children.  The aim of the Government is to provide the best possible assurances around international adoption and to improve standards for children and the families who apply to adopt from abroad in line with the commitment to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 39 and 40 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services, delivered efficiently and effectively.   Ensuring patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved. There is significant international and national evidence that acute complex healthcare, particularly for emergency medicine, complex surgical services and critical care should be provided in hospitals which are suitably staffed and equipped and which undertake sufficient volumes of such activity in order to maximise clinical outcomes and ensure safe services.  At the same time, there is a significant range of less complex care which can continue to be provided safely in smaller hospitals, especially in day surgery, medicine and diagnostics.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the HSE commissioned a comprehensive review of adult critical care services in order to inform the planning and future provision of this key element of the acute hospital system.  Prospectus Strategy Consultants undertook this work.  The company&rsquo;s brief was to consider the current provision of adult critical care services in the public health system and to provide advice on the appropriate model and configuration of critical care provision.  It was also asked to advise on such matters as appropriate governance arrangements and on HR, work practice, clinical audit and training issues, as well as supporting provisions such as transport and infrastructure.</P><Col N="781"/>
        <P>The Prospectus Team included four international advisors, together with two critical care experts nominated by the Intensive Care Society.  Their work included site visits to each of 37 hospitals with Critical Care facilities, a 30-day survey and audit of critical care activity in each hospital, stakeholder consultation and a review of best international practice.  I understand that the report is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>In relation to acute hospital services, recent reviews have highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services in the regions concerned, particularly in relation to accident and emergency services, critical care and surgical services.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the HSE Mid-West involved the reorganisation of the arrangements in Ennis and Nenagh so that these hospitals provide an urgent care/minor injuries service and a medical assessment service for 12 hours a day as part of a regional Accident and Emergency structure.  This took effect on 6 April 2009.</P>
        <P>In the context of the reconfiguration process, the level of staffing of the ambulance services in Clare and North Tipperary has been enhanced and a 24-hour advanced paramedic service is in operation. Advanced paramedics are trained to a high standard which equips them to provide more complex pre-hospital care than other personnel.  This includes the administration of a wider range of drugs and the urgent assessment and treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions.  Protocols are in place to ensure that all trauma, paediatric and obstetric emergency cases are brought directly to the major tertiary centre at the Regional Hospital in Limerick rather than to Ennis or Nenagh.</P>
        <P>The next phase of the process, which includes the reconfiguration of surgical services, is at an advanced stage. This will involve the transfer, on a phased basis during the period July to October 2009, of acute surgery services from Ennis and Nenagh to the Regional Hospital in Limerick. Since the beginning of January 2009 an additional emergency operating theatre has been in operation at the Regional Hospital in Limerick in anticipation of this change.   The operation of this theatre will be extended to provide additional capacity seven days a week from July 2009.  The extra activity involved will be facilitated through 30 additional surgical beds being commissioned on a gradual basis from July at the Regional Hospital in Limerick and at St. John&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of staff to accommodate the re-configuration of services is in hand. Agreement with the unions has been reached on the transfer of acute surgical services.</P>
        <P>Reorganisation of services must of course occur in consultation with the key stakeholders and on an incremental basis.  I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time.  This approach will, I am confident, produce the best outcome for patients.  The HSE has therefore established appropriate structures at regional level to give effect to this approach.  In the Mid-West there is a Project Board chaired by a Clinical Project Leader, Mr Paul Burke. This is supported by a Project Implementation Group with three sub-groups on Emergency Medicine, Surgical Services and Primary Community and Continuing Care and a Project Team with an Executive Project Leader.</P>
        <P>In the North-East there is a Steering Committee chaired by the Director of the National Hospitals Office and the National Director of Primary, Community and Continuing Care. This is supported by the HSE North-East Leadership Group and local implementation groups.</P>
        <P>In HSE South the Director of Reconfiguration of Acute Services in the Cork and Kerry Region, Professor John Higgins, is assisted by a Reconfiguration Team and a Reconfiguration Forum comprising representatives from general practice, community health services and all of the acute hospitals in Cork and Kerry. A number of subgroups are in place to review specific issues.</P><Col N="782"/>
        <P>In HSE South East a Steering Group has been established to develop a strategy by the end of 2009 for the future delivery of acute hospital services in the region.  Three Regional Advisory Groups on General Medicine, General Surgery and Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Health have been established to advise on specific services in the context of this work.</P>
        <P>I believe that the approach being taken by the HSE in relation to the configuration of acute hospital services is the best way forward and will result in a system which will facilitate the maximisation of patient outcomes and the further improvement of the health status of the population.</P>

	<P>Last year, hospital Emergency Departments treated 1.15 million people, of whom 368,000 were admitted to hospital.  The average number of patients on trolleys awaiting admission at 2pm each day is half what it was in 2005. </P>
        <P>We need to continue to reduce waiting times for all patients presenting as emergencies to our hospitals.  With this in mind, the HSE has set a lower waiting time target of 6 hours for all patients in its 2009 Service Plan. The aim is that all patients, irrespective of whether they are admitted or not, will be assessed, treated and discharged or admitted within 6 hours of arrival.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working to measure and report on the time taken to manage each patient&rsquo;s care from the point of arrival in the Emergency Department until they are discharged or admitted.  As an interim measure, a sampling approach is being adopted at selected time periods each day, which involves collecting registration, admission and discharge data from Emergency Departments at all hospitals, either electronically or manually.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently undertaking a project to provide all EDs nationally with a revised IT system. Hospitals which are not currently in a position to record total waiting times over a 24 hour period are collecting data on a sampling basis between 11am and 1pm daily and 4pm and 6pm.  The sampling is based on over 10,500 reported ED times from a variety of hospitals. As hospitals are given the data collection capability the sampling approach will cease.</P>
        <P>The latest information from the HSE, collected as part of this project, indicates that between February and May 2009</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the percentage of patients discharged within 6 hours increased from 79% in February to 88%</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The percentage of admitted patients admitted within 6 hours increased from 40% to 56%</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The percentage of patients admitted within 24 hours increased from 81% to 88%.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The percentage of non-admitted patients discharged within 6 hours increased from 89% to 94%.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">From today (July 1), the HSE is initiating an &ldquo;early transfer&rdquo; pilot programme across 4 sites (Tallaght, Beaumont, Drogheda and Cork University Hospitals). Under the programme, patients can be transferred from the ED to a ward earlier than would normally be the case. <Col N="783"/>The decision to transfer patients will be based on a prior analysis of the number of planned discharges each day.</P>
        <P>This and other developments such as reducing inappropriate admissions, reducing average length of stay and shifting activity from in-patient to day case procedures will contribute to further improvements to Emergency Departments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 36 together.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children acknowledges the need to reform the current arrangements for financing nursing home care to ensure that such care is affordable for all.  It was with this in mind that she introduced the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, <i>A Fair Deal</i>.  The Fair Deal will equalise the level of State support available for public and private long-term care recipients.  It will remove the real financial hardship currently being experienced by some private nursing home residents by ensuring that care is affordable for all who need it.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008 has now completed all Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas and has been referred to the President for signature.  The Minister intends to implement the new scheme in the final quarter of this year.</P>
        <P>At present, approximately two-thirds of nursing home residents are in private nursing homes and the Minister is aware that, in some case, families are experiencing financial hardship.  The existing Nursing Home Subvention Scheme provides for two different types of subvention, namely basic subvention and enhanced subvention.</P>
        <P>It is the Minister&rsquo;s expectation that the introduction of the Fair Deal later this year will remove real financial hardship from many families who, under the current system of nursing home subvention, may have to sell or re-mortgage their homes to pay for the cost of nursing home care.</P>
        <P>The HSE, in conjunction with Prospectus, carried out an assessment of bed capacity requirements in the areas of long-stay, dementia-specific and respite care beds over the period 2006-2008.  It looked at both immediate capacity requirements and projected requirements to 2036.</P>
        <P>The assessment found that, assuming 4.5% of people over age 65 require long-term residential care, there was a national over-provision of long-stay beds in 2006.  However, there was an under-provision of such beds in some parts of the country.  It concluded that a significant increase in capacity will be required by 2036, even assuming the percentage of people over age 65 requiring such care was reduced to 4%.  It also found there was a significant requirement for replacement, refurbishment or up-grading of existing public bed stock in order to meet modern standards.</P><Col N="784"/>
        <P>Care and Welfare Regulations, which underpin the new Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People were signed by the Minister last week.  From today, the Chief Inspector of Social Services in the Health Information and Quality Authority, an independent regulatory body, will have the power to inspect all designated centres for older people &mdash; whether in the public, private or voluntary sectors.</P>
        <P>Currently, there are about 8,200 public beds and over 17,000 private long-stay residential care beds, i.e. over 25,000 beds in total.  It is estimated that, at present, there are about 23,000 people in long-term care.  The recommendations from this assessment, together with the availability of Exchequer capital funding and funding for the Fair Deal, will continue to inform the provision of residential care services going forward.</P>
        <P>Residential respite care continues to be provided in public community nursing units (including community hospitals/long stay residential units) across the country. There are over 750 designated respite care beds provided nationally in these units. It is estimated that approximately 19,500 people benefit over the course of a full year &mdash; based on an average length of stay of 2 weeks per person.</P>
        <P>This is a very significant resource which is relied upon by carers across the country and which will continue to be developed as additional public bed capacity is provided.</P>

	<P>The Mental Health Act 2001 provides a modern legal framework for the admission and treatment of persons with a mental disorder.  The best interests of the person must be the principal consideration in any decisions under the Act, including a decision relating to involuntary admission.  The Act has extensive provisions relating to involuntary admissions and provides a high level of protective measures in relation to patients&rsquo; rights.  All involuntary admissions are automatically reviewed by an independent Mental Health Tribunal.  The review is independent, automatic and must be completed within 21 days of the admission or renewal order being signed.  Involuntary patients are entitled to free legal representation. </P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission, which was established in April 2002, is an independent statutory body whose primary function is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected.  The 2001 Act also established the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, the function of which is to monitor the standard of care provided in approved centres and any other premises where mental health services are provided.  The reports of the Inspector on approved centres are published on the Mental Health Commission website.  The Inspector can also be required by the Commission or the Minister for Health and Children to make inquiries relating to any matter which may be appropriate, having regard to the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, including the operation of any approved centre or other premises where mental health services are provided, or in relation to the care and treatment of a particular patient.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Mental Health Act 2001, which brings Ireland&rsquo;s mental health law into compliance with international conventions, provides robust safeguards and review mechanisms to ensure that the rights of patients are protected.</P>

	<P>The current estimated cost of pandemic preparedness for 2009 is &euro;66.3m. The bulk of this &mdash; &euro;60m &mdash; represents the cost of procuring an estimated 5.8 million doses of vaccine in 2009 of the total 7.7 million doses to be procured by the HSE. The remainder covers a variety of other items, including some extra antiviral drugs to add to the substantial existing stockpile of antivirals which had previously been procured as part of our pandemic preparedness plans.</P>
        <P>The funding for some of these items is likely to come from the existing HSE budget but I anticipate that exceptional items of major expenditure, such as the vaccine, will require the allocation of additional funding to the HSE. My Department has been, and will continue to remain, in contact with the Department of Finance about this issue.</P><Col N="786"/>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the various measures taken to date are based on the deliberations of the National Public Health Emergency Team, which includes representatives of the Department, the HSE and the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group. They also take account of the information and advice received from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Control. In particular, the stockpile of antivirals and the planned purchase of pandemic vaccine, when it becomes available, give Ireland a very favourable population coverage compared to our EU partners.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) was established by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2007 to implement the recommendations contained in the National Cancer Control Strategy. Considerable progress has since been made in the reorganisation of cancer services and particularly in relation to the transfer of breast cancer diagnosis and surgery into the eight hospitals designated as cancer centres by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The reorganisation of breast cancer services, which has been the highest priority for the Cancer Programme, is almost complete with services remaining to be transferred from only three hospitals &mdash; Tallaght, Sligo and the South Infirmary. The service at both Sligo and Tallaght will transfer this summer while the transfer from the South Infirmary to Cork University Hospital (CUH) is expected to take place later in 2009 on completion of a &euro;5m refurbishment project at CUH.</P><Col N="787"/>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) initiated a quality review of symptomatic breast cancer services in 2008 to assess the performance of the designated cancer centres against the National Quality Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services. In January 2009, HIQA issued individual interim reports to each of the designated centres, providing them with details of the standards that are being met and of where gaps exist. Significant progress has been made by all of the designated cancer centres in addressing the gaps in systems and services. The individual hospitals have prepared implementation plans in conjunction with the NCCP, which are now being implemented and monitored by the NCCP with the allocation of appropriate staff and resources to these hospitals.  A further inspection and assessment by HIQA is planned for the end of 2009, and these reports will be published. The NCCP has at all times stated that it only transfers services when it is satisfied that adequate resources are in place.</P>
        <P>Priorities in 2009 in relation to other site-specific cancers include services for prostate, lung, rectal and pancreatic cancers, brain tumours and head and neck reconstructive surgery and the development of community oncology.  Additional development funding of &euro;15m was allocated to the NCCP for all of these initiatives, along with 100 new posts.</P>
        <P>Recent achievements include the opening of two Rapid Access Diagnostic Clinics for Prostate Cancer at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin and at University Hospital Galway in June 2009, the first of eight such clinics. Rapid Access clinics are also to be established for lung cancer.  A single national programme for the management of brain tumours and other central nervous system tumours is being created on two sites &mdash; Beaumont and Cork University Hospital &mdash; and funding has been allocated this year to recruit a neuro-oncology trained neurosurgeon to lead this programme. St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital will become the national centre for pancreatic cancer surgery by the end of 2009. A single centre is also to be established for reconstructive surgery for head and neck cancer while the number of hospitals performing rectal cancer surgery is to be reduced.</P>
        <P>The NCCP has also developed a separate Community Oncology office which is working closely with the Irish College of General Practitioners to train and educate GPs in oncology and also to enhance nursing capability in oncology care within communities and primary care teams.  Early diagnosis and appropriate referral is critical to improving cancer care, so the successful development of this programme is a key strategic initiative.</P>
        <P>The implementation of all of these initiatives represents significant progress towards the goal of improving our cancer services and, ultimately, outcomes for cancer patients.</P>

	<P>The General Register Office of the Department of Social and Family Affairs has overall responsibility for the Civil Registration Service. Day to day services including the registration and production of certificates for births, deaths and marriages are provided nationally through local Health Service Executive offices.  At present members of the public can purchase certificates either in person, by telephone or by post. The majority of business is conducted in person at local offices.  </P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing development of its services, the HSE has identified a range of services which are suitable for online delivery, including the facility to order birth, death and marriage certificates.  This facility is due to be launched in the coming months. It has been developed primarily through the use of existing resources: the total cost of external service providers is expected to be less than &euro;10,000. The service will allow members of the public to order and pay for certificates online. There will be no additional charge for this online service.</P>
        <P>I understand that a private company currently offers a service, using the normal civil registration facilities, which involves them accessing, purchasing and providing certificates to their clients for which they charge an additional service fee.</P>

The second was a Health Technology Assessment, carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).</P>
        <P>Both reports confirm that a properly organised screening programme would have huge public health benefits and that population based colorectal cancer screening would be highly cost effective.  I am very anxious, notwithstanding the current budgetary situation, to introduce such a programme as soon as possible. Accordingly, I have now requested HIQA to explore different ways of delivering a high quality colorectal cancer screening programme within existing cancer screening resources, based on the range of advice contained in the two expert reports. Their work will be overseen by an Expert Advisory Group comprising representation from key stakeholders including my Department, the National Cancer Screening Service, the HSE National Cancer Control Programme, the HSE National Hospitals Office, the Irish Cancer Society and clinicians.</P>
        <P>HIQA&rsquo;s report is to be provided to me by the end of September, and when I examine this I will decide how to proceed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Emergency Department Task Force Report, which was published by the HSE in June 2007, recommended that the issues in <Col N="789"/>Emergency Departments be examined on a whole hospital and whole system basis. It identified the requirement for hospital specific initiatives as well as the development of national responses in relation to key structural issues. </P>
        <P>A key requirement was the development of strong internal management control processes at hospital and community levels to ensure that capacity is fully optimised and that measures designed to unlock capacity were supported by strong controls which enable an appropriate balancing between emergency and elective workloads.</P>
        <P>The Winter Initiative was established by the HSE in July 2006 to address many of the problems that manifest themselves in the emergency departments and occur nationally, particularly in the winter months.  The findings in the Emergency Department Task Force Report, and indeed other Reports since then, have informed the approach adopted.  These findings continue to be prioritised by the HSE.  The emphasis in year 1 of the initiative was on three areas which covered measures for:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Promotion and prevention</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Hospital avoidance, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Capacity building and generation.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A fourth dimension was added in year 2 which focused on improving the processes to reduce length of stay in hospitals in line with best practice e.g. integrated discharge planning, increased usage of day surgery and access to diagnostics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this context, a key component of the Winter Initiative Plan was to work to maximise long stay care capacity.  This was planned by means of a combination of contracting beds in private nursing homes and fast tracked initiatives to increase public long stay capacity.  I understand that at the end of March 2009 there were a total of 29,000 beds in  nursing homes.  Of these approximately 25,985 are long stay beds.  There are currently in the region of 23,000 people in long stay residential care in Ireland (7,500 public,15,500 private).  A monthly average of 9,161 beds were reported as subvented at the end of April 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition, in early 2009, the HSE provided 235 additional contract beds to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system by the numbers of patients whose discharges are delayed as follows:</P>

In 2009, a further additional 725 beds and 371 replacements will be provided for older people.  This includes beds being provided under the Capital Plan and beds being provided under the Fast Track Initiative.</P>
        <P>Hospitals and the Primary Community and Continuing Care Division of the HSE have delivered in excess of their Service Plan targets for 2008 despite financial constraints and increasing <Col N="790"/>demands for service, which the HSE has said equated to about 54,000 extra patients attending and 13,500 extra emergency patients being admitted to hospitals.</P>
        <P>Following on from the launch of the Code of Practice for Integrated Discharge Planning, the HSE is initiating an &ldquo;early transfer&rdquo; pilot programme across 4 sites (Tallaght, Beaumont, Drogheda and Cork University Hospitals), starting today (1st July). Under the programme, patients can be transferred from the ED to a ward earlier than would normally be the case. The decision to transfer patients will be based on a prior analysis of the number of planned discharges each day.</P>

	<P>Following enactment of the Health Act 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) wrote to all medical card holders aged 70 years and over in January 2009.  Persons who were in receipt of a medical card on a non-means tested basis were requested, if over the income limits set out in the Act, to make a declaration to the Executive, on or before 2 March 2009.</P>
        <P>To-date, 21,423 medical cards for persons aged 70 and over have been returned to the Executive or removed from the medical card register.  The vast majority of people in the over 70s age group (334,652 &mdash; as at 1st May 2009) retained their medical cards.</P>
        <P>Doctors have been advised by the HSE regarding clients that have been notified to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) as deceased, gone away or where duplicates exist. In circumstances where a card holder has been removed from the medical card register and they are still entitled to a medical card, the person or their GP should advise the HSE immediately and as soon as the details are confirmed, the client&rsquo;s medical card eligibility will be restored. The HSE has received contact from a number of doctors and individuals in this regard and these cases are being worked through.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the current economic difficulties and in accordance with a recent High Court settlement agreement between the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), a two phased process is under way to reduce the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) to comply with European Working Time Directive (EWTD) requirements; to increase flexibility in the working day of NCHDs; and to achieve other cost containment measures including a reduction in NCHD overtime. </P>
        <P>The first phase of the process concentrated on the introduction of EWTD compliant work patterns, rotas, rosters and on-call arrangements and resulted in Labour Court Recommendation 19559 of 15 June 2009.  The Labour Court recommendations include 5/7 working for NCHDs and a core working day of 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at weekends.  The new rostered working arrangements are to be introduced from 1 July 2009.  The effect of the Labour Court Recommendation would mean a reduction in long hours for NCHDs and improved patient safety.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement the result of any Labour Court adjudication was subject to an IMO ballot.  I am pleased to note that 86% of NCHDs voted to accept the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
        <P>LRC negotiations on all other NCHD contract issues, including cost increasing issues, will be dealt with in Phase 2 of the process and must conclude by 16 October.  All outstanding issues will be referred to binding adjudication by the Labour Court with a ruling by 20 November 2009.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy with regard to the implementation of the Labour Court recommendations on the working arrangements of NCHDs and any difficulties that are envisaged with regard to staffing and rostering.</P>

	<P>My Department and the Health Service Executive have been preparing for some years for the possibility of an influenza pandemic being declared.  On receipt of the alert in April from WHO, that human cases of influenza type A(H1N1) had been identified in the USA and Mexico, my Department activated <Col N="793"/>the National Plan for pandemic influenza which was launched in January 2007.  The plan was accompanied by a Guidance Report developed by the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group which was further updated in April 2009 and this guidance is currently being followed.  In line with the plan the following governance structures were put in place:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), which manages the health system response to a public health emergency continues to meet as required.</P>

A public consultation, under the Act, took place in March 2009 where all interested stakeholders were invited to make submissions on the matter.  As part of that process the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), as the representative body of pharmacists, submitted a written submission and made an oral submission to Department officials.  In addition, 104 other written submissions were received largely from community pharmacists.  These submissions along with the other submissions received were analysed and considered before I made my decision on the restructuring of payments. </P>

        <P>The HSE has indicated that in 2007 total expenditure on taxis amounted to &euro;31,647,613; however it is not in a position in the time available to provide a breakdown of this amount as between patient transport and other types of use.  The Executive has indicated that of the total expenditure of &euro;28,623,328 spent on taxis in 2008, &euro;27,910,135 related to the provision of taxi transport for users of health services.  It has also stated that ambulances and their staff are prioritised for front-line emergency work and that the use of taxis for patient transport was considered to represent a more cost-effective solution when compared to direct operation of a transport fleet for this purpose.</P>
        <P>It is essential that the provision or funding of transport by the HSE for users of health services and, where necessary, by staff occurs in a rational and cost-effective manner and makes best use of the available resources.  The HSE conducted a review of Patient Transport Services in 2008.  Arising from this, it is working to ensure that where it is appropriate that service users are facilitated in this manner, the most efficient and effective arrangements are employed and that there is a consistent national approach.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 87 together.</P>
        <P>The Transformation Programme for the North East region has been informed by the Teamwork Report to the Health Service Executive (HSE) which demonstrated that the service configuration in the region was unsustainable.  A series of focused and necessary service changes are being implemented across the region.</P>
        <P>The transfer of acute medical care from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan is subject to a number of dependencies first being in place, including the development of an enhanced ambulance and pre-hospital thrombolysis service.  The recently opened medical assessment unit at Cavan will also support the transfer of services from Monaghan.  The timeframe for this transfer is currently under review by the HSE.</P>
        <P>A number of additional measures and service improvements are being implemented in the Cavan-Monaghan area which will assist Cavan General Hospital in dealing with patients from Monaghan when acute in-patient care is transferred.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed me that the new medical assessment unit (MAU) at Cavan General Hospital which began to receive patients on 30 March 2009 has, up to 21 June, assessed and treated more than 900 patients.</P>
        <P>This MAU is providing a fast track alternative for patients who require an urgent medical assessment.  I welcome the information received by my Department from the HSE that the average time it takes from when a patient presents to the MAU until decision to admit or discharge is 3.5 hours, down from seven hours when these patients would have previously been managed in the emergency department.  I am further informed by the HSE that 19 additional staff has been sourced-redeployed to provide the MAU service.  The MAU is also currently assessing, treating and discharging 30-40% of referrals on the day, which is demonstrating its effectiveness to-date.</P>
        <P>Space adjacent to the emergency department has been reconfigured to facilitate the development of the following units:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A 24 hour observation ward which opened on 30 March 2009 to accommodate all patients who require observation for a period of 24 hours.  This development will result in <Col N="797"/>increased capacity in in-patient beds which will improve care for patients as they will avail of a bed in a more timely fashion.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An admission unit also opened on 30 March 09 which will accommodate patients in an appropriate environment to await beds from the time of decision to admit is made until an in-patient bed is available.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Two permanent emergency department consultants have been appointed to Cavan General Hospital since 2007 and a third took up post in February 2009.  The changes proposed by the HSE, which I support, are for reasons of patient safety.  The HSE will continue to work with all stakeholders to bring about the improvements in a carefully planned way that puts patients first.</P>
        <P>My Department has requested the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on the further service matters raised.</P>

        <Quest>  if the primary concern of policy determined by her or the Health Service Executive is of an economic nature rather than the need to address the requirements of patients; if, as would appear from recent statements, there is a tendency to place the greater emphasis on the cost regardless of the need to deliver the full spectrum of services as required to the community; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that in other jurisdictions a major effort is made to eliminate administration associated with waiting lists and instead concentrate on delivery of services in the first instance thereby creating greater efficiency and patient care; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>My first priority is to meet the needs of patients in the safest and most effective way possible.  While we must achieve value for money at all times, there is no question of allowing cost considerations to take precedence over the safety and quality of services for patients.   As required by the Constitution, publicly funded health services must operate within the voted limits authorised by the D&aacute;il.   In the current economic environment, it is particularly important for all agencies to ensure that they provide their services within the budget allocated to them.  This will often require difficult decisions regarding priorities, a search for innovative ways of meeting the needs of patients and clients, and a rigorous approach to minimising administrative cost.  My Department will continue to work with the HSE, hospitals and other health care providers to achieve these objectives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The emergency ambulance service is an essential element of the health service and, since the establishment of the HSE, has been brought under a national management structure.  The service continues to be developed to <Col N="798"/>ensure that it can provide a safe, effective and efficient service to the population.  HSE ambulance staff are subject to Garda vetting and are trained in line with the standards set by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. HSE emergency ambulance vehicles purchased since 2002 (which make up the vast majority of the fleet) meet European Union CEN 1789 standards.</P>
        <P>Where the HSE contracts with private ambulance operators for the provision of particular elements of service, it requires such providers to pass a commercial evaluation process and standards to be satisfied in respect of personnel education and training, Garda vetting and vehicles used.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that standards, education and training in pre-hospital emergency care have been the subject of considerable development by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council since its establishment as a statutory body in 2000.  The council&rsquo;s principal functions involve the assessment and recognition of relevant education and training institutions; the setting of course content and conducting of examinations; assessment of professional qualifications obtained in other jurisdictions; the preparation of clinical practice guidelines and of standards for pre-hospital emergency care; recognition of pre-hospital emergency care service providers; the operation of a register of pre-hospital emergency care practitioners and of fitness-to-practise procedures.</P>
        <P>In addition to its significant work in the areas of education and training, the council has developed detailed Clinical Practice Guidelines and patient care reporting systems.  The work which the council has undertaken in respect of all areas of its remit has, I believe, led to a significant improvement in standards of pre-hospital care in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The functions of the Health Information and Quality Authority include the setting of safety and quality standards in respect of services provided by or on behalf of the HSE; public ambulance services therefore come within the scope of the authority.</P>

	<P>As Deputies are aware, my Office is continuing to work actively to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks that will ensure that a properly regulated regime of <Col N="799"/>adoption is in place in Ireland.  Our aim is to support and protect prospective adoptive parents and, even more importantly, the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided.</P>
        <P>The promotion of a child&rsquo;s best interests is the fundamental principle that not only supports the development of a national child care and protection system but also ensures that an ethical and child-centred approach to inter-country adoption is adopted and consistently pursued in Ireland.  Inter-country adoption does not occur in a vacuum &mdash; rather, it occurs across jurisdictions and spans complex areas of family law, child protection and welfare.  It must be legislated for, managed and understood in that context.  Inter-country adoption requires a shared responsibility and respect between States in order to ensure that the best ethical practices to support the interests of children, and to safeguard them against their abduction, sale or trafficking, are practised and upheld.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Adoption Bill, 2009, was initiated in the Seanad and has recently passed all Stages in that House.  The Bill will continue to be prioritised by the Government for its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that the Bill, which includes the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, for their families and for the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.  As such, it is the intention of the Government, as Deputies are well aware, that all inter-country adoption will now meet the standards of the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>I have reported in detail to both Houses on the situation regarding the reasoning for and actions taken to support the negotiation of a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in recent weeks.  This position has not fundamentally changed since my last statement on the matter.  The process has been on-going since the beginning of 2008 and the dialogue with the Vietnamese authorities is continuing.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies have, in recent weeks, sought guarantees on and specific timeframes for the conclusion of the discussions on a new agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  I must reiterate that all options, including an interim inter-country adoption agreement, are actively being pursued by the Government to finalise these discussions.  I must also stress the point that it is not possible for me to either give a timetable or anticipate when this process will be concluded.  The negotiations remain live and a request to set up an interim inter-country adoption agreement, which was issued to the Vietnamese authorities on 20 May last via the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been made.  It is now a matter for the Vietnamese authorities and, as such, it would be improper for the Government to seek to influence or interfere with their decision-making process.</P>
        <P>The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a sovereign state and the decisions that it makes regarding the internal regulation and management of its adoption services must be treated sensitively as appropriate to a sovereign state.  My priority is to conclude discussions with the Vietnamese Government on a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement and to avoid any debate outside of that process that could potentially jeopardise or interfere with these discussions.  In the meantime, my officials will continue to be in regular contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and with the Embassy on the ground in Hanoi.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the work to prepare for and advise the Government on a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has been given, and continues to be given, the very highest priority by my Office.  I remain completely committed to finalising discussions on the text of the agreement with the Vietnamese authorities.  I have explained the reasons for the renegotiation of the existing agreement and am <Col N="800"/>acutely aware of the stress and anxiety that this process has caused to many prospective adoptive parents.  I will be in Vietnam on the week commencing 29 June, the itinerary for which visit has been compiled with the assistance of the Irish Embassy in Hanoi.  I will issue a statement on the visit on my return from Vietnam.</P>
        <P>My Office has also been working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral inter-country adoption agreements with a small number of other countries from which Irish applicants have traditionally adopted &mdash; including the Russian Federation and the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</P>
        <P>While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the relevant authorities in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Governments of these sovereign States.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>A Standards Advisory Group was established by HIQA to develop National Quality Standards on Residential Services for People with Disabilities.  The group comprised officials of HIQA, my Department, the HSE, service providers, organisations representing people with disabilities and service users, and met on a number of occasions during 2008.  Following a public consultation process initiated by HIQA, the proposed standards were formulated and have now been published.</P>
        <P>These standards will provide a national framework for quality, safe services for people with disabilities in a residential setting and relate only to adult services at present.</P>
        <P>Given the current economic situation, to move to full statutory implementation of the standards, including regulation and inspection, presents significant challenges at this time.  However, notwithstanding the difficulties of immediate statutory implementation, my Department, the HSE and HIQA have agreed that progressive implementation of the Standards will now commence, and that they will become the benchmark against which the HSE assesses both its own directly operated facilities and other facilities that the HSE funds.  Further discussions will take place regarding the introduction of an appropriate level of external validation for relevant settings.</P>

	<P>An air ambulance service is currently provided by the Air Corps on the basis of a Service Level Agreement prepared by the Departments of Defence and Health and Children, in consultation with the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Air Corps, all of which are signatories to it.  This arrangement has operated successfully for a number of years. </P>
        <P>The air ambulance service is provided by the Air Corps for the following categories:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness,</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>Dedicated additional funding of nearly &euro;7 million has been invested to date in the development of cystic fibrosis services, resulting in nearly 50 additional staff, including consultant, nurses and allied health professionals, being appointed to centres across the country.  A further &euro;1.6 million is being provided this year to support services.</P>
        <P>St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is the national adult tertiary referral centre for patients with cystic fibrosis and treats over 50% of the adult population with the condition.  Refurbishment work took place last year in the hospital to provide eight single en-suite rooms for the exclusive use of people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>The next stage in the development of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital will involve the building of a new ward block to replace existing accommodation.  The new facility will include accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients with appropriate isolation facilities for the treatment of their condition.</P>
        <P>Clinical and infrastructural needs at St. Vincent&rsquo;s will determine the configuration of beds across various specialties.  There has been no upper limit placed by the hospital or the HSE on the allocation of beds to a particular specialty.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to ensure that the project is delivered without delay.  The HSE, in partnership with St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, have structured the tender for this development in such a way that payments for the works can be deferred towards the end of the construction period.  Tenders for this development will be issued shortly, which should result in the signing of a contract before the end of the year.  It is intended that the construction, equipping and commissioning of this block will be completed as early as possible in 2011.</P>

	<P>My Department issued a suite of three circulars to the HSE on 15 May 2009, which provided for the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (8/2009), the Incentivised Career Break Scheme (Circular 9/2009) and the Shorter Working Year (10/2009), as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Supplementary Budget Statement of 7 April 2009.</P>
        <P>The purpose of these circulars is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff employed, along with an associated restructuring of organisation and operations, in as timely a manner as possible and in line with the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector.  While the reduction in numbers achieved under these schemes is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer, this must be done in a way that does not undermine essential service provision.</P>
        <P>The schemes do not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector (Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians).  This is in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria will have access to these schemes, provided the grades/staff groups concerned co-operate with the requirements in regard to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of the schemes while still protecting services.  Because staff who retire under the schemes will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff co-operation and flexibility in that regard is essential.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the HSE that the majority of health service trade unions have recently issued a directive instructing their members not to co-operate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  The unions have stated their opposition to the moratorium on recruitment and promotions as set out in 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, referred to above.  This instruction from the unions severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  As a result, the HSE has suspended all three schemes.  However, I understand that applications can still be made to the relevant employer in anticipation of a resolution of the industrial relations issues.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that the HSE has had ongoing discussions with the health service unions about a range of issues, including redeployment.  However, I understand that these unions will not agree a redeployment-reassignment policy until the suspension of the above schemes is lifted.  Redeployment and reassignment are key management requirements for the Public Sector in the Partnership talks with the unions at national level.</P>

        <P>I am on record as saying that I am already convinced, based on the expert advice that I have received and considered, as to the important role a HPV vaccine programme would play as part of a cohesive response to cervical cancer.  All of the clinical advice available to me indicates that, in the context of the limited resources available, the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme should take precedence over the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme.  The National Cervical Screening Programme, CervicalCheck, is being implemented at a full year cost of &euro;43 million.  I am fully committed to keeping the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme under active review.  As with all childhood vaccines, an organised population based programme is the optimum means of delivery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, the current fiscal position demands the most careful control of public expenditure and the Government is strongly of the view that account needs to be taken of all opportunities for efficiencies.  I am very conscious of the need to make savings where possible without impacting on service levels and have consistently communicated this need to the HSE and other health agencies. </P>
        <P>As part of a multi-annual approach to value for money announced by the Minister for Finance in the context of the budget, a range of value for money measures has been outlined in the HSE National Service Plan 2009, of which consultancy is just one element.  In line with the Government decision on the matter of July 2008, the HSE is required to reduce expenditure on advertising, public relations and consultancy by at least 50% in 2009 as against 2007 expenditure levels.  I have requested the HSE to report on this under section 10(2) of the Health Act as part of the monthly Performance Monitoring Reports on the National Service Plan.</P>
        <P>It is critical that the HSE exercises the same level of prudence and scrutiny in relation to these costs, as is being required by the Government across the entire public sector.  The HSE has indicated that it is determined to achieve a significant reduction in management consultancy costs generally.</P>
        <P>With regard to advisers, the terms and conditions of contracts for these individual advisers are already public knowledge.  All payments made are for work done under the provisions of their contracts.  These advisers have reduced their fees by 10%, following the Government decision taken regarding the pension levy.</P>
        <P>My Department recently wrote to the Chairperson of the HSE Board about Performance Related Award payments.  While acknowledging that the role of the board in relation to these payments, it was also highlighted that no performance-related awards have been approved in <Col N="805"/>the Civil Service in respect of 2008, and that consideration is being given to the future position in relation to such awards in the public service generally.  Reference was also made to the exercise currently being undertaken by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in reviewing the levels of remuneration appropriate to the groups within its terms of reference, as this could possibly be relevant in this regard.  This letter went on to say that, in light of these facts and the current economic and budgetary difficulties, it would be appropriate that consideration of any bonus payments should be suspended by the HSE board, pending the issue of further guidelines from central government.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>In order to establish the levels of alcohol, smoking, and illicit drug use during pregnancy, a research team reviewed 125,945 maternal records spanning 1988 to 2005 held by the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital.  The results of the research, which was funded by my Department, were published in March 2007.  Subsequently, the Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer asked the Health Service Executive to consider the findings outlined in the report and to decide on appropriate actions which needed to be taken.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has entered into a new research project by way of a Service Level Agreement with the Coombe Women &amp; Infants University Hospital to:</P>
        <P el="5">(1) <Miles com="ix" />Evaluate the prevalence of alcohol exposure in pregnancy, the patterns of behaviour (social drinking, binge drinking, sustained heavy drinking) and the factors that influence whether or not a woman drinks alcohol preconceptually and during each trimester of pregnancy;</P>
        <P el="5">(2) <Miles com="ix" />Follow a cohort of woman who drink alcohol during pregnancy to evaluate the impact on the infant&rsquo;s condition at birth and subsequent development;</P>
        <P el="5">(3) <Miles com="ix" />Explore the health promotion opportunities in terms of advising women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy and breast-feeding.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This research project, which has a three-year timeframe is well under way.  A full systematic review of perinatal outcomes following alcohol exposure has been completed and is being documented at present.  The research initiative outcomes will enable the Health Service Executive, in consultation with key stakeholders, to develop clear protocols in respect of the diagnosis <Col N="806"/>and management of foetal alcohol syndrome/spectrum disorders.  In the meantime diagnosis and management of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is a matter for individual clinicians.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive would, therefore, encourage all clinicians providing pregnancy-related care to offer appropriate advice in relation to an individual&rsquo;s alcohol consumption on the basis that it is in the best interests of the baby for mothers to avoid alcohol consumption during pregnancy.</P>

<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P FLI="0">In accordance with the procedures to control public finances and the Health Act 2004 which established the HSE, the Executive must receive the sanction of the Minister for Finance before it may enter into new commitments in respect of the development of services.  This is provided each year after the publication of the Revised Book of Estimates and is given in accordance with strict provisions regarding the use of funds, in particular funds allocated to further enhance and develop services.  Should it arise, specific prior approval of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance must be sought for any proposal to spend any of this funding on any other purpose.  Furthermore, to facilitate a more transparent level of accountability this funding, with the exception of the funding for the Fair Deal initiative, is accounted for in a new subhead, B.17, in the Estimates for the HSE.  The funding for the Fair Deal initiative is contained within subhead B.16 which accounts for funding for long-stay residential care.</P>
        <P>As the finalisation of the Revised Estimates Volume and its publication was delayed due to the necessity for the Government to deal with the critical situation facing the public finances, the letter of sanction was issued to the Health Service Executive on 15 June 2009.  This sanction included approval to development expenditure in the areas of Cancer, Disabilities, the Innovation Fund and Immunisation, as set out above.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Fair Deal scheme, the Deputy will be aware that the legislation to provide for the scheme was only recently passed by the Oireachtas and sanction in relation to such expenditure will issue as soon as the necessary arrangements are in place to commence the scheme.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that development funding is subject to regular and detailed analysis by both my Department and the Department of Finance and I am satisfied that these mechanisms are <Col N="807"/>more than adequate to ensure that development funding is used for the purpose for which it has been allocated.</P>

        <Quest> the policy recommendations contained in the various reports commissioned by her in the past ten years which are being pursued including the Hanley Report, the Brennan Report and others; if segments or a combination of each or all of these reports constitutes health policy; the cost of each of the reports; if further reports are contemplated; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26403/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous Parliamentary Questions Nos. 139 and 140 of 21 May 2009 on this matter &mdash; over 200 reports have been commissioned by my Department in the past ten years.  This period has seen widespread reform, huge technological advances, service expansion and fundamental change in our health system.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible, given the large number of reports in question, to list all of the recommendations arising from these reports which have been or are being implemented.  The recommendations of the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service (the Brennan report), the Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing (the Hanly report) and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System (the Prospectus report) were key components of the Health Service Reform Programme which was announced by the Government in 2003.  The establishment of the Health Service Executive (by the Health Act 2004) consolidated what was then a multiplicity of different agencies within a single agency.  This was a core element of the reform programme arising from the recommendations of the Brennan report.  More recently, the Government decision of 8 July 2008 on expenditure measures across the public sector and the budget announcement of October 2008 set out the programme of rationalisation of agencies in the health sector.  A total of 15 agencies will be either amalgamated into a single body or integrated into existing bodies including my Department and the Health Service Executive.  It is intended that this process will reduce the number of health agencies from 34 to 18.  Work is under way at present within my Department on the preparation of legislation required to facilitate the rationalisation programme and to collate information from agencies under a range of headings to inform the process.</P>
        <P>The Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing (the Hanly report) made a number of recommendations including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the changes needed in non-consultant hospital doctors&rsquo; work patterns;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the need for a significant increase in the number of medical consultants;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the need for a revised contract for medical consultants;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reform of medical education and training; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reorganisation of acute hospital services.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Work is proceeding in relation to the Report&rsquo;s main recommendations.</P>
        <P>The commissioning of external reports is very much part of a modern and effective administrative system.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the costs of reports is set out in the tables below.</P>

	<P>Generic drugs are available in Ireland for many medicines.  In 2008, 18% of prescription items under the GMS scheme and 11% of items under the Drugs Payment Scheme and Long Term Illness Scheme were dispensed generically.  My Department and the HSE supports the increased use of generics where this is appropriate.</P>
        <P>In 2008, expenditure on proprietary drugs where there was an equivalent generic available under the GMS, Drugs Payment Scheme and Long Term Illness Scheme was &euro;227 million.  The HSE estimates that there is a price differential of approximately 10% between off-patent proprietary drugs and their generic equivalents.  This suggests that approximately &euro;23 million in savings per annum could be made if there were full substitution of products supplied under the GMS, Drugs Payment Scheme and Long Term Illness Scheme.  Greater savings would, of course, arise if the prices of generic products on the Irish market were to be reduced.  The <Col N="816"/>HSE is in discussion with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (AMPI) representing the generic manufacturers, to examine ways in which efficiencies in the generic supply chain can be passed on to the State and to consumers through lower prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A group, chaired by Dr. Michael Barry, and comprising representatives of my Department, the Health Services Executive and the Irish Medical Organisation, is currently overseeing the implementation of specific measures that would deliver more cost effective prescribing by GPs, greater use of generic preparations and quality prescribing indicators.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE are continuing to examine all aspects of pharmaceutical expenditure with a view to containing costs.</P>

I have asked this group to recommend the best ways to achieve this, within the level of resources available to health and to report to me and the Minister for Finance by April 2010. Specifically, I have asked the group:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the current resource allocation arrangements for health and personal social services;</P>

	<P>In January 2007, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring patient safety and quality in our health service, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the health care system.  The Commission&rsquo;s Report &mdash; <i>Building a Culture of Patient Safety</i>- was published in August 2008.  The Commission recommended that there should be a mandatory licensing system in Ireland to cover both public and private health care providers.  It further recommended that the licensing system should commence with application to the acute hospitals and other facilities based on analysis of potential risk to patient safety and that this list should include facilities where the following treatments are provided:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />medical treatment under anaesthesia or sedation</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />dental treatment under general anaesthesia</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />obstetric services</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />cosmetic surgery</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />other techniques/technologies such as laser and intense pulse light therapy, hyperbaric oxygen chambers, private dialysis, <i>In Vitro </i>Fertilisation and endoscopies and any other to be prescribed by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government recently accepted the Commission&rsquo;s report and approved the commencement of work on the drawing up of detailed proposals for legislation to give effect to its central recommendation on the licensing of both public and private health care providers.  This legislation will be complex and it is anticipated that the Bill will be published in 2011.  The Government also supported the  establishment of a Steering Group, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Children, to drive the implementation of all the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  This Steering Group has now been established.  Its first meeting took place on 4 June and it has begun its work on an overall implementation plan to be completed within 18 months of establishment.</P>
        <P>From 1 July, the Health Information and Quality Authority will be responsible for the registration and inspection of all residential care services for older people.  This means that for the first time, HSE operated centres and private nursing homes will all be subject to independent registration and inspection.  This is a significant step forward in the protection of the rights of older people living in residential care settings across the country.</P>

	<P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the important work which the Crisis Pregnancy Agency carries out will continue. There are a number of factors which will ensure that this happens.</P>
        <P>Part 6 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 specifies the functions of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency which are to transfer to the HSE. These functions include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the preparation of a strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in consultation with specified Departments of State and other appropriate persons;</P>

      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to produce periodic reports on progress and to propose remedial action where required;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to further the attainment of the objectives of the strategy by promoting public awareness, developing, promoting and disseminating information and informational material and by fostering the provision of education and training;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to draw up codes of best practice for consideration by agencies and individuals involved in providing services to women with crisis pregnancies;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to promote and commission research into aspects of crisis pregnancy, as considered necessary;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to furnish advice to the Minister to other Ministers of the Government on issues relating to crisis pregnancy and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to perform any other function in relation to crisis pregnancy that the Minister may assign.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The HSE is currently in the process of planning how best to integrate and carry on the work of the Agency within its structures.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is required to produce a service plan each year, specifying the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided. I will be laying a copy of the HSE&rsquo;s service plan before the Oireachtas each year as well as a copy of the HSE&rsquo;s Accounts and Annual Report.</P>

	<P>The Irish Human Rights Commission was requested some time ago by a patient advocacy group to conduct an inquiry into matters relating to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland from the 1950s up to 1983.  Having considered the matter in some detail the Commission decided against conducting such an Inquiry under the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000.</P>
        <P>The Commission recommended that I  review a previous decision not to establish an external review of the practice.  Significant efforts had been made previously by the Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer, via the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and through international contacts, to source a suitable reviewer.  Progress was made in identifying and sourcing a suitable candidate who later became unavailable due to work commitments.  However, the Survivors of Symphysiotomy, another patient support group, subsequently expressed reservations over the choice of reviewer.  Thereafter it did not prove possible to source an independent expert.  My Department remains in correspondence with the Commission in relation to the matter.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that in line with a recommendation from the Commission my Department has asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to consider the preparation of clinical guidelines covering the practice of symphysiotomy.</P>

        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme. F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In April&rsquo;s Budget &euro;6.6m was provided for 400 additional CE places bringing the total number of CE places to 22,700.</P><Col N="821"/>
        <P>This Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I am keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.</P>

	<P>Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a <Col N="822"/>statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee&rsquo;s job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Redundancy Section of my Department has on record an application from the individual concerned.  When an employer is not in a position to pay statutory redundancy entitlement, the Redundancy Payments Section requires proof of this.  The employer is asked, as happened in this case, to provide a letter from his Accountant or Solicitor confirming inability to pay together with documentary evidence (i.e Audited Accounts/Statement of Affairs) within a specified period.  Where an employer does not provide the information requested or refuses to pay within the agreed timeframe, the employee can take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer, seeking a determination of entitlement to statutory redundancy.</P>
        <P>The employer in this case has not, to date, provided the information requested by the Department and I understand that the individual was recently advised of his entitlements to take a case before the EAT and was provided with the necessary application form (T1A).  In the absence of the required information from the employer, the Department cannot process the individual&rsquo;s claim until a determination of the Tribunal is obtained.</P>

	<P>The issue raised by the Deputy has been before this House on several occasions in the past and it has been repeatedly confirmed in replies to previous questions that my Department was not a party to the allegations made against the individual involved in this case. The matter was also the topic of an adjournment debate in the Seanad on 19 June 2008.</P>
        <P>As previously outlined to the House in reply to Question No. 690 on 30 January 2008 from Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, as the project to which the allegations related was co-funded by the EU, the Department was obliged, when it was notified of the allegations in 1999, to notify the European Commission, in a Quarterly Communication of Irregularities required under Commission Regulations 1681/94 and 1831/94, that the matter was under investigation. This notification was issued (via the Department of Finance) on 26 August 1999.</P>
        <P>On 23 June, 2000, the individual&rsquo;s ex-employer wrote to the Department and confirmed that</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />an extensive investigation by their auditors had found no evidence of fraud and</P>
        <P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />the Director of Public Prosecutions had decided, on the basis of a file submitted by the Fraud Squad, that there were no grounds for action.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In previous replies to this House on the above, my predecessors have confirmed that neither they nor the Department had any issue or concern to pursue with the individual concerned who had been so advised in writing.  For the avoidance of doubt, I can again affirm this position.</P>
        <P>If it is helpful to the person concerned, I am happy to restate that the Department has over a period of some 20 years dealt with the individual in a variety of capacities. The contacts were always of the highest probity. The Department never had any evidence to suggest the contrary.</P>

	<P>My Department and F&Aacute;S have been working together over the last number of months to put in place measures to assist up to 3,600 apprentices who have been made redundant due to the current downturn.  A number of initiatives to assist such apprentices have been put in place to date:</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs immediately on registration refer redundant apprentices to F&Aacute;S for assistance.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Following this referral, the F&Aacute;S Employment Services and F&Aacute;S Services to Business Divisions work in collaboration to provide guidance and support in finding a new employer and in considering other options available in individual cases</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S has amended the scheduling rules for off-the-job training so as to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training, at phases 2, 4 and 6 of the apprenticeship cycle. It is expected that up to 2,000 redundant apprentices will in this way progress to such off-the-job training this year.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S introduced an Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme to provide support for employers to provide on-the-job training to redundant apprentices when they have released their employed apprentice to a scheduled phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training phase in the Institutes of Technology. There are currently 199 apprentices participating on the scheme and 35 apprentices have completed their period of rotation with assessments. Employers will again be requested during the June and September 2009 rotation periods to provide redundant apprentices with on-the-job training with assessments.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />L&eacute;argas have provided funding under the Leonardo da Vinci programme of the European Union to support the placement of 37 redundant apprentices with overseas employers to complete their phase 7 on-the-job training with assessments. Recently 19 redundant apprentices returned from Germany having completed a phase 7 placement with such employers.  Another 12 apprentices are due to travel in early August to more work place<Col N="824"/>ments in Germany. L&eacute;argas have recently provided additional funding to support the placement of an additional 60 apprentices with overseas employers.  Arrangements here are being advanced.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ESB Networks have agreed a programme with F&Aacute;S to provide on-the-job training to eligible redundant electrical apprentices at phase 5 and phase 7 of their apprenticeships. This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of eighteen months. ESB Networks will fund this programme. There are currently 100 redundant such electrical apprentices in employment with ESB Networks and a further 100  will be provided with an opportunity to complete their on-the-job training before the end-year.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses.  These are trade related to enhance their employable skills. They  may also avail of the range of trade related night courses that are available in F&Aacute;S training centres. </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Institutes of Technology are providing up to 700 places per annum on an 11-week certified training programme for those redundant apprentices who have completed their phase 4 training but where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available for them. The programme will be divided into construction and engineering streams and will provide redundant apprentices with education and training  in a number of trade areas that will be complementary to their core apprenticeship disciplines. The programme is expected to commence in September next.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Finally, F&Aacute;S is finalising plans that will allow redundant apprentices to undertake phase 7 assessments in situations where an on-the-job assessment opportunities do not at present exist.  This will allow such apprentices, who are at the very latter end of their multi-annual training programme, to definitively finish and get the craft certification that attests to having successfully completed their apprenticeships.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am closely monitoring the overall situation and I am open to positively considering any other approaches that will advance the progress of all apprentices to craft status at every stage of the apprenticeship cycle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the current challenges facing the motor industry, along with most other industries, arising from the impacts of weak world economic activity.  As the Deputies will be aware the Supplementary Budget announced the introduction of a VAT Margin Scheme for second-hand cars, with effect from 1 July 2009. Under the scheme, dealers would be taxed for VAT purposes on their margin (i.e. the difference between the prices at which the dealer purchased and subsequently resold a vehicle) in regard to second-hand cars they acquired and resold after that date. In conjunction with the introduction of the Margin Scheme, special transitional arrangements were to be put in place regarding second-hand cars in stock on the introduction of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Margin Scheme would have replaced the existing Special Scheme for second-hand cars, under which dealers/garages are entitled to immediate input credit for the residual VAT included in the price of a second-hand car acquired either through purchase or trade-in.  Under the Special Scheme, dealers, when they resell the car, are required to repay this VAT input credit or VAT based on the resale price of the car, whichever is the greater.</P>
        <P>Further discussions on the matter took place with SIMI and the motor industry decided, on balance, that it would not be in its overall best interest for the Margin Scheme to be introduced at that time. Consequently, the proposed Margin Scheme and transitional arrangements regarding existing stock of second-hand cars was not introduced in the 2009 Finance Act.</P>
        <P>There will be ongoing dialogue over the coming months with SIMI as to what measures might be introduced to assist the motor industry, particularly with regard to removing the current stock of second-hand cars held by dealers. I have no plans to introduce a car scrappage scheme at this time.</P>

	<P>Following the Government Decision re: Decentralisation in Budget 2004, it was decided that the provision of replacement space for the office in question would be provided as part of the Decentralisation Programme.</P>
        <P>Following lengthy negotiations with the Departments involved, including, inter alia, agreement on the Departments to be included in the overall Decentralisation process and where they would be located, significant efforts were made to acquire suitable sites in the region in question.  It was subsequently confirmed that it would not be possible to accommodate the new local office in question within the Decentralisation sites acquired for the region.</P><Col N="826"/>
        <P>Since that time, however, due to the impositions arising from the current financial climate, it has regrettably not been possible to pursue all accommodation requirements, and Departments have been asked to prioritise their most urgent and immediate accommodation requirements for the attention of my Office.</P>
        <P>While this requirement is not on the current list of priorities for immediate attention by this Office, it has been noted as an office where additional space may be required.  In that context, examination of the current accommodation has taken place to determine whether interim remedial works can be undertaken.  This Office is also examining the possibility of additional space within the State Portfolio, and initial contacts have also been made with Estate Agents and Developers in the area to determine what options are available in the current commercial office market.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Transfers <i>per se</i> are not covered by the moratorium on recruitment.  However, the deployment and management of their staff resources are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who advise me that transfers will continue to be based on the needs of the organisation which, in the context of the efficient management of their office and Government policy on public service numbers, may have an indirect impact on transfers.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Office of Public Works that there are currently in excess of two hundred (200) Clerical Officers who have applied through the Central Transfer List for transfer to the Office of Public Works in Portlaoise (not a decentralisation office for the Office of Public Works).  This list has applications dating from 1999.  I understand that this list is not managed centrally and would therefore contain the names of civil servants who may have already moved to other Departments with offices in the Laois/Offaly area.</P>

        <Quest> the value of contracts covered by EU procurement directives in view of the fact that economic and financial standing is one of the criteria laid down in the EU procurement directive for preselection of contractors tendering for building contracts; the scale of contract below which these EU criteria do not apply; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>An exact breakdown of the value of public works contracts above and below EU Directive thresholds is not available. However, statistics on public works contracts advertised in the Official Journal of the EU by Irish contracting authorities indicate a value of approximately &euro;3.5 billion for these contracts. This represents about 50% of the estimated total value of public works contracts. It is essential that contractors performing any public contract be of sufficiently sound economic and financial standing. The criteria used to determine the appropriate level of financial capacity must, of course, be proportionate and relevant to the needs of individual contracts. Contracting authorities have various means of obtaining the necessary evidence to satisfy themselves in regard to this, such as turnover, extracts from balance sheets, banker&rsquo;s letters and access to insurance in regard to professional indemnity, public liability and employer liability.</P>

	<P>The issue of licences for taxis is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport who has established the Commission for Taxi Regulation as an independent body, under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.</P><Col N="828"/>
        <P>By virtue of Section 34 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, the Commission is empowered to make regulations in relation to the licensing, ownership, control and operation of SPSVs. In the context of those regulations, the Commission specifies various conditions, one of which relates to tax clearance.</P>
        <P>By way of general comment regarding tax clearance, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the purpose of the scheme is to ensure that persons who:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Derive an economic benefit from a licence or permit, to conduct certain activities in the state, or from the receipt of public contracts, and/or</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Notwithstanding the purpose of the tax clearance scheme outlined above, all persons having a taxable income (from whatever source) are obliged to make a return of that income and pay any resulting tax liability to the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue has robust and effective compliance and collection systems in place to pursue those that fail to meet their statutory obligations in relation to the filing of Tax Returns and the payment of any tax due.</P>

	<P>While I support properly focused, clearly defined specific tax reliefs, such reliefs narrow the tax base and make general reform of the tax base that much more difficult.  A broad tax base is the price that must be paid to keep tax rates low and low tax rates benefit businesses generally in this country. Any proposal for new tax reliefs has to be considered in this context.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that many property-based tax incentive schemes were terminated by my predecessor, An Taoiseach, in Budget and Finance Act 2006, following a review of those schemes carried out by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005. In the Supplementary Budget in April this year, I announced the termination of most of the remaining property-based tax incentive schemes as part of a range of measures designed to broaden our tax base so that everyone makes a contribution to resolving our current fiscal problems. Capital allowance schemes for specialist palliative care units and child care facilities are the only general property-based incentive schemes now remaining without a termination date.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to introduce a tax relief scheme for the building of primary or secondary schools.</P>

	<P>A core Government objective is to free up lending on a commercial basis into the economy to support economic growth and a number of actions have been taken to achieve this objective.  In the context of the bank guarantee scheme and recapitalisation the banks have made important commitments to support business lending.</P><Col N="830"/>
        <P>A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February and took effect on 13 March. This code applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner. The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints. Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice. This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.</P>
        <P>In addition, as part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. Compliance with this commitment is being monitored by the Financial Regulator. Officials from my Department are also in regular contact with the banks concerned in relation to their progress on implementing these measures.</P>
        <P>My colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has recently set up a clearing group including representatives from the main banks, business interests and state agencies, which is chaired by officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The purpose of the group is to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions. Any questions on the clearing group should be directed to my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly. Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis. I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy which will inform future policy.</P>
        <P>The banks report that they are &ldquo;open for business&rdquo; as evidenced by their promotional and advertising material. The banks state that they have funds available for lending to businesses and have provided details on approval levels and amounts drawn down. They report a slowdown in certain areas which they say reflects a reduced level of demand. The review of credit availability will consider this aspect. The most recent Central Bank Monthly Statistics for May 2009 show that credit to non-financial corporates actually increased by &euro;225m month-on-month after two months of substantial falls.  While care is always to be taken when reading monthly data, this could be a positive indicator of credit actively being fed through the real economy and businesses.</P>
        <P>You may also be aware that my colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Commerce, Mr Billy Kelleher TD has commenced a series of regional meetings to discuss access to bank credit with key local stakeholders.	</P>

	<P>On the issue of the tax treatment of retirement gratuities for the Public Service, the position is that under statutory pension schemes and pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners there is no liability to income tax in respect of retirement gratuities or lump sums paid to members of such schemes on retirement. Provided individuals are members of such schemes and the lump sum payments comply with the relevant legislation and Revenue rules in this area, there is no liability to income tax on the retirement lump sums.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), which will be implemented from January 2010.</P>
        <P>The scheme will allow qualifying children to avail of a free pre-school place in the year before they commence primary school.  The scheme is open to all private and voluntary pre-school services which are notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) or registered with the Irish Montessori Educational Board (IMEB).  Sessional playschools will, normally, participate in the scheme by providing the pre-school year for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week over 38 weeks while full or part-time daycare services will, normally, participate by providing the pre-school year for 2 hours, 15 minutes a day, 5 days a week over 50 weeks.</P>
        <P>An annual capitation fee of over &euro;2,400 will be paid to participating services in return for the provision of a free pre-school year to each child.  Services will be paid in advance at the start of each term.  It is a condition of the scheme that the pre-school year is provided free of charge to parents in return for the capitation fee.  However, services may charge for additional services, including additional hours, dance classes, etc or snacks,  provided these are offered to parents on an optional basis and provided children not availing of an additional service continue to receive appropriate pre-school provision.</P>
        <P>As part of the preparations for introducing the new scheme, the Childcare Directorate of my Office recently wrote to almost 5,000 private and voluntary pre-school service providers in the State, inviting them to participate.  These included the pre-school service providers who are notified to the HSE or registered with the IMEB and also a number of other persons who have expressed an interest in establishing a pre-school service and participating in the scheme.  Application forms and other relevant information regarding the scheme were included in this correspondence and applicants are now returning forms to their local City or County Childcare Committees.  The closing date for response is 10 July 2009.  Details of the services applying for entry to the scheme are then forwarded to the Childcare Directorate in my Office, which will issue contracts setting out the requirements of the scheme and their associated terms and conditions.  Services will be approved entry to the scheme subject to them meeting and agreeing contractual arrangements.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the application process will be completed by the end of September 2009 and I understand that a list of participating services in each area will then be made available to each City and County Childcare Committee and parents of qualifying children will be able to contact their local Committee from that point to obtain details of local services entering the scheme.  Parents will then be in a position to enrol their children in participating services.  In many cases, parents will already have enrolled their children in a service from September 2009, and will pay fees until January 2010 when the scheme will come into effect.</P>

	<P>My Department is currently preparing the General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill to regulate the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons, and the use of donated tissue from living persons for the purposes of transplantation and research.</P>
        <P>A public consultation on the different types of consent for the donation of organs for transplantation after death took place between January and March of this year and more than one thousand submissions were received.</P>
        <P>A separate, but related, public consultation on the draft Proposal for the General Scheme of the Bill took place between April and May 2009. Submissions received are currently being analysed. The types of activities covered by the proposals include hospital post-mortem examinations and the use of organs and tissues for transplantation, research, anatomy and education.</P>
        <P>One aim of the draft legislation is to establish a legal framework for organ donation which can benefit patients through transplantation of organs. Consent/authorisation is the defining principle underpinning any of the specified activities involving human tissue set out in the draft legislation.</P>
        <P>Ireland already has one of the higher rates of organ donation, ranked seventh in Europe in 2007. All organ donation in Ireland is coordinated through the Organ Procurement Service, which is based in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
        <P>My Department is analysing all submissions received from the consultation process and aims to present the final General Scheme to Government for its approval in the Autumn.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006 &mdash; 2010 under which capital grant funding is made available to community and commercial childcare providers for the development of childcare facilities.</P>
        <P>I understand from Pobal, who administer grants on behalf of my Office, that funding totalling &euro;134,182 has been provided to the childcare facility in Lisnamult under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme  (CCSS ), which is implemented under the NCIP, to enable them to provide childcare to disadvantaged and low income families at reduced rates.</P>
        <P>I understand that the group referred to by the Deputy has applied for capital funding under the programme. With the economic downturn, Government expenditure &mdash;  particularly in the area of new capital commitments &mdash;  was reviewed earlier this year.  As a result, with the exception of a limited number of projects, it was necessary to inform all NCIP capital grant applicants, including the applicant referred to by the Deputy, that no further grants were being approved and that the programme was closed to additional applications.  Existing capital commitments will continue to be processed during 2009 and 2010.  The City and County Childcare Committees will be advised by my Office if and when additional capital funding becomes available to my Office in 2011 and 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement in the HSE which is provided for in Circular 8/2009 does not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</P><Col N="836"/>
        <P>Members of all  other grades who meet the eligibility criteria will have access to the ISER provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of the ISER while still protecting services.  Because staff who retire under the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard is essential.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the HSE that the majority of health service trade unions have recently issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  This instruction severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  However, applications can be made to the relevant employer in anticipation of a resolution of the industrial relations issues.  Talks are continuing on the issue and it is hoped that a satisfactory resolution will be found.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School year under the early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which will be implemented from January 2010.  The ECCE provides for a free pre-school year which will benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  This will, normally, consist of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week over 38 weeks or 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week over 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010.</P>
        <P>Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September of each year.  In January 2010, children will be eligible if they are aged between 3 years 7 months and 4 years 10 months.  Exceptions to the upper age limit will be allowed <Col N="837"/>where children are assessed by the HSE to have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.  As eligibility is determined by reference to age children who are outside the age limit in January 2010, and to whom the exceptions do not apply, will not be eligible to participate in the scheme.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that, with the exception of this year, the scheme will commence in September each year and the age range for eligibility will provide flexibility for parents to access the scheme at the most appropriate time for their child prior to commencing school.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has the operational responsibility for the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the 32 local health areas. However, under the HSE&rsquo;s 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the Executive&rsquo;s Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin. The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The PCRS is committed to responding to all queries from Oireachtas members and the wider public. Its phone number is 01-8647100.</P>

The briefing note was circulated by the IPU in response to my announcement of a series of measures, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to tackle the rapid growth in the cost of distributing and dispensing drugs in Ireland.  These measures are absolutely necessary for two reasons. Firstly, the cost of the community drugs schemes has doubled since 2002 to over &euro;1.6 billion in 2008: and fees and other income earned by pharmacists have doubled accordingly. Secondly, it cost an exorbitant &euro;640 million to get &euro;1 billion of drugs from the factory gate to the patient in the community in 2008. This has to be reduced.  Given the current financial circumstances of the country &mdash; indeed, in any circumstances &mdash; this growing level of cost is unjustifiable and unsustainable.</P>
        <P>Savings from the combined effect of these measures have been estimated at &euro;55 million for the remainder of this year and &euro;133 million on a full year basis. This is almost exactly what would have been saved if I had imposed an across the board 8% reduction in fees and retail mark-ups and re-imposed the reduction in wholesale mark-up to 8%, as attempted by the HSE last year. However, I have decided to achieve broadly the same level of reduction through a revised common fee structure for dispensing, a reduced retail mark-up, removal of the special payment for over-70s dispensing which is no longer appropriate given the changes in medical card eligibility arrangements, along with the lesser wholesale reduction.</P>
        <P>The approach I have taken addresses pharmacists&rsquo; concerns that the current GMS dispensing fee is inadequate and provides for a standard dispensing fee structure across schemes. This will benefit pharmacies serving remote areas and socially deprived communities.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE are continuing to examine all aspects of pharmaceutical expenditure with a view to containing costs. The potential savings identified by the IPU, apart from an amount relating to pharmacists&rsquo; dispensing fees, refers to items which are already being pursued. In regard to the greater use of generic medicines, the report of the group chaired by Dr Michael Barry made recommendations which are the subject of ongoing assessment by Departmental, HSE and IMO representatives. These include specific measures that would deliver more cost effective prescribing by GPs, greater use of generic preparations and quality prescribing indicators.</P>
        <P>In regard to the agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, a separate report published by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics in May 2009 has concluded that an estimated total of &euro;248.5 million will be achieved in savings due to off-patent price cuts, up to August 2010, when that agreement ends.  Finally, the HSE is already exploring options for greater efficiencies in the procurement of drugs under the High Tech Drugs Scheme.</P><Col N="839"/>
        <P>I am satisfied with the accuracy of the figures quoted above regarding the current costs to the state of drugs and medicines and also the impact the new measures announced will have. I do not propose to speculate on the calculations presented by other stakeholders.  However, if the Irish Pharmacy Union wishes to elaborate on the method by which it made its calculations, I will examine that fully.  The IPU has not identified what they believe the total amount their members earn this year from the HSE schemes through fees, mark-ups and discounts;  nor have they have they put such an amount in the context of the substantial growth in earnings under the schemes in recent years or in the context of total turnover of the sector.</P>

	<P>There is no legislation in Ireland that deals specifically with the area of Assisted Human Reproduction. The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction examined this in its report and considered a number of legal issues which, in the view of the Commission, would arise under the current law, including the issue of determining legal parentage of a child born to a surrogate mother, applications for guardianship and custody, adoption law and constitutional law.  The Commission&rsquo;s Report was referred by the Government to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department is developing an appropriate regulatory framework which would involve legislation for the area of Assisted Human Reproduction.  The work involves, inter alia, examining the approaches to regulation in other jurisdictions and considering the ethical and legal issues that arise.  It will also take into account the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on this area &mdash; when completed &mdash; and an expected judgment of the Supreme Court in the RvR (<i>frozen embryos</i>) case.</P>

	<P>The Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability Services makes provision for the development of  specific high priority disability services including the creation of additional residential, respite places and day care places each year between 2006 and 2009 for people with intellectual disability and autism and additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>In the period 2006 to 2008 over &euro;425m has been allocated to the HSE under the Multi Annual Investment Programme for disability services.  The Multi Annual Investment Programme, had by the end of 2008, provided for approximately:</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>In light of the current financial circumstances, no additional funding was allocated under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme in 2009. However, in Budget 2009 an additional &euro;20m was allocated for health and education services for children with special educational needs. &euro;10m of this allocation will be to the Health Service Executive (HSE), and &euro;10m to the Department of Education and Science, to enable the services provided to children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that carers who are looking after someone who is in need of support because of age, physical or learning disability or illness can apply for various allowances and benefits to support their families from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

	<P>Radiotherapy services will transfer from St. Luke&rsquo;s to St James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital as part of the implementation of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology and a Transition Team has been established to oversee developments.</P>
        <P>No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s.  However, I am anxious to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services. I understand that the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s are preparing a report on possible future uses of the site and facilities and I hope to receive a copy within the next few months.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the complete transfer of services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years. A partial transfer will occur in the last quarter of 2010.  In the meantime, additional linear accelerators were commissioned at St. Luke&rsquo;s last year in order to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here, including MRSA and C. <i>difficile, </i>continues to be a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>Ireland participated in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections in acute hospitals in 2006 which surveyed a number of hospitals in Ireland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales. This study revealed that the Republic of Ireland was shown to have the lowest prevalence rate of both HCAIs and MRSA when compared with England, Northern Ireland and Wales. In European terms, the rates of MRSA for Ireland are better than many of the South European countries but not as low as some of the Scandinavian countries.</P>
        <P>A National Surveillance system was established by the HSE to collect data and provide information to monitor HCAIs in our health system.  The number of MRSA blood stream infection for the past three years are &mdash; 588 cases in 2006, 536 cases in 2007 and 436 cases in 2008.  This shows a significant decrease of over 25% between 2006 and 2008.</P>
        <P>Since May 2008, C. <i>difficile </i>has become a notifiable disease and all cases now have to be reported to the relevant Department of Public Health.  This data is inputted into the National Computerised Infectious Diseases Reporting (CIDR) system, coordinated by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The number of notified cases from May to December 2008 was 1625 and 946 cases from January to June 2009 (this is in the expected range of 40 &mdash; 60 cases per week which is consistent with the results in the 2006 survey).</P>
        <P>In March 2007, the HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the period of the Plan the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>In order to introduce measures to aid in the reduction of antibiotic prescribing, education campaigns for healthcare staff and the general public around the prudent use of antibiotics commenced last year.  The HSE launched a three week awareness campaign in November 2008 to highlight the importance of using antibiotics properly.  This coincided with the first European Antibiotic Awareness Day.  The awareness campaign included radio ads and distribution of leaflets on the prudent use of antibiotics.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, over 30 new staff in posts of Senior Pharmacists, Senior Infection Control Nurses and Surveillance Scientists have been appointed specifically to enhance infection control.  Earlier this year, new environmental building guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments were published by the HSE.</P>
        <P>HIQA, since its establishment in 2007, has also taken significant steps in this area.  A core function of the Authority is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  In 2007, HIQA developed National Hygiene Standards and commenced a programme of audit against these Standards.  The Authority undertook a comprehensive inspection and review of hygiene in our acute public hospitals in 2007 and again in 2008.  The reports represent a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in HSE- funded acute care hospitals.  HIQA noted that the standard on front line services which was already very high in 2007 had been maintained in 2008 and that corporate governance was significantly improved.</P>
        <P>In May 2009, the Health Information and Quality Authority published their National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections to provide an overall <Col N="843"/>framework for health and social care providers to prevent or minimise the occurrence of HCAIs.  These Standards include all key areas of importance in the control of HCAIs namely governance, hygiene, microbiological services, antimicrobial resistanceand surveillance systems.  Six months will now be allowed for the development by the HSE of a self-assessment tool, gap analysis and implementation plan before HIQA commences its initial review.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There are difficulties in making a direct comparison between the 1992 and 2009 public health service employment figures because the methodology used to compiled this data has changed over the years.</P>
        <P>The increased expenditure has taken place in the context of major demographic change affecting both the size and the composition of the population. It is estimated that the population has increased by 13% since 2002. There are now 45,000 more persons over the age of 65 than there were in 2002 and fertility rates continue to increase and are significantly higher than any other country in Europe.  While increased expenditure was required to meet the increased cost of providing health services, particularly in the areas of pay and demand led schemes, it should be noted that since 2002 an additional of &euro;2.7 billion was allocated to strengthen and develop services, particularly in the areas of services for people with disabilities, services for older people and acute hospital care.</P>
        <P>The health status of the population has improved at an unprecedented rate.  In the decade up to 2006 Ireland had moved from a position where life expectancy was 2 years below the EU average to a position where it is now a year above it. The factors contributing to this achievement were reductions in mortality rates from diseases of the circulatory system and significant reductions in other causes of death such as cancer, accidents and infectious diseases. There has also been a marked decline in infant mortality which is now well below the EU average.</P>
        <P>While there are a number of contributing factors to the improvement in the health status of the population and the increased life expectancy, the significant investment in the health services in recent years has been a major contributing factor to these improvements and to closing the difference in health status with the best in Europe.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Service Plan 2009 which I approved in December contained a number of economic and cost avoidance measures for 2009 (in addition to a continuation of value for money measures from 2008).  Subsequently a range of potential exposures (some of which were identified in the National Service Plan) materialised.  Based on the best information available, a figure of &euro;540 million was arrived at following intensive discussions and a detailed examination by the HSE and my Department.</P>
        <P>The Government made significant decisions on spending, revenue raising and employment control in the Supplementary Budget.  The approach agreed as part of the Supplementary Budget when combined with the &euro;133 million in measures previously identified by the HSE and not affecting the National Service Plan left a potential shortfall of &euro;147 million to be addressed.  In April I approved a series of measures to address this potential shortfall and obviate the need to amend the National Service Plan.  The HSE is now implementing these measures in order to deliver the Service Plan within its existing allocation.</P>
        <P>The level of service originally planned by the HSE and set out in the 2009 Service Plan is continuing to be delivered. Indeed, in a number of areas planned service levels have been <Col N="846"/>exceeded so far this year.  Maintaining this level of performance will demand close attention to value for money and ongoing modernisation of service delivery in line with best practice.  With regard to budgetary and service reviews taking place on a county basis, I have referred the matter to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

The document was also placed on my Department&rsquo;s Website (www.transport.ie) and sent to a number of representative bodies and agencies.</P><Col N="848"/>
        <P>Currently, Transport Managers employed by firms are not allowed to engage in any other employment outside the transport firm, or to work as Transport Managers for other firms simultaneously. There are some minor exceptions where the Transport Manager is a spouse or partner of the operator.</P>
        <P>New EU legislation will permit Transport Managers to manage operations for up to four separate Transport Operators, providing the total number of vehicles managed does not exceed 50.  The consultation paper also proposed to allow Transport Managers to engage in other employment outside the Transport firm where the number of vehicles being managed is less than 50.  The amount of time that can be worked outside the transport firm will depend on the total number of vehicles being managed.</P>
        <P>The majority of the operators who responded in the consultation process are in favour of the proposed changes. It is expected that the forthcoming EU Legislation upon which the new Transport Manager policy proposals are based, will be adopted shortly.</P>

	<P>The integrated ticketing system in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) is being introduced on a phased basis, based on smartcard technology.  A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved.  The project is now firmly in the implementation phase.</P>
        <P>A smartcard has been available on all Luas services for some time. Smartcards have also been introduced by Dublin Bus in respect of a number of ticket products such as annual and monthly tickets, 5-day rambler tickets, and annual and monthly integrated bus and rail and bus and Luas tickets. The disposable smartcard is now being used by some 30% of Dublin Bus customers.</P>
        <P>Irish Rail will launch its interim smartcard for its DART and Dublin commuter services from late Summer, initially with staff testing, and then being rolled out to the public. The progressive roll-out of smartcards is in line with good practice internationally.</P>
        <P>Subject to successful in-house testing, the single smartcard system will be rolled out initially to a small number of customers for live testing of the Dublin Bus / Luas integrated annual ticket. The full roll-out will take place throughout 2010 on Dublin Bus, Luas and Irish Rail. This means that by end 2010, the Integrated Ticket smartcard will be available to the vast majority of public transport passengers in the GDA.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann will commence testing in 2010 with roll-out of its pilot phase planned for Q1 2011 on a number of its services. Private bus operators are expected to join the scheme over this timeframe.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;18.6 million has been paid out by the Exchequer on the integrated ticketing project since the inception of the project in 2002. This expenditure encompasses project management, design and development costs and operator contributions for the single smartcard.</P>

The Immigration Division of my Department has informed me that following the marriage, the Ghanian national (as a visa required national) should apply for a spouse of Irish national entry visa from the Honorary Consul of Ireland, PW Ghana Ltd, 10 Abidjan Avenue, East Legon, Accra, Ghana.  Further details are available from our website www.inis.gov.ie.</P>
        <P>Upon arrival in Ireland, the Ghanian national will need to register with her local Registration Officer and make a request for permission to remain in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national. It is a fundamental requirement that a non EU national seeking residency in the State on the sole basis of marriage to an Irish national resides in the same household and in a family unit with that Irish national. Consideration of such application will involve the provision of documentary evidence to support the application and may also involve an interview by the Immigration authorities of either or both parties.</P>
        <P>If a non EU national is granted permission to reside in the State on the sole basis of marriage to an Irish national, he or she is permitted to work in the State without the requirement of a work permit and to operate a business in the State without seeking further permission.

	<P>I have read the US Trafficking in Persons (TIPs) Report 2009 which was published by the US State Department recently.  The Report makes a valuable contribution to research in the area of human trafficking.  It sheds light on this modern day form of slavery and sets out the efforts countries are making to counteract these abuses.</P>
        <P>Insofar as human trafficking in Ireland is concerned the Government is committed to taking all possible action to offer protection to the victims of trafficking and to pursue those involved in this evil trade. The Report acknowledges that significant progress is being made in Ireland on the issue of human trafficking.  It should be noted that the situation is, in fact, better than that reflected in the Report as it (the TIPs Report) was prepared prior to the publication by me on 10 June, 2009 of the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland 2009-2012.  This Plan contains a comprehensive approach to all aspects of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>One of the main criticisms made in the Report relates to the lack of convictions in relation to trafficking in this jurisdiction.  It has to be borne in mind that the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act has only been in force since June 2008 and investigations into suspected trafficking are inevitably complex.  Since then 65 persons have being considered as potential victims of trafficking under the provisions of this Act.  The potential of such persons to be victims of human trafficking is based on an allegation which has been made and not on evidence dis<Col N="850"/>covered in the course of the investigations concerned.  When the investigations are complete an investigation file will be prepared and submitted to the Law Officers for consideration as to what charges, if any, are to be preferred, on the basis of the evidence adduced in the course of the investigations.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum in the State on 17 November 2004.  Her two children were included in her application.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The person concerned then lodged Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court challenging the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that she not be declared to be a refugee.  Following the resolution of these Proceedings, the person concerned was afforded a fresh consideration of her asylum claim by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. This further consideration took place but again the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  The person concerned appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal who affirmed the earlier recommendation. </P>

	<P>Human Trafficking is a form of modern day slavery which has no place in Irish society.  An extensive range of legislative and administrative measures have been taken and are planned to address this issue. Many of these are set out in the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Human Beings which I published on 10 June 2009.  The measures include the following:</P><Col N="856"/>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P el="10">1. <i>Legislative measures</i></P>
<P el="0">Under the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996 it is an offence for an Irish person or a person ordinarily resident in the State, to commit a sexual act against a child in another country which is an offence in that country and if committed in the State, would be an offence under the Schedule to that Act.  In such circumstances, the person can be charged with the offence in this country.  The offences listed in the Schedule (as amended) are carnal knowledge, rape, buggery and sexual assault offences. The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 makes it an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into, transit through, or exit from Ireland of a child for the purpose of the child&rsquo;s sexual exploitation or to provide accommodation for the child for such a purpose while in Ireland.  It is also an offence to take, detain or restrict the personal liberty of a child for the purpose of the child&rsquo;s sexual exploitation, to use a child for such purpose or to organise or knowingly facilitate such taking, detaining, restricting or use.  Recent amendments to the Act have increased its scope.  Section 1 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 amends the 1998 Act by extending the definition of a child from a person under the age of 17 years to a person under the age of 18 years.  The maximum penalty on conviction is raised from 14 years to life imprisonment.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 provides for offences of trafficking in children and adults for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.  The State automatically accepts jurisdiction when the offence is committed in the State, including on ships or aircraft registered in the State.  The Act also provides that if an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident in Ireland is alleged to have committed a trafficking offence abroad the State will accept the jurisdiction to try the offence here.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment and a fine apply in respect of these offences.  Under Section 5 of the Act it is an offence for a person to solicit sexual services from a trafficked person where the person soliciting knows that the person has been trafficked.  The soliciting can take place anywhere &mdash; in public or in private.  Any person who accept or agrees to accept a payment, right, interest or other benefit for the prostitution of the trafficked person will also commit an offence.  Fines of up to &euro;5000 and 12 months imprisonment apply on summary conviction and an unlimited fine and up to 5 years imprisonment applies if a person is convicted on indictment. </P>
<P el="10">2. <i>Other measures</i></P>
<P el="0">Other measures include a national awareness raising campaign in October 2008, ongoing training for law enforcement and other key personnel in the public sector, education campaigns in schools, articles in journals etc aimed at particular sectors likely to encounter suspected victims.  In 2008, my Department arranged for funding from the budget of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy for Ruhama to make a 3 minute film and a 50 second advertisement designed to educate persons to the exploitation underpinning the commercial sex industry and to help address the demand side of sex trafficking.  The 50 second advertisement was launched on 10 November 2008 and was aired on RTE and the sports television station, Setanta. Measures to deal with prostitution include the following:</P>
<P el="10" LI="1">1. <i>Legislation</i></P>
<P el="0" LI="1"><Miles com="ix" />Under section 7 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 it is an offence for any person to solicit or importune another person in any street or other public place for the purposes of prostitution.  A person solicits or importunes where he or she offers his or her services as a prostitute to another person, solicits or importunes another person for the <Col N="857"/>purpose of obtaining that other person&rsquo;s services as a prostitute, or solicits or importunes another person on behalf of a person for the purposes of prostitution.  In exploitative situations, where the person being solicited or importuned has been trafficked, the offence of soliciting or importuning can be committed in any place, public or private. </P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="ix" />The criminal law governing prostitution is kept under continuing review in my Department and, in that context, one area of the law that has been identified as requiring change is where a person engages in sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under 18 years in exchange for money or some other consideration.  Legislation that will criminalise such behaviour in any place is being prepared in my Department.</P>
<P el="10" LI="1">2. <i>Garda operations</i></P>
<P el="0" LI="1"><Miles com="ix" />I am informed by the Garda authorities that initiatives are put in place on a regular basis by Divisional and District management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na targeting offences relating to prostitution, including brothel-keeping and living off the immoral earning which are targeted as part of investigations into organised criminal activities, including the advertising of escort agencies.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="ix" />Human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and particularly the overlap between human trafficking and prostitution is a complex issue involving many factors.  The Sexual Exploitation Working Group comprising of Governmental, non-governmental and International organisations. which is chaired by my Department, are tasked with examining and making recommendations on legislative, administrative, educational, social, cultural and other measures which (i) impact on and (ii) discourage demand for sexual services of victims of trafficking.  I will consider what action is necessary in the light of the outcome of those deliberations.</P>

	<P>Measures for the protection and support of victims and potential victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation are set out in detail in the National Action Plan To Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Human Beings which I published on 10 June 2009.</P>
        <P>Measures include the administrative immigration arrangements introduced on 7 June 2008 providing for recovery and reflection periods and periods of temporary residence pending the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The administrative framework provides for a period of recovery and reflection of 60 days in the State for suspected victims of trafficking.  In circumstances where the person wishes to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any investigation or prosecution in relation to the alleged trafficking, a further six months period of residence, renewable, is provided to enable him or her to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 10, 11 and 12 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 provide protective measures for alleged victims in court proceedings for an offence under the Act.  Under Section 10 the Judge may decide to exclude all persons other than officers of the court or persons directly concerned with the proceedings from the court &mdash; but announce the verdict, decision and the sentence (if any) in public. This is intended to protect trafficked persons who can be very vulnerable and traumatised and the traffickers and their criminal associates may wish to <Col N="858"/>harm them or prevent them from giving evidence.  It is an offence under Section 11 &mdash; with a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment and an unlimited fine &mdash; to publish or broadcast any information which could identify the alleged victim of the offence. Provision is also made &mdash; in Section 12 &mdash; to allow an alleged victim of trafficking to give evidence through a live television link, with the leave of the Court in the case of adults, from either within the state or abroad.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated a Witness Protection Programme since 1997.  Given the highly confidential nature of the programme specific details of the nature of its operation are not made available but some of the protection measures provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the existing programme include armed protection if necessary, provision of a new identity, financial support and relocation, which may include relocation to another country, if necessary.  The use of this programme for a suspected victim or witness in a human trafficking case is an operational matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The Legal Aid Board will provide legal aid and legal advice to potential and suspected victims of human trafficking through the Refugee Legal Service with effect from 20 July 2009.</P>
        <P>Other measures of assistance such as accommodation, medical treatment, counselling have been put in place and they and other services continue to be developed by my Department, in conjunction with Governmental and non-governmental organisations.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 came into force on 7 June, 2008.  This legislation creates offences of trafficking in adults and children for the purpose of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.  I am informed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the incidents are being closely monitored by them with a view to responding to any trends or patterns that may emerge.  Prior to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 the facilitation of the entry into the State of a person was dealt with under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  That Act does not specify an offence of trafficking for sexual exploitation.  At this time there is no evidence to indicate an increase in sex trafficking into Ireland but the trends and patterns will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>The Garda Policing Plan for 2009, which reflects the priorities set for the Force by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  One of the strategic goals identified in the Plan is to reduce significantly the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in communities. </P><Col N="859"/>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that public order hot-spots in the Clare Division have been identified and Garda personnel are deployed on specific initiatives which concentrate on the enforcement of legislation relating to anti-social behaviour.  A policing initiative, targeting public disorder, minor assaults and other anti-social type behaviour, has been put in place in Ennis, with particular emphasis on weekends.  This initiative has been enhanced by the recent introduction of a Garda CCTV system in the town centre.  A community based CCTV system has also recently become operational in Kilrush.</P>
        <P>There are a range of crime prevention initiatives in operation in Clare Garda Division.  These include two Garda Youth Diversion Projects, operating in Ennis and Kilrush, which are funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service.  Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project.</P>
        <P>There are 18 Neighbourhood Watch Schemes in operation in the Division, with each scheme a partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public.  There are also 27 Community Alert groups in the Division.  The Community Alert Programme, which receives funding from my Department, is a response to crime in rural areas and is a partnership between Muintir na T&iacute;re and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, three Business Watch Schemes are in operation in the Division which create an axis of communication and awareness of crime prevention within the business community and thereby provide a framework within which the business community can make a significant contribution to the prevention and reduction of crime and anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>A full-time Crime Prevention Officer (CPO) is based in Ennis Garda District, with responsibility for the Division.  The CPO liaises with the Garda National Crime Prevention Office and provides advice and support to members of the public and the business community on technical crime prevention issues.  The CPO has also been trained as a Crime Prevention Design Advisor, enabling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make recommendations to communities and local authorities on design in the built environment in areas which may be prone to anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I am assured that local Garda management are committed to the prevention and detection of anti-social behaviour.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt with appropriately, including by juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge notices or initiating criminal proceedings.  Any persons found engaging in such behaviour will continue to be dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.  The management of local authority housing, including transfers of existing tenants, is a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that there are a number of initiatives in place to assist employees to return to full-time employment following a work related incident.  These initiatives include:- the Employee Assistance Programme; the Critical Incident Protocol; and Medical Assistance Support.  The Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) is a civil service wide support programme which is designed to assist employees with personal difficulties.  The programme provides a confidential service including information and support to staff who are <?oasys _dc18- ?>experiencing difficulties.  The EAP in the Irish Prison Service has three full-time Employee Assistance Officers (one Senior and two Welfare Officers) supported by 32 part-time Staff Support Officers who perform these duties at local level in addition to their prison duties.  I am informed that the Officer referred to by the Deputy was made aware of the availability of this Service.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has a Critical Incident Protocol which seeks to ensure that any employee who has been exposed to assault, trauma, injury or fatality in the course of their duty receives appropriate and timely support, including access to a clinical psychologist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Medical Assistance Support includes referral to the Chief Medical Officer.  Officers who absent themselves on sick leave for a period of four weeks are referred to the Chief Medical Officer for medical prognosis.  Furthermore, all prison grade staff have access to a range of therapeutic services, including psychiatric and psychology services.  Referral to any particular service is on the basis of assessed need.  The Officer concerned was referred to the Chief Medical Officer and was facilitated with a number of follow up appointments.</P>
        <P>In the event that an Officer is certified by the Chief Medical Officer as unfit to carry out the full range of duties, every effort is made by the Prison Governor to identify a suitable position for that officer.  The Deputy will appreciate that it may not always be feasible to accommodate officers with less onerous tasks in a front line operational service.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the Officer concerned is not certified as being unfit to carry out the full range of duties.  Local management has made every effort to support the officer in his return and continued attendance at work by facilitating him with alternative duties where operationally possible.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the Reply given to his Parliamentary Question No. 164 on Tuesday 14 October 2008.  The status of the persons concerned remains largely as set out in that Reply.  However, in the interim, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the second named person by her legal representative and lodged under cover letter dated 23 March 2009.  In response to this application, a letter issued on 9 June 2009 advising that the person concerned was not automatically entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicant was advised that she could seek the exercise of Ministerial discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 by making further representations identifying any new facts or circumstances which demonstrated a change of position from that at the time the Deportation Order was made on 5 August 2004. No representations have been received to date in this regard.  </P>
        <P>The persons concerned have continued to meet their presentation requirements with the Garda&iacute;.  The first named person was due to present himself again at Anglesea Street Garda <Col N="861"/>Station, County Cork on Monday 29 June 2009.

        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 March 2009, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

	<P>The first and second named persons concerned, a husband and wife, arrived in the State on 21 October 2008 and applied for asylum.

        <P>The second named person accompanied by, her daughters, the third and fourth named persons, applied for asylum in the State on 14 February, 2007.  Her daughters were included in her application for asylum.  The asylum application of the second named person was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The person concerned lodged an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court were then initiated challenging the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that she not be declared a refugee.   However, she later withdrew both the Judicial Review Proceedings and her appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the second named person was notified in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) by letter dated 12 March, 2009, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her two daughters.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her two daughters should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

        <P>The fifth and sixth named persons are twin sons of the first and second named persons.  They were born in the State on 29 June, 2007.  The fifth and sixth named persons were notified by separate letters dated 6 May, 2009 that, as persons who had no legal entitlement to be in the State, the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Separate represen<Col N="863"/>tations have been received on behalf of both persons concerned and will be fully considered before the files are passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The permission to remain in the State of the person in question expired in July 2007.</P>
        <P>An application on behalf of the applicant for residence in the State, on the basis of her marriage on 26 September 2008 to an Irish national was received by the Immigration Services Section of my Department on 30 April 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Applications of this kind, in fairness to all other such applicants, are dealt with in strict chronological order and currently take six to nine months to process.  It should be noted that marriage to an Irish national does not confer an automatic right of residence in the State.</P>
        <P>The applicant was advised by my Department by letter dated 21 May 2009 that all the pages in her passport were full and that she should obtain a new passport. The applicant does not require authorisation from my Department to travel outside the State to renew her Thai passport.  As the applicant&rsquo;s passport is full, my Department cannot at this time consider any application for an entry visa to facilitate her return from outside the State.  When the applicant gets her renewed Thai passport, she can apply for an entry visa in the normal manner.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate the granting of post release supervision orders is entirely a matter for the Courts who are independent in the exercise of their functions.  However, the supervision of those orders is the responsibility of the Probation Service of my Department and in that regard I can advise the Deputy that:</P>
        <P>Section 28 of the Sex Offender Act, 2001 requires a Court to consider the inclusion of a period of post release supervision when sentencing an offender on conviction of a scheduled sexual offence under the Act.</P><Col N="864"/>
        <P>Section 29(1) allows the Court to impose a sentence comprising of a sentence of imprisonment followed by a period after release during which the offender will be under the supervision of a probation officer.  Section 29 also requires the offender to comply with any conditions of supervision specified in the sentence.</P>
        <P>Section 33 designates non-compliance with conditions of supervision as a summary offence prosecutable in the District Court.  Section 33 was amended by Section 13(c)(4) of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, to allow for the prosecution of such a summary offence by a probation officer.  To date, no offender has been convicted under Section 33 of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 as amended.</P>
        <P>At any one time, there are approximately 100 convicted sex offenders on post-release supervision orders being supervised by the Probation Service in the community.  Probation officers supervising these offenders work closely with the Garda&iacute; and other partner agencies to ensure the cooperation and compliance by the offender with supervision, in the interests of community safety.  In conjunction with the Garda&iacute; and others probation officers, by and large, successfully engage with the offenders concerned and ensure their compliance with supervision through ongoing motivation and monitoring.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently reconfirmed its commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, Co. Dublin.  The revised plans for Thornton Hall prison aim to protect the taxpayers&rsquo; interests while, at the same time, providing modern, regime focused and operationally efficient accommodation to replace the Mountjoy prison complex in the shortest possible timeframe. </P>
        <P>It is intended that the new prison will be built on a phased basis.  Phase one involves the provision of essential preliminary work required to facilitate the development such as the construction of a dedicated access route, services and perimeter wall.  The preliminary works in phase one of the project will be procured on the basis of separate contracts to the main prison development.  Work is expected to start on this phase towards the end of this year or early next year.  This phase of the project does not include the provision of prison places.</P>
        <P>It is expected that an EU wide tender competition for the main prison buildings will be launched early next year.  The objective is to complete the procurement process for the main prison buildings while the construction of phase one is underway thus enabling construction of the main prison buildings to commence immediately after contract award.</P>
        <P>The construction of the main prison buildings should take no more than three years from the date of the signing of a contract.  The new prison at Thornton will have a capacity of 1,400 in single occupancy cells but with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,080 prisoners, thus future proofing the development.</P>
        <P>Estimates as to the costs involved are commercially sensitive and releasing information as to estimated costs would prejudice the procurement process.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that, in addition to the 1,400 new prison spaces provided since 1997, a new block in Castlerea Prison, which accommodates over 100 prisoners, has recently opened.  Moreover, an additional 300 new prison spaces are also due to come on stream very shortly: a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will accommodate approximately 150 prisoners is due to <Col N="866"/>open by the end of July and a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will accommodate 150 prisoners is due to open in September.</P>

Equality Tribunal posts are also due to relocate to Portarlington and an advance move of 8 Tribunal staff to Portlaoise has taken place.  The Equality Authority has a decentralised office in Roscrea with 16 administrative staff, including one officer who has been offered a position and is awaiting transfer on return from term time.  As with decentralisation plans for other Government bodies, the question of the decentralisation of further staff of the Equality Tribunal and Equality Authority will be reviewed in 2011.</P>
        <P>I should mention that my Department maintains separate transfer lists in respect of civil servants who have expressed an interest in transferring to regional offices of the Department&rsquo;s Probation Service, which are not covered by the decentralisation programme.  Further information in relation to these transfer lists, which are due to be updated, can be provided to the Deputy on request.</P>
        <P>As transfers involve redeployment of existing staff, they are not directly affected by the moratorium on recruitment.  The moratorium does, however, affect the filling of vacancies created by transfers in cases where no replacement is readily available.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme announced in 2003, 125 posts attached to the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs were to decentralise to Limerick. The Division is the Headquarters of Irish Aid. Following sanction of an additional 20 posts by the Department of Finance in 2005, the total number of posts attached to Irish Aid Headquarters increased to 145. Of these, 138 have now decentralised, based in the new Irish Aid Headquarters building in Limerick, which opened in November 2008.</P>
        <P>The principal costs associated with the decentralisation relate to accommodation. This is a matter for the Office of Public Works.

        <P>Staff of the Department based in Limerick who have to travel abroad on official business, use Shannon, Cork or Dublin Airports, as appropriate. An estimate is not available of the costs which would have been incurred on such travel had Irish Aid Headquarters not been decentralised from Dublin. In relation to travel within the State, there are ongoing travel and subsistence costs associated with travel on business by officials between Limerick and Dublin.

	<P>As I have stated in this House on many occasions, and most recently in my reply to Question 154 of 25 June, the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories represents a primary impediment to the two-State solution. It both prejudges the outcome of final status negotiations and undermines the fundamental viability of a Palestinian State. I also firmly believe that it weakens the standing of moderate Palestinian leaders and plays into the hands of extremists on both sides. These are points that both I and my officials have made directly to the Israeli authorities.</P>
        <P>Within the context of the EU, Ireland has long been among the most active Member States in ensuring that we convey our serious concerns about settlement expansion to the Israeli Government at every opportunity. The EU has made it very clear to Israel that settlement construction in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law. At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 15 June, the EU called again on Israel to end all settlement activities and dismantle settler outposts.</P>
        <P>It is significant that the United States has now powerfully supported the EU&rsquo;s longstanding demand for an immediate end to settlement construction and expansion. President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have both been quite clear on this point, calling for settlement expansion to cease, including so-called &ldquo;natural growth&rdquo; within existing settlements.  The international Quartet &mdash; the EU, UN, US, and Russia &mdash; also made it clear in their statement in Trieste on 26 June that Israel must freeze all further settlement activity. This is further evidence of the international consensus that now exists on this issue.</P>
        <P>The planned settlement expansion the Deputy refers to &mdash; the authorisation of the construction of hundreds of new homes at the Jewish Settlement of Talmon in the West Bank &mdash; is <Col N="868"/>therefore particularly disappointing. While I hope it is not the case, it suggests that Israel is not prepared to heed the calls of the US or the rest of the international community when it comes to settlements. It also has a direct, negative impact on the already difficult political process, further alienating the moderate Palestinian leaders who are finding it increasingly difficult to defend the merits of peaceful engagement with their Israeli counterparts.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, Israel must decide whether it is prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed for peace. I welcome the fact that direct discussions are continuing between the US and Israeli governments on how to give effect to the clear US call for a freeze on all settlement activity. While agreeing a freeze on settlement building will undoubtedly prove a difficult issue for Prime Minister Netanyahu&rsquo;s coalition government, in the long term it represents the first step towards an agreed solution that will allow Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side in peace and security.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every applicant for an Irish passport must first establish that he or she is an Irish citizen. The passport application referred to by the Deputy was submitted on behalf of the child in question by his parents to the Passport Office on 10 January, 2007. As the applicant was born in Ireland in 2006, his application was considered under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004. This Act provides that persons born in the State after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside without restriction in the State or in Northern Ireland, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for 3 years of the 4 years preceding their birth.</P>
        <P>In the case of applications for passports arising from the terms of the 2004 Act, it is the practice of the Passport Office to seek evidence of lawful residence in the State by one or both parents. The types of evidence considered are immigration stamps in passports and Garda National Immigration Bureau cards and registration books. The evidence submitted showed that the child&rsquo;s mother had accrued 1,021 days reckonable residence in the four year&rsquo;s prior to his birth. As this fell short of the 1,095 days required, the residency requirement was not met and the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship was not demonstrated. Accordingly, his passport application could not be approved.</P>
        <P>The Passport Office wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s parents on 18 January, 2007 to advise them of its decision and the reasons behind it. They were requested to furnish further evidence of their claimed period of three years reckonable residence.  Further passport applications were forwarded on behalf of the child on 19 December 2008 and on 12 May 2009. Unfortunately, neither of these applications provides any additional evidence of reckonable residence by his parents. These applications will be cancelled and the fees refunded.</P>
        <P>My Department will retain the photographs from the most recent application and associate these with the original application made in 2007. It remains open to the applicant&rsquo;s parents to pursue his application for a passport by submitting further evidence of reckonable residence. Should they require any assistance in this regard, they should contact Mr Kevin Walzer of the Passport Office at (01) 673 3215 or by e-mail to kevin.walzer@dfa.ie.</P>

The decentralisation to Limerick of the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is the Headquarters of Irish Aid, was completed in November 2008. My Department is provided with details of officers who have applied for transfers through the Central Applications Facility (CAF) and who have expressed a preference to work in Limerick.  It is possible that other officers in my Department may have submitted applications for transfer to locations other than Limerick. However, there is no obligation on such officers to inform the Department that they have applied for a transfer to another location through the CAF. </P>

	<P>The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) is a series of measures that are designed to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion.  The programme is implemented locally by 37 Integrated Local Development Companies and 17 Urban Partnerships.  These are not-for-profit companies that target the areas of greatest need in the country, to provide an area-based response to long-term unemployment and to promote social inclusion.</P>
        <P>Pobal manages the programme on behalf of my Department. LDSIP allocations are made by Pobal based on a number of factors including the size/population of the catchment areas of the local development company, the proposed annual programme of activity of each company, and the deprivation index for the catchment area. My Department approves the broad approach adopted by Pobal. Similar factors were taken into account in calculating appropriate reductions in companies&rsquo; allocations to reflect the provisions of the supplementary budget.</P>

	<P>The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP), operated jointly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and F&Aacute;S, is the main welfare to work measure for jobseekers. The NEAP process is fundamental to addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register. It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by F&Aacute;S. Under the plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to assisting them enter or re-enter the labour market. The referral capacity under the plan has nearly doubled for 2009 from 6,500 cases per month to 12,250.  Claims for jobseeker payments are processed in the Department&rsquo;s local offices.</P>
        <P>Each claimant for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is given an information sheet when they make their claim that, among other things, lists the range of employment support services operated by the Department. This includes the back to work enterprise allowance, the short-term enterprise <Col N="873"/>allowance and the education allowance scheme. The relevant information and booklets are also available in each of the Department&rsquo;s local offices.  Details of the schemes are provided on the Department&rsquo;s website and also on the websites of the Community Information Service and other relevant websites. In May 2009, a mailshot was issued to 51,000 people under 25 on the live register advising them about education supports available to them.</P>
        <P>Jobseekers claimants are also advised about the Department&rsquo;s facilitator service which is available to help a claimant to explore the range of work and educational options available. The Department&rsquo;s facilitator service has been increased from 40 to 60, with a further ten facilitators currently being appointed. Facilitators are working closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at national and local level to identify appropriate education, training and development opportunities.  In addition, the frontline staff of the Department dealing with customers provide information on a range of issues and would normally advise customers of progression opportunities available. Frontline staff are supported by employment support section who act as a central support unit.</P>
        <P>The Government has devoted significant resources to the back to work enterprise allowance and the back to education allowance over the years. In view of their important role in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers, the Department continues to promote the schemes through all the channels at its disposal. In the light of the unprecedented increase in the live register in the last year and the associated increase in the number of claims to be processed, the capacity of local office staff and the general inspectors to undertake control activity has been curtailed.</P>
        <P>Control of schemes, however, is an integral part of the activity of all staff, including facilitators whose main role is activation. To support the ongoing programme of control activity, proposals are being developed to integrate the control of high risk cases into the activation programme. The Department will continue to monitor all activity and target its resources to maintain a balance between customer service and control.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
        <P>The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s payments &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that <Col N="874"/>self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these people enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution. Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseekers Allowance by satisfying certain conditions including a means test.</P>
        <P>Self-employed people can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services. Their means would be taken as any net profit that they may earn in the coming 12 months. While their income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year&rsquo;s earnings will be received in the coming year. Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</P>

	<P>The current range of payment options offered by the Department to customers include payment at a local post office or to a bank or building society account or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators. Other than jobseekers, customers can opt for a payment method having regard to their own personal circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department administers a variety of schemes which have weekly or monthly payment cycles. For operational reasons, and to facilitate the distribution of payments through the post office network, each scheme is assigned a day of the week for payment. These measures ensure that payments to be distributed through post offices are spread across the week. A person can collect their payment on the due date or within a number of days thereafter.  The management of queues at post offices is kept under review by An Post which is responsible for the post office network, and the operation of individual post offices.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution, which a person is required to contribute towards their rent, be increased from &euro;18 to &euro;24 with effect <Col N="875"/>from 1 June 2009 and that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date. These measures account for the reduction in the rent supplement payment of the person concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most recent data published by the CSO show that rents in the private sector have fallen by almost 11% since November 2008 and by almost 20% in the past year. It is essential that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices. Each existing recipient of rent supplement, including the person concerned, was advised in advance, by letter, of the particular reductions being made to their rent supplement payment from 1 June 2009. This letter also advised that if the recipient wanted to talk to their landlord to seek a reduction in rent, the Department&rsquo;s letter could be shown to a landlord as evidence of their reduced rent supplement payment. Each existing recipient of rent supplement, including the person concerned, was advised in advance, by letter, of the particular reductions being made to their rent supplement payment from 1 June 2009. This letter also advised that if the recipient wanted to talk to their landlord to seek a reduction in rent, the Department&rsquo;s letter could be shown to a landlord as evidence of their reduced rent supplement payment.</P>
        <P>While he may be contractually obliged to pay the current rent, it is expected that landlords will decrease rents in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally. In the current climate, where there is a large number of vacant rental properties, it is expected that people will be able to get accommodation at the appropriate rental level.</P>
        <P>Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case. Officers have been advised that support, appropriate to the circumstances of any individual case, may be provided to rent supplement tenants for up to two months, while alternative accommodation is being sourced within the existing rent limits.</P>

	<P>The one-parent family payment (OFP) is a means tested payment for men and women who are bringing up a child without the support of a partner. The claimant must be widowed, separated or divorced, unmarried or a prisoner&rsquo;s spouse. The person must also have main care and charge of at least one child who is residing with them, not be cohabiting and have made efforts to seek maintenance from the other parent of their child.</P>
        <P>By its nature, OFP is not paid to married couples. However, the majority of social welfare payments may be paid to married couples, providing the qualifying conditions are satisfied. Also, in addition to the main claimant&rsquo;s personal payment, an increase for a qualified adult (IQA) may be paid in respect of their spouse or partner. As OFP is designed for those parenting alone, IQAs are not payable with this payment. Most social welfare payments also provide for an increase in respect of qualified children.</P>
        <P>There is a range of additional social welfare payments available to which families (including lone parent families) may be entitled, providing they satisfy the relevant qualifying conditions. These payments include child benefit, family income supplement, fuel allowance, and payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, such as rent and mortgage interest supplements and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>

	<P>The mortgage interest supplement scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme provides a short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare scheme to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment. A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the statutory qualifying conditions, mortgage interest supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution of &euro;24 a week, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;24 a week because they are also required to contribute towards their accommodation costs, any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to say whether a couple would have an entitlement to mortgage interest supplement based on the limited information provided by the Deputy. There are a number of other qualifying conditions and factors that impact on entitlement to mortgage interest supplement and the amount of supplement payable in any case, including: the size of the mortgage and the amount of mortgage interest payable; the level of earnings of the spouse and the amount of jobseekers benefit payable in respect of a qualified adult; the number of hours per week worked by the spouse, as mortgage interest supplement is not payable where a claimant and/or spouse works in excess of 29 hours per week; whether the Executive considers the amount of mortgage interest payable to be reasonable having regard to the size of the household.  The couple in question should discuss their entitlement to mortgage interest supplement with the community welfare officer at their local Health Centre.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical assessment and a means test.</P>
        <P>The person concerned applied for Disability Allowance on 15 May 2009.  His claim was decided on the 23 June 2009 and he was awarded Disability Allowance with effect from the 20 May 2009 at the reduced weekly rate of &euro;92.40 plus a Dependant Child Allowance of &euro;26 which gives a weekly total of &euro;118.40.  The person concerned was formally notified of this decision by letter and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. His first payment will be in his bank account on 15 July 2009 and arrears due for the period from 20 May to 14 July 2009 will be issued by cheque to the applicant soon after he receives his first Disability Allowance payment.  The person concerned was assessed with means from self employment. The weekly rate of Disability Allowance payment depends on the amount of weekly means assessed.</P>
        <P>The legislative provisions regarding Disability Allowance state that means will be assessed from all income which the claimant or the claimant&rsquo;s spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the year following the date of their claim with certain exceptions. Income derived from <Col N="877"/>earnings from self employment is not included in these exceptions and is accordingly assessable as means for Disability Allowance.</P>

	<P>The Defence Forces are obliged to carry out the procurement of food products in an open and transparent manner and in line with National and EU Public Procurement Guidelines. The Defence Forces have absolutely no discretion in this regard. The previous contract for the provision of fresh poultry products for the Defence Forces expired on 31 May 2009. In anticipation of this deadline, an open tender competition was advertised on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s e-tenders website and published in the Official Journal of the European Union in February 2009.</P>
        <P>The tender documentation indicated that the contract would run over a period of two years and that a potential tenderer could tender for any or all of the 18 Defence Forces locations throughout the State. The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 7 May 2009. A total of nine tenders were received and a three person Defence Forces Evaluation Team evaluated the tenders. The contract was subsequently awarded to Crossgar Foodservices, County Down on the basis of cost. The contract value is in the region of &euro;350k over two years.</P>
        <P>All poultry products provided by Crossgar Foodservices under the contract are produced on the island of Ireland. The chickens are reared by individual poultry farmers in Northern Ireland. When ready for slaughter they are then processed by O&rsquo;Kane Poultry, based in Northern Ireland, who have Board Bia certification. I am advised that the Defence Forces are fully satisfied that the poultry products from Crossgar Food Products are fully certified in all respects and that the products meet the required Irish, English and EU specifications.</P>
        <P>I met with the IFA last week and I understand the concerns of the IFA poultry growers.   I agreed with the representatives the importance of food standards and traceability in the procurement of food for the Defence Forces.  We will continue to ensure the highest standards within the overall requirements of EU procurement rules. I have also agreed to bring the concerns as expressed to me to the attention of other Departments also.  It should be noted that over &euro;5m was spent in the last 12 months by the Defence Forces on food products for the various Defence Forces locations around the country and that the vast majority of these contracts were with Irish companies.</P>

	<P>The harvest of wild salmon by commercial and recreational means is only permitted in those rivers that are meeting their conservation limits and which have an identified surplus.  Based on scientific advice, the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout Bye-law No. CS 301, 2008, provides that the River Maigue is closed for salmon fishing as it is not meeting its conservation limit.  The decline in salmon stocks is due to a number of factors including continuing deterioration in marine survival, overfishing in the past, poor water quality and river habitat damage.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board (ShRFB), together with other agencies and stakeholders, continue to work together to address the in-river issues.  I understand that a notable improvement in water quality in the catchment, on foot of monitoring and enforcement by the ShRFB and local authorities, allows the agencies to advance with confidence, a major programme of works to rehabilitate damaged habitat and to repair the infrastructure of the river.</P>
        <P>Catchment-wide surveys to ascertain the status of stocks in the system over the coming years, together with a newly refurbished fish counter, will provide detailed information to assess whether the numbers of salmon entering the river are increasing.  The ShRFB is confident that all of these ongoing initiatives will increase salmon numbers in the Maigue in the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 251 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e over the telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre.  In order to address a lack of broadband in areas where it was not commercially viable for the private sector to operate my Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008.  3 is required to provide services to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and who seek a service.  The NBS will be rollout out on an Electoral Division (ED) basis.  Details of the EDs in County Laois and County Offaly to be covered by the NBS can be found at: <i>http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Communications/ Communications+Development/National+Broadband+Scheme.htm.</i></P>
        <P>Challenging programme roll-out targets have been agreed with 3 and initial NBS services were launched in a small number of rural areas at the end of April this year.  Broadband coverage in individual EDs will be made available incrementally during the coming months.  The forthcoming availability of services to premises located within identified EDs will be announced progressively prior to their enablement on 3&rsquo;s coverage map which can be accessed on its website at <i>www.three.ie/nbs.</i></P><Col N="884"/>
        <P>Some 48% of the EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to be enabled by the end of December 2009, while all of the EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to be enabled by the end of September 2010.  My Department is closely monitoring the rollout and has been informed by 3 that these targets will be achieved.  As regards the exclusion of certain unserved premises from the NBS, it is important to clarify that, in designing the NBS, which was approved by the EU Commission, a balance had to be struck between reaching as many unserved areas as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas.</P>
        <P>EU State aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  The nature of broadband networks is such that they provide a coverage footprint over a certain area rather than an individual link to isolated premises.  It was essential to guard against the NBS coverage footprint spilling over, to an extent, which would be unacceptable from a State aids perspective, into surrounding areas already served by existing service providers.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, to try to include individually unserved premises that are located within EDs deemed to be already served within the scope of the NBS would have given rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion and therefore, such areas had to be excluded.  It is expected that over time, as competition increases and technology develops, service providers will be attracted to offer service to any such premises located within currently served areas.  Details of the availability of broadband services in the specific areas not covered by the NBS are available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>As indicated in a previous reply, an application under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 1 May 2008. The details of the over-claims in respect of the areas declared are as follows.  This application was selected for a satellite eligibility inspection which required a follow-up field visit. During this visit, discrepancies were found in relation to 4 parcels (D28306026, D28306048, D28306049 and D28306047). As a result of these discrepancies, the area claimed of 35.88ha was reduced to 33.02ha.</P>
        <P>If the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, penalties must also be applied in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme. In this case, the number of entitlements held by the person named is 36.85. As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 3%, under EU Regulations, the difference between the area found and the area claimed is doubled and deducted from the area found. As a result, the area eligible for payment under the Single Payment Scheme was 27.30 hectares.</P>
        <P>The person named was informed of these findings on 24 March 2009 and of his right to seek a review of this decision within 21 days and of his right to appeal the outcome of any such review. An appeal was received from the person named, and it is currently under consideration. The person named will be advised of the outcome of the appeal, in writing, and, should he be dissatisfied with the outcome, will then have the opportunity to appeal to the Agricultural Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>From January 2009 to the end of May 2009 my Department made forestry premium payments totalling almost &euro;62.5 million.  Of this figure, approximately &euro;900,000 was for first premiums in respect of new planting and &euro;61.5 million was for subsequent premiums in respect of previous planting.  Premium payments since the Supplementary Budget reflect the 8% reduction.  As for future premium payments I cannot anticipate the measures that will be included in the 2010 Budget later this year.</P>

	<P>I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in  view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a  position to reverse any of the decisions taken. I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of  teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department&rsquo;s website. The  process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information  on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the  revised schedule for 2009/10.</P>
        <P>My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a  net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. Initial  allocation letters have also issued to Post Primary Schools and Vocational  Educational Committees. Information on the teacher allocations to second level schools, whether  enrolment related or otherwise, is currently being compiled into a format for  publication on my Department&rsquo;s website in the coming weeks. My intention is  that, just as is the case with the information provided in relation to primary  schools, this information will identify the changed position for second level  schools and VECs arising from the October budget decisions.</P>
        <P>At the level of individual schools the changes in relation to the allocation of  teaching posts will impact in different ways depending on whether enrolment is  rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers  than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. Across the school system  generally there will inevitably be an impact on class sizes and at post-primary  level the changes will impact on the capacity of individual schools to offer as  wide a range of subject choices as heretofore in future years. My Department  will through the normal processing of examining applications for curricular  concessions endeavour to ensure continuity of provision for those already  preparing for the certificate examinations. The changes at second level are  therefore more likely to impact on the range of subjects that schools will be  able to offer to those starting the Junior or Leaving Certificate programmes  next September.  All the above allocations, primary and post-primary are provisional at this  stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any  one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of  support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and  posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until  the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for  mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards  will have been considered. The appellate process is particularly relevant at  post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned  are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective system wide  redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools may end up retaining  teachers, though over quota.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has considered the correspondence submitted by the schools in question appealing the decision to suppress a class for pupils with a Mild General Learning Disability (MGLD) in each school. My Department recently advised both schools that the decision to suppress the classes remains.</P>
        <P>The material submitted by the schools did not include any proposal for a local  arrangement. The schools concerned are single sex schools and therefore there  would not appear to be a basis for facilitating a local arrangement between the  two schools.</P>

        <Quest> the status of the planned reorientation of the millennium partnership fund by the Higher Education Authority; his views on whether the absence of information on the new plans has led to considerable uncertainty and concern in those areas which have previously benefitted from this fund, resulting in a contraction of his stated objective for people to enter or re-enter education and training; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has been working with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and  Pobal on the re-orientation of the Millennium Partnership Fund, which was  recommended by an independent evaluation commissioned by the HEA. The review recommended a more targeted approach, focusing the fund on a rigorously selected sample of groups with a strategic focus and good linkages with other stakeholders at community level. It also identified the potential for the  impact of the Fund to be considerably enhanced through shifting the emphasis  from retention to community-based access.</P>
        <P>To date, there have been two consultation events with a wide range of  stakeholders to reflect on experiences and to ascertain views on the shape and  content of a re-oriented Fund.  The work has focused on a collaborative  approach to developing a framework that reflects the inputs from the  consultation events and draws on current learning in the area of community-based access.</P><Col N="897"/>
        <P>Given the importance of shaping a new programme that will integrate effectively  with existing structures and complement existing core initiatives, whilst  simultaneously laying a solid foundation for the future, it is considered that  additional work will be required on the shaping of the new programme, including  further consultation with participating groups.  Therefore, the fund will  continue in its existing format for the coming academic year, during which time  the transition to a community-based access approach will continue to be  developed. The HEA has already been in contact with the relevant local area  partnerships informing them of this decision.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the number of special needs assistants who will be removed from schools from September 2009; the schools affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education has been requested by my Department to arrange for its Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) to review special needs assistant (SNA) allocations in all  schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of  such posts are properly met. The review is currently under way and it is  intended that it will be completed during 2009.</P>
        <P>Given the proximity of the end of this school year and, in the light of the  fact that those schools yet to be reviewed will have prepared for the new  school year in advance of being reviewed, my Department has allowed exceptional transitional arrangements for schools where the SNA allocation is being adjusted. With a number of exceptions e.g. where a child with SNA support is leaving a school, schools may, if they so wish, retain the existing cohort of  SNAs until 31 January 2010.</P>
        <P>The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on  a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs  leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any  surplus identified. Additional applications for special needs assistant support  may be made at any time with the result that the individual situation of any  school can change.</P>
        <P>Given the variables involved and the transitional arrangements mentioned above, it is not possible at present to give an indication of the number of special  needs assistants whose employment will be terminated from September 2009 and the number of schools involved.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department has received an application for major capital funding for the provision of a new school to cater for the school referred to by the Deputy. The application has been assessed and has been assigned a band 2.2 rating under the prioritisation criteria for large scale projects.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P>Due to my diary commitments, it is not possible at this point in time for me to  arrange a visit to the school.  However, as the Deputy may be aware, I met a  delegation from the school in January and they made me aware of the issues  arising in the school.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, my Department provides funding under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) and under the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) to enable individual school authorities to carry out small scale capital works.  The school in question received funding under the 2007 SWS to allow it to upgrade its toilet  facilities. No further applications for funding for minor capital works have  been received to date but it is open to the school authority to submit an  application which will be considered by my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 290 together.</P>
        <P>On Thursday 4th June 2009, the Taoiseach, along with myself and other Cabinet colleagues, met with representatives of the Religious Congregations to begin the process of addressing with them the issues arising from the publication of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The Taoiseach  conveyed the view of the Government and indeed the wider public that further  substantial contributions are required from the Congregations by way of  reparation. Furthermore, the contributions need to be capable of being assessed  by the public for their significance by reference to the full resources available to the Congregations and in the context of the costs of well over a billion euro being borne by the State. The Taoiseach asked the Congregations to revert with proposals in this regard.</P>
        <P>The same group again met with the representatives of the various Religious  Congregations on Wednesday 24th June at which the Religious Congregations  reported on the progress they had made in compiling reports on their financial  positions. It is expected that reports signed off on by their financial advisors will be submitted by the Congregations to the Government by mid July when a further meeting will be held.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has stated that the Government would now move to appoint a panel of three eminent independent persons to assess the material submitted by the congregations and report to Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the resources of the Congregations.</P>

	<P>On Wednesday 3rd June the Taoiseach, Mr Brian Cowen TD, along with myself and other Cabinet colleagues met with survivors groups to begin the process of discussion of the issues arising from the Report of the Commission to Inquire  into Child Abuse.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach reiterated the apology issued to survivors by former Taoiseach  Bertie Ahern, TD, and conveyed directly and personally a sincere apology, on  behalf of the Government, of the State and of all our citizens, for the failure  to intervene, to detect their pain or to come to their rescue. The representatives were told that the needs of survivors of abuse are a particular priority of the Government at this time.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach pointed out that the Government have accepted all of the  recommendations of the Commission and are committed to their full  implementation. Mr Cowen also referred to the fact that the Government had  called on representatives of the Religious Congregations concerned to make  further substantial contributions by way of reparation.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach also stressed that those who perpetrated crimes against  survivors, no matter how long ago, must be made amenable to the law so that  they can be held to account for such crimes. He added that an Assistant Garda  Commissioner has been tasked with examining the totality of the Commission  Report and that criminal investigations are continuing in respect of a  significant number of people.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach told those present that Minister Barry Andrews will bring to  Government before the end of July a comprehensive implementation plan to put in place the recommendations of the report.  As well as listening to the issues raised by survivor groups at the meeting, each group was asked to make a submission outlining the needs of survivors going forward. All of the issues raised, together with the recommendations of the Report, will be considered in full by the Government.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide, in tabular form, the number of civil servants awaiting transfer to locations within the Laois/Offaly area, including Roscrea; if these transfers are affected by the moratorium on recruitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department has two main locations outside of Dublin, in Athlone and Tullamore, which were in existence prior to the announcement of the Decentralisation Programme in 2003.  As you are aware, offices of the Department of Finance decentralised to Tullamore providing the primary opportunity for officers to move to that location under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation programme. Under the Central Applications Facility (CAF) protocols, vacancies in existing decentralised locations may only be filled from CAF, as staff already in that location accept an offer under CAF to decentralise to another location.  To date, 16 officers have transferred to my Department&rsquo;s office in Tullamore under the CAF. </P><Col N="902"/>
        <P>I understand from the Public Appointments Service that there are currently 43  CAF applicants seeking to transfer to the Department of Education and Science  in Tullamore.  Prior to the moratorium of March 2009, these officers would have  been considered for transfer to this Department as serving officers in  Tullamore decentralised to other locations. While the moratorium does not allow  Departments/Offices to fill posts by recruitment or promotion, lateral  transfers between locations under the CAF may proceed, as resources permit.</P>
