      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his first day in office.  I notice he has dispensed with the English prayer and this may be a new precedent he is setting.  He will get used to the words in the vernacular after a while.</P>
        <P>In the last period we have had a number of what I consider to be very sizable severance payments and golden handshakes to people in this country.  Yesterday, there was the announcement of the &euro;70,000 bonus to the chief of the Health Service Executive.  This may be the norm or what the Taoiseach considers to be the norm but it is certainly not the norm for people outside.</P>
        <P>I return to the severance package given to the former director general of F&Aacute;S, Mr. Rody Molloy.  On 25 September at a press conference in NUI Galway when asked a question about this matter, the Taoiseach stated in respect of the additional golden &euro;1.1 million package for Mr. Molloy that the matter was dealt with in accordance with established guidelines from the Department of Finance.  I understand from newspaper reports and internal e-mails from November last, released under the Freedom of Information Act, that three officials in the Department, all with expertise in the pension area, referred to this enhanced package and stated it was outside the guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  In fact the letter sent from the Department of Finance to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 26 November stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I note that the terms offered by your Department to Mr. Molloy are not fully in accordance with those of the circular letter of 26 May 1998 from this Department to all heads of Department.  Nonetheless, I am to convey sanction to the proposed terms and conditions, that this is an exceptional case and that your Department is satisfied that these terms are appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Does the Taoiseach still stand by his comment that the additional package awarded to Mr. Molloy is in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines, or does he wish to correct the public record in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation as has emerged has not changed the position in respect of this matter.  The correspondence simply reflects the fact that the F&Aacute;S director general&rsquo;s severance arrangements were informed by what he could have claimed under the 1998 guidelines if his <Col N="768"/>contract had been terminated.  It has been quite clear all along that the terms he received were broadly in line with what he might have sought if the contract had been ended by the F&Aacute;S board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14- ?><Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>He offered to resign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the issue that arose.  It was clearly the case that it was regarded as in the best interests of the organisation that the change take place.  Therefore, as far as the board was concerned the arrangements made were analogous to those if the contract had been extended.  If one considers the guidelines in place, they relate to the severance arrangements whereby people have an entitlement to increased severance arrangements where their contract ends before the termination of the contract itself.</P>
        <P>In the exceptional circumstances of this case, that is, the need to allow F&Aacute;S to move forward, the severance arrangements were approved by the Departments under the provisions of the Labour Services Act 1987 which covers the DG&rsquo;s remuneration and superannuation terms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>They threw in a car and all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have examined the guidelines and I am still not clear as to how this happened.  The guidelines to all heads of Department on 26 May 1998 state at No. 3: &ldquo;It is not, therefore, appropriate to make payments where the initiative for the termination of a contract comes from the CEO concerned&rdquo;.  That is very clear and in this case Mr. Molloy was not sacked.  The Taoiseach himself clarified that there was no threat of legal action.  Mr. Molloy resigned.  According to the guidelines issued in 1998 it was not appropriate to make that payment.</P>
        <P>On 26 November an official stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I understand from news media that Mr. Molloy resigned voluntarily from his job in F&Aacute;S.  If this is correct then the terms set out in the draft letter are outside those permitted in the letter of 26 May 1998 regarding severance and early retirement for chief executives of State sponsored bodies.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Correspondence from 26 November states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I understand that Mr. Molloy has resigned voluntarily.  If that is the case then our letter of May 1998 regarding severance terms for CEOs does not apply.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A further e-mail of 26 November states: &ldquo;Given that the terms are different from the delegated sanction under the 1998 letter, should we not get this package referred to Government for approval where we deviate from the terms?&rdquo;  Clearly, this was the situation in so far as Mr. Molloy was concerned.  There were three senior Ministers involved, namely, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  All three were involved in some form or other in dealing with this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Sweetheart deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The point is this was clearly outside the guidelines referred to in the letter from the Department of Finance and yet it was given sanction in what was deemed to be an exceptional case.  If this was deemed to be an exceptional case why was no Government decision made to authorise it?  If it did not go to Government who overruled whom?  Clearly, the Department of Finance stated this was not appropriate.  However, someone gave a direction that this would be deemed to be an exceptional case without the matter going to Cabinet.  I <Col N="769"/>wish to find out who that person was, or on whose instructions this was given.  The Taoiseach may be able to answer that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is wrong in the contention he makes.  The arrangements were that the F&Aacute;S board would discuss the matter with the outgoing CEO at that time, refer it to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and obtain the approval of the Department of Finance.  That was the arrangement that was made and followed in this case.  There was no other arrangement required in that respect.</P>
        <P>Second, as I have already said, severance arrangements were approved by the Department under the provisions of the Labour Services Act 1987, which cover the remuneration and superannuation terms.  We are talking here about moving the situation on and a change at the top of the organisation.  The issues that arose and to which the Deputy is referring, concern the fact that had the outgoing chief executive decided to stay and the F&Aacute;S board decided subsequently to terminate the contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>He offered to resign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me.  Will the Deputy let me explain the situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the Taoiseach can. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Had they decided to terminate the contract, under the terms and conditions of employment he would have been entitled to seek those increased severance arrangements.  That is the point.  In the interests of the organisation, both were coming to the conclusion that this was the right thing to do.  He was prepared to go on the basis of being dealt with, as he would claim, fairly.  Had the contract been terminated he would have been entitled to those enhanced severance arrangements as well.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Who signed off on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The signing off was by the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If they say that is not appropriate, it should have gone to the Cabinet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me, I have explained to the Deputy that one has got to move on with the correspondence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The severance arrangements were approved by the Departments under the provisions of the Labour Services Act 1987.  That was the legislative basis upon which the decisions were taken.  It was under that legislation that the remuneration and superannuation entitlements of the director general applied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision should have been taken by the Cabinet. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is talking about the normal practice of any office in discussing the pros and cons of issues as they are debated.  However, the issue emerged that it was in the interests of the organisation that it be moved on and that it would be decided under the terms of the Labour Services Act.  The point I was making about the Department of Finance guidelines was that if the contract had been terminated the enhanced severance arrangements, in line with those guidelines, would have been applicable in this case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must move on to the second question, and I call Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Later today, the Government will put through the House the Second Stage of the National Asset Management Agency Bill.  This will be the most expensive piece of legislation ever to pass through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann whereby the State will be expected to put up &euro;54 billion to take bad loans off the banks.  Even in a best case scenario it will mean the taxpayer is putting up a premium of about &euro;7 billion for these bad loans.  Meanwhile, tens of thousands of householders are facing the prospect of having their homes repossessed by the same banks who will benefit from this arrangement.  In a report last week, the ESRI estimated that by the end of next year 35,000 households will not be able to repay their mortgages.  It is well known that the banks are just waiting for the NAMA legislation to go through before they open up in a very serious way to seek repossession&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any evidence for that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of homes from people who are in serious trouble.  One of the biggest problems I hear from Labour Party public representatives all over the country concerns the difficulties of repaying mortgages and the fears people have of losing their homes.  The biggest fear people have at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the Deputy will be in Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is the fear of losing their homes.  I want to put a suggestion to the Taoiseach, which I ask him to take up before the NAMA legislation is enacted.  Deputy Joan Burton will put down an amendment on Committee Stage proposing that there should be a moratorium on home repossessions for a period of time.  This is perfectly reasonable.  The people who are having difficulty today in repaying their mortgages are those who had good jobs a year or two ago, and certainly at the time they took out the mortgage.  Hopefully, they will have good jobs again when we come through the economic difficulty.  However, while the economic recession lasts, while there is an employment downturn and while business is difficult, many of these people will have problems repaying their mortgages.  Instead of having their homes repossessed, an arrangement should be made whereby they can retain their homes and continue to live there.  All kinds of arrangements could be made through the banks which would allow that to happen.  It would make more economic sense because ultimately the State will have to pick up the tab if people&rsquo;s homes are repossessed.  It also makes sense from a social and family viewpoint if people are allowed to stay in their homes.  I want an assurance from the Taoiseach in this respect.  I know he will probably tell me that there are codes of practice, but all these codes are doing is buying time for people.  They are just postponing the evil day.  There needs to be an assurance given to people who are worried about losing their homes that there will be a moratorium on home repossessions.  I ask the Taoiseach to implement that before the NAMA legislation is finally enacted.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recognise that the level of mortgage arrears which results in house repossessions by the lender is, thankfully, still very low in this country.  In previous discussions we have had on this matter, I have stressed the need for people who are not in a <Col N="771"/>position to pay or who have temporary difficulties, to make contact with the lending agencies.  There are codes of practice in place which must be respected when people get into such difficulties.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific question raised by the Deputy, in the revised Programme for Government we have further strengthened our commitment to assist mortgage holders who are under pressure due to changed economic circumstances.  The programme refers to introducing new measures to protect families who are experiencing difficulties with their mortgage repayments.  The existing statutory code on mortgage arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers&rsquo; Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service on debt default will be further reviewed with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt. These include, for example, the use by banks and other lenders of more flexible mechanisms to avoid foreclosure in appropriate circumstances.  These could also include reduced rates, longer maturity dates, rolling up of outstanding interest, banks taking equity in the house, and banks taking ownership and leasing back to the resident with payments coming off the loan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>They will not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions, the Government will examine ways of expanding its own mortgage measures.  A range of options and efforts will be made to assist in every way possible.  As regards a moratorium being put in all cases concerning mortgage repayments, it is a question of being able to distinguish between those who are not in a position to pay and those who are refusing to pay, despite perhaps having an ability to pay or pay an amount of it.  That issue would have to be considered in the context of any amendment that is put forward, to ensure that, on the one hand, we seek to protect people in difficulty while, on the other, not compromising funding support for those institutions on an ongoing basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two requirements that have to met here, but the approach the Taoiseach is taking does not meet either.  I have been talking about the necessity for a moratorium on home repossessions for some time.  On a number of occasions, the Taoiseach has responded by saying the banks are being spoken to, codes of practice are being introduced, and all kinds of approaches are being recommended to the banks.  The first problem with that, however, is that it is being left to the goodwill and generosity of the banks.  Whatever disposition the banks may have now to be generous and to respond to the invocations of the Government to deal sympathetically with mortgage holders, as soon as the NAMA legislation is passed and the banks have their money and their bad loans off their books, they will have a free hand to do as they please.  The Government must include a requirement in the legislation for a moratorium on repossessions.  I do not refer to people who default on their loans through their own fault, who have the wherewithal to repay a mortgage and are negligent in doing so, but to people who are stuck because they have lost their job, their business has gone bad or their circumstances have changed and they need a break.  Just as the banks are looking for a break from the Government, householders also need a break.  Unless that is done before the NAMA legislation is passed, the Government will tee up a situation where the banks will be able to go after householders with a free hand and the world and its mother knows that is what they are planning to do.  The ESRI estimates 35,000 householders are in their sights.</P>
        <P>The second thing that needs to be done is the Government needs to take the fear of the loss of one&rsquo;s home out of the psyche of the country.  The Taoiseach has invited the trade unions and employers for further discussions.  The first item he needs to put on the table before he commences social partnership talks is a guarantee that people will not lose their homes in order that those who have endured jobs losses or the loss of their business will not find themselves <Col N="772"/>in a situation where they have to uproot from their neighbourhoods, leave the homes they have been living in and take their children out of the local school and so on.  This would mean they would, at least, have that peace of mind and the issue of the rescheduling the repayment of the mortgage and all the options outlined by the Taoiseach, with which I agree, could be bedded down and made part of a moratorium that could be enforced for the period of time we are going through these difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government parties have in their revised programme indicated that they want to enhance protections for mortgage holders who have a genuine problem.  Nobody in the House is at variance on the need to maximise protection in this regard.  We need to do so in a way that meets the objectives of what the House is seeking which, at the same time, does not use a mechanism that can have an adverse impact on the funding of the banking institutions.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has made certain points about the NAMA legislation.  It is not about giving a free hand to anybody.  It is about restructuring and having a viable financial system that will be able to continue to provide mortgages to those who seek them, as we seek to revitalise the housing sector and to make sure the funding arrangements for the banks are such that people who get into difficulty are dealt with appropriately, sympathetically and proportionately in view of their circumstances.  The question of the best way of achieving that, therefore, can be further discussed in the context of the NAMA legislation and continuing economic debate in the House.</P>
        <P>However, in the context of discussions I have in the House or outside the House with other social partners, the purpose of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the programme for Government is seeking to achieve precisely that.  How do we protect those in genuine difficulty temporarily who would have the capacity to reply and who need a period of time to reorganise their commitments?  We have set out in some detail how that may be done.  That is the Government&rsquo;s intention.  We are setting out that objective and further discussion on it can take place in the House.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Attorney General that currently the sanctioned complement of permanent staff in the Office of the Attorney General is 133.  There are 117 staff members serving and 16 vacancies.  The office also currently has 13 contract staff.  The breakdown among the various parts of the office is as follows: the advisory side of the office currently has 33 permanent staff serving with one vacancy and, due to part-time working arrangements, the equivalent of one further vacancy.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, currently has 23 permanent staff engaged in the drafting of legislation.  There are also four vacancies at assistant parliamentary counsel grade II, which is the entry level for drafting staff.  The breakdown by grade of permanent drafting posts is as follows: one chief parliamentary counsel; one first parliamentary counsel; four parliamentary counsel; seven assistant parliamentary counsel grade I; and 14 assistant parliamentary counsel grade II, including the four vacancies.  In addition, there are currently five consultant parliamentary counsel engaged on a contract basis in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government to draft legislation.</P>
        <P>The administrative side of the office has 61 staff serving and ten vacancies.  Due to the moratorium on recruitment and the need to make savings, there are no plans to fill these vacancies.  Eight other contract staff are engaged by the office.  Four are legal researchers, three are the Attorney General&rsquo;s private staff and one is engaged as a research assistant.  Two legal researcher positions have been left vacant since last autumn as cost saving measures.  The complement of staff in the Office of the Attorney General is kept under constant review to ensure it is sufficient to meet the demands of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for putting on record quite an amount of detail in respect of the staffing of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  He said the total staffing complement is 133.  The an bord snip nua report states the staffing complement in 2007 was 138.  Will the Taoiseach explain this difference?  Is it due to temporary contracts?  Are there vacancies and are they likely to be filled?  How many temporary contracts have been renewed?  In particular, how many have been renewed since March 2008 when the ban was imposed on the renewal of such contracts?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied the staffing complement in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office is sufficient to meet the office&rsquo;s requirements and, in particular, to meet the requirement to maintain the flow of legislation to the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the tenure and duties of contract staff.  The office currently engages 13 staff on a contract basis.  Three are engaged in the Attorney General&rsquo;s private office and their tenure is directly linked to that of the Attorney General.  Two provide clerical support and one is his special assistant.  Five are engaged in drafting legislation with their contracts set to expire in April 2010, two in June 2010, July 2010 and August 2010.  Four are engaged as legal researchers to ensure the legal staff involved in advisory and drafting work can concentrate on the more complex aspects of cases or legislation.  Their contracts are due to expire between April and August 2010.  One is engaged on a part-time basis on the statute law revision project to identify obsolete legislation and bring a Bill to the House to remove it from the Statute Book and that contract expires in November 2010.  The office is fully supportive of the Government strategy to reduce public sector numbers.  It has ten vacancies for permanent staff and two for contract research staff, which it is not seeking to fill due to the need to make savings.  </P><Col N="774"/>
     
        <P>The number of drafters of legislation has increased since the last parliamentary question in February 2008.  There are 23 permanent drafting staff and five consultant drafters now, with a further person expected to join the permanent drafting staff shortly, compared with 19 permanent drafting staff and four consultant drafters when Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s parliamentary question was last answered in February 2008.  Also, a recruitment panel is in place following a competition last year.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General&rsquo;s office is considering approaching the Department of Finance to discuss the filling of some of the remaining drafting vacancies.  The intention is to eliminate the use of contract drafters once sufficient permanent drafting staff are in place.</P>

	<P>We should do something about questions to the Taoiseach.  They come up every month or six weeks and the same rota is used.  It might be better if we dispensed with these ordinary questions.  We might have them twice a month but choose priority issues that the Taoiseach would have notice of, such as Northern Ireland or whatever.  This rota is used all the time and the same questions are raised by myself and Deputy Gilmore.  I believe it is a waste of time but I will ask my question anyway.  The Chief Whip might take note of that element of D&aacute;il reform.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Taoiseach mentioned an increase in the permanent staff in the legislative preparation section of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  It never ceases to amaze me why, year after year, we produce lists as to the legislation it is intended to be produced yet the Bills rarely see the light of day on time.  We are waiting for the noise pollution Bill, the roads Bill, the amalgamation of quangos legislation &mdash; FETAC, HETAC and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI &mdash; and legislation covering the regulation and licensing of public and private hospitals.  I accept it takes particular expertise to become a drafter of legislation but it would appear that we need a more defined schedule as to when the Bills can be produced.  The Taoiseach might indicate something in that area.</P>
        <P>Arising from the recent agreement between the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il, I understand the animal health and welfare Bill, which will put an end to fur farming and stag hunting, will be produced eventually.  Does the Taoiseach have any idea when that is expected or will it be at the end of 2010?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>Never.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach might respond to some of those points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The questions relate to the staffing arrangements in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I would make the point that Opposition Deputies ask about this Bill or that Bill and if it is put on a B or C list and then removed in the interest of being more accurate, we are asked why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be for some suspicious reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and told to put it back on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Taoiseach has a long B list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a thread of consistency in that regard.  We must streamline the situation but sometimes the argument becomes circular.  </P>
        <P>Regarding the Bills published so far this year, there was a large number of them compared with recent full years.  In 2005 there were 28; 42 in 2006; 38 in 2007; 33 in 2008; and to date in <Col N="775"/>2009 41 have been published.  Some long, complex Bills including the NAMA legislation and other financially related legislation have been included in that.  The throughput has been exceptional given the complexity of the legislation.  We sometimes look at volumes of legislation without considering whether Bills are simple or complex in scope.  The NAMA legislation has rightly taken up a huge amount of time as a priority and the Attorney General and his office have been outstanding in seeking to bring all that together, with others, including the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
        <P>On the other issues the Deputy raised, those are usually dealt with by licensing arrangements and can be dealt with in that way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">How many drafters are on contract?  The Taoiseach said that will be phased out, which is appropriate, but how many are on contract?  Are they resident here or are we using drafting contractors from abroad, as was the case previously?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said in my earlier reply that there were four contract drafters but it is important to point out that a recruitment panel has been drawn up.  It is the intention over time to replace contract staff with permanent staff.  We are constantly trying to build up expertise.  We also know that from time to time it is appropriate to seek some assistance in the private sector through legal firms or whatever that would assist in the drafting of legislation.  It must be pointed out that no matter how well that is done it comes back to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for validation and checking by the Attorney General before it can be taken as a Government Bill.  It is always a question of trying to mix and match what is the most efficient and effective way of proceeding.  Ideally, it is about making sure that in this very technical area the expertise built up over many years is transferred to permanent staff complements in the office to ensure that institutional memory and expertise is retained.  Despite the constraints in terms of recruitment, staffing, resources, etc., that impinge on the Attorney General&rsquo;s office no more than anywhere else, he has been doing a very good job in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there redeployment or inter-transferability between the varying staffs of the Office of the Attorney General, the Advisory Council, the Parliamentary Counsel, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office and the statute law revision unit or are their respective specialisations a barrier to that interchangeability in terms of staff movement?  Will the Taoiseach indicate if there is the prospect for a range of experiences in terms of those who take up posts within the broad ambit of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Recruitment panels have been drawn up based on those who indicate an interest.  In the broad State-legal apparatus it is possible for personnel from various related activities to do the appropriate tests to determine if they can get on those panels.  I am sure there have been occasions when the people working in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office transferred to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  Sometimes people come directly into the Attorney General&rsquo;s office having qualified at the Bar.  Depending on the grades and the level of expertise required it may be possible to take in directly people in the legal profession or build up expertise from within the office or related offices.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have received a draft annotated agenda for the European Council in Brussels on 29 and 30 October.  Discussions at the Council will focus on institutional issues, climate change, the economic situation, macro-regional strategies, illegal immigration and external relations.  I will also take the opportunity to brief my colleagues on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon treaty referendum.</P>
        <P>As I said in my statement on the outcome of the referendum last week, the resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote was a good day for Ireland and a good day for Europe.  The Irish people have ensured that the European Union functions more efficiently and effectively for all its citizens in dealing with global problems such as climate change or international crime prevention, to name just two.  They have signalled to the other 26 member states that they want to remain at the centre of a stronger, fairer and better Europe.  I believe Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union is vital to our future prosperity and growth and the result of this referendum clearly shows that I am not the only one who believes this to be so.</P>
        <P>I also reiterate my words of thanks to all those who contributed to the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, including my own party members and Government colleagues, the other parties in this House, the civil society groups, business groups, trade unions, community organisations and the various other people who lent their support to the treaty.</P><Col N="777"/>
        <P>I spoke with a number of my colleagues from the European Council, including the President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt of Sweden, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Brown and President Sarkozy, following the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on that date.  I have since spoken with Prime Minister Zapatero and Chancellor Faymann.  They congratulated the people of Ireland on the outcome of the vote and said it was an important day for all concerned.  They said they were looking forward to moving past the institutional changes that had been the focus of the European Council for so long to other pressing issues which face all our countries and citizens.</P>
        <P>I would like to put on the record of the House my appreciation for the efforts of all my colleagues at the European Council who listened to the concerns of the Irish people and made sure that they were met.  I travelled to Brussels on 17 September for an informal meeting of Heads of State and Government.  The meeting was called by Prime Minister Reinfeldt to ensure a co-ordinated EU position for G20 talks on recovery from the financial crisis.  Discussions at the meeting focused on improving international financial regulation to ensure that there is no repeat of the financial crisis, and climate change, where the EU continues to lead in the build-up to the December Copenhagen conference.  I also used the meeting to brief colleagues on the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three areas in which I want to ask supplementary questions of the Taoiseach.  I share the Taoiseach&rsquo;s welcome of the decision in the recent referendum on the Lisbon treaty and join with him in expressing the appreciation of the Labour Party, particularly to the many civil society groups which participated in the referendum campaign.</P>
        <P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s current understanding of the Czech Government&rsquo;s position on the ratification of the Lisbon treaty?  My understanding is that President Klaus is refusing to sign the ratification instrument of the treaty and is seeking some kind of an opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the Czech Republic.  I saw press reports to the effect that the Czech Government intends to bring that issue to the summit meeting in October.</P>
        <P>In regard to the October summit, three sets of appointments must now be made.  The first is the appointment of President of the European Council.  The name of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been mentioned in that context as a possible candidate.  Is it intended to make that appointment at the October summit and what is the position of the Government on appointing a President of the European Council?  Does the Government have a preferred candidate or is a range of candidates being considered?</P>
        <P>What is the position on the appointment of an EU high representative, which I understand is also to be made at the October summit?  Have candidates been considered for that and what can the Taoiseach tell us about the issue?</P>
        <P>When does the Taoiseach expect the rest of the Commission to be appointed?  There has been some speculation in European capitals that the rest of the Commission will be appointed at the October summit.  The Taoiseach previously said to me that it was not intended to do this at the meeting and the only intention was to appoint a high representative, with the rest of the Commission being appointed at a later stage.  Will the Taoiseach give an update to the House on the appointment of an Irish representative and what progress is being made from a Government perspective on the identification or nomination of an Irish member?</P>
        <P>My understanding of the September summit is that a case would be made to the G20 summit, which was to take place afterwards, on the limiting of bonuses paid to bankers internationally and the establishment of a new global financial supervisory system for banks.  I do not recall any outcome from the G20 summit in respect of those requests, which I understood were agreed at the September summit by EU leaders.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="778"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised the position of other countries, particularly the Czech Republic.  Following our decisive referendum result on the Lisbon treaty, we are keen to see it enter into force as soon as possible.  I appreciate this position is shared by the majority of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>In that context I welcome the signature of the Polish instrument of ratification by President Kaczynski last Saturday.  There has been speculation, much of it unhelpful, about what it will take to satisfy Czech President V&aacute;clav Klaus so that he would sign the Czech ratification instrument.  We need greater clarity on what exactly the Czech Republic is seeking in the first instance, which is a matter for the Swedish Presidency to ascertain in consultation with the Czech Republic.  I would then expect consultation with other member states either before or at the next European Council scheduled for 29 and 30 October.  In the meantime, it is not helpful to add to speculation.</P>
        <P>I repeat that we wish to see the treaty enter into force as soon as possible and we are conscious of the role of the Presidency in the matter.  It is important we obtain institutional certainty for the reasons outlined in other parts of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  I am aware of a meeting involving the President of the Commission and the Czech Prime Minister, Mr. Fischer, yesterday but there is a need for the Presidency to be allowed some time and space to deal with this matter in a way that I hope will see ratification of the treaty as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>On the question of the position of Presidency of the European Council, I spoke to President Barroso on the day it emerged that we would approve the referendum ourselves.  He made the point that the question of the position of high representative, which would be a vice president of the Commission, must be designated by the European Council.  There is a current issue in that there is institutional uncertainty as a result of the Czech position as to whether the next Commission will be established under the Nice or Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>When I spoke to President Barroso, I reminded him of the importance to the Irish people of the Commission and Commissioner issue, as was evident in the context of our referendum.  We discussed the matter further.  Regardless of the treaty basis, each member state is currently considering who they will nominate and for my part, I am now giving careful consideration to the matter.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the President of the Council itself, there are no officially declared candidates as I understand it.  Speculation has arisen about the matter and in the immediate aftermath of our referendum I was asked a question on a programme for UK television about former Prime Minister Blair.  I said that if Mr. Blair is declared to be a candidate, we will favourably consider that candidacy in view of our knowledge of him and the contribution he has made to this country during his tenure as Prime Minister.  We will wait to see if other candidates are declared but I wanted to indicate the esteem in which that person is held in this country in view of the contribution he made to bilateral relations and progress on this island when he was Britain&rsquo;s Prime Minister.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised another issue relating to the G20 meeting.  The G20 leaders last month agreed to launch a framework laying out the policies and ways to act together to generate strong, sustainable and balanced global growth.  They also pointed to the need to shift from public to private sources of demand and to establish a pattern of growth across countries that is more sustainable and balanced, and to reduce development imbalances.  G20 members pledged to avoid destabilising booms and busts in asset and credit prices and to adopt macroeconomic policies, consistent with price stability, that promote adequate and balanced global demand.  They also undertook to make decisive progress on structural reforms that foster private demand and strengthen long-run growth potential.  They called on their Finance Ministers and central bank governors to launch the new framework by November by initiating, with <Col N="779"/>the assistance of the IMF, a co-operative process of mutual assessment of our policy frameworks and the implications thereof for the pattern and sustainability of global growth.</P>
        <P>In response to the economic crisis, the G20 agreed to continue support for economic activity until recovery is assured.  This approach has also been endorsed at EU level and is consistent with the strategy underlying the European economic recovery programme.  The G20 leaders also agreed that the reform of pay and bonuses for bankers is a priority issue and that it must be dealt with in order to avoid a business-as-usual attitude creeping back into the financial sector.  The main changes envisaged involve the reform of remuneration practices in order to increase financial stability.  These changes include avoiding multi-year guaranteed bonuses; ensuring that compensation for senior executives and other employees having a material impact on a firm&rsquo;s risk exposure will be aligned with performance and risk; and making companies&rsquo; compensation policies and structures transparent by means of disclosure requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only fair to reflect on the clear decision given by the people in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  In essence, the result represents the removal of a stone from the shoe and will allow us to concentrate on other matters.</P>
        <P>The difficulty being caused by President Klaus of the Czech Republic must be a cause of serious concern.  I met Mr. David Cameron, MP, in his office at Westminster last year and he clearly indicated that, assuming he wins the forthcoming British general election, it would be his intention to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty if it has not been fully ratified.  In light of the nature of the euroscepticism that exists in Britain, it is probable that there would be a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in any such referendum and that the good work done in respect of the Lisbon treaty during the past ten years would be negated.</P>
        <P>President Klaus is seeking an opt-out in respect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will become legally binding once the treaty is signed off on.  This has been referred to as an artificial obstacle and I do not in any way wish to interfere or make comments about the Czech Republic and the way it and its President do their business.  President Klaus did not so refrain when he visited Ireland.</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach raised this matter with President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, particularly in view of the fact that in the recent past Ireland was the focus of the attention of the remainder of the 500 million people who live in the EU?  As Head of Government, the Taoiseach must discuss this issue with his counterparts.  The Lisbon treaty is critical to the Union in terms of its ability to measure up to meeting the global challenges of climate change, immigration, employment creation, food security, etc.  The years dedicated to achieving agreement will be set at nought if this matter cannot be dealt with by the end of the year.  I hope the Taoiseach will raise the issue with his counterparts in Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When campaigning in respect of the recent referendum on the Lisbon treaty, I was struck by the awareness of people throughout the country in respect of the competency that will be given to the Union with regard to dealing with drugs and the transport and distribution thereof across member states.  The saddest event I witnessed during the entire campaign occurred near the gates of Dublin Castle following the declaration of the official result.  Some 100 metres up the street I saw a drug pusher selling drugs to a young girl, who was in a terrible condition, at the back of a van.  I reported what I had seen to the garda&iacute; who were on duty outside Dublin Castle.</P>
        <P>I hope the Taoiseach will highlight this issue.  The question of drugs and the destruction of an entire generation of young people is particularly relevant to Ireland.  As an island nation &mdash; and despite the good work of Garda drugs units &mdash; Ireland does not have the capacity to deal as effectively as possible with the menace of drugs on an inter-country basis.  I hope the <Col N="780"/>Taoiseach will raise at the meeting of the Council the matter of the Union being given competency to deal with drugs, those who push them and the destruction of young people&rsquo;s lives.  From the point of view of social justice, we could certainly major on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated earlier in respect of the situation that is developing in the Czech Republic, the European Union is leaving it to the Presidency to ascertain the position and obtain the clarity that is necessary.  Member states will then be consulted on and with discuss how that situation will be tackled.  This is preferable to different Heads of Government acting as if they were President of the Council and then everyone else getting involved.</P>
        <P>It would be better, in the context of the various considerations and the importance of bringing about institutional certainty, to ensure that the ratification of the treaty be completed.  The treaty has been ratified in accordance with constitutional traditions in each country.  The main issue outstanding relates to the President of the Czech Republic signing off on the treaty.  In addition, a small number of Senators from the Czech Parliament have brought a constitutional case to the country&rsquo;s constitutional court.  It will be a matter for the court to decide how it is going to dispose of that case and it is not for me to anticipate how, if or when it will do so.  At the most recent meeting of Heads of State and Government which I attended, there was evidence of a strong desire on behalf of all states to the effect that this matter be dealt with as expeditiously as possible in a way that will allow for the institutional arrangements to come into play in an orderly manner.</P>
        <P>As already stated, this is a matter for the Swedish Presidency to deal with in the first instance.  The Swedish Presidency is competent in this regard and will deal with the matter on behalf of the entire Union.  We will be informed in due course with regard to how it is proposed to progress this matter.  It would not be prudent or correct for me to comment further prior to the discussions that need to take place.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny also referred to the area of justice and home affairs and the fact that under the Lisbon treaty there will be an enhanced and improved competence at EU level in respect of intensifying co-operation and ensuring that certain matters which simply cannot be dealt with in the context of the nation state.  Matters such as international criminal activity, drug trafficking, etc., must be tackled on an ongoing basis.  Interpol plays a role in this regard and there is co-operation among police forces.  In recent months, significant caches of illegal drugs have been seized by the Garda and by customs officers.  Such activity is an important aspect of the fight against crimes of this nature.</P>
        <P>Everyone acknowledges that the type of activity to which Deputy Kenny refers is pernicious in nature and that it destroys the lives of the many people who suffer from addiction.  The need for our judicial and policing authorities to co-operate with those of like-minded states in trying to quell the problem is an ongoing priority.

	<P>I also wish to take this opportunity to thank all those who were involved in presenting the &ldquo;No&rdquo; case analysis from a progressive point of view.  I also compliment the hundreds of thousands of people who stood resolutely by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; analysis on referendum voting day.  They too are to be commended on their position and participation in a democratic debate and decision-making process.  I was delighted by the role that Sinn F&eacute;in has played and how the results have shown the considerable impact my party had in informing the electorate.  It was something of a David and Goliath contest, which probably explains the stone in Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s shoe.</P><Col N="781"/>
        <P>On the issue of the question before Members, I note from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s initial response that the agenda for the summit on 29 and 30 October includes, among a number of others, economic issues.  In that context, will the European Council be discussing the unemployment crisis?  I refer in particular to the use by the campaigning &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side of the fear and worse, the prospect, of an increase in the rates of unemployment were people were to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; again, as well as of the prospect of a further decline in our economic condition and a dissuading of potential inward investors coming to these shores.  The counter to such suggestions was the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign&rsquo;s underscoring of what it sought people to believe, that is, that jobs and recovery would result were people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>With respect, I am addressing the Taoiseach.  Will an accelerated jobs strategy be placed before the European Council when it next meets?  What special measures for this country will be undertaken?  Will the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity to raise the European Commission&rsquo;s approval of the Polish Government&rsquo;s decision to allocate &euro;54.5 million in an aid package to Dell to assist its relocation of 1,900 jobs from Limerick to Poland?  Has the Taoiseach noted what was stated by the European Commission when announcing its decision on 23 September?  It stated that the Polish Government&rsquo;s aid package to Dell was acceptable because of its &ldquo;contribution to regional development and job creation in a disadvantaged [area]&rdquo;.  Does the Taoiseach agree it is a scandal that the European Union should be encouraging a giant multinational to take 1,900 desperately needed jobs from one of the most economically deprived regions of one member state and relocate them to another member state, albeit in an equally deprived region?  Does he agree that, put simply, this defies logic and understanding?  What kind of perverted jobs strategy does this represent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the stone ended up in Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s shoes, it is no wonder that David did not slay Goliath this time.  The Deputy&rsquo;s stonethrowing was misdirected.  To take the serious point that has been raised by the Deputy, the economic situation and macroregional strategies will form part of the agenda, as indicated thus far, on 29 and 30 October.  This matter has been at the heart of the discussions taking place at both the European Council and at the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, on an ongoing basis in an effort to respond to the depth and range of the crisis with which we are dealing in both economic and financial terms.  The European Union, through its membership of the G20 and its work through that process, is influencing global strategy on how to restore world economic growth as quickly as possible and will continue to do this.</P>
        <P>It is unfair to blame the European Union for the redundancies at Dell in Limerick.  Given the excellence of the workforce and management there, the maintenance of that Dell manufacturing facility for such a length of time was a major achievement.  Moreover, the reorganisation of the Dell business model, which unfortunately saw the relocation of manufacturing capacity to Poland, also was part of ensuring that Dell would maintain a presence, albeit much reduced, in the mid-west, albeit and much.  However, it is important that Members should acknowledge the contribution this company made for a long time in the mid-west region and that in the event of it not changing its business model, the prospect of any jobs remaining in Ireland or in other parts of the world would have been put at risk.  Unfortunately, while such developments are not welcome, we also must avoid suggesting it was possible to maintain the <i>status quo</i> on a sustainable basis over the long term.  The flexibility, responsiveness, initiative and creativity of the management and workforce at Dell, Limerick, kept that manufacturing facility there for <Col N="782"/>as long as it was possible to so do, given the costs involved.  The fact that so much was achieved there is an indication of how flexible they have been.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, stated in Limerick that the Commission had approved an application from Ireland for co-financing under the European globalisation fund to assist redundant workers at the Dell computer manufacturing plant at Raheen, as well as ancillary enterprises throughout the mid-west.  Instead of portraying the European Union as being the cause of the loss, it would be more accurate to refer to the European Union in respect of the assistance it is giving to those who unfortunately have lost their jobs.  This is the reality with which we are obliged to content and therefore I do not agree.</P>
        <P>There are issues in respect of state aid.  Ireland provides assistance as part of its industrial policy to attract jobs here.  If an investment comes to country A, be it Ireland or anywhere else, on foot of the provision of assistance that is within state aid guidelines, such a policy is as applicable to other member states as it is to Ireland.  The European Union did not provide assistance regarding investment in Poland by Dell or any other company.  It was provided by Polish taxpayers within a framework of stated guidelines that apply a level playing pitch throughout the European Union.  The existence of such a level playing pitch has been of great assistance to Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract investments as it prevents large countries from simply using their economic muscle to provide aid to industries regardless of rules that are implemented or imposed by the European Commission.  The European Commission has been the best guarantor of fair play to small countries in respect of inward investment policies.  Again, the negative portrayal of the European Union in this regard is both wrong in its analysis and unfair in respect of what the Commission does generally as the guardian of the treaties and in ensuring fair play to all countries.</P>
        <P>The Commission approved the Irish application for &euro;22.8 million under the European globalisation fund, of which the European Union will contribute &euro;14.8 million and the Government &euro;8 million to retrain, upskill and offer further educational opportunities to up to 2,400 affected workers.  The European Union, through its funding initiatives, is providing prospects of retraining to 2,400 workers who have lost their jobs as a result of a decision by Dell and not as a result of a decision by the European Union.  The European Union, through its policies, is providing assistance to those who unfortunately have lost their jobs.  This is the accurate portrayal of the European Union&rsquo;s involvement in this issue.  To portray it otherwise is to do it a disservice because it would not be an accurate portrayal of what happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, I find the response of the Taoiseach incredible.  His efforts to paint my pointing to the factual situation, that the European Commission approved the Polish Government&rsquo;s &euro;54.5 million grant aid to Dell to relocate 1,900 jobs from this jurisdiction to another within the European Union, as being grossly unfair are amazing.  That is as close to balderdash as I have ever heard from the Taoiseach.  It is incredible that the European Union has given approval to state enterprises regarding their promotion of investment in Poland to secure jobs there.  It is fine that they were here for so many years but we do not have to cravenly thank them so much for having been here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking a question.  We do not have to cravenly thank them for having been here.  Dell did very well when here and the motivation behind leaving was that it was able to move from this jurisdiction, displacing 1,900 Irish workers, in order to make more profits by transferring the work to lower paid workers in another location within the European Union.  It is an absolute travesty and the Taoiseach should not try to discharge <Col N="783"/>the European Union from any responsibility in this.  The Commission gave approval and these are the facts.  During the period of the Lisbon treaty referendum, when this became apparent in the later stages, there was nothing but deafening silence from the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side in respect of this matter.  This is at the core of what we are talking about, namely protecting jobs in Ireland.  I am asking the Taoiseach, in respect of his attendance at the meeting on 29 and 30 October, if the issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked a series of questions, with respect.  The Ceann Comhairle is from the same neck of the woods as I am and will understand the same way of asking questions.  I want to know what strategy the Taoiseach will bring forward seeking approval from other members at the Council meeting on 29 and 30 October to address the jobs crisis in this State and the ongoing decline in the state of the economy.  That is the key and kernel of the matter.  Will the Taoiseach stand over future decisions such as this that will see the loss and haemorrhage of critical jobs in this jurisdiction to other locations in the European Union?  Shame on him if he does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s opportunistic efforts to use the fact that there have been job losses in Dell in that region as a means of giving vent to his anti-EU rhetoric.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case that this did not happen?  The Taoiseach should answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering the question.  I answered it at length in my initial response because I do not accept the simplistic portrayal of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, which is easy to put across.  Redundant workers welcomed the European globalisation fund initiative and said it would be of assistance to them in finding retraining opportunities and seeking other opportunities as they seek to positively move from where they are to where they want to go.  That was the reaction on the ground in Limerick.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in suggests that the European Union facilitated something.  The decision was taken by the company and the company takes that responsibility.</P>
        <P>The investment within Poland is within state aid rules that apply in this country as they do in other countries.  That is how it operates and it was not a question of the EU providing any moneys to the Polish authorities.  That is their own money.  While I would rather Dell had been able to stay in Limerick, the company still has a presence there and I acknowledge that the company made a strong contribution while it was here.  I would rather that it could remain here but we must deal with the situation as it is.  As a result of that company&rsquo;s decision, the European Union stepped in to assist these workers through the EU globalisation fund.  To portray the EU negatively on that basis is an unfair charge against the EU.</P>

	<P>That is correct and I will be brief.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to accommodate a debate in the House this week or next week on the so-called new programme for Government negotiated between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party?  Will the D&aacute;il have the opportunity to properly address the content of the programme, which has been <Col N="785"/>debated by only one of the political parties in a conference at the weekend?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the imposition of a guillotine on the NAMA legislation.  When the Bill was introduced in the House, the Minister gave an undertaking that there would be no guillotine and that all Members who wished to contribute to the debate would be able to do so.  At &euro;54 billion and counting, this is probably the most expensive legislation that has ever come before the House.  To suggest that it would be the subject of a guillotine prior to Members having an opportunity to make their contributions is wrong practice and procedure.  Not only that, but during the weeks of the debate there has been an opportunity for people as renowned as Professor Joseph Stiglitz to come to Ireland and speak at length about the craziness &mdash; from an economic point of view &mdash; of an Irish Government paying at least &euro;7 billion over the odds for the distressed loans.</P>
        <P>During the period of the debate the Minister admitted that Anglo Irish Bank, a failed financial entity, requires approximately a further &euro;6 billion over and beyond NAMA in funding from the State.  That is to be diverted from items we all know are essential, not least getting credit to business flowing again.  It is essential that the Government reconsiders the wisdom of imposing a guillotine and leaving us with a NAMA which is not just inadequate but which will be a millstone around the taxpayers of this generation and the next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Guillotine or no guillotine and irrespective of whether a raft of Deputies is left to speak is not the issue with regard to NAMA.  While on principle we oppose the imposition of guillotines, the issue for us in opposing this is simply that we oppose NAMA, end of story and full stop.  We do not want to see it progress to a further Stage here.  We are opposed to the ordering of the conclusion of Second Stage and it moving on to Committee and further Stages.  That is our position and will be our position throughout because this is a flawed proposition that will have dire consequences for people today, tomorrow and for some considerable time to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make an observation.  I believe Second Stage of the Bill was to conclude last night.  The debate was extended until 10.30 p.m. and I understand from the Fine Gael Whip that this was to accommodate Fine Gael speakers.  The majority of our speakers have spoken on it.  I have stated in the past that I am opposed to the principle of guillotines.  However, we are faced with the political reality that the Bill is before us and is being discussed.  We have opposed NAMA previously and we will do so again.</P>
        <P>Arising from the political reality, I am more concerned that we do not have guillotines imposed on the debate on sections of the NAMA Bill on Committee Stage.  That is where we will deal with the points being made by Deputy Burton and everybody else.  While the intention is to group relevant headings, I would be utterly opposed to the imposition of guillotines by timescale on those groups because the critical issues must be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had 27 hours of debate on Second Stage of this important legislation and another two hours of debate will take place today.  We need to move on to Committee <Col N="786"/>Stage to deal with the detail of the Bill and it is only fair and right that we do so.  It is important to point out that, while people discuss the legislation and have their views on it, it is far more expensive to contemplate what would happen if we did not proceed with the Bill.  We would put at risk all that we have achieved so far.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When EU Commissioner Almunia was here he made the point very clearly about the need for the country to move forward with the national asset management agency solution.  It also has continuing support from the European Central Bank and the IMF.  There are far more than certain individuals, however eminent, speaking about this matter.  The concepts of fair economic value and long-term economic value are accommodated for in the EU guidelines on distressed assets.  It is a fair contention that the outline the Minister has put on these aspects of the legislation would be regarded by most people as reasonable.</P>
        <P>We must move forward with the Bill.  Second Stage is due to conclude at 7 p.m. and I anticipate that Committee Stage will be taken on the weeks beginning 21 and 27 October, pending the agreement of arrangements with the Chairman of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  It is important that we move forward on this basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Washington to discuss comprehensive immigration legislation to be passed in the United States or is he basing his talks on a selective or individual arrangement for Ireland?  I recognise the complications this involves and the difficulties facing American legislators.  I understand the Obama Administration wants to bring in comprehensive immigration legislation this year which will deal with the undocumented Irish and other immigrants. </P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach have any indication of when the report of the Moriarty tribunal will be published?</P>
        <P>The interim report of the mid-west task force chaired by Denis Brosnan has been around for some time.  He predicts that unemployment could rise to 20% in the mid-west if no action is taken regarding the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  I suggest that the Chief Whip arrange an appropriate time to discuss that report in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs normally meets Irish groups in New York and Washington, and goes to the hill to meet people to discuss issues of interest to us.  However, it was not possible for him to go in September because of the Lisbon treaty referendum cam<Col N="788"/>paign.  He has taken the opportunity to do so this week.  I am sure that he will meet some of the immigration reform groups because this is a perennial issue with which the embassy deals.</P>
        <P>The US Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton, mentioned it when she was here.  She said in a public comment that the Obama Administration is addressing this matter and that it needs to be done comprehensively because it is a difficult and sensitive issue in the United States and in Congress.  There is a continuing effort to build a consensus on how to deal with it.  We have met people who have come here to discuss that issue.  The Minister will see how we can constructively assist the debate so that we can try to deal with the matter as it affects us and our people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach support those efforts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  </P>
        <P>The chairman of the Moriarty tribunal has not given me a date for the presentation of his report.  Work is ongoing and the report is being finalised.  I cannot give a date but will check up on it.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the Whips to decide if the interim report of the task force can be fitted in for discussion at some point in our debates.  The Minister and the T&aacute;naiste are taking up recommendations in the interim report.  We will continue to work on those.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a large number of people offering with questions.  It is important that these relate to promised legislation because, otherwise, the Order of Business will be all over the place. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it intended to bring the revised programme for Government before the House for approval? </P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made a commitment, which the Taoiseach repeated, to hold an election next summer for a mayor of Dublin.  We do not yet know what will be the functions of that office or how it will relate to the existing local authorities.  Legislation is required.  When is it intended to publish it and is it planned to enact it before the end of 2009?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Heads of the Bill are expected later this year.  The intention is to meet whatever timelines are envisaged. </P>
        <P>The parties in government have approved the legislative programme for Government.  There will be plenty of opportunities for debate on the issues arising from the programme in Question Time and in economic debates.  In the weeks immediately ahead the Government is anxious to proceed with its heavy legislative programme and schedule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>We wake up daily to hear news reports of the most vicious and depraved assaults on elderly people, particularly in rural areas in every part of the country.  What package of measures is available in the programme for Government initiated two years ago to deal with the increase in crime?  Experts say that there is a direct link between an economic downturn and an increase in burglaries and other crime.</P>
        <P>The Government recently rejected a Fine Gael Bill on home defence on the basis that it was bringing forward its own legislation, particulars of which we have not seen.  It has indicated that it will continue to downgrade Garda stations around the country.  If the recommendations of the McCarthy report are implemented, most rural Garda stations will close.  Many Garda stations are open for only one hour in the morning, a token presence.  The Government has <Col N="789"/>discontinued the subvention for an alarm and safety system for older people.  What package of measures does the Government plan to address the problem of communities living in fear for their personal safety and that of their property, and their loved ones and family members?  How long more must we tolerate a situation in which lawlessness seems to be the order of the day?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions about particular policy areas are best addressed to the line Ministers.  The Government is committed to providing the maximum resources possible to the Garda in the current circumstances.  There have been many successes in targeting anti-social behaviour and protecting people in their homes.  There have also been some serious incidents which have unfortunately resulted in deaths.  This reinforces the continuing efforts of the garda&iacute; to identify those groups or gangs who target or seek to victimise the elderly whether in urban settings or in rural areas.  The Garda regards this as a matter of high priority and conducts continuous surveillance to identify and apprehend the people involved in this appalling cowardly and despicable behaviour. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment.  </P>
        <P>A report on cystic fibrosis was published yesterday by the HSE which confirms the scandalous failure of the Government and the HSE to provide the essential facilities necessary for those who suffer from CF.  Will that report be debated in the House?  Will the Taoiseach confirm or clarify whether it is correct that the report was commissioned in 2005, concluded in 2006 and suppressed by the HSE until yesterday?  On what basis can the cover up of a report of this nature, prepared with public money, which exposes the gross neglect of services be justified?  Does the Taoiseach agree his Government and the Minister for Health and Children are responsible for a series of promises made to provide proper services in this area?  They have not been fulfilled, have directly resulted in the premature death of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and have placed other patients at very serious risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, these are policy queries and best addressed to the line Ministers concerned.  Without notice I certainly would not have all the detail.  Obviously,  seeking to assist people who suffer from cystic fibrosis must be a continuing effort by those charged with the responsibility for providing services.  There have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a total failure to provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept there has been a total failure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a plethora of reports highlighting this fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in replying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his first day in office and I assure him that we humble backbenchers will do our best to make it as interesting as possible for him during his sojourn in the Chair.</P>
        <P>Will the Ceann Comhairle, and perhaps through him, the Taoiseach, address a very serious issue that has developed over recent years, namely, that, on an increasingly prevalent basis, Ministers refuse to answer questions on the basis that they are not accountable to the House?  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to bear with me for 30 seconds.  The Departments to which this applies most particularly are the Department of Health and Children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a long list of Members who wish to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="790"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This concerns promised legislation and the business of the House.  The Departments of Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, more recently, Transport, have crept into the area of repeated refusals to answer questions.  A problem that has emerged in recent weeks is that, because of a lack of accountability to this House, certain embarrassing issues have arisen, precisely because there was no plan or attempt by different Ministers to answer the question.  There was, in fact, a complete refusal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must remember &mdash; as a long-serving Member of this House the Ceann Comhairle will know this better than anybody &mdash; that for every penny approved by a Department to a subsidiary body of any kind, the Minister concerned is responsible to this House.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan, have we legislation in question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we have.  I ask the Taoiseach, through the Ceann Comhairle, to address this issue before these problems become much more serious than they are now.  They could not be more serious.  Will legislation be introduced or will the Taoiseach incorporate these proposals into legislation already on the Order Paper with a view to ensuring that from now Ministers will answer the questions they are asked?  For example, the chief executive of the HSE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;should come into this Chamber to answer questions because we cannot get answers to questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan, I suggest that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the same way, the chief executive of F&Aacute;S should have been here to answer questions in the past four or five years.  We would have received answers to questions and would not have had these problems.  I ask the Taoiseach if something can be done about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s specific question is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.  It is a matter for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges soon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We shall move on.  I call Deputy Billy Timmins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no promised legislation in this area.  It is possible for the committee system to bring any people charged with public bodies to come to the House and be cross-examined on a range of issues.  That is ongoing.  Where there are issues of policy, obviously a Minister is responsible.  In operational matters, agencies are established by this House and given that statutory responsibility.  It is of course incumbent on all such bodies to provide effective response to representations from Deputies and to assist them in every way so that they and we can discharge our democratic duties.  That issue has been commented upon by Members of this House and I would like to see it rectified to their satisfaction.  Ultimately, the situation is that we have a committee system through which people are brought forward and <Col N="791"/>cross-examined on various operational matters and this is being done effectively by Deputies. However, to bring people into the Chamber on the Order of Business concerning promised legislation is not the way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Ceann Comhairle received any notices from members of the Labour Party who wish to raise matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to the Labour Party now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>They were slow out of the traps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Joan Burton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle called me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall call Deputy Timmins in a moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House when the Government proposes to commence Committee Stage of the NAMA legislation?  Second, I ask the Taoiseach and his Government to give serious consideration to having this most important legislation dealt with in this Chamber.  The committee rooms are small and there are many Members of all parties who wish to contribute on Committee Stage.  It is almost impossible to do that in the basement rooms available.  </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach spoke yesterday about Committee Stage of this Bill being structured like a Finance Bill, in which an hour or two will be devoted to ten or 15 sections.  That means that if the Bill runs, as it will do by the time the Minister&rsquo;s amendments come in, probably to more than 100 sections, each section of five or six will have a mini-guillotine.  What does this mean in respect of the Government&rsquo;s commitment that every aspect of this Bill will be debated?</P>
        <P Just="Left">When will Members see the amendments of the Minister for Finance?  I am told these may run to hundreds of pages and it is extremely difficult for the Opposition to operate in an environment where we have no prior notification from the Minister for Finance on legislation that will cost all of us &euro;54 billion and rising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I make the point that the cost to our financial system of not dealing with this issue is far greater.  To suggest we are not making arrangements to ensure that the interests of the taxpayer are being protected in this matter is a gross distortion of the situation.  Second, regarding the actual arrangements, it is anticipated that Committee Stage will be taken in the weeks beginning 21 and 27 October, pending the agreement I arranged with the Chairman of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  It will be a matter for that committee to order its business and decide how to accommodate the point made yesterday, namely, that where specific stages are relevant and possible amendments on specific sections that would be of particular importance, there would be a fair bit of debate.  As I understand it, that is what is envisaged and it is the way to proceed.</P>
        <P>We have to get on with this legislation.  It is difficult and complex and provides a heavy workload for everybody but it must be proceeded with.  We will do that and accommodate everything in the very best way we can in the interests of trying to debate those sections of the Bill that are of major concern to people and seeing that amendments are put forward and debated.  We do not have unlimited time because of the urgency of the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="792"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Very briefly, Deputy Burton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has been very helpful and the matter of how this will work is very important.  Did the Taoiseach say that Committee Stage would commence on 21 October?  If that is the case, we must have our amendments in by 10 a.m.  Second Stage of the Bill is being voted on only tonight.  It would be impossible.  We would not even have a chance to hear what the Minister for Finance proposes.  Can I get clarification from the Whip about the proposed date?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is envisaged to begin Committee Stage in the week beginning 21 October.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is so, will the Whip clarify whether we must have all our amendments in by 10 a.m.?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Whip will talk to the Deputy about that.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach will be aware that an Irish citizen, Mr. Michael Dwyer was shot in unusual circumstances in Santa Cruz in Bolivia in April.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the family is at least entitled to the truth surrounding the circumstances of Mr. Dwyer&rsquo;s death?

	<P>I wish to ask about 772 people who are living in what are de-designated psychiatric units and 300 people with intellectual disabilities who are still in psychiatric hospitals.  In respect of the 772, the units are not subject to inspections because they have been de-designated and, therefore, no one knows their condition or how the situation should proceed.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that not only will the HIQA standards of inspection be implemented, but that inspections be extended to these units?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach intervene to ensure that the &euro;40 million obtained by selling psychiatric hospital lands that is now in the Department of Finance be given to the HSE to provide proper services for those people, as was intended under the legislation?  The money derived from the sale of lands was to be used for the benefit of people already in psychiatric hospitals.</P>

I know this is the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s first day and we are all anxious that everything should go well, but I tabled questions on all of these issues and was <Col N="794"/>told that the HSE not the Minister for Health and Children had responsibility.  However, the HSE tells me that it is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  In the meantime, 772 unfortunate people are living in appalling conditions when they could be in the community and 300 people with intellectual disabilities are in wards mixing with people unsuited to their needs.  When will we do something about this situation?</P>

	<P>In the first instance, I join with others in wishing the Ceann Comhairle well in his office.  I hope I do not test his patience on his first day.  I am not anxious to delay the business of the House but I want to make one remark about something the Taoiseach said earlier.  He mentioned the Government&rsquo;s heavy legislative workload.  By way of being positive, I ask if the Taoiseach would consider the outsourcing of the preparation of legislation.  A number of Bills on the proposed legislative list have been put back.  I say this because there has been&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are retracking on previous questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Not so.  I can assure the Ceann Comhairle that people may not even agree with what I have to say.  If the Government wanted to eliminate the legislative backlog the Taoiseach could announce that he was willing to give up the Government monopoly on the initiation of legislation and allow legislation to be initiated by the Opposition and in committees.  I am not going to develop this point because instead of going down that road we have a rather ill-informed rush to change the electoral system.  What is the reasoning behind this?  It is not to change the legislative process.  I am just noting this point.</P><Col N="796"/>
        <P>I refer to a seminal paper prepared by former Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, which ruled that Ministers in delegating functions to bodies such as the HSE or any other body, did so in an explicit policy envelope and could not legally, under the Constitution, devolve any function they held as Minister other than that which was specified in the Act appointing the particular body to which delegation was made.  This should inform the notion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we come to the question, please Deputy. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as to when is it appropriate to ask a question. </P>
        <P>I will finish with an explicit question about promised legislation.  Ireland has not ratified the<b> </b>Hague Convention on the protection of the child.  We have not done so because we have not passed the adoption Bill which is on the list of promised legislation.  Our failure to ratify the adoption Bill is accompanied by the failure of Vietnam to accept the Hague Convention.  Vietnam aspires to accept the Hague Convention in 2010.  It is most likely to be 2011&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Deputy is drifting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am finishing now.  My question is when will we have the adoption Bill and related legislation before the House?  When I have listened to all the huff and puff about electoral reform from people who do not want to change the legislative process I will find another way of stating those other more general views.  However, it is a pity that we would not be committed to wanting to improve the flow of legislation through the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his question.  It is hoped to take the adoption Bill in November.</P>
        <P>On the other points raised by the Deputy, the issue from the Government&rsquo;s point of view is always to bring forward legislation that is consistent with Government policy.  Much legislation is brought forward under the aegis of Private Members&rsquo; time and this is the entitlement of any party or individual Member but such legislation may not be consistent with the Government position and therefore does not go beyond Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is another British convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is part of our heritage with which we have to contend.  However, it is open to try and develop the committee system.  Where there are broad areas of agreement in the House on issues that may require legislative enactment, then it is open to Members to try and work constructively together.  Too often, however, partisanship dominates and it seems people would be fearful that we would be in agreement on certain things.  In fact we probably agree on far more than we let on.  It would be helpful if D&aacute;il reform could develop a committee system to do that.</P>
        <P>There is an arrangement whereby outside drafting personnel are provided but in any case such work must be finally approved by the officials in the Office of the Attorney General.  Having taken a question from the Deputy&rsquo;s party leader this morning and with reference to February 2008 when this question was asked, there are now more drafting personnel in the <Col N="797"/>Office of the Attorney General.  It is the policy to move away over time from contract to permanent staff.  This has been achieved even in the context of a moratorium and by means of the office not employing certain staff in other areas of activity.  The point is made that we need to be efficient and effective in everything we do.  I agree the legislative work load is high.  We could do a lot more by working together but we need eminent Members of the House on all sides to come together and try and make this happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in wishing the Ceann Comhairle the very best in his term of office.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the animal health and welfare Bill which is listed in section C of promised legislation, the heads of Bills yet to be approved by Government.  I ask about some of the so-called concessions agreed between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party last week with regard to animal welfare.  These are included in what is termed the programme for Government but I would refer to it as an aspirational policy document.  What does the Taoiseach intend will be included in this Bill?  That document sets out the prospect of a ban on the culling of badgers, the phasing out of fur hunting and a reference to ending stag hunting.  We are not quite clear on the time line for this.  Will it be included in the Bill which is set out in promised legislation?  Does the Taoiseach believe this is a serious series of measures for improving animal welfare or will it be just more window dressing which will not deal with real animal welfare issues?  For example, my colleague, Deputy Andrew Doyle, today raised the issue of puppy farming which takes place in horrendous conditions and all around the country but which does not seem to have been included in the aspirational document last week.</P>
        <P>These proposals have been much vaunted by the Green Party as one of the biggest achievements in the so-called programme for Government yet the document does not go any way towards addressing the real and serious issues of animal welfare.  It also probably suggests that the Greens in Government, far from being the meat in the sandwich are probably a little more like the hummus within the toasted ciabatta.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>To answer the serious point, consultation has been completed on an animal welfare Bill.  There is no date for bringing forward the legislation but work will be ongoing on the Bill, quite apart from further issues that are addressed in the programme for Government.</P>

        <P>Regarding the forthcoming budget and finance Bill, there is no reference to the Limerick regeneration project in the so-called new programme for Government whereas the original programme for Government made specific mention of regeneration projects.  Also, there is no mention of it in the report of the jobs task force established by the T&aacute;naiste.  Is the Minister still committed to Limerick regeneration?  Why was it not included in the new programme for <Col N="798"/>Government?  When will it be approved at Cabinet?  I understand there is a commitment that it will happen towards the end of this month.  The regeneration programme for Limerick is still not formal Government policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The whole range of Government activity is not encapsulated in any one programme for Government and that applies to any Government.</P>

I had to have a cold cloth applied to my forehead because I was so worn out simply watching it.  At 1 o&rsquo;clock an additional 300 teachers was agreed to but he got it ramped up to 500 by tea time and we are all very grateful for that.  I wish to avail of this opportunity to ask the Taoiseach to respond to queries we have received.  Will any of those teachers be recruited during the present academic year?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is over a three year programme.  As the Deputy is aware the question of the detailed implementation of the programme is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science.  As a general point, the question of allocation of teachers in any year is based on the <Col N="799"/>intake of the previous September, as the Deputy is aware.  The question is to establish in what way we can deal with any specific issues that arise based on criteria which are to be worked out by the Department.  That will inform how those extra teachers will be provided for and it is quite apart from the extra teachers that will be provided because of demographic change.  It is a commitment for a further improvement in the situation based on the changes that took place in 2007.</P>

	<P>I join with my colleagues in wishing the Ceann Comhairle well in his new post.  I refer to the commitment about third level fees in the programme for Government.  Will a cap be put on the registration fee?  There is great concern among people who must pay a &euro;1,500 registration fee.  Will that figure rise?  The Taoiseach represents a rural constituency, as do I.  People from rural areas have very significant registration fees to pay plus accommodation costs and such people are under desperate pressure.  There are many families with children in college throughout the country.  Is it possible that at some stage in the future people will get tax concessions or that they would be able to write costs off against tax?  It is very unfair, especially for rural people.  Is there a commitment that the Taoiseach will cap the fee after &euro;1,500 and will it be possible to get tax concessions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the programme for Government which confirms the situation in respect of fees.  The question of registration fees relates to specific areas of expense that must be accommodated.  That situation is outlined in the programme.</P>

	<P>If accepted, section 7 would read: &ldquo;A prisoner or other person who is lawfully in the custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may be placed in temporary custody&rdquo;.  This suggests a person is lawfully in the custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is the opposite of the actual position.  In fact it would constitute a material change as it would have the effect of excluding prisoners in the custody of a governor.  I understand what the proposed amendment seeks to achieve.  However, it creates the difficulty which I outlined above.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt> <P>It is possible to avoid the problem by amending the wording to read: &ldquo;A prisoner or person who is lawfully in the custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;.  However, for two reasons such an amendment is unnecessary, as Deputy Rabbitte has already pointed out.  First, the term &ldquo;other person&rdquo; in section 7 clearly means a person in the lawful custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The only people who can be placed in temporary custody under section 6(1) are prisoners and persons lawfully in the custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 6(2).  The term &ldquo;person&rdquo; is used elsewhere in the Part to mean a person lawfully in the custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 8(2) and the amendment to section 9 proposed by the Government.  In both cases the cross-reference to section 6(2) makes clear that the person will be lawfully in the custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In view of these points, the Minister has directed that he is opposed to the Labour Party amendment.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to describe the context of this Bill.  F&Aacute;S, as the national training and employment authority, has the remit to provide a range of proactive job-related services, supports and programmes to assist individuals to remain in and return to the labour market.  The agency also promotes workforce development by upgrading the competencies and qualifications of individuals and by providing and facilitating targeted training programmes and services to both employees and especially to the unemployed.  F&Aacute;S, as such, is a key agency in the Government&rsquo;s plan to fight unemployment and ensure that workers do not become distanced from the labour market.</P>
        <P>Last month, the live register fell by 16,500 people.  This was a welcome development and was the first decrease in the live register figures since September 2008.  However, despite this decrease, 423,600 people remain on the live register and the Government is committed to continuing to provide these individuals with the necessary assistance during this difficult period so that they can return to work as quickly as possible.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>On an ongoing basis, significant numbers of unemployed persons leave the live register.  From October 2008 to September 2009, some 150,530 people are recorded as leaving to commence employment.  This is a positive trend that shows there are still jobs available and that the Government&rsquo;s activation measures are assisting the unemployed to develop their skills and secure employment.</P>
        <P>In that context, I would like to highlight some of the achievements of F&Aacute;S in 2008 in order to illustrate the scale of work being carried out by the organisation.  Under training in employment, 26,100 apprentices were trained to meet future craft skills needs.  In addition, some 32,400 employees were upskilled in priority skill areas, including management skills and ICT.  Under training for the unemployed, 7,900 people received specific skills training, while 12,800 received training in foundation skills.</P>
        <P>Under employment programmes, 24,400 people were on a community employment or job initiative programme as at 31 December 2008.  Under employment services, F&Aacute;S employment services received notification of 96,000 job vacancies.  Some 60,000 were referred to F&Aacute;S in 2008 from the live register of which 41,000 were interviewed and approximately 34,000 had left the live register by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I am working closely with my colleagues, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to ensure that appropriate responses are developed and put in place to meet the upskilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.</P>
        <P>The fact that there were problems in one area in F&Aacute;S does not in any way reflect the work of the majority of F&Aacute;S staff, who are hardworking and committed to their role in supporting those who avail of the training or employment activities of the organisation.  I would like to acknowledge the excellent work carried out by them.  Their commitment and professionalism are crucial in helping us to deal with the key labour market challenges currently facing this country.</P>
        <P>Effective governance in any organisation is fundamental to efficient and cost-effective delivery of services.  Effective governance flows from the board of an organisation and it is with this in mind that I propose to make a number of structural changes to streamline the board of F&Aacute;S.  It is my intention that the board will comprise members who have the necessary expertise and competencies to lead F&Aacute;S proactively in the current economic environment.</P>
        <P>It is against this background that I am bringing the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009 before the House for its consideration.  This Bill is part of my response to ensure that F&Aacute;S is fit for purpose and operates under the highest standards of corporate governance.</P>
        <P>I propose to offer some general observations on the rationale and general principles informing the content of this amending legislation, and then proceed to summarise the provisions of the Bill.  I appreciate that Members will have greater opportunity to explore the provisions in more detail on Committee Stage, to which I look forward.</P>
        <P>The Labour Services Act 1987, which established F&Aacute;S, was enacted more than 20 years ago and in that intervening period there has been a sea change in the worlds of corporate governance and public service ethics.  One of my aims in this Bill is to introduce current best practice in these areas into legislation in order to improve and update the corporate governance structure in F&Aacute;S.  The Bill also takes account of the recommendations contained in the Committee of Public Accounts&rsquo; fourth interim report on special report No. 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General and F&Aacute;S 2007 accounts, and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P><Col N="802"/>
        <P>The board of F&Aacute;S as it is currently constituted is considered large and unwieldy by any standards.  Therefore, I propose to reduce the size of the board from 17 to 11 members, including the chair.  As part of this process, I also intend to change the composition of the board.  The board will be appointed on the basis of relevant experience and competencies in areas such as the functions of F&Aacute;S, finance, corporate governance and public administration.  This will be a move away from the current system where a number of board members are nominated by bodies not accountable to the Oireachtas.  In addition, the Bill provides for a system of rolling appointments and resignations of board members.  Experience has shown that this system has the dual benefit of preserving corporate knowledge and, at the same time, bringing new ideas to a board.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will appoint the members of the board in consultation with the Minster for Education and Science and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>I also propose to include the director general of F&Aacute;S as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board as is standard practice in other agencies under my remit, such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  The inclusion of the director general on the board of F&Aacute;S will improve the lines of communication between the executive and the board.  This will assist the board in its deliberations on often complex and varied matters.</P>
        <P>At present, there is considered to be a lack of clarity around the accountability of the director general of F&Aacute;S to the Oireachtas.  In order to resolve this matter, I have included provisions in the Bill which set out quite clearly the accountability of the director general to the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has a significant annual budget and it is important that its spending is directed in a way that is both transparent and provides value for money.  External contractors provide a number of services to F&Aacute;S and it is in this context that I have included provisions in the Bill that will prohibit staff and board members from engaging in procurement matters where a conflict of interest exists.  These provisions also provide for appropriate penalties where these rules are broken, including dismissal for members of staff and the removal from the board of board members.</P>
        <P>Wrongdoing can take place in large organisations in both the public and private sectors, even where proper internal financial control structures are put in place.  It is against this background that I also considered it important to include provisions in the Bill that would protect bona fide whistleblowers from reporting wrongdoing at any level within the organisation.</P>
        <P>I now propose to summarise the main provision of the Bill and these will be examined in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides that the director general of F&Aacute;S shall be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  He shall, when required, give evidence to the committee on the regularity and propriety of the following: transactions recorded in any accounts of F&Aacute;S subject to audit; the economy and efficiency of F&Aacute;S in the uses of its resources; the systems and procedures employed by F&Aacute;S for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of its operations; and any matters affecting F&Aacute;S in a special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>As is the norm in these provisions, the director general shall not express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government.  Section 5 provides that the director general of F&Aacute;S shall be accountable to all other committees of the Oireachtas.  This section provides for the him or her to attend any committee appointed by either or both Houses of Oireachtas and give an account in respect of matters concerning the general admini<Col N="803"/>stration of F&Aacute;S that fall within the terms of reference of that committee.  This section also provides that the director general is not required to attend to give an account to an Oireachtas committee of any matter that he or she is of the opinion has been, is or is likely to be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State unless, on foot of an application by that committee, the High Court determines otherwise.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for a number of requirements relating to disclosure and conflicts of interests in respect of the members of the board and staff of F&Aacute;S.  Under the provisions of this section, a board member must declare a material interest in any matter relating to a contract or arrangement that comes before the board.  Following such a declaration, he or she must absent himself or herself from the meeting, take no part in any deliberation on the matter and not vote on a decision relating to the matter.  Similar provisions are included in this section in regard to staff members in F&Aacute;S.  A staff member must disclose any material interest that he has in any potential agreement, contract or arrangement and must not take part in any negotiations or deliberations on this matter.  In addition, he or she must not influence or seek to influence or make recommendations on the matter.  The legislation provides that where a staff member contravenes this section, F&Aacute;S may take appropriate action against that person including termination of that person&rsquo;s contract.  The sanction against board members who contravene the provisions of this section is contained in section 9 and provides for the removal of the board member by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides protection from civil liability to employees of F&Aacute;S who make a bona fide report of offences being committed under any enactment or any serious wrongdoing being committed in regard to F&Aacute;S to the Garda or a member of the board.  It also provides protection to employees who report contraventions to the Minister of directions given by the Minister.  This section introduces a prohibition on the penalisation of employees who report offences being committed, serious wrongdoing or contraventions of ministerial directions.  Penalisation in the context of this section means suspension, lay-off or dismissal or the threat of suspension, lay-off or dismissal; demotion or loss of opportunity for promotion; transfer of duties, change of location of place of work, reduction in wages or changes in working hours; imposition of any discipline, reprimand or other penalty; and coercion or intimidation.  This section also makes it an offence for staff members of F&Aacute;S to make reports in bad faith to the Garda, members of the board or the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for redress for penalisation contrary to the provisions contained in section 7.  This section sets out the structure by which an employee of F&Aacute;S may seek redress if he or she is of the view that he or she is being penalised for reporting wrongdoing in the organisation.  Employees may make a complaint to a Rights Commissioner if they consider that they are being penalised by F&Aacute;S for reporting breaches of legislation or serious wrongdoing relating to the organisation.  Following investigation of the complaint, the Rights Commissioner will make a decision on the matter.  Either party may appeal the decision of the commissioner to the Labour Court.  Where F&Aacute;S does not carry out the terms of the decision of the Rights Commissioner, the employee may bring a complaint before the Labour Court to seek a determination to have the terms of that decision effected.  In the further event that F&Aacute;S fails to carry out the terms of the Labour Court determination, the employee may make a complaint to the Circuit Court for an order directing the organisation to carry out the determination in accordance with its terms.</P>
        <P>Section 8 is an amendment to section 13 of the Labour Services Act 1987 to provide for the removal of the prohibition on the disclosure of information obtained by a member of the board in the course of his or her duties in certain circumstances.  The current legislation prohibits the disclosure of information with limited exceptions.  This amendment will permit the disclosure of information specifically to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and will <Col N="804"/>remove any doubt about there being a legal barrier to a member of the board reporting issues of concern to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides for restructuring the board of F&Aacute;S in a number of ways.  The board is considered large in comparison to many non-commercial semi-State boards and, to streamline the board, it is proposed to reduce its size from 17  to 11, including the director general as an <i>ex officio</i> member and a chairman.  The Bill will provide for a departure from the current model of 17 members where nominations can be made by other bodies to a model of 11 members where the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in consultation with the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Education and Science, will select the chairman and nine ordinary members based on their ability and experience, the other member being the director general.  Due to a reduction in the size of the board, the quorum for a meeting will be reduced from nine to seven.  Nominations to the board will be based on relevant experience and competencies in the following areas: the functions of F&Aacute;S or finance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration.  Membership of the board will be limited to two terms of not more than five years each.  In addition, to facilitate the development of fresh ideas and experience, this section provides for a rolling system of appointments to the board.</P>
        <P>This section also includes a provision to amend paragraph 12 of the First Schedule of the Labour Services Act 1987.  The purpose of this amendment is to update and strengthen the regulations surrounding the dismissal of a member of the board and it is in keeping with current legislation in this area.  The amendment provides that the Minister may remove a member of the board for the following reasons &mdash; the member is not adequately performing his functions; a material conflict of interest exists in the performance by the member of his or her functions; the removal of a member is necessary or expedient for the effective performance by F&Aacute;S of its functions; or a member of the board has contravened the provisions relating to disclosure of interest as provided for in section 6.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for the repeal of Part II of the Schedule to Labour Services Act 1987, as employees of F&Aacute;S will no longer be appointed to the board following election as described in the Schedule.</P>
        <P>Members will have greater opportunity to explore the Bill&rsquo;s provisions in more detail on Committee Stage, something to which I look forward.  The Bill will require technical drafting amendments, which I propose to bring forward on Committee Stage.  My introduction of this legislation sends a clear message to the public and to F&Aacute;S itself that I want to restore public confidence in its ability to deliver its training and employment mandate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.</P>
        <P>We will not oppose the Bill but we will table amendments.  The Bill has five functions &mdash; to reform the board of F&Aacute;S; to require the disclosure of the interests of board members; to protect whistleblowers; to make the director general responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts and other relevant Oireachtas committees; and to give the Minister the power to remove board members for underperformance or, where it is expedient, to ensure the functions of F&Aacute;S are performed properly.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed changes to the board, it makes sense to reduce the number of members from 17 to 11, including the director general.  One of the flaws in the structure of the board is that, by and large, it is a representative board with members representing different sectional interests.  A culture whereby board members represent the interests of the organisation is not in place and making 11 appointments without restricting them to different sectors <Col N="805"/>is appropriate.  I do not say it may be inappropriate for some members to have a trade union or business background but that should be left to the discretion of the Minister and the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Provisions should still be made for the election of a worker director.  I am not clear as to why such a provision has been removed.  I will table an amendment to reinstate at least one worker director.  Proper Oireachtas scrutiny of the appointments is not provided for, although the programme for Government contains two sets to proposals to allow Oireachtas committees to make nominations to boards and a new appointments system, which will be subject to future legislation to be agreed by the Government parties.  However, this legislation represents an opportunity to pre-empt these changes by providing for proper Oireachtas scrutiny of all appointments made by the Minister or to give the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment the opportunity to make nominations.  I expect the support of the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il for this, given it is mentioned in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The provision requiring disclosure of interests is valuable and the protection of whistleblowers, provided for in section 7, is important, given much of what we have learned about the scandals in F&Aacute;S has come from decent, honest, hardworking employees, like most of those who work for the organisation, who were appalled by the behaviour of their superiors and the inaction of board members and Ministers.  They blew the whistle in regard to much of this and it is welcome that there is protection for whistle-blowers in the legislation.  We should have a single item of legislation that protects all whistle-blowers but I welcome the measure in this Bill.</P>
        <P>I am also happy with sections 4 and 5, which make the director general responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts and to the other Oireachtas committees.</P>
        <P>I agree with section 8, which gives the Minister power to remove board members for non-performance or where it is expedient to ensure the functions of F&Aacute;S are carried out properly.  There should also be provision for the Minister to dismiss executives of F&Aacute;S for the same reasons because it is the executives in F&Aacute;S who have done the most wrong, not the board members.  It is right that the board has resigned but the primary wrongs were done by executives who remain in place.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, should have the power to dismiss those people for the same reasons she would be enabled to dismiss board members.</P>
        <P>In terms of political responsibility, and it is important to talk about responsibility when it comes to F&Aacute;S, at least five members of the Cabinet must take some responsibility for the scandal, mess and waste that has gone on in F&Aacute;S.  They are the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health and Children.  The T&aacute;naiste has largely treated F&Aacute;S as a bad media story that she wanted to go away.  There has yet to be root and branch reform of F&Aacute;S, and that is what is missing from this Bill.</P>
        <P>As far back as May 2008 when we first raised concerns about this issue we were told that F&Aacute;S had changed its procedures and strengthened its controls.  We were told the board had the confidence of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, but about two weeks ago that changed for reasons that remain unclear.</P>
        <P>Issues have arisen also regarding the retirement package for Mr. Molloy and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s role in approving it.  An issue also arises to do with Mr. Molloy being allowed to keep his car and whether the T&aacute;naiste gave the board of F&Aacute;S any advice or direction on that.  We still do not have an answer.</P>
        <P>Another issue arises concerning the role of the Taoiseach in this, who said in July 2008, with regard to Rody Molloy, that he depends on him at all times and would defend him at all times.  In fairness to him, he still does that.  At least he is consistent, but the Taoiseach&rsquo;s relationship with senior people in F&Aacute;S is a matter of concern, as is the fact that he defended him a year ago, and continues to defend him.</P><Col N="806"/>
        <P>We must also ask about the role of the Minister for Finance.  In response to a parliamentary question put down by me specifically asking about the very generous &euro;1.1 million retirement package given to Mr. Molloy, the Minister for Finance stated: &ldquo;I was advised orally by my officials about the final package and having confirmed that it was within the guidelines I did not object to [them]&rdquo;.  We have since learned from documents made available under the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, misled the D&aacute;il in that regard.  According to Mr. John O&rsquo;Connell, the assistant secretary in the Department of Finance, he informed the Minister that the package given to Mr. Molloy was not fully in accordance with the guidelines and was, therefore, an exceptional case.  It is important that the Minister for Finance comes into the D&aacute;il and explains the reason he misled me and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with regard to his reply on that matter.</P>
        <P>We should not forget the role of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who were both Ministers for a long time at that Department.  They were given some of the information that had been circulating for a long time, did not act on it and went along with what was going on in F&Aacute;S.  They went on the trips, were entertained and essentially were very well looked after by F&Aacute;S.  They did not try to change the structures in F&Aacute;S in any way or bring about any of the reforms that, in fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, she is now trying to introduce.  It appears there is an overly comfortable cosy relationship between senior Fianna F&aacute;il politicians and senior executives at F&Aacute;S, and I am not yet convinced we have the full story about that or that it has changed.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that this Bill is a missed opportunity to start from scratch and examine the Labour Services Act from first principles by asking ourselves what type of national employment and training agency we want.  I was interested to see that when some of the research papers relating to F&Aacute;S were distributed, and I thank the Oireachtas Library for this information, among them was one from 2005 by a professor of political studies in California who studied F&Aacute;S.  He made four excellent points, the third of which was that F&Aacute;S enjoyed relative immunity from criticism, including research-based criticism.  That was the case, and it was the case for too long.  He accurately described it as the &ldquo;Swiss army knife of the Irish State: a highly flexible, multi-functional instrument used to address a myriad of policy problems from high-tech skill shortages to functional illiteracy&rdquo;.  Therein was the problem.  This organisation was essentially being given the job of doing everything, and that was never going to be sustainable.</P>
        <P>Somebody else described F&Aacute;S previously as an octopus &mdash; a body with a small brain, invertebrate, omnivorous and using an ink-based defence when attacked.  The writer in this case described that ink-based defence as glossy brochures, publications and leaflets but we now know that the ink-based defence went much further.  It went into very generous advertising contracts for all sorts of commercial and other interests.  I am referring to an independent research paper published as far back as 2005, yet it was not acted on.</P>
        <P>We can even go back to 1992 when the Culliton report proposed radical reform of F&Aacute;S.  Essentially, it argued that the multi-objective nature of F&Aacute;S was hindering its efforts to focus on training in industry and recommended that F&Aacute;S should be divided into two sections &mdash; a social economy section that would train people in work and a section that would train people for work.</P>
        <P>Referring to the document published in 2005, the two core criticisms of F&Aacute;S are the same.  First, F&Aacute;S is unable to carry out such a multiplicity of functions and, second, its parent department is unable to control F&Aacute;S.  I do not believe this Bill will change that.  We still have an agency that is trying to do everything ranging from social employment and training the unem<Col N="807"/>ployed with no skills to fourth level education.  We will still have a very large agency with a very big budget that is not properly under the control of the parent department.</P>
        <P>I was interested to find out how far F&Aacute;S dates back historically.  Deputy Bertie Ahern gets the credit for establishing F&Aacute;S, but it was the FitzGerald-Spring coalition Government that was responsible.  It was an initiative of Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn who then envisaged a slightly different organisation, NETA, a national economic and training agency.  That model would have been a better one and had that Government stayed in office, the agency would not have been established in the way it was done by the subsequent Minister with responsibility for labour.</P>
        <P>We need to return to the original first principles of the Quinn legislation introduced in 1986.  We should also consider reversing the reforms that were brought in by the then Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, when she had responsibility for that agency.  She doubled the number of directors in the agency from 15 to 30.  The T&aacute;naiste is now reducing the size of the board, which is welcome, but do we need 30 directors in F&Aacute;S?  Would 15 not be adequate?  Could we not return to the structure that was in place prior to when the Minister, Deputy Harney, inflated the size of Government by doubling the number of administrators, which is interesting when one contrasts what she did in F&Aacute;S to her rhetoric?  It is very different.  We also must consider returning to the regional structures and giving them more autonomy within F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Bill does not contain any political vision or strategy as to the type of training agency we want.  The agency has a new chief executive officer, it will have a new board and some improvements in procedures will be made, but no fundamental change in the agency is proposed.</P>
        <P>Turning to the agency&rsquo;s budget, the employment programmes and community employment schemes cost &euro;430 million a year.  They have an important social role and should be continued.  They provide a valuable service to individuals and communities but should that be the job of F&Aacute;S?  Would that not be more appropriately done at local government level?  The F&Aacute;S corporate budget and regional directorates cost &euro;150 million a year.  Some of that allocation is questionable, and that money could be spent better elsewhere.  Apprenticeships and training and integration cost &euro;108 million a year.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if he directed the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to value its property portfolio using a valuation methodology being used by the National Asset Management Agency instead of current market value; if he is satisfied with the approach taken by the DDDA to value the property portfolio; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36113/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not issued any direction to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority on this or any other matter.  Recognising the current difficulties in securing an appropriate and realistic valua<Col N="808"/>tion of property assets under the present extraordinary market conditions, my Department and the Department of Finance met with representatives of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in July.  It was agreed that the authority would await the publication of the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 and also have regard to the guidance for the treatment of impaired assets, prepared by the European Commission and the European Central Bank, in valuing its property assets.</P>
        <P>The intention was that the authority should have access to the most up-to-date guidance on this issue in finalising its annual accounts for 2008.  The valuation of its assets in the accounts is a matter for the authority; the accounts are prepared in compliance with relevant accounting standards and are audited by independent auditors.  I understand that the annual accounts for 2008 are now being finalised within the authority and will be submitted to me in the coming days, following which I will bring them to the attention of the Government and arrange to have them laid before both Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of any other agency in his Department which produces an annual report without submitting annual accounts at the same time?  Is the Minister in favour of using current market value when it comes to the accounts of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and its various sites or is he in favour of the new NAMA methodology as outlined by the chairman?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the position of other agencies but I will address the question of whether I favour current market value.  If the Deputy is referring to the NAMA way of doing business, it is current market value plus a premium.  I understand, and I believe it already has been in the public domain, that the site we are referring to has been written down by approximately 85%, if one is to believe reports seen in the newspapers.  I have not received the accounts yet but I understand that is roughly accurate.</P>
        <P>There has been significant depreciation in that site, which is to be expected under the current conditions, as we are in extraordinary times and this site was bought at the very height of the boom.  We are now at the lowest end of the market.  It is to be expected.  I hope to receive the full accounts and Deputy Hogan will have the opportunity to go through them in detail.  No doubt he will then have the opportunity to put questions pertaining to those accounts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be aware that the decision to use a new valuation model for the 2008 accounts of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, based on NAMA valuations and methodologies, is a departure.  The Minister is wrong when he says it is consistent with good accounting standards.  Accounting standards state that valuation methodologies must be fair, true and consistent from one year to the next.  Is the Minister concerned about this departure on the basis that all the agencies with land under his remit could be treated in a different way for valuation purposes than heretofore?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not at all concerned.  I understand these valuations have been carried out by the reputable valuers Lisneys, who have said that the valuation of this particular site has gone down by as much as 85%.  Listening to what some people have said about NAMA, one might think the decrease is 50% but in this case it is not; the figure is 85%, which is unprecedented but the truth of the matter and nothing can be done about it.</P>
        <P>The Deputy would be far better off under the circumstances awaiting the publication of the accounts.  As I have said to the House, they will be laid before the Houses.  I am very concerned about governance issues pertaining to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and I have appointed a chairperson of calibre who understands the question of corporate governance. <Col N="809"/> That person has been complimented by the Deputy and will do a very thorough job.  The Deputy can be assured that no stone will be left unturned on any matter relating to the Dublin docklands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that he has not yet received any valuation under the NAMA methodology but he received a valuation from Lisneys in July.  Will he indicate if that is accurate?  He has received a valuation so what is in it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not received a valuation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has received one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard from my officials and I will say, for the third time, that as I understand it, the value of this site has depreciated by up to 85%.  That is my information and it is accurate.  It reflects what I have seen in newspaper coverage as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has a person on the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the House that Deputy Joanna Tuffy has indicated she will be slightly late arriving to the House.  I have agreed to take her priority question last so with the indulgence of the House, we will now take Question No. 107 in the name of Deputy Phil Hogan.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if he will make a statement on the financial position of the local authorities for 2009; his plans to improve local government funding in the context of the White Paper on local government reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36114/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities have budgeted to spend some &euro;11 billion in 2009 between current and capital expenditure.  The capital income is funded mainly through grants, borrowing and other capital income sources.  Current expenditure is funded from specific grants, commercial rates, income from goods and services and general purpose grants.  I am providing some &euro;905.2 million in general purpose grants from the local government fund to local authorities for 2009.  These grants are my contribution to meet the difference between the cost to local authorities of providing an acceptable level of day to day services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants.  It is a matter for each local authority to prioritise its spending, within the resources available to it, across the range of services it provides.</P>
        <P>The Government decided to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on all non-principal private residences.  I consider this to be a very important development in providing local authorities with a new source of local revenue and one which will reduce their dependency on central funding.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are not immune to the effects of the downturn in the economy.  However, while there are pressures on resources at all levels, local authorities are required to introduce efficiencies where possible and to prioritise their expenditure to focus on essential services and to maximise the use of all resources available to them.  I intend to advance the White Paper on local government later this year following, in particular, Government consideration of local <Col N="810"/>government financing in light of the report of the Commission on Taxation and the commitments included in the renewed programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that the debt of local government financing as of 31 December 2008 is &euro;4.9 billion, which has led to many local authorities being in a serious financial position.  A programme for Government review was agreed by the Minister&rsquo;s party and Fianna F&aacute;il last Saturday.  On 30 September the Minister stated that we cannot have a document that is not costed; it must be costed and it will be costed.  What are the costs associated with the measures that will assist local government bodies to meet their financial targets over 2010 and 2011?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that when I spoke about costing, it was in the context of a forthcoming budget.  The budget provides the costings for a programme for Government.  The programme is simply a series of political commitments but the budget puts a financial shape on those commitments.</P>
        <P>With regard to the programme for Government, we have considered a number of issues relating to the financing of local government.  As I have always stated, it is our intention to broaden the revenue base for local authorities.  We operate a system which, in my view, is unsustainable in the long term.  The difficulties relating to it date back to 1977 and we are still trying to recover from them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have begun the process of introducing reforms to broaden the revenue base.  There are a number of steps in this regard.  As stated, I have introduced a tax on second homes.  I would like to examine &mdash; this is included in the new programme for Government &mdash; the idea of a site value tax.  In addition, we want to consider introducing some form of a system of water rates that will be based on allocation or metering.  A capital investment will be required in this regard.  The process of reform will be slow and difficult.  There must be a political commitment to introduce the reforms to which I refer, and we must not shy away from the difficult choices to which I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister stated, the programme for Government refers to a site value tax, water charges and extra local government taxation.  Which of these measures does he intend to prioritise for 2010 in the context of local government finances, particularly as there will be an 8% reduction in the local government fund next year?  What measures will the Minister prioritise in order to ensure the debts of local authorities can be serviced and their current costs met?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A two-pronged approach is required in this regard.  In the first instance, we must consider a number of expenditure cuts.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it also will be necessary to reform the public service.  It is common knowledge that, unlike the boom years, there is not a great deal of activity in planning departments at present.  I am obliged to ask myself what these staff are doing.  There are demarcation problems in respect of the public service but I would like a situation to develop whereby it would be possible to move people from the public service into the Civil Service.  I have tried to encourage some of the planners in the departments to which I refer to assist An Bord Plean&aacute;la in clearing its backlog.  Therefore, the approach I am advocating involves obtaining real public service reform and examining the introduction of new revenue-raising measures.</P>
        <P>I cannot state for certain whether we are in a position to introduce any form of water taxation.  In light of the logistics involved and the capital investment required to put in place a system of water metering, it would be difficult to see it being introduced in 2010.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="811"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the programme for Government and the Minister&rsquo;s plans to deal with the financial issues relating to local government, will he indicate the income that is likely to be generated from the introduction of water charges and a site value tax?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked my Department to prepare scoping documents in respect of both matters.  The process relating to introducing water meters into people&rsquo;s houses would be both extensive and complex.  It will be some time before I can make available to the Deputy a scoping paper on that matter.  However, I will keep him well informed of progress.</P>
        <P>It will take a great deal of time to introduce a site value tax.  As the Commission on Taxation recognised, this will prove to be an extremely tax.  I am of the view that it will take up to two years to obtain the necessary valuations.  We must obtain those valuations before we can even consider introducing such a tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>So nothing is going to be done.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made towards implementing the announcement of 23 April 2009 not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting here; if all voting machines have been removed from their long-term storage locations; if all long-term storage contracts have been terminated; if so, the cost to the State; if new short-term storage arrangements have been entered into; the cost to the State; the way it is intended to physically dispose of all of the electronic voting equipment, including that stored at Gormanston, County Meath; the cost of same; and if costs are being incurred for the storage of manual electronic voting related equipment. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36055/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>On 23 April 2009 I announced that the Government had decided not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.  Since then, a process has been put in place to address the issues that arise from that decision.  An interdepartmental task force, chaired by my Department, has been established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  The first meeting of the task force took place in July 2009.</P>
        <P>In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of costs possible in the circumstances, consistent with  environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is under way to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This process includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.</P>
        <P>In 2007 more than 60% of the machines, some 4,762 in total, were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by returning officers for this purpose.  It is intended that all machines will be removed from their current locations when arrangements for their disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.</P>
        <P>In May 2007 my Department, following a competitive tendering process, engaged consultants with valuation expertise to examine individual leases and to make recommendations on termination of leases, where appropriate.  In May 2008 I accepted the consultants&rsquo; recommendations and these are currently being implemented.  The consultants recommended termination of leases in seven cases and this has since occurred at three locations.  No additional payments <Col N="812"/>were made in respect of these terminations.  Work is ongoing on concluding the other four leases.  It is expected that, in certain instances, termination of lease arrangements will give rise to buy-out costs and these will be dependent on the outcome of negotiations.</P>
        <P>Returning officers continue to have requirements for the storage of manual voting equipment.  My Department has informed them that these arrangements should be made on the basis of achieving the best value for money, with a preference that such items be stored in an appropriate public building where payment of rent is not required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I welcomed the announcement he made on 23 April.  The purpose of the question is to obtain a progress report in respect of this matter.  On foot of the Minister&rsquo;s reply, I am not sure as to what progress has been made.  By all accounts, the Exchequer is still paying for the storage of these machines.  Is it correct that a deadline has not been set in respect of completing the process of disposing of these machines?</P>
        <P Just="Left">A letter was sent to local authorities in September but the Minister did not refer to this.  That letter is critical in the context of the audit regarding the number of these machines that are in place and in respect of the escape costs relating to the storage leases, the duration of which is 20 years or more.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister in a position to indicate the date by which this project will be scrapped entirely and on which the Exchequer will cease funding it?  Has he identified the cost of escaping leases with durations of two, three, four, five, ten and 20 years?  What costs have accrued to his Department or to the Exchequer since the announcement was made on 23 April last?  How much more will the Exchequer be obliged to pay before the project is completed and the machines disposed of?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, to date some &euro;51.33 million has been spent on the development and roll-out of the system.  In addition, there have been associated storage costs.  For 2008 these amounted to &euro;204,000 &mdash; lower than those for the previous years.  Storage costs for the years 2004 to 2007, inclusive, were &euro;658,000, &euro;696,000, &euro;706,000 and &euro;489,000, respectively.  Pending the removal of the machines there will continue to be ongoing storage costs.  This was factored into the analysis and informed the decision to end the electronic voting project.</P>
        <P>This matter was dealt with in chapter 9 of the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which was published on 11 September and which states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">It is in the nature of large ICT projects that they can be overtaken by technical developments or that the solutions developed may not achieve user acceptance. In such instances, the challenge for management of projects is to recognise when they are not working as intended and to act appropriately. The decision to abandon a project that is not working is the correct course because it avoids spending further public moneys &ndash; both capital and current &ndash; in a non-effective way.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It concludes by stating that reasonable steps are being taken to wind down the project and to reuse or dispose of the assets that can no longer be utilised.  The Deputy has asked further questions that I intend to answer.  I spoke to representatives from Nedap-Powervote, who have indicated the approximate costs.  I do not believe they are exorbitant and I will keep the Deputy informed at all times as to the progress being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Has a deadline been set by which this process of disbanding the electronic voting project will be completed?  On foot of the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on 23 <Col N="813"/>April, what will be the estimated total cost to achieve this deadline?  Within the costs associated with the overall process of dismantling this project, has the Minister identified what will be the cost to escape those leases that were set for 20 years?  In the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, everyone knew these machines were the equivalent of PlayStation Ones that would expire within a certain timeframe.  The idea that leases were taken out for 20 or 25 years on a product that had a limited shelf life was madness in the first instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the storage arrangements and the costs involved, the original electronic voting machines were stored at 25 local premises.  In 2007&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>

	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>In most cases, these leases are of relatively short duration and will not involve negotiation of termination arrangements or the payment of a penalty to end the lease.  The most widely publicised lease concerns the storage facility in Cavan-Monaghan, which was arranged by the former Monaghan county registrar.  While the length of that lease &mdash; which has been publicised as being for 25 years &mdash; has been the subject of much public comment, this arrangement was somewhat exceptional in comparison with the other leases.</P>
        <P>On the question regarding a deadline, I cannot give the Deputy a definitive date as to when all these arrangements will be completed.  However, I am hopeful that progress can be made.  The Department has made contact with and is in negotiations with the Nedap-Powervote company.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As announced in the 2008 carbon budget and confirmed more recently as part of the supplementary budget in April 2009, there is an unequivocal commitment that a carbon levy will be introduced in 2010.  This commitment is reflected in the renewed programme for Government.  The recent recommendations of the Commission on Taxation of course must be considered in formulating the carbon levy.</P>
        <P>The principle of carbon pricing is accepted by virtually all economists and analysts as the most effective way to secure emission reductions.  It is the basis of the EU&rsquo;s emission trading scheme, which applies to the bigger emitters such as power generators and industrial plants.  The carbon levy will enable us to harness its benefits in the rest of the economy and will deliver a further reduction in emissions, which will be reflected in the forthcoming carbon budget projections.  In accordance with the two previous carbon budgets, this year&rsquo;s carbon budget will demonstrate that climate change considerations now are integrated into the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="814"/>budgetary policy and the decision-making process across all sectors.  It also will demonstrate that decisions on expenditure and taxation are informed as much by the climate impact as by the financial and economic impacts.</P>
        <P>The carbon budget will outline the preliminary emissions figures for 2008; the projected emissions for the 2008 to 2012 Kyoto Protocol period, taking account of the measures already adopted through the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 and in the two previous carbon budgets; the effects of additional measures being put in place; and the projected emissions to take account of these measures.  Essentially the carbon budget will demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s progress towards meeting its targets for emission reductions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Will he indicate how much money he expects to raise through the carbon levy?  Has an estimate been generated by his Department for the Department of Finance&rsquo;s budgetary calculations?  Second, there has been a shift in emphasis from roads to public transport in the programme for Government.  I understand that 94 road projects will be deferred and that the money will be put into public transport.  The Minister should provide some details in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It could have serious implications in respect of climate change</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>While this issue falls into the domain of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, that certainly is the intention.  I hope the Deputy agrees this shift in ratio is essential and must be made as we were out of kilter with regard to sustainability for far too long.  In other words, we were investing far too much in roads and not enough in our public transport system.  Thankfully, the new programme for Government recognises for the first time that this must change.  This is a real commitment and there must be change.  I also am glad to note in respect of public transport that at long last, real-time information will be provided for passengers.  This information can be acquired from a computer screen at the bus stop or, even better, from one&rsquo;s mobile telephone.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I cannot reveal the budget&rsquo;s contents.  While I cannot tell him what will be the rate of the carbon levy, it will be introduced.  Moreover, I hope it can be introduced in a manner such as has been outlined in the report by the Commission on Taxation, whereby those people who suffer from fuel poverty can be protected and that the money can be directed towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  That is the purpose of a carbon levy.  It must change behaviour and must do what it says on the tin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Surely the Minister has an estimate as to how much income a carbon levy is likely to generate to meet other objectives in the work agenda as indicated by him.  The Minister also should comment on the progress that has been made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>On the latter question, we are making progress.  Many might state that progress is being made in respect of transport simply because there are fewer cars on the road.  However, substantial progress is being made in Dublin city, for example, in respect of other modes of transport.  I am pleased to note that cycling has increased substantially and <Col N="815"/>visibly throughout the city.  Although the bike to work scheme was derided at the time of the last budget, it has proved to be enormously successful and popular.</P>

	<P>Were the Deputy to examine the report of the Commission on Taxation, he would find therein an outline of what a carbon levy might look like.  That is the closest thing to an estimate I can provide to him at this point.</P>

        <Quest> the steps he has taken to ensure that outstanding development levies are collected from developers by local authorities; the moneys outstanding in total; the moneys outstanding in respect of each local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  The adoption of individual development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.</P>
        <P>Each planning authority also is required to include details of contributions received in that year, as well as information on how the contributions have been expended, in the statutory annual accounts of the authority.  A new requirement was introduced for the financial year 2008 to include details in the annual financial statement of all accrued uncollected levies due to the planning authority.  The 2008 statements will be the subject of a full audit by the local government audit service during the audit cycle 2009-10.  My Department does not, therefore, have up-to-date information on the amount of development contributions due to planning authorities.</P>
        <P>As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures.  Where any payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I note he has not yet received the information regarding the amount that is owed to the local authorities for development levies.  That is worrying in some ways because many newspapers have carried partial information that suggests the amount of money is considerable.  In February, <i>The Irish Times</i> wrote that the four Dublin local authorities are collectively owed &euro;322 million by property developers in unpaid levies.  Dublin City Council is owed &euro;142 million, Fingal County Council is owed &euro;70 million and South Dublin County Council is owed &euro;22.5 million.  One story that caught my eye is related to the property bubble and how property developers are affected.  It also relates to NAMA.  A story in the newspapers over the summer concerned a development company that owed some &euro;750,000 to local authorities.  It also owed money to Anglo Irish Bank, which is a secured creditor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question Deputy, please.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="816"/>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This will become a major issue.  We may find that local authorities turn out to be insolvent because development levies were a major source of funding for local authorities.  If they do not collect these levies over the next few years, local government funding is reduced and they have difficulty collecting water charges from businesses that claim they cannot pay they will be in big trouble.  What is the Minister proposing to do on this and what information does he have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some extra information.  Authorities are systematically pursuing outstanding development contributions.  The action taken includes construction site visits by senior planning staff in order to determine an accurate picture of the moneys due.  Failure to pay amounts due to the authority has resulted in enforcement proceedings being initiated under planning legislation and this will continue to be the case.  County and city managers are maintaining a policy of actively managing any arrears that may occur or where money is due to be paid and remains unpaid.  Staff have been assigned specifically to deal with the collection of outstanding development contributions.</P>
        <P>With regard to local authorities referred to at the beginning of Deputy Tuffy&rsquo;s contribution, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has 219 cases that have been referred to the planning enforcement section for appropriate legal action to recover the moneys due.  Deputy Tuffy also referred to Dublin City Council.  Since January 2009 in excess of 200 developments have been inspected to establish if development contributions are due.  Following these inspections, 92 warning letters under section 152 and 64 section 154 enforcement notices were issued, 10 section 157 referrals have been made to the District Court and the city council has been successful in the cases that have been heard to date.  Fingal County Council has 50 cases at various stages of legal proceedings.  These were instituted for the amount outstanding in respect of development contributions.</P>
        <P>I could go through this in detail but I do not want to waste the time of Deputy Tuffy.  In Kilkenny, 90 cases are with the legal advisors for legal action and Cork County Council has similar figures.  We see a picture of actively pursuing these moneys.  Deputy Tuffy can have no real concern that the local authorities are not pursuing this.  It makes sense because it is their revenue stream and local authorities will do this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that local authorities are pursuing these development levies from the developers and that extra staff have been assigned to this.  What if the local authorities are not able to collect the money?  Is the Government examining this problem?  At the Green Party conference at the weekend the Minister referred to how we will fund local authorities in the future.  Local authorities were making money in the same unsustainable way as banks and the Government.  All of this development was unsustainable and now it has collapsed.  Local authorities are one of the institutions that will pay the price for this type of one-dimensional view of how to get the bulk of funding.  Does the Minister have a view of how we will deal with this?  Are there plans or emergency plans if they do not collect funds?</P>
        <P>I referred to the developer, Laragan Developments Limited, that went in to examinership.  The secured creditor was Anglo Irish Bank and the unsecured creditor was the local authority.  When developers go into examinership will it be the case that local authorities lose out to the banks because the banks or NAMA have secured debts and the local authorities do not?  We could have a crisis in local government besides unfinished estates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I take Deputy Tuffy&rsquo;s point that much of this is associated with the housing bubble.  We conducted a survey and the breakdown of development contribution money as applied across various programme headings of my Department.  The survey, conducted in 2008, show that 41% of development contributions are for water and sewerage, 45% on roads and 14% on amenities.  We continue with that infrastructural development and continue <Col N="817"/>to invest record amounts in the water services investment programme and public transport.  We will continue to receive development contributions on that basis.</P>

        <Quest> the number of local authorities that have heritage officers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Heritage officers play an important role in ensuring support for heritage activities and organisations at local level.  Since 1999, the Heritage Council, under the aegis of my Department, has developed a partnership programme with local authorities to facilitate the employment of heritage officers.  To date, my Department has provided funding of &euro;5.15 million, including this year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;550,000, to the Heritage Council for the programme.  There are 28 local authorities with heritage officers in the programme.</P>
        <P>The employment of heritage officers is a matter in the first instance for each local authority.  Local authorities that participate in the programme are eligible for financial assistance from the Heritage Council towards the cost of employing a heritage officer.  The Heritage Council also organises training courses and seminars that facilitate the professional development of heritage officers.</P>
        <P>There is great variety in the projects supported by heritage officers across the country.  These projects have included survey work, development control and forward planning, biodiversity enhancement, allocation of heritage grants, and facilitating partner groups and organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister referred to 28 heritage officers and I presume this refers to 28 local authorities.  Are these local authorities at city council and county council level or are some town councils?  Is there anything in train to ensure the other local authorities have heritage officers?</P>
        <P>The Minister made the point that there is a need for a more sustainable planning.  From the point of view of the Heritage Council, sustainable planning is linked to the protection of our heritage.  Heritage officers could play an important role in ensuring we do not make mistakes of the past and in ensuring we have sustainable planning and we protect the environment and heritage.</P>
        <P>Our economy can be built on new sources of income.  An obvious area for Ireland is heritage and environmental tourism.  What role does the Minister see heritage officers playing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Heritage officers can make a major contribution in promoting tourism activities in the local authority area.  On every occasion that I launched a book when members of the Heritage Council were present I stated that it is my strongly held view that we should have heritage officers in each local authority area.  That is not the case.  However, where they are in place it has made a tremendous difference.  In 1999, at the inception of the heritage officer programme the number of heritage officers employed was only three.  After five years the number had risen to 25 and the number of heritage officers reached its peak in 2008 with the employment of 28 heritage officers.  It has remained at that level since then.  Since the introduction in March of the general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts in local authorities, the level of employment in the sector has decreased.  However, the number of heritage officers employed has remained at its peak of 28.</P><Col N="818"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Recently, the Department of Finance approved a delegated sanction to my Department for implementation of the general moratorium on condition that the overall staffing levels in the local authority sector are to be reduced significantly by the end of 2010 in adherence with the Government&rsquo;s policy on staffing and numbers in the public sector.  When I have been contacted about these issues I have made it very clear that it is very important to keep in place heritage and conservation officers because I consider the job they do to be vital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned that many staff might be surplus to requirement in sections of local authorities.  This is the type of work that they could do and I support the Minister on that view.  There are many legacy issues and work that needed to be done which was put on the long finger because of the Celtic tiger.  Will the Minister issue a circular to local authorities to appoint heritage officers, deal with heritage issues within their resources and existing staff and establish a retraining programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is the case that if they wish local authorities can appoint heritage officers with the assistance of the Heritage Council.  The Deputy is aware that because of budgetary constraints grants to the Heritage Council, which is based in his native city and which does a very fine job, have had to be cut somewhat although not as much as could otherwise have been the case.  The points Deputy Hogan made on demarcation and the fact that we do not have enough flexibility in the public service are valid.  We need to seriously examine how we employ people and the type of job they can do effectively.  I believe that type of strict demarcation belongs to another era.  We have 30,000 civil servants and 300,000 public servants.  I do not see why people in the public service working in the environmental section of a local authority cannot come to my Department; that does not make any sense to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The point made by Deputy Hogan is very important.  Local authorities will not need as many planning officials as they did because there will be fewer planning applications to administer.  People in planning might be the right people to put into the roles of heritage officers.  It is important that rather than stating this as an aspiration, the Government implements it.  This is the most important public service reform of all.  We need to keep jobs in the public sector but we need to deploy them to where they are needed.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that numbers in the public sector must be reduced because that is Government policy.  Does this mean the Government has adopted the McCarthy report?  I thought it had not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we have not; the McCarthy report is still a list of recommendations.  I made these points previously but Deputy Tuffy was not in the Chamber at the time.  I made precisely the same point that Deputy Tuffy made, that people in planning departments have little enough to do compared to during the boom.  The problem is with regard to public service unions and demarcation and that is a real difficulty.  I have succeeded somewhat &mdash; not the extent that I would like &mdash; in giving people in those departments extra work from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, I must be candid and state that it is not as effective as I would like it to be.  When I see the amount of people available and the amount of work is required I do not see the required results, frankly.  I want to ensure that we can get greater flexibility in the public service.  It is a real issue that political parties over the years and successive Governments have failed to tackle and I hope this Administration will tackle it.</P>

	<P>I am delighted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that there have been recurrent problems with green algae on a number of beaches in County Cork.  Various factors can contribute to the formation of green algae, which is due to excessive nutrients entering water, including from run-off from land due to intensive agricultural practices, septic tanks or discharges of untreated wastewater.</P>
        <P>The draft south-western river basin management plan identifies the full range of water quality issues in the area covered by the plan, including Cork county and city, and sets out how it is proposed to manage the rivers, lakes, groundwaters and coastal waters covered by the plan to ensure their protection.  The plan, being finalised by the relevant local authorities, will contain a programme of measures to address these challenges, including the identification of any necessary waste water infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In addition, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has established a task force representative of a number of stakeholders, including my Department, to advise him and Cork County Council on various aspects of the green algae at Coolmaine, Harbour View, Inchydoney and Ring beaches.</P>
        <P>Proposals to upgrade and improve the wastewater infrastructure at Clonakilty, Courtmacsherry, Rosscarbery and Timoleague are currently at various stages of planning under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007&ndash;09.  Local authorities have been asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by the end of next week as a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 water services investment programme.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities have been asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that we have a Green Party Minister to deal with green algae in west Cork.  The problem is that he is not dealing with it and that is my difficulty.  I am very glad I do not have to tell him about Coolmaine and Inchydoney beaches because he knows them.  However, if had visited them in the past year or two he would hardly have recognised them because of the problems there.  I want to press him very strongly on this issue because serious public health issues are raised and much damage is being caused to the environment.</P>
        <P>The tourism industry is also being badly damaged.  Last weekend, people booked out of hotels in Clonakilty and the Minister knows the effort that town makes in the Tidy Towns and Entente Florale competitions.  It is a disgrace that these issues have not been dealt with at official level.  Apart from all of this, there is the matter of community use.  My kids used to go to Coolmaine beach and I used to go swimming there with them.  One can no longer go to Coolmaine beach during most of the summer.  The local people are affected.</P>
        <P>I want to press the Minister on two issues.  The first is the management plan on the green algae, or &ldquo;sea lettuce&rdquo; as it is called.  I understand expert groups are meeting and a major meeting is taking place today, whether by coincidence or otherwise.  The second issue is to stop this occurring.  There is no doubt that the lack of a treatment plant in Courtmacsherry, which has been on the cards for past six years, and the need to upgrade the Clonakilty and Rosscarb<Col N="820"/>ery facilities play a part.  These issues are directly under the control of the Minister and they have been delayed repeatedly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14- ?><Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the area as I used to holiday in Timoleague and I know this problem has existed for years.  When I was on holidays there more than ten years ago I could see the algae on the beach.  If one went down to Dunworley one could see the green algae there and it was very clear.  This is coming from run-off nutrients from farming practices and septic tanks.  We must deal first with the point sources.  While the Department allocates the moneys for the water services investment programme, the local authority is responsible for the schemes.  It is unfair for Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe to claim I am responsible for all these local authorities and must make them do their work.  I cannot do that.  I can, however, give the Deputy some idea of where the various projects stand.</P>
        <P>The three schemes in question amount to an investment of &euro;122 million.  Cork County Council is preparing the contract documents for the Clonakilty water and sewerage scheme with a view to seeking tenders next year.  My Department is assessing the additional information on the Courtmacsherry and Timoleague water and sewerage scheme which was just received from Cork County Council to determine whether to approve the council&rsquo;s revised preliminary reports for it. The report sets out the scale, scope and costs of the scheme.  In April I met with a delegation from the area about the scheme.  The meeting&rsquo;s focus was on the affordability of the scheme as a substantial element of it falls to be funded by the council under the water pricing policy.</P>
        <P>I am more than happy to give the Deputy more information on the Rosscarbery and Owenahincha scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be pleased to receive that extra information.  Regarding the treatment plant in Courtmacsherry, I am not blaming the Minister for the delay as he has only been in office for two years and this has been going on for years.  I would have thought, however, that he would have pushed it to a conclusion.  All that happens is that a scheme&rsquo;s proposals are sent back and forth to the Department with added proposals for six months at a time.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to revised proposals just received by his Department regarding the Courtmacsherry-Timoleague scheme.  Last May I received a reply to a parliamentary question that the Department was examining a revised preliminary report for the same scheme.  This was supposed to be included in the 2007 to 2009 investment programme.  There is no way it will be built now before the end of the year.  Will the Minister give an absolute commitment that he will give priority, as far as he can and in so far as his Department is concerned, to clear this problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no getting away from the fact that it must be dealt with at point source.  We have some work to do in this country not to be in denial about the problems <Col N="821"/>associated with agricultural run-off and septic tanks.  There are too many parties which do not want to know about these problems because they are difficult issues with which to deal.  Building water treatment plants is fine but we must go beyond that in examining the cause of the problem.</P>

        <Quest> if he will draft new planning guidelines for the proper development and maintenance of village and urban centres for the benefit of local communities; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35950/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The proper planning and sustainable development of urban and village centres is underpinned by the legislative and regulatory frameworks set out in planning legislation and supported by the extensive suite of statutory planning guidance already in place.  New draft guidelines in preparation will provide further support in these regards.</P>
        <P>Building on the 2007 guidelines for planning authorities on development plans, which comprehensively deal with the function, content, process and implementation of development plans as a blueprint for the economic and social development of cities and towns, including their central areas, my Department published guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable residential development in urban areas in December 2008.</P>
        <P>These promote high quality, sustainable residential development at all levels of the urban hierarchy, including towns and villages.  The guidelines provide more specific advice on co-ordinated planning and development of such areas.  Best practice examples and processes to implement the guidelines were also provided in an accompanying urban design manual.</P>
        <P>The 2005 retail planning guidelines for planning authorities also support the vibrancy and vitality of city, town and village centres.  My Department intends to commence a focussed review of these guidelines before the end of the year, which will consider how town centres can be further enhanced and revitalised through sustainable retail planning policies.  In addition, my Department is preparing draft guidelines on local area plans which are increasingly used in the planning of strategic developments within an urban and suburban context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been much bad planning in towns and villages across the country.  Many housing estates have been left unfinished with no proper facilities.  It is important, therefore, these guidelines are drawn up and issued as soon as possible.  In one estate in the Dublin North-East constituency a town centre was to be built and a DART station brought on-line but neither has happened.  Will the Minister guarantee that the provision of proper facilities will be included in these new guidelines and be put on a statutory footing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Only last week, we introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 in the Seanad which will ensure the highest standards in planning and development.  For the first time, a local authority&rsquo;s regional planning guidelines will have to have regard to and comply with the national spatial strategy.  I have also introduced measures which ensure new residential developments will be built near public transport facilities, cr&egrave;ches and playing areas which is what good planning is about.</P>
        <P>Planning is not about buildings but about people.  In the past, we tended to forget about this aspect.  It is only when one has people-centred planning that it makes sense and people&rsquo;s quality of life is enhanced.  I hope the Deputy will see the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill contains many good provisions and as a consequence support it.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if he will bring legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas in autumn 2009 to provide for directly elected mayors; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35822/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 156 together.</P>
        <P>On 12 May 2009 I announced the Government decided to introduce a directly elected mayor for the Dublin region in 2010.  This decision arises from the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a directly elected mayor of Dublin and from the considerations in the Green Paper on local government which I published in April 2008.</P>
        <P>A central theme of the Green Paper on local government is the need for a renewal of local democratic leadership.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce a directly elected mayor of Dublin will deliver significantly strengthened leadership for the city and region, with enhanced accountability and a direct connection with the citizen.  My Department is drafting the necessary legislation and it is my intention that the mayor will be equipped with a suite of substantial powers across the functions of local government, and will have the authority and powers to deliver real leadership for the city and region.  The mayor will act primarily as a strategic policy maker who will also work to integrate the activities of local government and the wider public service in and across Dublin.  The details of the mayor&rsquo;s responsibilities will be set out in legislation.</P>
        <P>The Government decision on the Dublin mayor marks the first phase of the transformation of local government in accordance with the programme for Government.  Given my intention that mayoral elections will be held next year, it will be necessary to have the relevant legislation in place well in advance.  To these ends, I will be bringing my legislation proposals to Government in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s response is a wee bit flowery.  I know he will respond by saying that the specifics will be in the legislation, but at this stage we need to put some meat on the bones because several questions need to be answered even before we reach the legislative stage.  For example, what are the powers of this proposed mayor in respect of rezoning and the draft development plan, a power that county councillors hold under a statutory instrument?  How will the mayor affect this process?  Questions arise about staffing, salary, the expense of creating the office, the term of the office and powers.  There is an onus on us to put this up for debate because there are many questions.  One might ask why I, as a Donegal man, am asking about the Dublin mayor but I want to know if this will be rolled out nationally.  Will Dublin be a pilot?  Will Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, and Cork all have directly elected mayors?  If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is still in office in 2010 when the mayor is elected, what will his relationship be with the mayor?  Many questions need to be answered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I will have a good relationship with the person elected, even if it is a Fine Gael person.  Fine Gael has supported this proposal.  One of Deputy McHugh&rsquo;s colleagues raised it on the Adjournment and I set out the responsibilities involved in a little more detail then.  If the Deputy wishes, I can repeat them: setting the framework for the future; the physical development of Dublin city and the region by setting out regional planning guidelines which Dublin local authorities must abide by; delivering a reliable, sustainable, integrated public transport in Dublin by leading the Dublin Transportation Authority, following the London model; ensuring the delivery of an environmentally sustainable approach to waste management in Dublin by proposing and overseeing the implementation of the Dublin region waste management plan; maximising conservation and efficient use of water resources and the safe treatment of waste water through proposing and overseeing the implementation of the <Col N="824"/>Dublin regional water services plan; promoting a dynamic city region which is enterprising and renowned for its rich culture and heritage by bringing all key public and private sectors together in a new regional development board; promoting quality housing and sustainable communities; promoting the protection and enhancement of Dublin&rsquo;s environment; and a range of other areas.  This will be set out in the legislation.  </P>
        <P>We feel it will not impose significant costs.  They will be found within the existing financial arrangements.  Given the broad support we have received for this initiative from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and others, we feel that it will be successful.  It will be a real legacy and something of which we can all be proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that the Labour Party pioneered the concept of a directly elected lord mayor of Dublin.  Does he intend to extend this to other cities?  Is this the only aspect of the White Paper that will be implemented?  It belongs in the context of local government reform but where are the rest of those reforms?  The election of mayors should be tied to the local election period and, while I know there is a sequencing issue in respect of the legislation, does the Minister envisage that the first term of office will be on the current five year schedule for local government elections? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that was the intention.  We need to broaden our concept of local government.  We are committed to a Dublin mayor.  I did not know that the Labour Party pioneered the issue but that raises the question why it did not do anything about it.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>We were not in office. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how long ago that was or the circumstances.  We need, however, to rethink the structures of local government.  What we have now is an inherited British model but is it suitable to our modern State and does it have the dynamism and flexibility to deal with the issues?  The answer is probably &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We must reinvent it.  It may be a difficult transition but we need to be quite radical.  The mayoralty is only one aspect of that, but if we are to have more dynamic local authorities with fewer people on them, it raises the question about the number of people in this D&aacute;il.  Should we have a slimmed-down D&aacute;il?  That question does not go down too well in this House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister may confirm or reject the revelations in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> at the weekend.  I do not assume that everything I read in the papers is true but it seems that a survey of voter attitudes in Dublin south east was commissioned at the cost of &euro;12,000 which was subsequently charged to the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure this is relevant to the question about the Dublin mayor. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very relevant.  Red C carried out the opinion poll on voter attitudes in Dublin south east.  As part of that were any surveys done or questions asked about the Dublin mayoralty, what voters thought of it, or the kind of candidate they might wish to support? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department did not pay for it.  I paid for it.  I do not recall questions about the Dublin mayoralty.  It will enhance the city greatly and has been called for by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  The role would evolve.  If one talks to Ken Livingstone, for example, he will say that initially people were sceptical about the London mayoralty.  He told me he, too, was sceptical and voted against the legislation when it came to the House of Commons although later, of course, he was a passionate advocate for the role of the mayor in London.  People will criticise this move and say it is only starting off and that perhaps the Minister should award more radical powers.  I believe the role will have sufficient powers.  The person can be assured he or she will have powers to do a good job for this city.  Whoever he or she may be, if I am in office as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that person will have my full co-operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made the point that the mayoralty is only part of what he hopes to do for local government.  It will be welcome.  A directly elected mayor is an idea worth trying, especially for Dublin, to see how it will work out and evolve.  That said, we should not lose sight of the importance of the role of the ordinary county and city councillor.  These people are at the coal face and are often able to achieve things that perhaps Deputies and the Opposition cannot.  There is no separation of Government and Opposition on local authorities.  </P>
        <P>The Minister made a point about reducing the number of councillors.  I would guard against that because we do not want politics to become totally professionalised and a full-time job.  The good point about councils is that they still have a certain number of people who come from and work in the community.  They have other jobs and experiences which they can bring to their work as local county councillors.  We need to keep that.</P>
        <P>I hope that in whatever the Minister does he will not allow the media to drive the agenda.  In reality, there are not too many Deputies.  Professor Michael Gallagher of Trinity College has said the number of Irish parliamentarians is in line with that in other countries of similar size to Ireland.  There is a tendency for us to go along with the media agenda.  The Minister mentioned the election of faceless people from lists who would be picked by party membership. <Col N="826"/> We should not do only what the media says but should do what is good for democratic representation in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is well outside the scope of the question, interesting as it is.  I am not sure if the Minister wishes to air his views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not recommend any system along the lines of what exists in Germany where party apparatchiks put people in place.  The list or top-up system I had in mind would be based on those people who stood in elections and the percentage vote they received.  That allows the election to be personalised.  I am not going along with any media agenda but simply proceeding with what I think is best.  </P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s point in respect of councillors is fine.  However, as the Deputy knows, we discovered there has been a significant turnover of councillors, particularly on Dublin City Council.  We must ask ourselves why this is the case.  Some have complained the work was not compatible with their work commitments and was not paying enough.  There were many complaints.  The Deputy&rsquo;s basic point is that it is good to have people from different professions represented and that is fair.  However, there are clear difficulties that must be addressed and that is what I hope to do in the forthcoming legislation, particularly in the White Paper.</P>

	<P>I have seven minutes left, with the last ten minutes going to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  I noticed that the T&aacute;naiste was late this morning and the Minister of State was late this afternoon.  I have often said that the Government is not interested in sorting out the problems in F&Aacute;S.  Given that its members do not seem to be able to turn up for this debate, I can rest my case.</P>
        <P>I wish the new CEO of F&Aacute;S the best.  There is also a new board, but there is no policy or serious political direction in terms of what type of employment agency we want and need.  The corporate and regional directorate structure, much of which is not necessary, costs approximately &euro;150 million.  The community employment, CE, scheme is valuable from a social point of view, but this would probably be better done at local government level.  The apprenticeships and training integration, which cost &euro;108 million, work well.  In many ways, F&Aacute;S apprenticeships are exemplars for the rest of the world, but one wonders whether they could be better handled by the Department of Education and Science.  Training for people in employment, which costs &euro;122 million, is being cut.  The Skillnets model is the way to go in that regard.  The budget for training for the unemployed amounts to &euro;248 million.</P>
        <P>There is a strong case for reform, even if we were to move to a system in which people were given individual training accounts or vouchers that they could use to choose their own training.  For some degree holders, this might involve applying for masters degrees at a third level institution or university.  For others, it might involve buying training from a VEC or further education bodies.  For others, it might involve going to F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>It is important not to forget that more than 400,000 people are on the live register.  The Government is prepared to spend at least an extra &euro;7 billion to give the banks a free gift through NAMA, yet it is unprepared to spend anything like that on private sector pension protection, unemployment, mortgage debt and so on.  Even &euro;1 billion set aside for employment could create as many as 150,000 training or supported employment posts, which would remove people from the live register.  This is the type of model being used in other countries.  Once one&rsquo;s insurance or employment benefit runs out, one is expected to engage in high-quality training or education if one wishes to retain those benefits.  Ireland should be moving towards this type of model, but it is a shame that these reforms were not introduced during the good times when doing so would have been easier.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note the good work done by the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue.  Its Chairman, Deputy Allen, and Deputies Shortall and O&rsquo;Brien made good inputs into the proposals to restructure the board.  We should also acknowledge the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s reports.  In my contribution on F&Aacute;S last week, I was critical of the media for not blowing the whistle earlier.  That the media was well looked after by F&Aacute;S in terms of advertising and trips played a role, but we should acknowledge the good work done by journalists such as Senator Ross and Mr. Nick Webb, who blew the whistle on the travels of F&Aacute;S executives. <Col N="828"/> Shane Phelan, Stephen Collins and Colm Keena of other newspapers pursued the matter subsequently.</P>
        <P>I always make the same point in our debates on F&Aacute;S, but it never gets reported.  It is important to recognise the good work done by so many ordinary F&Aacute;S workers on the ground, be they trainers or clerical officers, whose morale has been sapped and destroyed by this controversy.  I hope someone someday will include this point in his or her newspaper article on debates in the House.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will not oppose this legislation on Second Stage, but we will propose the amendments that we outlined this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill does little to address the significant systemic problems in F&Aacute;S.  Currently, more than 430,000 people are on the live register and face an uncertain future.  This country needs and demands a State training agency that can provide expert training courses that meet the needs of industry and labour in order to get people back to work.</P>
        <P>We have all spoken on what are termed the &ldquo;new economy&rdquo; and the &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo; and the new jobs in technology, engineering and science that are the future for our labour force.  However, the tools of the State to prepare people for this new labour market are inadequate.  In recent days, I have received information on what is occurring in F&Aacute;S, particularly in some of its training courses, that makes for damning reading.  It is shocking for those trainees it effects, for the businesses they want to be in, for the taxpayer and for the good and honest reputation of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>A complaint was made about what a contractor working for F&Aacute;S was doing.  The executive summary of the auditor&rsquo;s report states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The audit was initiated in response to a request from Training Services in the North East region which raised concerns regarding aspects of the assessment process on contracts run by [a company].  Internal Audit examined some of the assessments.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This audit made significant damning findings against F&Aacute;S.  The summary went on:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The key issue of the audit was to determine the integrity of the assessment process in these contracts and by extension the integrity of the certification processed by F&Aacute;S and issued by the various certifying bodies such as FETAC and City &amp; Guilds.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The stakes for F&Aacute;S, FETAC and City &amp; Guilds are high.  They are also high for those companies that are part of a multimillion euro industry and provide courses for and on behalf of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Two issues were raised in the report.  It stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The first of these matters was that Curriculum Sections within F&Aacute;S training centres adopted different approaches to the verification of assessments carried out by contracted trainers.  The Curriculum Section in Dundalk supervised independent verifications of contracted courses, in much the same way as they did for in-centre courses.  On the other hand, Baldoyle Training Centre did not carry out these independent verifications.  Such a divergence of approach between training centres is a matter for concern in the context of F&Aacute;S&rsquo; role in regard to the certifying bodies.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The second matter that arose during the audit was the question of shortcomings in the set-up of contracted training courses which involved a significant amount of IT training and certification.  The issues that arose in relation to the contracts included outdated and unre<Col N="829"/>liable computers, the lack of adequate numbers of printers or networked printers during assessments and computer disks being re-used or unavailable.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These are serious and damning situations in which F&Aacute;S has allowed contracted companies to do its business and cases where F&Aacute;S did not maintain oversight.  This report into the certification of these courses is dated February 2009.</P>
    
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The key issue of the audit was to determine the integrity of the assessment process in these contracts.  The internal audit examined a total of seven contracts.  It is important to place the internal audit findings in an overall context.  In all the cases examined, it found that the assessment event took place and in the case of three contracts, the internal audit found that the sample assessments had been processed correctly.  The issues identified with the remaining four contracts sampled by internal audit varied in significance.  However, the findings point to a number of instances of the manipulation of assessment material in contracts delivered by this company for and on behalf of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>The manipulation of material initially came to light on a computer aided design, CAD, course run in the north-east region.  The company accepted in writing in April 2007 that the assessment material had become unreliable.  However, the company ran further courses and the same issues still arose, but it did not address the initial problem.  In light of the acceptance that the assessment material had been manipulated on the north-east CAD contract, there was an onus on the company to ensure that the same did not occur on subsequent contracts.  The internal audit was of the view that this was not done.</P>
        <P>These are important courses, costing tens of thousands of euro, some of which run for ten or 11 months.  In many cases they are full-time courses in which the results are fixed.  It does not make sense.  People pass the tests who could never have passed.  Dates of tests have been changed.  It is stated that a test was taken on 5 April, for example, but the record will show the test was taken on 13 May or some other date.  The whole arrangement is a fix, a con, and it is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>One company is responsible for these actions which have been carried out in a number of places.  I do not have the name of the company because this information has been redacted.  I have contacted the office of the director general of F&Aacute;S and requested the name of that company because we are entitled to know it, what it was paid and why it continued to provide further courses when there was evidence that one course in particular had been manipulated.</P>
        <P>The internal audit would have expected that subsequent to the CAD contract, further contracts would be conducted with integrity and meet the clear standards set down by the certifying bodies.  The internal audit is of the view that the material highlighted in this report shows that this did not happen.  I ask if there are other courses where this is happening.  I ask the Minister of State to revert to his senior Minister and to F&Aacute;S; I ask him to name the company and the payments it has received.  I also ask him to say what action he will take with regard to this situation and what changes will be implemented in F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>I refer to a reply I received to Parliamentary Question No. 81 of 8 October 2009.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment referred to &ldquo;a revision of the relevant procedures, the enhancement of the contract used when dealing with external contractors and the development of a protocol to allow appropriate sanctions to be taken against external contractors&rdquo;.  What sanctions, if any, can be imposed on this company?  It appears none.  Is it a fact that the Minister cannot recover the money or has it even been sought?  Is the Minister ensuring independent verification of the results of these tests?  The relevant external certifying bodies have been informed of the audit findings.  What action has been taken by City &amp; Guilds and <Col N="830"/>other independent examining bodies who run courses on behalf of F&Aacute;S?  What are they and the Minister and the Department doing about it?</P>
        <P>This country could be dragged into the mire by the antics of F&Aacute;S.  There is evidence of one company which ran four long-term courses.  This is not acceptable and it is a scandal at the heart of F&Aacute;S.  The standard of some of these courses is equivalent to the leaving certificate.  I remind the Minister of State of the understandable fury in Drogheda when a leaving certificate exam was inadvertently shown for a few seconds or minutes to a candidate.  I ask him to imagine the furore if F&Aacute;S courses are not up to scratch because of a lack of proper verification.</P>
        <P>Are inquiries currently being carried out all around the country?  I want to know the truth about this matter.  Does this situation also apply to other companies?  If this is the case, I ask the Minister of State to make a statement to the House in this regard tomorrow morning.  We need a credible process.  The young people participating in these courses need to be assured that such courses are completely above board.  If the Minister is spending millions of euro providing these courses, we must be ensured that they are properly and independently corrected.</P>
        <P>If a teacher were to change the results of a candidate&rsquo;s test in order to give him or her a pass mark which they did not deserve, this would bring the examination system into disrepute.  F&Aacute;S has been discredited as a national organisation because of the antics, waste of money, arrogance, complacency and lack of accountability, which continues in F&Aacute;S in this specific case.  The House needs to be reassured that this is being addressed, that something is being done about it and that it will never happen again.  The situation cannot be allowed to continue in which a company falsifies results and is then given another contract and falsifies those results also.  What sort of country are we running?  This is unacceptable and I ask if the situation is continuing.  I am asking a very important question.  I want to know the answer because the country is entitled to know the facts.</P>
        <P>There are other issues which I cannot address here.  I acknowledge that people in F&Aacute;S have acted with integrity as evidenced by the release of these papers in order to facilitate me.  I acknowledge there are very fine people who are doing a great job in F&Aacute;S, but there is also a rotten core in the organisation.  There has been unacceptable behaviour for a State training body and this must be rooted out now.  If this is not done, we will be back in the House with more information on the incredible, appalling, disgraceful situation which the Government has allowed to develop in F&Aacute;S through its failure to make it accountable to these Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Seamus Kirk on his elevation to the important constitutional office of Ceann Comhairle.  I have no doubt that the fairness which he displayed in another place will be found here as well.  I wish him and his family every success in his important role.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party views this as an important Bill and the party will not oppose it.  However, we will table significant amendments on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister of State, whom I know is interested in this area, will accept them.  We acknowledge the Bill contains significant and important sections which will hopefully lead to a re-orientation and re-focusing of the role of F&Aacute;S with regard to the provision of training and important courses and certification.  In light of what Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has revealed to the House, it is time for a complete overhaul of F&Aacute;S.  The information is mind-boggling and staggering and is a source not just of controversy, but also of deep worry.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd referred to certification and to examinations which are the passport to employment.  The certification awarded is relied on to indicate that a candidate has the necessary skills and expertise in that area.  Therefore, it is very important.  That deflates my notion of it, as Deputy Varadkar rightly stated.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>This idea originated from my colleague Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn who was a very innovative Minister and who had much to put forward in this area back in the 1980s, including the idea of the National Employment and Training Authority.  Perhaps that is the correct name that should be used given the context and perhaps we should return to the original focus and identity of what Deputy Quinn had in mind because we seem to have strayed away significantly from the very ethos and basis upon which F&Aacute;S has grown.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to what Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd said.  In the context of what has been revealed to the D&aacute;il, I call upon the Minister of State to investigate thoroughly the contents of what has been revealed this evening.  I was not aware of it but Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has been given information and there should be an investigation in order that the Minister of State is in a position to advance the situation in this regard.</P>
        <P>Several recommendations and sections in the Bill which are important have been included.  I am opposed to the proposed number of members of the board.  It is important that the number of members of the board is reduced.  I am opposed to the proposal to have 11 members on the board, a number far to high and unwieldy.  While it is a reduction, it is still way out of kilter with the number necessary to run an organisation.  One can never get down to the meat of a decision when one is going around the table and waiting to get consensus to secure an important objective.</P>
        <P>It amazes me that the election of a worker director has not been accommodated in this context.  One might say one would expect such a statement from the Labour Party but the truth is far from it.  The participation of worker directors in Bord na M&oacute;na could withstand the scrutiny and oversight of anyone who wants to independently or objectively examine the situation.  A colleague of mine at the time, Councillor Mark Nugent, rose to the positions of vice chairman and chairman of the board at a very critical time, as Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd may recall.  He was not afraid to make the hard decisions to ensure Bord na M&oacute;na remained a commercial operation when it was going through a traumatic time and he was the workers&rsquo; representative.  However, he was a person of great guile and integrity and knew that hard decisions had to be made and did not shirk his responsibility.  Therefore, I advocate that a workers&rsquo; representative should be accommodated in this regard.  I realise the Minister of State, Deputy Callery, is involved and to reduce the number of board members is a step in the right direction at least, and I accept as much.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why the relevant joint Oireachtas committee does not have a role in scrutinising the appointments.  Otherwise we would have the old &ldquo;scratch my back&rdquo; philosophy and one person is appointed to the board simply because he knows somebody else.  What can we say?  If Deputy Callery were nominated I could not say he should not be on the board or is not suitable, although because he is a Deputy he would not be nominated in any event.  There should be a degree of scrutiny and oversight.  Otherwise, we will be fixed with the idea that appointments are determined by who one knows.  I do not believe that should preclude one from membership because one may well have abilities and competencies that are very important in the context of the board.  However, it should be possible, even if one is not subject to scrutiny, for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make recommendations, and that was a recommendation of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If nothing else, the committee should be in a position to make recommendations to the Minister.  At least it would result in two or three recommendations from an all-party committee.  I have chaired all-party committees for several years, including the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which the Minister of State is a valued member.  The vice chairman of that committee is also present.  We work by consensus.  We have never allowed any partisan or political side to take precedence.  I have often held a view but I have never allowed that to cloud the best interests <Col N="832"/>of the committee.  If someone can find something in the record to the contrary I will stand down because I would not behave in that way.  My role is to be independent and to do what is best and I trust the committee would have a role in this regard.  I recognise the Minister will consider the matter because he certainly played a significant role in the past, which I have acknowledged.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not change the way in which F&Aacute;S works, how it goes about its work or how it develops or implements the labour intervention measures.  It must change from the perspective of how, where and why it was established in the mid 1980s.  It must evolve to meet the demands of the new situation and circumstances that pertain in 2010 and that will be in place in future.  This is especially important in light of the comments of Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.</P>
        <P>I have had a good deal of interaction with F&Aacute;S.  All the people I have met in F&Aacute;S, including managers, assistant managers, the Minister&rsquo;s staff, other staff and so on have treated me with nothing but the height of courtesy.  They have worked with diligence and respect and have done a good job.  Clearly, 99.9% of the staff in F&Aacute;S have done a good job.  There are obviously several people who have questions to answer and we are not the only people who make that point; it has been verified by various reports.  Major issues have arisen concerning the total disregard for fundamental or basic accountability which resulted in a significant waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money and profligacy.  To engage in acts of profligacy at a time when money is very scarce and when the Government is trying to scrape money from the bottom of the barrel for important schemes cannot be tolerated, nor should it be.  The concerns have now been added to in the Chamber this evening.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to rehash the litany of revelations about F&Aacute;S in recent times, which have continued with the recent issues raised concerning the severance package agreed with the departing chief executive officer.  My colleague, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, has queried the legal instruments under which top-up payments were made and why departing CEOs are entitled to certain rights, irrespective of the facts and circumstances surrounding his or her departure.  It is important we do not take the matter too far.</P>
        <P>We have examined this matter as it relates to the Bill.  We are concerned that the Minister would retain a greater degree of control than previously over who is appointed to a board.  We are all subject to public perception.  I do not believe it is the be all and end all, and perhaps some of the great public should put their names on the ballot paper and see how hard it is to get in here.  However, whether it is a perception, the reality or a fact there is the idea that there is cronyism and that it has bedevilled the organisation.  The idea that F&Aacute;S has been bedevilled by cronyism is very real.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be given a central role in selecting candidates for the board.  However, this provision appears to be omitted from the Bill.  Is there any reason for this, because the Committee of Public Accounts is a very eminent committee?  It is one of the most important committees in the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the whilstleblowing protection offered to employees of F&Aacute;S to enable them to speak up against serious wrongdoing in the organisation.  However, I am not aware that any such protection is afforded to officials from the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Very often officials from the Department may encounter information that is important.  Why should they not have protection if they furnish or reveal such information?  It is important that this matter is examined too.  I appreciate the Minister of State is trying to herald a new beginning with the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill but in our view it falls some way short in that context.  Perhaps now is the time for a major overhaul.</P><Col N="833"/>
        <P>For many years my colleague and former party leader, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, championed and brought forward for consideration a Whistleblowers Protection Bill.  As far back as 1999 it was an issue which motivated him and about which he cared deeply.  The Bill was introduced by the Labour Party thanks to him.  The Government created all sorts of obfuscation, verbal gymnastics and downright empty rhetoric in order to stall that Bill.  Eventually it brought forward a motion seeking a discharge of an earlier Order of the D&aacute;il to allow consideration of the Bill.  For some time, the Taoiseach and other Ministers continued to give the impression that they working to strengthen and improve the Bill &mdash; a process the Labour Party would have accepted &mdash; but nothing was further from the truth.</P>
        <P>The purpose of Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Bill was to challenge the traditional culture of secrecy surrounding the conduct of business and public affairs in this country.  In the notorious litany of events which has reached the public domain, one was often compelled to ask whether anybody had stumbled across some of the wrongdoing that has now emerged.  If so, why was it not reported earlier?  People may well have known or had suspicions, but the consequences for whistle-blowers&rsquo; careers and livelihoods were such that it may have been easier to turn a blind eye.  I acknowledge that the protection being afforded now is important but I wanted to go further in suggesting that even departmental officials would be protected.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill proposed a new set of statutory rights for employees whether in the public or private sectors, to report and transmit information concerning illegality or malpractice which they discover in the course of their employment.  Under the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill, any employee who blows the whistle on fraud or malpractice would be entitled to protection against dismissal or any other sanction which his or her employer attempts to impose.</P>
        <P>There is clearly an obligation on the State to ensure that individuals who provide such information are not victimised or discriminated against in the wake of such disclosures.  We in the Labour Party welcome section 7 as a move in the right direction.  The Government should, however, take the next step by either introducing its own whistle-blowers&rsquo; legislation, or do the decent thing and accept the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill on whistle-blowers&rsquo; protection.  It is still fit for purpose and we are eager that it should be accepted.  My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, has been vociferous in that regard.</P>
        <P>With the permission of the House, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share the last five minutes of my slot with my colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be churlish not to acknowledge that F&Aacute;S has had significant successes, but I am worried by the degree of rigidity involved in its operations.  One may bring forward something that one feels is important, but it may get shot down, so there is a need for flexibility.  I have met some excellent people in F&Aacute;S over the years, including in my own county of Westmeath where I have had a lot of contact with them.  They are perceptive and diligent individuals who often have the genesis of a good idea.  They are at the coalface interacting with people and therefore they may well develop such proposals.  It should be possible to apply such an idea and put it into practice at regional level, so that it will not have to go through the full cycle of staff for consideration, which can be a merry-go-round.  Sometimes we need quick and effective action.  We need to strike while the iron is hot, so ideas should be allowed to germinate, grow and be put into action.  I am sure the Minister of State would share that notion of flexibility concerning ideas, which may incur the same level of expenditure but would produce more cost benefits.</P><Col N="834"/>
        <P>The Minister of State is from the west and will know that something which works in Mullingar may not work in Geesala.  A different application of schemes is required to suit specific problems that arise in particular areas.  My colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is aware that something that works in Gurranabraher may not work in Ballynacarrigy.  My constituency contains a fair number of rural areas, while hers has a significant urban element.  Something that works in rural Ireland may not have an application in urban areas.  The Minister of State is also aware of that and while he is from a big town, his constituency is very large.</P>
        <P>I am eager that we should not get the one-size-fits-all model in terms of this legislation.  It is nonsense to say that if it does not work in Ballynacarrigy, it will not work anywhere.  Various people have different skills demands and different levels of training are required to suit them.  We in the Labour Party want to see F&Aacute;S being strictly fit for purpose, more concerned with its essential core work of upskilling people&rsquo;s competences and qualifications, providing specific and well-resourced training programmes, giving an opportunity for people who may have illnesses or disabilities to participate positively by developing their individual skills.  We must get rid of the rigidity that often circumscribes participation in CE schemes.  Where these can be shown to be of use from the perspective of rehabilitation, we must allow people to make their contribution so they feel they are part of the workforce.</P>
        <P>There is nothing worse than seeing young lads who may have had drug problems being given a year on a scheme and then, because they are under 40 years of age, they must be let go.  Effectively, that puts such people back on social welfare.  Those people can feel ten feet tall by making a contribution to the local park or community centre.  They feel they are part of society because such work rebuilds their confidence and gets them back on the employment ladder by making a contribution.  When they partake in such schemes, however, their income may be capped at &euro;20,000.  What is the difference between social welfare and CE money?  The Minister of State has to find it all at the table, so it would be better to put some social welfare money into CE schemes so people could make a contribution.  That would get people working again.</P>
        <P>I am more concerned with F&Aacute;S returning to its core duties and functions, rather than pursuing esoteric and far-fetched notions about courses, which NASA may have inspired in Florida or elsewhere.  That day is gone.  I did not know this was happening until I read about it and I was taken aback.  F&Aacute;S had an annual budget of &euro;1 billion at the time.</P>
        <P>People are entitled to examine new areas of activity.  I am not against that because one must be innovative and be creative.  I represent a rural area and people want to participate in training schemes to gain skills, but it is no use giving people mock computers to work on.  The expenditure should be put into value-for-money projects.  Whatever income we have should be spent here at home, but in fairness to F&Aacute;S executives and board members, they may well have to travel abroad.  Realism needs to be brought into the debate but at the same time the Minister cannot say officials are banned from travelling.  They will not learn anything sitting in the same room.  People ask me why I do not correspond by e-mail but I am a doubting Thomas and I want to put my hands on documents and information.  It is important that officials have an opportunity to travel to examine novel and innovative attempts to deal with pressing issues in the unemployment and training fields and so on but they should only do so when it is absolutely essential and when some positive outcome can be achieved or important help secured.</P>
        <P>I will illustrate how important are F&Aacute;S personnel.  I was informed by Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan about their important role in monitoring various schemes together with other agencies such as the VEC and the HSE.  Each agency had a representative on the board of a scheme and the Deputy was also a member.  She was extremely impressed and taken by the excellent level of reporting and oversight undertaken by the F&Aacute;S representative and this must be acknowledged. <Col N="835"/>  We cannot throw the baby out with the bath water because a few things went wrong.  I understand the new director general, Mr. O&rsquo;Toole, has commissioned in-depth audit reports to address all the issues raised but it is important that the organisation&rsquo;s role in schemes such as this remains uninhibited.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to conflicts of interest are positive.  We must get rid of the perception if there is a conflict of interest that somebody knows somebody else &mdash; d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i &mdash; and people are getting something because of who they are rather than what expertise they bring to the table.  We must get away from that mentality because we have been bedevilled with it and while it does not permeate everywhere, it only needs to permeate once to become the accepted wisdom.  It is important in that context that conflicts of interest are made public.  This had to be done on local authorities when I was a member.  If one passed by a scheme in one&rsquo;s area, one had to bid goodbye and get out.  It was proper order to get councillors the hell out of there because they had nothing to do with it and they should not have tried to influence anybody on the way out.  One made a declaration, for example, regarding land ownership and nobody should have tried to influence anyone by looking through the keyhole or winking on the way out.  I did not like that either.</P>
        <P>I refer to activation measures and courses.  I have a long-standing bugbear about the treatment of apprentices.  I meet young people every day who did their training as plasterers, electricians, carpenters and so on and they are the best in the business.  They do not have grand certificates and so on but I value them as much as any other tradesman.  I will not belittle them and ask for their F&Aacute;S, City &amp; Guilds or RECI certificate.  I know apprentices who reached their final examination where they had to answer questions about mathematical formulas but they failed.  I contacted the previous director general of F&Aacute;S about this and I hope Mr. O&rsquo;Toole will take this up.  I want these apprentices to be given another opportunity.  They have been given the third run.  They were told after four or five years as an apprentice they were no good and they were thrown on the scrapheap because they did not pass examinations even though they knew everything about electricity.  It is time they were given another opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing time.  The apprentices to whom he referred end up working in the black economy.  They are extraordinarily good at what they do and they are in demand.  If they were encouraged and helped over the finish line, they would work in the real economy and we would all benefit.  This issue should be examined.</P>
        <P>When I was notified that the legislation was being introduced, I cried &ldquo;yippee&rdquo;.  Finally when something had gone wrong in an organisation, the officials at the top would pay for it, the blame would be laid at their doors and the Government would reorganise at the top rather than at the bottom as was the case for years.  When something went wrong previously, the guy opening the door was usually fired not the guy who was responsible or who had benefited.</P>
        <P>The majority or 99.9% of people working in F&Aacute;S are not engaged in junketeering.  They pick up the telephone when a public representative calls about people&rsquo;s apprenticeships or when people need to be transferred from A to B or a particular skill group is needed.  They are decent, honourable people who are always willing to help.  I no longer jump for joy regarding the legislation because of the reconfiguration of the board.  While the number of members will be reduced and the Minister is starting in the right place, which is at the top, where are the worker directors?  Where is the guarantee that women will be represented on the board?  We are not dealing with the same workforce as when the current board was appointed and the workforce comprises all sections of society.</P>
        <P>Media reports state the legislation is about ensuring expertise will drive the organisation, which we all support, but surely there could be no greater expertise than that of those who work in the organisation and who have the confidence of the staff.  When times get bad and <Col N="836"/>changes are needed within the organisation, the worker directors would bring the workforce with them.  They did in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  They are, good decent people who are prepared to give their time to their organisation.  The Minister should reconsider this provision and ensure a cross section of representation on the board.  I do not want to hear that Ireland is too small and there are not enough women with the expertise to serve.  We have enough women and they are waiting to be asked.  Whether the worker directors are male or female, they must be considered because F&Aacute;S employees did not cause this problem and they should not lose out as a result.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>Like Deputies Penrose and Shortall, I am making the case for worker directors.  Why should those who continue to work for the organisation be the fall guys in this?  The Minister is going the right way but she needs to tweak the legislation a little more.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Like many of the previous speakers in this debate on the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009, I have weekly, and sometimes daily, interaction with the front line staff in F&Aacute;S and, as the previous speaker mentioned, 99.9% of the people working in F&Aacute;S are committed, experienced and have great expertise in terms of the job they do.  As with any barrel of apples, if one or two are off colour, the rot tends to spread quickly.  However, the body of people I deal with in F&Aacute;S on a regular basis are nothing but professional and provide an excellent service not just to their own communities, but throughout the country.  As the chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Willie Penrose, mentioned, this is not just an urban issue.  In huge swathes of rural Ireland F&Aacute;S plays a crucial role in daily life, and that must be recognised.  I want to record my admiration for the staff in F&Aacute;S who do a superb job on a day to day basis.</P>
        <P>In terms of what F&Aacute;S grew from, I recall the time of AnCO and the national manpower service, which were crucial agencies to this economy and this country when they were first established.  The reason for instituting those agencies was to ensure that our young people were given an opportunity.  In the days of AnCO and the national manpower service many people left school at the age of 13 and 14 with no qualifications and very little in terms of educational achievement.  Those agencies were put in place to tackle a deficit that existed at the time.</P>
        <P>Over time, the role of our national training agency has changed dramatically, in some cases for the better, but not in all cases.  As was pointed out, F&Aacute;S provided a myriad of services initially as a training agency, but it has expanded into areas which would be better serviced by other Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>On the core function of F&Aacute;S and the reason for this legislation, in fairness to the Committee of Public Accounts, it has done an excellent job regarding this particular controversy, particularly in dealing with issues in the public interest, but also in the interest of F&Aacute;S.  In fairness to the Minister, the majority of the recommendations from the conclusions and recommendations of the PAC report and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General are included in this legislation.</P>
        <P>Starting with the board of F&Aacute;S, the changes that will be made include reducing the size of the board from 17 to 11.  A rolling system of appointments will be introduced which is welcome because as with any other agency or board, people become stale, so to speak, having served for many years on a board.  It is welcome that they will be changed on a regular basis.  That will bring new blood and new ideas to a board.</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P>The removal of the automatic right to nominate individuals for appointment is welcome.  We have seen that, because of the way F&Aacute;S was structured initially, the board became unwieldy.  In my opinion, that filtered down to the rest of the organisation in that in some areas F&Aacute;S was dealing with there was a distinct lack of direction from board level.  That is something this legislation will remedy.</P>
        <P>Other provisions include making the director general of F&Aacute;S accountable to the Oireachtas; requiring the disclosure of conflicts of interest on the part of directors and staff of F&Aacute;S; and banning directors and staff of F&Aacute;S from any involvement in matters where they have a conflict of interest.  That is standard procedure in most boards in that if somebody sitting at the table has a conflict of interest, he or she is obliged to declare that and remove themselves from whatever decisions are being made.  That is not just in the interest of the individual, but also in the interest of the board.</P>
        <P>The final provision is the protection for the whistle-blower.  We must be careful with any legislation that introduces a measure such as this because with rights come responsibilities, and people should be responsible.  It stitches in protection not just for the person who may have some information which he or she feels must be passed on either to the board, superiors or the Department but also for the agency and board.  That is a crucial element because as with other major organisations employing thousands of people, there will be some who will make unscrupulous charges against an individual or section.  The way this legislation is framed will ensure that an individual with information is protected while at the same time there is protection for the board, its members and the rest of the organisation.</P>
        <P>Since this controversy kicked off early last year, the issue of accountability of staff and board members has become significant.  The way this legislation is framed, such accountability is clear and understood.  Everybody who will be associated with the board of F&Aacute;S will be obliged to ensure that he or she is accountable and any decisions made, whether joint or individual, are subject to scrutiny.  People must be held accountable for the decisions they make, and this was not happening at the very highest levels at F&Aacute;S.  Many of the individual incidents of mismanagement which have come into the public domain with regard to senior management in F&Aacute;S can and will be avoided in future.</P>
        <P>The disclosure of people&rsquo;s interests is a standard procedure with all boards in State and semi-State agencies.  There is a requirement on people to disclose a particular interest they have; as far as I am aware, it is a legal obligation.  The Committee of Public Accounts has done significant work in unravelling the series of events which has led us to where we are today with the introduction of this piece of legislation.  The Minister and the Department have acted quickly and listened to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee.  The recommendations have been taken on board and this will lead to a meaner, leaner and more efficient and effective F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Economic, financial and employment factors mean we require, now more than ever, a State agency for training, further education, business support and to help people who have made an effort.  These people may have remained in education up to the leaving certificate and on to higher level education or they may have returned to education to improve the skills they may or may not have been able to tap into when they were younger.  In this economic climate, such people must be supported, and that is what F&Aacute;S is there to do.</P>
        <P>The Government and these Houses must ensure any decisions, whether at board, director or at front-line level, are in the interest of getting people back into employment and improving people&rsquo;s training and education.  The jobs, education and training which people receive should be sustainable and stay with people into the future.</P>
        <P>As public representatives, we are dealing with people on continuous education schemes and jobs initiatives.  We deal with partnerships, jobs clubs and organisations for the unemployed. <Col N="838"/> F&Aacute;S plays a significant role in this respect so the more we strengthen and build it, and the more we ensure that it is efficient and effective, the more dividends we will see in the long run.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy might tell Deputy O&rsquo;Brien that we said as much.  I welcome the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Deputy Brady referenced the AnCO days and although I am even older, I can remember those days.  I remember standing beside Gene Fitzgerald, a good man from Cork who was then Minister for Labour, when he opened the old AnCO centre in Cookstown industrial estate.  The refurbishment and redevelopment of that centre in recent times got some headlines.</P>
        <P>It is good that people who are unemployed and seeking training or other help at any time, and particularly in a recession, are able to do so in first-class facilities where they can be comfortable about what they are doing.  I was glad to hear other colleagues make the point about the importance of the service locally.  I heard such comments in recent Private Members&rsquo; motions.  There are difficulties, which this Bill addresses, and there has been much recent controversy surrounding F&Aacute;S.  However, we are also entitled to be positive about what F&Aacute;S has done in all our communities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>To be parochial for a moment, I went to the opening of the new St. Dominic&rsquo;s community centre in Tallaght.  Those of us who attended it were deeply impressed by what we saw and it was good to hear community representatives pay warm tribute, in these difficult times, to the efforts of F&Aacute;S and its local personnel.  It is important to do so.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Like everybody else, I live in a community which has been affected by the recession.  Tallaght is the third-largest population centre in the country and we have seen significant increases recently in unemployment, with over 10,000 people now unemployed.  It is very important for us to make the case, in discussing this Bill, that F&Aacute;S resources must continue to respond to the needs of the people.  People are finding themselves unemployed often for the first time.  There is a new poor and people who were always in good jobs and able to find employment are now being suddenly challenged.  I do not wish to be smart about it but I bring to my politics my own experience in being made redundant three times.  I know what it is like, although I do not mean this in a flippant or virtuous way.  It is important for us to support people.</P><Col N="839"/>
         <P>There are many reasons for the public to be angry about what happened in F&Aacute;S but those of us representing communities where there are issues and where we use F&Aacute;S are entitled to say that an unemployed person needs a course, in their own community as far as possible, regardless of whatever else is going on.  Not a week goes by in my Tallaght office when representations are not made to F&Aacute;S management asking for constituents to be looked after.  I hope that will continue to be the case.</P>
        <P>I hope the management of F&Aacute;S will consider this debate and build on its previous efforts, improving as it goes along.  For the first time in ten years there are serious employment problems in our communities, and my community is no different in that regard.  Many well-educated young people are emerging from schools but cannot access employment immediately.  F&Aacute;S clearly has a role to play in that regard.</P>

        <P>&ldquo;[G]overnment of the people, by the people, for the people&rdquo; &mdash; these are the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln.  What the NAMA legislation represents is government of the developers, by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens, for the banks.  It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  The country as a whole has been devalued by the despicable behaviour of a few.</P><Col N="840"/>
        <P>While it is easy to accuse developers of causing the greater part of this debacle, in my view, it was the bankers who were responsible.  There were a number of telling signs that we had gone off track.  The two main banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, both sold their headquarters to pension funds when the market was at its maximum.  If that was not bad enough, the banks then got a tax break which is costing taxpayers additional moneys.  Again, the banks are running rings around taxpayers, the citizens of this State.  As always, they are self-serving and clever.  When those who provide funding sell their most valuable assets, alarm bells should go off all over the place.  Unfortunately, while alarm bells were going off, well-paid public and civil servants in the higher echelons of regulation chose the easiest path open to them.  In other words, they did nothing.</P>
        <P>The banks were lending tens of millions to people with no record of trading in a downturn.  Funds were allocated to ensure that projects advanced, with no analysis of what would happen if the market did not remain at its height.  Did no one believe a slowdown had to occur or that a crash could occur?  Did no one believe our property bubble could only end like all other property bubbles worldwide, namely, that it would burst?  Where are the people who were talking about a moderate correction to the market and a soft landing?  They have vanished because there could never have been such a landing.  That was fanciful talk by those who had an interest in keeping prices high.  Who are they?  They are the Government, auctioneers, bankers and developers.</P>
        <P>It is disturbing that some of these now likely to be bankrupt developers are focusing on starting new companies in other countries in order that they might continue to trade.  I must say one thing: these guys can build.  What I find distasteful is the prospect that people who contributed significantly to our recession can adopt a business-as-usual attitude and commence trading in other jurisdictions.  I have not mentioned builders because many have continued to operate in the area they know and understand best, namely, the building trade.  Not all of them went into development.</P>
        <P>Members might ask how I have reached the conclusion that State officials took the easy option.  They need only consider the position of Mr. Patrick Neary, the former CEO of the Financial Regulator.  How could this supposedly independent official cry halt when every Government Minister, the current Taoiseach and his immediate predecessor included, were saying &ldquo;Party on lads, our economy is built on sound foundations&rdquo;?  How could Mr. Neary, who was appointed by the Government, state that everything his political masters were saying was wrong?  It was, after all, former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who said that independent, objective economists whom he believed to be talking down the economy should consider committing suicide.  What was the outcome for the former CEO of the Financial Regulator who acted so poorly on behalf of the State?  Just like Mr. Molloy from F&Aacute;S, he received a massive golden handshake.  The lesson is to do one&rsquo;s job badly and be rewarded for it.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il, which has been in Government for 23 of the past 25 years, has led us to this.  God forbid that independent regulators should have acted independently.  This would have been too much to ask.  What were the governors of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland doing when these events were occurring?  The fact that the European Central Bank holds sway does not mean that these individuals could absolve themselves of carrying out all further duties.  However, absolve themselves they did.  We, as a nation, are now paying the price.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance stated that he will accept amendments on Committee Stage.  The issue of valuation has received a great deal of coverage but that relating to the types of assets involved has not.  In my view, we have the good, the bad and the ugly assets.  There is, however, <Col N="841"/>a fourth type, namely, the useless asset.  I refer here to the &euro;9 billion in rolled up interest owed to the banks.  This is not an asset.  Why are we giving the banks a free pass in respect of interest?  Another useless asset is the &euro;28 billion given to Anglo Irish Bank.  These funds will never be seen again.</P>
        <P>Why is the Government not facilitating small business in the same way it is assisting the banks?  There are animals grazing on some of the ugly assets to which I refer and that is likely to be the case for many years to come.  I am of the view that there must be a buy-back clause in respect of these assets.  The banks would love to transfer them to NAMA at the supposed prices at which they were originally purchased.  During its lifetime, NAMA will never realise those prices, or a fraction of them.  The relevant clause will then force valuers acting for the banks to identify a realistic figure that might be achieved over time.  If this does not come to pass, the banks must repurchase such assets at the price at which they were transferred to NAMA in the first instance.  The taxpayers of today and their successors will, therefore, be protected and will not forced to take the most deplorable hit in respect of the poorest of assets purchased by developers in the Celtic Tiger era.</P>
        <P>Assets which involve estates that have almost been completed must be handled carefully.  I have heard some talk of social housing being provided in these estates.  I was previously a member of local authority and I urge caution in this regard.  Ghettos are man made.  God forbid that the State might allow the mistakes that were made in Limerick and Ballymun to be repeated in every town throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The current market value of assets must be considered.  What is that value at present?  The market value of a residential unit is what it sells for today, irrespective of whether the sale is a forced one.  A sale is a sale.  Why do we have an archaic system which does not allow the public to know the actual price of something?  A private treaty sale should not be private.  There must be open disclosure of the amount for which a property changes hands.  This can be easily achieved.  When legal representatives close a sale, the Revenue Commissioners could be notified and the amount involved could be placed on the relevant website within a short period.  This would stop the type of sharp practice that held sway for far too long whereby the prices related to people were incorrect.  Under the system I propose, if a house is sold and a buyer wants to inquire as to the price, he or she can check the website to discover the real figure.  The secrecy involved in the current system always ensures that unsuspecting purchasers overpay for properties.</P>
        <P>The Government believes this is a &ldquo;Ronseal&rdquo; deal.  In other words, it does what it says on the tin.  My concern is that if we value these assets high enough, it will give the banks the opportunity to cash their Government bonds with the European Central Bank.  For all intents and purposes, this is the European Central Bank&rsquo;s way of injecting capital into the economy.  We thank it for that.  However, there is no guarantee from our friends in the lending institutions that the funds in question will be invested to ensure that existing jobs will be protected and new ones created.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many jobs are teetering on the brink of extinction because of cashflow difficulties.  As a result of these difficulties, the banks have not, to date, facilitated sustainable businesses by providing them with funds.  The banks can put the funds provided by the ECB on their own balance sheets in order to meet the requirement for them to have in place the correct ratio between funds lent and funds on deposit.  The doomsday scenario is that even after all these funds have been provided by NAMA, the State will be required to further recapitalise and even nationalise the banks.  That matter is for the State and no one else to decide.</P>
        <P>I wish to take issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr. Joaqu&iacute;n Almunia.  Mr. Almunia <Col N="842"/>attended a press conference on Friday at which he stated that NAMA should be rushed through as quickly as possible.  This represents an outright interference in national affairs.  It is unforgivable that an EU Commissioner should make such an intervention on the night before the Green Party took its vote to keep Fianna F&aacute;il in government.</P>
        <P>There is a long-standing convention that Commissioners do not interfere in national politics.  However, as can be seen with the NAMA legislation, all pressures are being brought to bear to ensure a successful outcome.  The Green Party Members, who rolled over so easily are no longer green but are more akin to turquoise.</P>
        <P>As for the banks, these are the same lending institutions that facilitated the transfer of funds out of the country illegally and the establishment of many offshore accounts.  They set up dozens of accounts per client, in some cases with false names, to mask their clients and their fraudulent actions.  Those who were caught were pursued by the Revenue Commissioners and paid the relevant tax, interest and penalties that were due.  The banks paid their fines and continued with business as usual.  How can one trust these people when their actions and deeds have been so dishonourable towards the State?  Lending institutions have a commitment towards shareholders with no public interest remit.  However, when they face ruin due to their reckless trading, they ask the State to intervene and save their industry.  Other countries that have bailed out their banking sectors are finding out how grateful are these banks.  The Obama Administration is highly dissatisfied with its financial institutions, which are not lending to any business, big or small.  Will we find ourselves in the same position?  This is not simply my opinion.  Dr. Michael Casey, former head of economics at the Central Bank, described NAMA as a stroke.  At the Glenties summer school, Dr. Patrick Honohan, who now is Governor of the Central Bank, stated there was no guarantee of lending from the Irish banks.  The European Central Bank has noted that banks have a self-interest in hoarding money and Professor Joseph Stiglitz stated that to buy over market value was criminal.  I note that Professors Stiglitz and Krugman are both Nobel Prize laureates in economics.</P>
        <P>This Government is so determined to operate on a business-as-usual basis that another major concern arises.  Instead of lending to small businesses, what if the banks trade conservatively and purchase Irish Government bonds?  In this scenario, the Government provides its bonds for the six covered financial institutions, which in turn cash these bonds with the European Central Bank.  The aforementioned banks then buy Irish Government bonds on the international markets.  While this is not allowed, if it happens it will be nothing short of a three-card trick.</P>
        <P>Astonishingly, our six institutions, which are small by international standards, are placing their corporate identity ahead of everything else.  Members should recall the belligerence shown towards the Minister for Finance when the idea was floated about a merger of some of the aforementioned institutions.  Their corporate identity is much more important than safeguarding taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The Minister for Finance must ensure that the observation of NAMA is open, transparent, and unquestioned by all because, otherwise, the public will not believe this one-party Fianna F&aacute;il State will not favour those who have funded them throughout the Celtic tiger era boom.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance must ensure that taxpayers are not compromised by developers whose loans have been transferred to NAMA but whose liability to the State remains the same.  This can be no developers&rsquo; charter for them to renege, file for receivership or go into examinership only to reappear some time later to continue trading as though nothing has happened.  These are the same people who helicoptered, jetted and lived like merchant princes of the 1700s.  Taxpayers will not accept funding NAMA to allow developers re-establish business as usual.  There are concerns that many developers have placed properties with no mortgages into <Col N="843"/>family members&rsquo; names.  While their companies may be bankrupt at a corporate level, such individuals still will retain a huge asset value that is out of reach and in effect is being paid for by the citizens.  This is not acceptable.  The personal guarantees are a legal minefield and may not be worth the paper on which they are written.  I do not doubt there will be many legal challenges before a clear corridor is available for officials within NAMA.</P>
        <P>The Zoe group&rsquo;s court cases over the summer require comment as to have two cases heard within a few weeks in this State&rsquo;s superior courts is unique.  However, the Supreme Court headed off the Zoe group at the pass and criticised the concept of future economic value by stating the only value is current market value and that anything beyond that is a guesstimate.  The banks covered by the State guarantee and NAMA have a huge question to answer.  How can NAMA deal with a covered Irish institution that has a property with a mortgage on it when a non-covered bank trading within the State also has a mortgage on the same property?  Will NAMA pay off the cross-mortgaged properties of those non-covered institutions which trade in the Republic?</P>
        <P>The civil servants in our one-party State who chose not to tell the emperor he was wearing no clothes will be the same individuals who will attempt to force the banks to provide capital to business and who failed us at the peak of the boom.  Do the State&rsquo;s employees have sufficient financial, legal and administrative abilities to compete with the hired guns that the major banks and developers are likely to draft in?  I do not believe so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Government bail out citizens as quickly as the banks?  The Department of Social and Family Affairs will not provide mortgage interest relief for a household with any source of earned income.  In the case of a dual-income household that is working to pay for its house, even the loss of one job and reduction to part-time status of the other will elicit no help for such people from the State, which is highly unfair.  When will a NAMA be provided for those who are earning the least and who bought the most expensive properties in the country?  Such people, who did it right, should not be allowed to fail.  The muscle and power of this great little country should provide support and backup for these people.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael proposal for a recovery bank has been dealt with by my colleagues on this side of the House.  It is a good idea, which would provide &euro;22 billion in a wholesale bank market to ensure the continuation of business.  The purpose of NAMA is to allow time and inflation catch up on the &euro;54 billion.  The Bill to provide this sum is the worst legislation that has ever come before this House.  The real difficulty with NAMA concerns our ability to provide funds for those within the State who need its services.  The measure of any society is how well it looks after those who are less capable of looking after themselves.  However, this proposal will remove our capacity and the cuts, savings, adjustments, or whatever the Government Members wish to call them, will be for naught.  All our abilities to raise additional funds will be consumed by NAMA and banks are to be looked after before the citizens.  If one is keeping score, the score is &euro;77 billion to the banks and nil to the citizens.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I wish to demonstrate what is a million and what is a billion because figures involving millions and billions are being thrown about and people have lost sight of what they mean.  While people may know what is a million, a billion is 1,000 million.  I propose to count in seconds rather than in euro.  If one counts 1 million seconds and transfers that number into days, it amounts to 12 days.  However, 1 billion seconds amounts to 12,000 days or 33 years.  If one takes 54 billion seconds, the equivalent figure is 1,750 years.  We could be paying back this money forever.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to contribute to this historically important debate on the Bill to establish the National Asset Management Agency.  I add my name to those who have already commended the Minister for Finance on publishing this legislation.  I cannot think of a more important item of legislation to come before the House and, given the circumstances that created the need for this Bill, I hope that nothing of this magnitude need ever appear before the House in the future.</P>
        <P>The scale of the difficulties the Minister and the Government are seeking to overcome might appear daunting and intractable but anyone who reads the Bill will quickly see how clear-headed and straightforward is the approach of the Minister.  This is one of the great strengths of the Bill and the overall approach to securing the future stability of the Irish banking system and allowing the lifeblood of any economy, the flow of credit to businesses and households, to flow.</P>
        <P>From a housing perspective, particularly in terms of social housing, I see enormous potential for real and meaningful synergy between what NAMA will do and what my Department is already doing.  For some time, the social housing investment programme has been undergoing a significant restructuring to shift the focus increasingly towards long-term leasing arrangements, with lesser reliance on construction and acquisition.  I have initiated this restructuring for a number of reasons.  If we are to cater for the range of social housing needs that exist at different stages of the life cycle, a uniform social housing stock does not fit the bill.  We need a flexible system of graduated supports that can be adapted to cater from differing needs of different households throughout various stages of the life cycle.  It must also be capable of taking account of the changing circumstances, for better and for worse, of a particular household over time rather than focusing and permanently defining need by reference to a point in time snapshot.  As part of that, we must accept that the most appropriate response to social housing needs is not always the provision of a physical social housing unit for life.</P>
        <P>The approach I am taking is also a reflection of the new reality in the property market.  While demand in the housing market acted like an on-off button, dropping off rapidly, the supply side was more like a cooling oven, slower to respond to the change in market conditions.  The result is a considerable oversupply of housing available for occupation around the country.  Estimates of the overhang range from 35,000 units at the low end to well over 100,000 at the upper end, depending on how one defines the issue.  The most recent full assessment of social housing need in March 2008 indicated there were more than 56,000 households on local authority waiting lists in need of housing.  It is likely this figure has increased in the meantime.  Even if we were operating in a resource rich environment, it would make eminent sense to endeavour to match up these existing unsold units, of the right type in the right location that meet the sustainable community agenda, with existing demands rather than add further to the housing stock to meet needs through construction programmes that will take time to deliver.  However we are not in a resource-rich environment.  Therefore a move away from the tried and tested build or buy approach is driven by necessity.  Were we to stick to construction and acquisition programmes to meet social housing need we could not hope to make any meaningful inroads into existing need.</P>
        <P>By contrast, through careful management of the programme and by taking advantage of the value in the market, the long-term leasing schemes I introduced will enable us to continue the momentum built up in recent years in meeting the needs of record numbers of households.  Last month I launched a further strand to the long-term leasing initiative that will enable the Government to tap into the dynamism and expertise of the voluntary housing sector.  This new approach will allow voluntary bodies to enter into agreements with developers or landlords <Col N="845"/>interested in leasing units on a long-term basis and also to engage directly with the lending institutions with a view to acquiring homes that will be leased for social housing purposes.  This innovation has the potential to transform the landscape of social housing provision in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Direct lending by banks to voluntary housing bodies for such purposes with the leasing income stream as a means for servicing borrowings is a further example of clear-eyed alignment of the Government&rsquo;s social and economic objectives.  Banks get to return to prudent and responsible lending, using the flow of credit to the economy, and the funding advanced means that the housing needs of disadvantaged households can be met.  From the perspective of the voluntary and corporate housing sector, this initiative will enable it to have less reliance on Exchequer support, making the sector stronger and more dynamic.  It will further cement the partnership between the sector, the State and local authorities in delivering this crucially important aspect of social policy.</P>
        <P>This is happening even in advance of the formal establishment of NAMA.  My Department is finalising the terms of an agreement between the Irish Banking Federation, the County and City Managers Association and the Irish Council for Social Housing, setting out a shared understanding of each party&rsquo;s potential role in progressing the long-term leasing initiative.  At the moment several voluntary housing bodies are advancing proposals with various financial institutions that could see units delivered very quickly.</P>
        <P>Once NAMA is established and loans transfer across with properties attached, my Department will step up engagement with the team.  This engagement has been under way for some months and I have met with representatives of NAMA as we seek to extract the maximum social dividend from the overall process by providing a return on residential units suitable for long-term leasing purposes.  The interim NAMA team has already met with some voluntary housing bodies.  I welcome this direct contact and hope the relationship continues to be fruitful for NAMA, the voluntary housing sector and my Department.</P>
        <P>The approaches I have outlined and the clear synergies with the role of NAMA point to a considerable social dividend that will be delivered from the Government&rsquo;s overall efforts to restore the public finances and our banking system to health.  We are acutely aware of what is being asked of the taxpayer.  I welcome the safeguards in the NAMA Bill and the proposed inclusion of a loss levy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In parallel with NAMA, our focus is on maintaining or restoring the financial well-being of individual households and addressing issues of debt.  The new programme for Government sets out commitments on debt enforcement and support for distressed mortgage holders to expand and make more flexible options available from lenders and borrowers in dealing with debt situations.  Notwithstanding the extremely low rate of repossession in Ireland by international standards, it is important that the full range of mechanisms is available for fair and compassionate resolution of debt management problems.</P>
        <P>I conclude by commending this Bill and by complimenting the Minister and his officials on their hard work and clear vision.  I look forward to working with NAMA and to continuing the efforts of my Department to deal proactively with the new circumstances in the residential property market, seeking to make economic necessity and social need work in tandem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge and appreciate the fact that the Minister for Finance published this legislation on 30 July, allowing ample time for people across the country to debate the matter.  It has been debated at many meetings and by all citizens.  It is an issue that everyone has a view on and this is a good thing in itself.  NAMA is the most important Bill to arise in the House in decades.  When we are long gone from here we will remember this time, this decision and why it is so important.  NAMA is designed to provide the banks with a clean <Col N="846"/>bill of health and, as a consequence, provide the flow of credit on a commercial basis to individuals and businesses in the economy.</P>
        <P>The banking system is vital.  From meetings we have all had with businesses and service providers who are having difficulty securing finance to develop their businesses, we see the importance of the banking system in terms of the loss of jobs from those unable to develop their businesses.  It is essential we address the issue of the availability of banking finance in the economy, particularly to small businesses.  Governments all over the world have had to step in during the international crisis.  Delaying action in these matters is not an option and only puts a greater cost on the taxpayer in the long term.  It is very important to act now in order to benefit from the economic recovery as it emerges in the United States and across Europe.</P>
        <P>We are all very disappointed at the state of the banks and we are annoyed at the way our regulatory system let us down.  There was appalling behaviour by some in the financial system and it is important that confidence is restored through the action now being taken by the Government in this legislation.  There is no doubt that the banks should be exceedingly grateful to the taxpayer for support.  In return for the support, the Government has every right to expect the banks to play their part in the economic recovery of the State.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
        <P>An essential element of this is the provision of credit to business to develop, protect and create jobs.  The public knows we need the banks and we cannot have an economic recovery unless we fix the banking system.  People need to be reassured and the restoration of confidence is and will be key.</P>
        <P>The decline in the country&rsquo;s economic fortunes has been dramatic, profound and extremely swift.  Throughout the country people have lost jobs and taken pay cuts, with many people genuinely trying to stay afloat.  People are suffering and businesses are struggling.  It is imperative for our sake and for the sake of our children that we address this situation immediately because without a banking system we do not have an economy.  The banking system has let us all down but it is essential for the economy that the banks are revived.  However, this revival must go hand in hand with major reforms and restructuring of operations to ensure our people and economy are served in a proper manner by our banking system.</P>
        <P>Through a series of measures, the Government has sought to stabilise the banking sector since September 2008, beginning with the State&rsquo;s guarantee of 29 September 2008, the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland and the taking of Anglo Irish Bank into State ownership to prevent it from destabilising the rest of the banking system and the economy.  There is no doubt the banks should be exceedingly grateful to the Irish taxpayer, and the Government has already taken a number of important steps to ensure changes in the banking system, including the holding of shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland that have gained significantly in value since the taxpayers&rsquo; investment, a cap on bank executives&rsquo; pay, the fees that will accrue to the State as a result of the guarantee and the imposing of the new rules on the banks in their dealings with businesses and residential mortgage clients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The establishment of the National Asset Management Agency is not about bailing out the banks but about saving the economy.  All of the measures taken by the Government have sought to stabilise the Irish economy and to protect the Irish taxpayer.  As a result of NAMA, the banks will be in a better position to raise funds for lending to small and medium sized businesses as well as to individuals.  The banks will have greater access to cash through world markets and the European Central Bank because of the transfer of bonds from the State to the banks in the payments of the loans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The system which we are debating, the National Asset Management Agency, has the backing of the IMF and the ECB.  Both of these international agencies have commented favourably on <Col N="847"/>this approach.  In its recent report on Ireland, the IMF recognised that NAMA is a crucial step in resolving the banking crisis and will deal with the uncertainty about the asset quality, in particular those relating to land and property and associated loans on the banks&rsquo; balance sheets.  The IMF and most experts agree that as long as this matter is left unaddressed, the banks will not be able to play their part in the restoration of economic growth.  The IMF described NAMA as pivotal to the orderly restructuring of the financial sector and limiting long-term damage to the economy.  Financial markets and international commentators have already reacted positively to the NAMA legislation.  Last week, the <i>Financial Times</i> stated that nine tenths of the detail of the plan are absolutely right; its only concern is that the proposed bank levy in the event of NAMA making a loss might be too hard on the banks.</P>
        <P>With regard to developer account holders whose accounts will move to NAMA, it is important to note the clarity from the Minister that the amount a borrower owes will not change because of a transfer of a loan to NAMA.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that he intends to issue guidelines governing the agency&rsquo;s interaction with borrowers in the completion of properties acquired by NAMA.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate on the value of assets that NAMA will hold and discussions about current market price.  There is no current market price for land or development products because there is no market.  Banks are not making loans for land and development available as these loans are still on the banks&rsquo; books.  This means there are no buyers.  NAMA will not fire sale these assets; it is expected they will be disposed of over a five to ten year period.  An important matter the Minister identified for us is the estimation that NAMA will have to achieve less than a 10% uplift over current market values on its assets over ten years to break even.</P>
        <P>Another important point of clarity from the taxpayer&rsquo;s point of view is that if NAMA makes a profit this money will accrue to the taxpayer.  The Labour Party has proposed blanket nationalisation and that alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Full nationalisation would involve huge upfront costs from the taxpayer which the State would have to borrow on the international markets.  This is at a time when we are borrowing &euro;400 million a week just to keep going.  The Government has made it clear that if any further capital injections are required from the State for either of the two main banks it will be in the form of equity capital, which would have the effect of increasing State ownership of the bank.</P>
        <P>NAMA must be established and begin its work quickly to have the most impact and help the economy to recover as soon as possible.  Some European countries and the United States are beginning to recover economically.  If we do not take full advantage of what this recovery strategy offers us we will inevitably lose crucial time in our quest to stabilise our financial sector and limit the long-term damage to our economy.  The sooner this legislation is implemented the sooner the banks can start lending again.  This is in the best interests of the Irish people and Irish business.</P>

	<P>I thank the Acting Chair and I will need his protection.  I propose to share time with Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.</P>
        <P>I am old-fashioned in my view of politics and economics.  I understood the basic rule of capitalism was that the market determined the price and value of goods and services; at least that was the way it used to be.  Professor Joseph Stiglitz has been much quoted in recent times.  He is a Nobel laureate in economics, a former World Bank chief economist and was an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton.  He is not an unimportant observer in these matters and his firm advice to us &mdash; as a social democrat it is not something I would normally exhort to the House &mdash; is to play by the rules of capitalism.  It is a view that was firmly enforced by those who cheered on the economic bubble that was the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>For the boom years the Government took hold of an economy left to them by the rainbow Government which was creating 1,000 new jobs a week based on solid exports, industry, production and real goods and services and created a parallel false economy based on inflation and bubble economics whereby we could all have a notional ever-increasing value on our homes and one could invest forever more in pyramid selling of land and property and it would be all right forever more.  On that basis we could reduce our tax base and increase public expenditure because this bubble was going to expand forever.</P>
        <P>It is a profound irony that what is now proposed in the Bill before the House is that the rules of capitalism are no longer to apply to the capitalists.  The rules of capitalism are not to apply to the speculators and bankers who created the problem in the first instance.  Of course, the rules of capitalism are to apply in full measure to ordinary mortals, those who bought their homes at the height of the boom.  They are left with inflated mortgages which they will spend their lives trying to pay back.  There is no redress or support for them.  The Bill proposes to place a generational burden on the taxpayer.  We do not know the cost despite all the stabs at costing it from the Government side of the House.  The true cost of this extraordinary measure will not be known until the fullness of time.</P>
        <P>The core of the proposal is amazing.  The basic principle is to overpay banks for assets.  That basic core principle has been described by Professor Joseph Stiglitz as criminal.  That is hardly an understatement of reality.  He also said:</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">There is an alternative.  Play by the rules of capitalism &mdash; if you cannot pay back your debt, shareholders and bondholders lose.  If the Government puts in money, it needs to get control commensurate with the money put in.  It also should get a return proportionate to the risk involved &mdash; in this case, it is a big risk.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That is the view of capitalism and those who have been recognised internationally as the main spokespeople for the capitalist economy.</P>
        <P>What is proposed, however, in NAMA is that the State will overpay by design for so-called distressed assets on the basis of a new economic concept that I never heard before &mdash; the hope dividend.  The new concept for economic planning &ndash; certainly not a sound one for State economic planning &ndash; is that we are to hope that some time in the future the value of the assets we take into public ownership now will be greater.  We will not pay the market, the real or true value of these assets but instead put a price of hope on them, hoping it will be achieved some years hence.</P>
        <P>Valuing these assets is like a gazing into a crystal ball or being an economic Mystic Meg.  We are going to gamble the good name, treasure, fortune and resources of this State at taking a stab in our depressed economy on the potential price of assets that were deliberately overvalued in recent years.</P>
        <P>Members opposite get agitated when it is fairly and honestly stated that this is a banker&rsquo;s solution, if a solution at all.  I am sorry Deputy Wallace has left the Chamber but the Labour Party alternative is not blanket nationalisation.  Instead, it is a temporary nationalisation of the strategic two banks to achieve, as Joseph Stiglitz said, the normal aims of capitalism &ndash; that he who buys the assets, controls the outcome.  There is no easy solution in all of this, any solution is fraught with risks.  To minimise risk and maximise safeguards for the taxpayers of today and the future, the agreed path of many economic commentators, including Professor Stiglitz, is the Labour Party&rsquo;s choice.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s expectation of property price rises in the future is an essential ingredient if the NAMA plan is to succeed.  Apparently, we all, collectively as a nation, must hope for another property boom as the way of getting back the State&rsquo;s investment.  This is the property boom which has already proved ruinous to thousands of ordinary families across the country who cannot pay the exorbitant prices it created for housing.</P>
        <P>The Greens have grafted in a community role for NAMA which leads to a contradiction.  Is NAMA to be an agency to get back public moneys or a property investment agency which will give out land for social purposes?  The two cannot be encompassed in the same objective.</P>
        <P>Another suggestion is that NAMA money is not real money, meaning it could not be spent on the provision of public services.  It is a State guaranteed bond, a State IOU, in exactly the same way as every other State borrowing is achieved for the normal day-to-day running of the State.  It is real money and a real enormous crippling debt.  Worryingly, it is to be funded on the basis of a six-monthly bond at plus 1% of the ECB interest rate.  Every 1% interest rate change, with the &euro;54 billion in question, will mean an extra &euro;540 million per annum on payments.</P>
        <P>The main need of our economy now is the release of capital, a fact I am only too aware of having spent last Monday night with Wexford businesspeople at a forum in the Ferrycarrig Hotel.  Small businesses are going to the wall for want of money.  When it is stated with conviction that banks will start lending again as soon as NAMA is enacted, I do not believe it unless the State insists on taking ownership and dictating lending policy to the banks in the short term.</P>
        <P>It looks like we are stuck with the NAMA solution.  It is now Government policy, endorsed recently by the Greens and Fianna F&aacute;il.  We are stuck with this enormous gamble for ourselves <Col N="850"/>and our future.  It falls to the rest of us to pray that the Government solution is not worse than the original problem that the failed politicians on the other side of the House caused in the first place.</P>

	<P>An examination of the census figures demonstrates how unsustainable the property market had become.  Between 2002 and 2006, the number of households in Ireland grew by 181,563 with an additional 260,718 housing units being built.  Up to 80,000 houses were built as holiday homes or empty investment properties.  It was unsustainable that 30% of new housing should be empty.  Despite this surplus, house and land prices continued to rise suggesting demand was even greater than the unsustainable supply.  It was, however, a false demand buoyed up by falling credit standards, light-touch regulation, low interest rates, speculation and tax incentives on property.</P>
        <P>This led to the establishment of an unholy trinity, a collusion between bankers, large developers and Fianna F&aacute;il.  While the property bubble may have burst, who believes this relationship has also ended?  During this time we witnessed the reckless game of passing on liability to home owners that was acted out by developers and bankers.  A developer would borrow money from a bank to buy land for a housing project at an overinflated price.  The developer would then sell the housing units to purchasers at overinflated prices.  In turn, the banks facilitated the purchasers with loans, thereby transferring the developer&rsquo;s liability to the bank on to the purchaser.</P>
        <P>What did the bank do with these mortgages, many of them for 35-year terms, which could have been tangible assets in the NAMA process?  They sold those mortgages on the international market and with that money gave the cycle a kickstart again by lending money to developers at even more inflated prices.  This went around in circles while every September the developer went to the Galway tent, paid his dues and ensured that the game continued.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of this game was that the rules for traditional loans went out the window, 100% mortgages were introduced, the ratio of wage to value of home was abandoned to the extent that a first-time buyer was offered a loan of three to four times his wage and the scheduled payment over 20 years went up to 35 years.  The basic rules for buying property were abandoned in the past decade and a half, with Fianna F&aacute;il in Government observing this, while bankers used light touch regulation and developers laughed all the way to the bank, knowing that there was a killing to be made from the punters.</P>
        <P>Even affordable housing went out the window.  The notion that a house bought from a local authority for &euro;250,000 was an affordable house was a nonsense.  There are now almost 4,000 unsold affordable units across the country because they are overvalued and the punters know it.  Those houses are probably worth &euro;100,000 in the market.  The banks threw any duty of care out the window.  Their bottom line was to look after the shareholder, while the lender would be looked after by other means.  The fundamental rule of banking is that banks exist to serve shareholders and that will remain as we go into the NAMA process.</P>
        <P>There was no consideration given to the idea that lenders might become over-stressed because the group-think of the unholy trinity of Fianna F&aacute;il, bankers and developers was that the property values would increase for ever.  They did not care if the home purchaser defaulted on his or her loan, or if they had to repossess the house because they believed they could make a profit on the asset so they lent like hell.</P>
        <P>We are engaged in the subordination of democracy with what may be described as &ldquo;the namafication&rdquo; of every policy that goes through the D&aacute;il.  We witnessed that this afternoon as the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, indicated that social housing policy in future will be determined by <Col N="851"/>long-term leasing and letting.  The priority is not for local authorities to purchase homes to make a long-term investment for sustainable community development but for them to get out and lease vacant units.  That is &ldquo;namafication&rdquo; of social housing policy.  It is also present in the retail sector where the downward rent reviews are held up although the Bill was passed on 1 July last to create an inflated market value on properties for the NAMA evaluation.  That is causing serious difficulties for businesses that operate in the retail sector where the cost of rent far exceeds the costs of employment, energy and other factors, which is outside the European norm.</P>
        <P>Everybody expected that NAMA would offer some redress to the ordinary person who bought a home in recent years and now finds that not only is the bank doing him over for his mortgage repayment, but that while the banks are being bailed out the Government is not stepping in to protect him.  It is estimated that there could be 35,000 families in mortgage arrears, an increase of 150% in the past 16 months.  From 1 December 2009 legal proceedings dealing with mortgage difficulties will shift from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  In 2008, the High Court issued 120% more repossession orders than in 2007.  When the Circuit Court deals with these cases the legal costs of repossession orders will be significantly reduced, making it inevitable that these figures will increase substantially.  The Irish residential market is worth &euro;150 billion and the value of arrears is estimated at almost &euro;3.5 billion, or 2.3% which is up from 1% in the same period last year.</P>
        <P>As this crisis continues to grow we are witnessing the most expensive Bill ever moved in this House in order to bail out banks and developers that colluded, with the Government&rsquo;s assistance, to create the problem.  There has been no legislative action.  The only action to date has been to deal with a voluntary code that the Government states it is observing.</P>
        <P>I propose the establishment of a national home mortgage agency to deal with stressed mortgages and help individuals and families remain in their homes.  The consequences of families losing their homes are well known.  The agency would require a legislative framework to set out the criteria by which mortgage difficulties would be managed.  It would set out the obligations of Government, lending institutions and borrowers.</P>
        <P>In essence, the process would be an independent assessment which would establish the sustainable amount for distressed borrowers and what they could pay each month.  The agency would bring together borrowers, lenders and Government so that all stakeholders would share in the cost of ensuring that homeowners could afford their monthly mortgage repayments and stay in their homes.  Furthermore, it would set the parameters for mortgage assistance for those who are suffering because of the economic downturn and would set out the eligibility factors ensuring that borrowers make reasonable repayments and that this is not just a cop-out for them.  It will also involve the rescheduling of mortgages along with eligibility factors and a requirement that the borrower would be in regular contact with his or her lending institution.  The independent agency would review the eligibility of each applicant and assess whether the borrower should increase his or her payment or be entitled to an extension of the reduced payment.</P>
        <P>I propose a first-stage approach that will lead to the beginning of badly-needed normalisation of the residential property market whereby working people can afford to buy their homes at just prices, and expect to repay their mortgages within a predetermined and reasonable period with the assurance that they are protected in so doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  As the previous speaker said, we are here tonight to normalise and make a new beginning in a situation which has spiralled out of control and needs to be addressed.  Fortunately or unfortunately, this Government is the only group putting forward a proposal that has the capacity to deal with the issues to which Deputy Lynch has referred, normalising a way of life for so many, whether homeowners, small businesses, employers or larger enterprises that have not been able to avail of the necessary credit to allow them to continue in business.</P>
        <P>We are here because of the poor lending practices of the past.  Competition from external banks forced others into a position such that in order to maintain market share they had to give up many of the prudent practices that existed prior to the entry to the market of the external banks and follow their poor and imprudent lending practices.  Many of these pressures came from international sources.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We often fail to recognise that this is part of an international problem.  While we have a problem that is peculiar to Ireland it must be viewed in the context of what was initiated in the United States.  It happened some time prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  It started with the Clinton policy and the development of the notion of the subprime mortgage and the bundling, processing, re-processing and re-sale of what are, and clearly were from the start, toxic assets.  People borrowed money who had no capacity to repay it.  It was a policy of the Clinton Administration.  President Clinton stands over a policy that had been good in very many ways but which failed, initially, with the failure of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.  We know where matters went from there.  The comment in this House and abroad in the country would lead a person to believe the problem we have is in total isolation.</P>
        <P>The banking practice that emerged in this country over the past ten years is very different from that which existed heretofore.  During that period people on all sides of the House took pride in the fact that interest rates were much lower and not at punitive levels.  We all knew people who were cursed in the past with rates of 20% or 21%.  We prided ourselves out of that and perhaps did not realise what was opening up with the availability of money from money markets rather than from the deposits which were a factor in a bank&rsquo;s capacity prior to this.  The regulation regime allowed that to happen and policy makers on all sides of this House espoused it as the way forward.  It recognised, or reflected, a population and an economy that were maturing and that was something we embraced.  To try, as some have done on both sides, particularly among the Opposition, to lay this at the door of Fianna F&aacute;il and in this cynical way suggest it was something cooked up at a race meeting in Galway is disingenuous.  It belies those persons&rsquo; record in this House on policy development and in the approaches they took and the campaigns they led, whether from a trade union point of view or in commentary in this House.  It does not do them any particular honours to take this approach.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, the Government has had to deal with what was clearly a very difficult situation.  The suite of policy measures it has brought forward is appropriate and commensurate with the challenge and risk that existed at every opportunity, initially through the bank guarantee, through the &euro;7 million recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland and the ultimate nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  It has been suggested there might have been some other way and that Anglo Irish Bank, because of the toxicity of its assets and the practices that existed there, could have been eliminated.  This was suggested in despite of the people who had deposits or the bondholders, many of which were smaller institutions that provided credit in this State and pension funds.  That suggestion shows, at a minimum, an ignorance of the facts and, at best, an underestimate of the importance, from a systemic point of view, of where Anglo Irish Bank stood within our financial structure.  NAMA is a requirement at this stage. <Col N="853"/> It is about freeing up credit and that is clearly what the Government has set out, in response to the needs of Irish people.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>There is an issue about wrongdoing and I will not go into it.  It must be addressed.  Collectively, we must find a system to bring people to justice more quickly.  I do not suggest it should be administered in this House.  We have all commented on this &mdash; some with regard to the way justice was denied in this House most recently.  It would be wrong to try in this House to bring justice to those who have perpetrated wrong.  However, there are issues with regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  They concern the hiding of personal loans, the bed and breakfast approach to deposits in other institutions, and institutions making deposits in Anglo to boost or misrepresent results.  There was the distortion of the market by contriving to sustain a stock price that clearly should not have been sustained.  That points towards corruption.  As a society we must be much quicker in addressing this and bringing people to book if we wish to restore the credibility our financial system must have if it is to serve the citizens of this State in future years.  There was no choice about nationalisation.  Clearly, the approach NAMA takes in dealing with toxic assets will provide a cheaper suite of finance to Anglo Irish Bank than would have existed heretofore.</P>
        <P>There has been reference to the long-term pricing issue.  That shows an ignorance of the facts regarding how one might deal with so many assets, so much value and so much volume.  If we were to do a mark to market in an environment where there is no market effectively we would be saying it was a fire sale.  Who would end up with the assets?  If one were to take that approach, there would be no need for NAMA in the first place.  One would effectively throw away our entire property and development book, and the entire existing asset base required for the development of this country over the next 30 to 50 years, into the hands of sovereign wealth funds, Middle Eastern wealth funds established on the back of the oil industry or some of the Chinese wealth funds.  I do not believe anybody would suggest that the way to dispose of these assets is by way of a fire sale into an environment where no market exists in this country.  It is about an orderly disposal of the assets and this can only be done through NAMA.</P>
        <P>One must set some price in the event of not having a market.  Clearly, the approach being taken also acts as a stimulus because the funding coming from the European Central Bank is at the extremely low rate of 1.5% when moneys on international markets are currently costing much more.  When one considers that &euro;4 billion of that money will go into Anglo Irish Bank, this should reduce, to a very real extent, Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s concerns.  Perhaps these were the concerns of the Nobel Prize-winning economist.  If we were to have a discussion about that economist-professor, he has made some rather strange utterances in the past that I do not believe would find favour in the democratic system we operate in this country.  Perhaps that is for another day.</P>
        <P>There have been statements, most recently by Deputy George Lee, that the taxpayer was funding NAMA.  There is another canard if ever there was one.  The taxpayer is not funding NAMA &mdash; the ECB is doing so.  With the inclusion of a levy regime, as proposed by the Minister, it is clear that the taxpayer will not fund NAMA.  Banks will ultimately have to do that in the event of there being a loss which is not envisaged at this stage.</P>
        <P>The biggest issue from now is to ensure that banks will lend into the economy when they come into funds as a result of the passage of the NAMA Bill.  It is important that they do not hoard that cash.  They are getting the money at a cheap rate.  Clearly, if they were to put it in the markets they would get a better return on it than what they will pay for it and we must ensure they do not do that.  I am concerned about that area and that there is not effective competition between the banks at present.  We need at least three banks in this State to create the kind of competition that is necessary.</P>
        <P>To an extent, I am concerned that there is a capacity for the gouging by banks of some of their customers.  It is happening already.  They are doing this because they can, because there <Col N="854"/>is no competition.  I have seen a number of examples, particularly where banks are imposing punitive margins on viable businesses.  I am aware of customers with viable business who have attempted to rearrange contracts in order to reduce to some extent their overhead and allow themselves a bit of breathing space as they go through a difficult trading period where they are repaying interest and capital.  In an effort to reorganise their affairs, the banks are attempting to put a multiplier on the margin that exists, of 2%, for example.  In some cases they are attempting to multiply that four times to a margin of 8%.  We must find a mechanism to prevent that because it is wrong.  The banks are taking an approach on viable sectors other than the property and development sector in which they have maxed out.  They got that wrong and are now attempting to recapitalise and reposition themselves by targeting people who are trying to survive through a difficult period.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister may be able to find some mechanism within the NAMA structure that will ensure standards other than the code of practice which is laudable and, if properly policed, beneficial.  There still is an obligation on all of us to find a way to ensure that the banks, which will be in funds shortly with the passage of this Bill, do not try to use their dominant position in a negative way that will force many of these viable businesses into a position where they can no longer trade.</P>
        <P>I commend all the people involved in the development of this Bill for their job of work.  It obviously involves risks but the greatest risk would have been to sit on our hands and ignore the problem.</P>

	<P>Is c&uacute;is &aacute;thais dom seans a bheith agam cur leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar an mBille seo.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this very important Bill.  Any student of history can look back at the political evolution of this nation, or, prior to that, at previous administrations, albeit of a foreign dimension, and see that in every generation, in every century, almost in every decade, there have been bank failures in this country.  Between 1770 and 1800 there were serious bank collapses on this island.</P>
        <P>In 1780, a major application was made to the British House of Commons and the Irish House of Parliament, Grattan&rsquo;s Parliament, to create a new bank.  It is ironic that history has repeated itself.  The people who opposed the idea were some of the merchant princes of our great capital city and a few others who believed there was a threat to their dominant positions in the national and international marketplaces.  At a time when the current financial crisis bedevils our island and there is a need for credit fluidity, it is ironic that Fine Gael on the right, Labour on the left and Sinn F&eacute;in on the far left oppose this important Bill.</P>
        <P>In 1782, three attempts were made to create the Bank of Ireland.  In May of that year, the law was passed and an opportunity for our nation was created.  While there was serious opposition to the Bank of Ireland, its important role in our success has been proven.  On the establishment of the State by Cumann na nGaedhael in 1922, the first group to which it turned for support was the Bank of Ireland.  That support was made available and has helped to create our modern nation.  In 1983, Fine Gael turned to the Bank of Ireland and called in favours.  It is ironic and unfortunate that the Labour Party, which has had a direct relationship with the management of AIB over the years, is opposing the Bill.</P>
        <P>Between 1989 and 1992, I had the privilege of being a Minister of State with responsibility for commerce.  With the Minister for Finance, I had responsibility for banking regulation.  I am not boasting, but I may be the only Member, past or present, who placed an inspector in a bank as a result of information that became available to me as Minister of State.  I took that information to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and we were able to deal with a serious situation.  Afterwards, I was given information pertaining to problems that arose in a <Col N="855"/>particular insurance company during non-Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations.  I put a team of inspectors into the company and dealt with the situation.</P>
        <P>Greater economic and Opposition minds than mine called for a major change in banking regulation.  As a result, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, was established and responsibility for the focused management and inspection of financial structures transferred to it from the Parliament and the Government.  The problems that we have inherited came about because those who were highly paid to do their duty did not keep an eye on the transfer of capital from one institution to another.  The liberalisation of credit facilities has created a serious problem.</P>
        <P>One must be mindful of the changes in Ireland.  In 1987, some 700,000 people were employed and the national debt equated to 131% of GDP.  By 2007, some 2.2 million people were employed and the national debt had decreased to 25% of GDP.  What occurred in those 20 years?  There was a major demand for services, infrastructure and housing, all of which posed everyone a major challenge.  Economics and opportunity took over and labour, product, service and investment costs grew astronomically.  Despite the success of our economy in recent years, the international crisis originating in the US with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and other institutions and problems in Europe, such as Iceland&rsquo;s economic collapse, created an international wobble in the financial markets.  This broke down the trust that was critical to the movement of capital, the opportunity for credit and the capacity for a structured system for the consumers of the EU.  Our nation has had its difficulties, but where would we be if the vision of Fianna F&aacute;il in taking us into Europe and the eurozone had not given us the support critical to carrying us through this crisis?</P>
        <P>The proposals before the House will have a major impact, in that they will ensure that we can move the banks&rsquo; debts to NAMA, borrow the necessary funds, restore credit flows and bring a new confidence to the economy.  Through NAMA, we will manage our way in a larger economy with greater capacity and consumer demand and an ever growing export market.  During the next three to five years, this will allow us to return to a position of economic growth.</P>
        <P>This is not the first time that we have been faced with such a situation.  In 1985, when I was a member of the shadow cabinet, there was a serious crisis with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which was owned by AIB.  On 2 April, the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Alan Dukes, briefed us in the morning about a crisis facing the banking sector and AIB in particular, namely, the impending collapse of the insurance corporation industry.  The report was taken to our shadow cabinet by our then leader and later Taoiseach, the late Charles J. Haughey, go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam uasal d&iacute;lis.  We debated it for approximately 90 minutes and took a decision that, in the interests of Ireland and its financial system, we would support the Bill that would be before the House later that day to save the banking and credit systems.</P>
        <P>By 8.30 p.m., the Bill was before the Seanad, which sat late to pass it.  Before the banks opened the following morning, the President had signed the Bill into law.  This solidarity was a gesture of pragmatic patriotism, commitment to the nation and honour and integrity as Members of Parliament.  It showed that our collective wisdom was best and that we should work in unison to sustain a financial system for our people, a system that was critical to the evolution, trade and commerce of everyone.</P>

The main Opposition party claims that it can set up a new bank with a capital base of &euro;2 billion within six weeks.  How will that deal with liabilities of &euro;100 billion?  Fine Gael <Col N="856"/>believes that it can use &euro;2 billion to borrow &euro;77 billion or &euro;80 billion.  This is illogical, impractical, unfair and disgusting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin where the last speaker finished.  For us to buy into what the Government has suggested would be to buy into the last 12 years, which led us into this morass.</P>
        <P>NAMA has a number of problems.  I have only asked for five minutes because it is important that I place my opposition on the record.  The Government wants to pay over the odds for loans deliberately.  Mr. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prizewinner, has characterised this as criminal.</P>
        <P>He won the Nobel peace prize for being an economist with foresight and understanding of the global economy.  Every indication here is that property prices are continuing to fall.  We are buying property loans totalling &euro;77 billion at what appears to be a discount price of &euro;54 billion.  Is this really the case?  Much of this money was borrowed from somewhere else to make the deposit so the real value is very suspect.  It is acknowledged that the &euro;54 billion is &euro;7 billion more than its real value, according to current valuations.  However, what is the real value and how does one know the real value when there is no market against which it can be measured?</P>
        <P>How is &euro;47 billion considered to be the value?  Is it a value based on the air in this House or the light coming through the window?  In addition, there are indications that values will fall further.  We acknowledge that we will be paying &euro;7 billion over the odds and there is no market against which to measure the notional value.  In fact, this market is falling and expert opinion predicts it will continue to fall.  The Irish taxpayer is being exposed to a significant risk and with no comeback.  I have a key triad of aspirations to which I try to adhere since I entered politics: transparency, accountability and fairness.  Where is the transparency in this proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>What would the Deputy&rsquo;s party do?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will get his answer in a moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>He obviously did not read the proposal.  I do not think he is capable of reading it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not take too long to read it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We will be paying even more over the odds than we realise in a falling market.  There will be an opaque system with regard to who will manage the fund, how it is <Col N="857"/>answerable to the Oireachtas and the opportunities for political interference and favours.  Key to our economy will be to have lending available and NAMA does not guarantee this.  What has been the experience to date?  I see the Minister of State is shaking his head.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>He should stay quiet for goodness sake. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us all stay calm.  I ask the Minister of State to address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s idea certainly would not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister of State speak on the Bill himself?  He should let the House hear his bright ideas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister of State that I am bound to protect the Deputy.  I ask him to be kind enough to co-operate.  I ask Deputy Reilly to address his remarks through the Chair and I will be happy to protect him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always very pleased to have the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s protection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to the task at hand.  The bottom line is there is no assurance that the banks will start lending again.  The experience to date has shown that they hid the &euro;7 billion they were given up their jerseys and it has not been made available to anyone.  If they are given more money they are likely to do the same.  There is no assurance that loans will be available to the people in need, small and medium-size enterprises and ordinary mortgage holders.  </P>
        <P>We understand the difference between senior bond holders and subordinate debt.  It is the subordinate debt that takes the extra risk and attracts the higher interest rate.  They are getting away scot free.  Where is their sacrifice?  I object strenuously to the idea that the reputation of Ireland Inc. will be damaged by taking any action other than this proposal.  Ireland Inc., the Irish citizen, the State, did not borrow this money or lend it recklessly, but rather it was the bankers and developers.  It is not our reputation or my reputation on the line but the reputation of the banks.  The Government should not blackmail us with that threat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>With interest rates at an historic low and bound to rise, there is a further risk of possibly another &euro;10 billion.  I will leave it to Deputy Barrett to explain to the House what the national recovery bank would do, how it would operate and how it would ensure that money flows to businesses, because such explanation will require some time and my time is finished.  Fine Gael will not support NAMA.  We will try as best we can to protect the taxpayer by putting in place various amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage.  Moody&rsquo;s now says that on top of the &euro;4 billion in Anglo Irish Bank and the &euro;7 billion given to AIB and Bank of Ireland, even with NAMA, we will need another &euro;8.5 billion.  The Irish taxpayer is being plundered at a time when we cannot even vaccinate our children against cervical cancer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I love to hear lectures from people on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches about the irresponsible attitude of the Opposition when we do not agree with their proposals, especially when they created the mess in the first place.  Criticism should be based on facts.  People should go to the trouble of reading or understanding the alternatives presented by our party and by the Labour Party.  They should criticise when they know the facts.  I suggest such <Col N="858"/>people should not talk about &euro;2 billion and about setting up a bank in six weeks.  They do not even know that this was a wholesale bank which was designed to make money available to the retail banks but on condition that the money be used for lending purposes to help businesses.  This would allow the existing banks deal with their own problem.  We did not create this problem.</P>

	<P>When I was a child I was warned that gambling was all right provided one gambled with one&rsquo;s own money and that one was given good odds.  There are no odds in favour of the taxpayer in this proposal.  We are in this mess because the banks and the bankers were gambling with borrowed money, contrary to any gambler&rsquo;s instinct.  One never gambles with borrowed money.  Now when things have gone wrong, the taxpayer is expected to pick up the tab.  </P>
        <P>NAMA is a massive gamble and the odds do not stack up.  As my colleague asked, what is the value of property?  A total of 36% of the outstanding debts are in land.  What is the value of a piece of land on the outskirts of some rural village?  What assets are in Anglo Irish Bank?  I will ask the Minister for Finance when he comes to the House.  He is our shareholder.  He should know at this stage the up-to-date situation regarding Anglo Irish Bank and all its debts, including the type of debts and the type of properties.</P>
        <P>Before this House is asked to vote on this proposal he should use Anglo Irish Bank as an example of how this particular proposal will work.  I ask for an explanation.  It is proposed that one State agency will take over debts from another State agency and then pay that State agency back some money of less value than what was being taken over.  Anglo Irish Bank will give over land and property to NAMA and NAMA will give money back to Anglo.  A significant gap will exist.  We are informed that Anglo is bust.  The taxpayer has already paid in approximately &euro;4 billion or &euro;5 billion.  There will be another shortfall of at least &euro;7 billion or &euro;8 billion in Anglo alone.  I ask someone to explain how we will make up this huge gap in Anglo.  We have not been told by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Does he intend to wrap up Anglo or will he endeavour to see Anglo trade itself out and, if so, how will it trade itself out of such a massive debt which has been imposed?  We have already ploughed money into Anglo but the reason for which escapes me &mdash; it is a zombie bank.  We have put billions of euro into Anglo.  We will be taking all this property from Anglo, we will put it into NAMA and then put money back into Anglo, but there will be a massive shortfall.  How is it going to trade itself out?  That is a simple question for the Minister for Finance to explain to the House.  Can he do so?</P>
        <P>Deputies from the other side of the House lecture us about loyalty to the State and suggest that we should march up those steps and support the NAMA proposal.  However, they will walk up those steps blindly and land a generation with a massive debt.  It will not be my generation or that of the Acting Chairman, but that of our children and grandchildren.  They will have a massive debt around their necks, but the Minister and the Government cannot explain to us in simple language how it will work.  It is based on assumptions, including that the value of property has bottomed out, which is not true.  All the leading experts would tell the Minister that it has not bottomed out.  What is the value?  There is talk of handing over &euro;54 billion for loans of &euro;77 billion.  Why has the Government picked &euro;54 billion?  Why not &euro;64 billion or &euro;44 billion?  There is no basis to &euro;54 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an estimate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="859"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>An estimate of billions of euro.  Billions of euro have become simply pieces of paper now.  The attitude is that &euro;1 billion here or there makes no difference according to Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We are still waiting for the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>We have seen the members of the Green Party crawling to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party over the weekend to get a few bob back to keep our schools running.  When the Government introduces a budget next December that will take &euro;4 billion out of the economy, the pain and suffering it will impose on the taxpayer will become apparent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy promised us his proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>At that stage the Members on the Government side of the House will understand the value of &euro;1 billion.  The business of it being only &euro;1 billion here or there and only an estimate is unacceptable.  It is an estimate which involves making commitments to bondholders in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  This is not monopoly money and these are the facts.</P>
        <P>Someone told me we had no other option and that as a State we cannot dishonour bonds that banks took upon themselves.  Since when was this the case?  The bondholders who gave this money knew exactly the risk they were taking.  Any dog in the street could see the likes of Anglo Irish Bank and others were pumping money into property and escalating values that no one could justify.  They took the risk.  Why must the taxpayer now carry the can because these people took such a risk?</P>
        <P>The State will be in debt such that bondholders will not be prepared to touch us, never mind the fact that we were supposed to back up banks&rsquo; debts.  If we get ourselves into such debt we will either pay a very high premium for any moneys that we borrow or we will not get any money in the first place.  The options are far greater for the State than for banks.  I have listened to those who state that we should all march up the stairs blindly and support these proposals, that it is only a few billion euro here and there, that, sure, it will never happen and it is all nonsense.  No one has taken into account the next wave of debt that will occur in banks as a result of defaults on mortgages and commercial loans.</P>
        <P>Anyone who went to the trouble of reading the recent European Commission&rsquo;s report would have noted that the report predicts that in 2010 the EU economy will contract by 0.1%.  There are variations between countries with a decline of 4.7% predicted for Lithuania, a decline of 3.2% for Latvia, 2.6% for Ireland and 1% for Spain.  This is not over yet.  An independent report from the European Commission informs us that the prediction is that in 2010 the economy in Ireland will contract by 2.6%.  However, we hear comments to the effect that it has all bottomed out and it is all the way up from here on.  Those comments do not stand up to the facts.  This is data from an independent report from the European Commission.</P>
        <P>I realise time is short but I also wish to question the figures provided by the Minister in his opening contribution to the debate.  He stated that the funding of &euro;54 billion was borrowing from the ECB and that we would borrow at a very low interest rate of 1% with a 0.5% premium.  However, he assumes the rate of 1% will remain for the next ten years, although all the professional forecasts indicate that long-term rates will rise to 3.8%.  That figure will then be added to the 0.5% premium.  The Minister&rsquo;s calculations are based on the assumption that the 1% interest rate will last for the next ten years, which is not factually correct.  The information that the House has been given is factually incorrect.  The fact is that the long-term forecast is for the ECB rate to rise to 3.8% over a ten year period.  If we add the 0.5% to that, the rate will be 4.3%.  In money terms, in case anyone on the Government side of the House is interested, this amounts to &euro;10 billion over ten years at a minimum.  The attitude is that it is only &euro;10 billion and the Minister is pretending that the 1% rate represents cheap money.  He <Col N="860"/>sent out every Minister of State and backbencher with a script to persuade the public that the Opposition was acting irresponsibly and that it had no ideas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are suggesting the ECB is giving us the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>According to those on the other side of the House the European Central Bank is giving the money and we do not have to pay anything back.  When the Government Deputies wake up, are they capable of asking themselves simple questions?  No one gives money in this world unless they expect it to be paid back.  No one gives long-term guarantees unless they expect that there is a decent risk.  Proper information should be handed to the public so that the public, in turn, can make a genuine assessment as to the risk with which they are being presented.  It will not be those in this Chamber who will pay back this on their own.  We will be calling on the people outside who elected us and who sent us here to look after this situation.  We should give them the real facts.  It is all very well gambling if one is gambling with one&rsquo;s own money, if one can afford it and if the odds are worthwhile.  There is no way anyone, including Deputy Peter Power, who is about to speak, who is a good man and knows about odds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>My simple question is that Anglo Irish Bank will hand over its debts to NAMA and NAMA will hand money back to Anglo, but there is a vast gap because they <Col N="861"/>will not give back what they are taking.  How does the Minister intend to handle the additional debt of Anglo in view of the fact that &euro;4 billion has already been invested?  How does the Minister intend to handle the additional debt and the gap between the assets handed over to NAMA and the money NAMA will hand back to Anglo Irish Bank?  Will the Minister explain in simple language how he intends to handle this situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a considerable discussion on this legislation in recent weeks but, unfortunately, much of the debate has been predictable.  In my experience, once the Government proposes something the Opposition often feels compelled to oppose it.  I know the Opposition has a role to play but we must have a radical change in the way we do our business, both in the House and outside it.  For example, the House will not sit during the week following the bank holiday weekend.  There is no justification for that, however, so I ask the Chief Whip to ensure that the House sits then.  We are not long back since the summer holidays and the public has never been so cynical about politics.  We need to make this House relevant.  We are talking about establishing NAMA where billions are thrown around, but the majority of people may not be too sure how many noughts are in a billion.  It is important for us to make the House relevant to the public and explain clearly what we are doing and why.  </P>
        <P>This country is experiencing the most serious financial downturn in living memory.  In recent days, we have spent most of the time debating expenses, how much Members were paid and if they were entitled to it, whether they overspent and, if so, was it exorbitant.  I left a business career to become a Member of this House.  Nobody forced me to come here, I volunteered and was lucky to be elected.  I feel it is an honour and a privilege to be a Member of this House.  It is essential that Members receive a good salary.  Public representatives should be rewarded appropriately and politics should attract good people to public service.  I have no regrets about coming here and I would like to remain here for a number of years to come.</P>
        <P>Recent events, however, have served to discredit public life and create the impression that politicians are just in it for the money.  It is important to rebut that impression quickly.  This day last year, the Minister for Finance introduced his budget, including a measure to reduce Ministers&rsquo; salaries.  He must go further in the next budget.  In view of the serious financial situation in which we find ourselves, there is no justification for the moneys that are currently paid to members of the Cabinet.  We should show real leadership in that regard.  We have asked the public to make major sacrifices so far and in the December budget we will be inflicting more pain on them.</P>
        <P>Unless we give a lead and show the public that we are not asking them to do something we are not prepared to do ourselves, we will not get out of our current difficulties.  Membership of this House is only given to a few.  We all have a role to play in giving our people hope and confidence.  We must explain clearly to unemployed men and women what we will do to put them back to work.  We must also explain to families who are finding it difficult to put food on the table and pay a mortgage how we will assist them and improve their lot.  I detect anger and a distinct lack of hope among the public.</P>
        <P>Only a few years ago, we were living in a country where everything appeared to be running smoothly and employment was there for everyone who wanted a job.  Ireland was considered an example of a most successful country, but we now find ourselves in serious financial difficulty.  There is no point in blaming international events alone for our troubles because we contributed in many ways to the problems we are experiencing.  It is vital to be honest with the public, admit we made mistakes and clearly outline the measures we intend to take to ensure that we recover.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the National Asset Management Agency is an important step in that recovery.  It represents a major step in this country&rsquo;s move towards recovery.  When the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, outlined the measure there were those who portrayed it as bailing <Col N="862"/>out banks and developers.  The share price was used as an example because it increased within 24 hours, but those who monitor bank shares can see that the price has not changed much.  A number of developers have disagreed vehemently with the proposal.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the Bill will pass Second Stage, but I appeal to the Minister and the Opposition to be as constructive as possible on Committee Stage.  This is the most important measure we will pass.  This side of the House does not have a monopoly on wisdom, so it is important for the Opposition to play its part.  I appeal to the Minister to be open in considering Opposition amendments.  It is in our interests to get it right not just for this generation, but also for the next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I would like to thank Deputies for their many considered and useful contributions on Second Stage.  I look forward to a constructive and informed discussion on Committee Stage.  In the meantime, I will respond as much as possible in the time available to the points raised by Deputies.  I agree with Deputy Se&aacute;n Power that, in considering the Bill on Committee Stage, we must all pool our ideas about how this proposal can be improved.</P>
        <P>Before moving on to address some of the specific points made about the Bill, I want to deal with some of the more general issues raised on the National Asset Management Agency and the banking system.  We are all agreed that one of the key factors for our economic recovery is a healthy banking system to serve the needs of the wider economy.  In the absence of a properly functioning banking system, economic recovery will not happen.</P>
        <P>As I have outlined in the past, the Government has taken decisive steps to support the banking system.  The overall objective of the Government has been to facilitate the flow of credit to business and to ensure that Ireland is best placed to take advantage of the global economic recovery when it occurs.  We have also ensured that the interests of the taxpayer are protected to the maximum possible extent.</P>
        <P>The agency builds on the progress made by Government to date and will ensure that we have a banking system that can support economic recovery.  The establishment of NAMA removes the riskiest assets from banks&rsquo; balance sheets, which frees them to restore the flow of credit to the real economy.  Deputy Barrett asked me about the impact of NAMA on Anglo Irish Bank.  The impact is to remove risk assets from its balance sheets and to reduce the bank&rsquo;s loan book quite dramatically.  This, in turn, has an implication for the minimum capital ratio the bank will have to hold, which will be much less than its current ratio.  Obviously, we will have to work on those figures in consultation with whatever directive the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator makes regarding capital ratios.  The establishment of NAMA is the most cost-effective option from the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective to ensure a properly functioning banking sector.</P>
        <P>While the requirement for a NAMA business plan will not arise until the legislation is in place and a board has been appointed, questions were raised on Second Stage about the nature of the operation which NAMA will carry out.  I consider it important that there should be as much clarity as possible on how it is intended to operate, on its organisational structures and on the extent of its impact.  Such clarity will inform our debate as the Bill progresses through its various Stages.  Therefore, I instructed the interim managing director to draw up a draft business plan setting out how NAMA will carry out its functions and duties.  This draft business plan has now been submitted to me and I have arranged for copies to be circulated to all Deputies this evening.  I must emphasise that a more detailed business plan will be prepared by the NAMA board once the legislation is in place.  This is work in progress but I think it is worth circulating to Members of the House at this stage of the debate.</P><Col N="863"/>
        <P>I want to commend the interim managing director and his small team for the extensive preparatory work done so far, as outlined in this plan.  The plan anticipates that a NAMA core team of 30 will be required on establishment to manage the immediate loan valuation and transfer process, and this will rise to a core staff of about 75.  It is essential that NAMA moves quickly to establish itself and has the resources immediately available to it to value and transfer the largest loan exposures.  I have, therefore, written to the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency today asking him to ensure that the necessary staff resources are made available to the interim managing director of NAMA, in accordance with the projections in the draft plan.</P>
        <P>The draft business plan outlines the scope of NAMA as set out in my opening Second Stage speech.  It is envisaged that NAMA will pay approximately &euro;54 billion for loans with a book value of &euro;77 billion, implying an estimate aggregate discount of 30%.  Furthermore, the plan confirms that the estimated recovery in asset prices required for NAMA to break even, taking subordinated debt into account, is 10% over ten years.  This is achievable.</P>
        <P>Tables in the draft plan provide further breakdowns of the agency&rsquo;s loan portfolio, geography and cash flow projections.  A separate part of the plan outlines how NAMA proposes to value and transfer loans in tranches up to the middle of next year.  I have taken the unusual step of releasing this plan in draft form as a confirmation of my intention to ensure to the maximum extent possible transparency and accountability in the way NAMA operates.  Another part of the draft plan outlines the extent of the accountability and reporting requirements that will apply to NAMA.</P>
        <P>While I have moved early to make this information available, I emphasise that the details on loan books provided in the draft plan are estimates in aggregate form and are based on an assessment of provisional figures provided by the institutions themselves.  They will, therefore, be sensitive to assumptions made by institutions regarding those assets that will be designated as eligible and that are liable to be adjusted further as the detailed analysis and due diligence is carried out by NAMA upon the enactment of this Bill.  While legislation can be broad in its application, I will have a further opportunity to clarify implementation or limitation conditions through guidelines, should this be necessary, to ensure consistency of application and administrative efficiency in the loan acquisition and management process.</P>
        <P>The asset management approach has a proven track record internationally.  The establishment of NAMA has been supported by institutions such as the IMF and the ECB as well as by the financial markets.  Goldman Sachs welcomed the agency as just the latest in a &ldquo;series of impressive steps by the Irish Government&rdquo; to deal with our problems.  As recently as last Friday, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Joaqu&iacute;n Almunia, said he wanted to see the D&aacute;il pass the legislation establishing the National Asset Management Agency as fast as possible.  This clearly qualifies as strong support for the Government&rsquo;s approach from the European authorities.</P>
        <P>I refer to issues raised in the debate.  Some Members have continued to argue the case for nationalisation and I have dealt with this repeatedly over the past few months.  Total nationalisation is not the panacea that its supporters claim it to be.  Apart from the fact that it does not address issues surrounding risky portfolios of assets on the banks&rsquo; balance sheets, it has the rather obvious downside of requiring the State to compensate shareholders before putting additional capital into the banks to resolve their capital deficiencies arising out of these impaired assets.</P>
        <P>A policy of total nationalisation could impact negatively on financial institutions&rsquo; own funding, with wholesale money markets becoming less prepared to lend to an Irish banking sector that has been nationalised.  It could impact also on the sovereign&rsquo;s funding since nationalising the entire banking system could result in Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign credit rating being downgraded.  This would result in increased debt service costs on the national debt, which the country can <Col N="864"/>ill afford when it has many other pressing calls on its scarce resources.  In the context of the global funding crisis, these are risks no Government cannot afford to take.  However, the Government is not, in principle, opposed to nationalisation where it is the best solution.  This was acknowledged by Deputy Ruairi Quinn in a thoughtful contribution that he represented as not being too far from his party&rsquo;s position, which he clarified as not necessarily being in favour of blanket nationalisation but rather supporting public ownership in the region of<?oasys _jy ?>70%, with the banks remaining quoted on the stock market.</P>
        <P>This brings me to another claim that has been made, most notably by Deputy Enda Kenny, which is that the Government is unwilling to facilitate consultation or debate on the subject of NAMA.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I first announced our intention to establish an agency on 7 April.  At that time, I made it clear I was very keen to engage in a proper debate over NAMA in order that the Government could deal with the issues involved as comprehensively as possible.  Since then I have engaged in debate on the matter both with the media and, in particular, with Members.  I have appeared on two occasions before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and engaged with members of the committee in a comprehensive discussion on both occasions.</P>
        <P>A draft version of the NAMA Bill was published on 30 July, which was almost seven weeks before the formal publication of the Bill in order that Members could engage in a fully informed debate and make considered contributions.  I will continue to listen to constructive comments and suggestions until the enactment of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Another misplaced claim made during the debate is the legislation represents a bailout for developers.  This is just not so.  Let us be clear.  NAMA is not designed to be, and will not be permitted to operate, in practice as a bailout mechanism for developers who have operated irresponsibly.  The amount a borrower owes will not change because of the transfer of a loan from his bank to NAMA.  The agency will have a statutory duty to maximise the taxpayer&rsquo;s return and will, therefore, be expected to use its entire means to this end.  The Bill also provides the agency with the wide range of powers it needs to pursue borrowers and enforce security.  In some cases, this will mean borrowers&rsquo; personal assets will have to be assumed by NAMA and, in such circumstances, I cannot understand how the misconception that the agency will bail out developers continues to run other than pure political mischief making.</P>

	<P>Those, like Deputy Burton, who persist in misrepresenting the Bill in this way will have a heavy burden to bear in the verdict of history because we have serious decisions to take not only as a Government, but as a Parliament and a people, and misleading the people about legislation does not assist us in this task.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Several Deputies have complained that the valuation is too generous or that there are insufficient safeguards to ensure the banks have to bear an appropriate share of the risks involved but this is not the case.  The valuation methodology used to estimate the price paid for the loans must accord with EU guidance.  Each loan will be valued in accordance with this methodology, which takes into account both market conditions and long-term economic returns.  Long-term economic returns in the valuation process are necessary to achieve the goal of stabilising the financial system and to ensure that it is in a position to support economic recovery.  This objective could not be achieved if the banks were forced to accept fire sale prices.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton commented that the ECB recommends paying the current market value for assets.  On the contrary, the bank recommended that we avoid paying too great a premium over the market value, which is quite a different matter.  Furthermore, as I stated in my opening contribution, the Governor of the Central Bank and his predecessor have confirmed that the proposed allowance for long-term economic value is not unreasonable or disproportionate.  The cash flow produced by NAMA will be sufficient to cover interest payments on the NAMA bonds and operating assets.  Details of this are set out in the document I circulated.</P>
        <P>Several Members made reference to the increase in the share prices of the two main banks since 16 September as proof that we overpaid for the loans.  This is not necessarily the case, as on the day in question share prices for financial institutions around the globe generally increased.  It was also the case that the increase in share values was an expression of confidence in the Government&rsquo;s ability to take the decisive action necessary to deliver a restructured and cleansed banking system that can support economic recovery.  The share prices have reduced since.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies correctly highlighted the importance of the availability of credit to the wider economy.  This is the crucial issue relating to the legislation and I will take into account every improvement to the Bill and the operation of NAMA that can facilitate the extension of credit during the remainder of the debate.</P>
        <P>Mortgage lending is supported by a statutory code of conduct, which has been in effect since February.  We secured the agreement of the two recapitalised banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, not to initiate legal proceedings for repossession within 12 months of arrears appearing.  This will be complemented by new measures in the revised programme for Government to protect families experiencing difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I reject the scaremongering in which Deputy Gilmore engaged this morning in the House.  He said &ldquo;it was well known&rdquo; that the banks were waiting for the Bill to pass before moving in a serious way on homeowners in trouble. Well known by whom?  What is the evidence for this?   Has Deputy Gilmore been briefed on this?  Has he concrete information to put on the table or is this scaremongering?  At a time of economic recession, sending out a signal to homeowners who have difficulties making their repayments that a massive pounce is being planned on them in the banking system on the enactment of the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister not refer to the minutes of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not envisaged and it will not happen.  Deputy Gilmore must produce evidence.  All the evidence relating to the behaviour of the banks when it comes to repossession points to the contrary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing in the NAMA legislation will result in more repossessions of family homes.  A robust, statutory-based code of conduct is in place to deal with mortgage repossessions, which I introduced.  The revised programme for Government, as the Taoiseach stated during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, commits us to enhance protections for mortgage holders who have a genuine problem.  It ill becomes any Deputy to engage in such scaremongering for political purposes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment.  I am sure he will do a great job.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment Deputy James Reilly on his initiative.  The Minister&rsquo;s response is also welcome.  Her acceptance in principle of the Bill makes sense.  Many people would be surprised to learn that there is no legal requirement for a practising medical practitioner to have insurance.</P>
        <P>This statutory measure will protect patients and doctors.  I hope it will also open up the route towards the regulation of private clinics, which currently are not regulated.  The growth in cosmetic surgery was a feature of the Celtic tiger years and private clinics have provided services with doctors flying in from Britain, carrying out procedures and then flying out again.  Whether the private clinic delivers cosmetic surgery or IVF there is an obvious need to set standards and ensure their robust enforcement.</P>
        <P>It is not, however, the private clinic that is causing controversy at the moment.  It is the public health service and how it is managed.  The public is outraged at the latest news of the lavish &euro;70,000 bonus sanctioned for the CEO of the Health Service Executive.  The Minister for Health and Children has simply washed her hands of the issue but it will not go away.  Let us look at the facts.  Since he took up the post of CEO, Professors Drumm has received &euro;180,000 in bonuses.  This year alone his total salary package is worth more than &euro;500,000, a staggering figure.  While the HSE sanctions this reward to its CEO, it is setting about making cutbacks of &euro;1.2 billion in the coming year.</P>
        <P>The argument being put is that this bonus relates to 2007 and therefore is a contractual obligation, but the question still has to be asked: for what exactly is the bonus being given?  We are told by the chairman of the HSE board that there is a process of evaluation in determining the level of bonus.  It would be helpful to know the criteria used in that process.  Are they related to patient outcomes, improved patient care, higher standards, quality assurance or speed of access?  If they are, and they should be, let us look at the record.  Susie Long died in 2007.  She was a young woman with cancer and she died because the HSE did not provide her with the care she needed in time.  Women were misdiagnosed at Portlaoise hospital in 2007.  Again, <Col N="871"/>the HSE failed to protect and care for very sick women.  In the year in question, 2007, the HSE was not even capable of keeping within its budget.  A supplementary estimate of &euro;244 million was drawn up because of a failure of management that drew criticism from the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen.  He said he was not satisfied that the HSE was giving sufficient priority to tackling the causes of its budgetary difficulties.  For the failure to manage the accounts in 2007 a reward of &euro;70,000 is now being given to the CEO responsible.  Is it any wonder the public is offended?  It appears to be all about responsibility.  The proposals in this Bill will ensure doctors cannot walk away from responsibility when something goes wrong.  All of us understand that doctors are not infallible.  Allowance must be made for the unforeseen, the unplanned or the human error, quite apart from the negligent.</P>
        <P>Patients deserve protection from medical negligence but also from political incompetence.  When the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, proceeded in her bull-headed fashion, to establish the HSE without giving it the time needed to ensure proper management structures, I warned her in this House that she would create a monster bureaucracy.  The rush to get the HSE up and running by a politically-driven deadline of 1 January 2005 gave us a cobbled together structure with weak foundations constructed by the Minister, from which she then walked away.  It has been tottering ever since.  Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine just how bad the situation could get.</P>
        <P>Currently, three years after the Minister declared a state of national emergency, the accident and emergency crisis continues.  According to INO figures there are almost 300 patients on trolleys around the country.  Perhaps those patients should have recourse to making an insurance claim for the distress caused.  There were 9,000 cancelled operations in the first half of this year, a 27% increase on last year.  Perhaps those patients should be able to claim.  This year there has been a 70% increase in delayed discharges.  What about them?  It is the powerlessness of patients that is so worrying and to provide patient power would require a fundamental transformation of the health service.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a simple measure to amend and extend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  It should not be necessary for an Opposition Deputy to introduce this legislation yet it was the Fine Gael party that published the legislation.  That is to Fine Gael&rsquo;s credit but it also raises questions about the role of the Department of Health and Children.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, specifically transferred responsibility for financial management by making the HSE the Accounting Officer.  Since then, the role of the Department has been always uncertain.  It was to deal with policy while the HSE was to deal with implementation.  It has not worked out quite like that.  Surely a Department with such a reduced area of responsibility should be capable of delivering legislation to meet current needs.  Insurance cover for medical practitioners is one such area that seems very obvious.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that the Medical Council will have the power to set the appropriate type and level of insurance to be held by different classes of practitioners.  Today, the Medical Council has no such authority and, while it does require that doctors must have adequate cover, there is no system to check that doctors have cover and that it is adequate.</P>
        <P>The Medical Practitioners (Professional Indemnity) (Amendment) Bill 2009 has the support of the Labour Party, as made clear by the spokesperson, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  I have no doubt it will bring reassurance to both patients and doctors.  We must ensure that, with mobility developing across the EU, standards for medical care applied in this country are on a par with standards in other countries.  We do not have that, whether in respect of indemnity, the provision of hospital beds or the provision of services at primary care level.  We could debate many issues relating to health care tonight.  This is a modest Bill that deals with a specific area of <Col N="872"/>medical indemnity to ensure doctors have the insurance cover to protect their patients.  I welcome this measure and look forward to the Minister pursuing this Bill to bring it into law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Barry Andrews, Dooley, Conlon and Byrne.  </P>
        <P>I am pleased to speak on this legislation, which is important from the point of view of general practitioners and the public.  I commend Deputy Reilly on introducing this Bill.  On occasion we criticise the Opposition during Private Members&rsquo; time but it is only fair to give credit where it is due.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Cregan never does that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not, as Deputy Naughten knows.  Due to his profession, Deputy Reilly is <i>au fait</i> with what is required.</P>
        <P>The main provisions of the Bill are that medical indemnity cover is to be compulsory for all medical practitioners specified by the Medical Council as requiring such cover; the Medical Council will make the rules specifying the categories of practitioners required to hold medical indemnity cover, the form and level of such indemnity cover including the minimum sum of medical indemnity cover for each class of practitioner, and the bodies recognised by the council for the purpose of providing such cover;  written evidence of appropriate indemnity cover is to be a requirement for the Medical Council to issue a registration certificate, which is the main thrust of the Bill; and it is to be an offence to practice without medical indemnity cover or to falsely represent having medical indemnity cover with penalties for summary convictions or convictions on indictment.  We have had cases where members of the profession from other countries have practised here and they were not always insured to do so.  This is highly dangerous.</P>
        <P>In recent years we have moved to a far more efficient system for providing for indemnity of professionals in our public health services.  Under the clinical indemnity scheme, the State has assumed responsibility for the indemnification and management of clinical negligence claims arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients.  The clinical indemnity scheme was established because commercial insurers either withdrew from offering insurance cover to obstetricians, gynaecologists and those in obstetric units who were not in a position to provide cover at affordable rates.  This was due to the escalation in the size of court awards and associated costs in case of birth related cerebral injuries.</P>
        <P>The scheme was established in July 2002 and is managed by the State Claims Agency.  One of the main advantages of the scheme is that it has rationalised the myriad of medical indemnity arrangements which had applied up to that point.  Under the clinical indemnity scheme each hospital or HSE area assumes legal liability for its employees&rsquo; alleged clinical negligence.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established in January 2007 to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure the safety and quality of care for patients is paramount throughout the entire health care system.  Its report, Building a Culture of Patient Safety, was published in 2008 and approved by the Government in January.  The report contains 134 recommendations including proposals for legislation; licensing of all public and private health care providers; developing standards on patient safety and quality that will apply across the entire service; and the introduction of systems of credentialing and privileging for health care professionals.</P>
        <P>Measures taken by the Minister and the Department to restore public confidence in the health service include the establishment and continued strengthening of HIQA and the Office <Col N="873"/>of the Chief Inspector of Social Services, the assignment of executive responsibility for all matters relating to patient safety to the Office of the Chief Medical Officer and the commencement on 1 March of the provisions of the Health Act 2007 on protected disclosures.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s position on the Bill.  It recognises that some of the issues in the draft Bill may be worthy of further consideration and I believe they are.  However, a number of matters require further research and reflection and these include, but are not limited to, the competence of the Medical Council to determine what is an appropriate minimum sum of indemnity coverage for each class of practitioner and EU issues regarding freedom of mobility.  These will need to be considered and will require further investigation and legal advice.  The Minister has given a commitment to put in place a review group and to report back by January.  I welcome that commitment.  The Minister is taking the right approach and I commend Deputy Reilly on bringing the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the discussion on the Bill tabled by Deputy Reilly which deals with the need to ensure that all doctors are properly indemnified and have appropriate medical negligence cover so that patients can be compensated in the event of unsatisfactory treatment.</P>
        <P>This is an area in which I have some interest having been a barrister, a profession which has professional indemnity insurance and where compensation is provided for negligence.  In my case, amazingly, it did not have to be called upon at any time but it provides a certain assurance to clients who use these professional services and develops the profession in many ways.  The type of cases that are thrown up tends to inform professional standards and professional development.  It serves the purposes of compensating those who have been wronged and brings along the profession, and is something that would be appropriate to other professions.</P>
        <P>My area of responsibility as Minister of State with responsibility for children involves me with the work of social workers.  The work they do is extremely complex.  They deal with some of the most at risk and vulnerable children and children who have been failed by many other professional services, whether it be schools, family support or agencies of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Some of them come to social workers damaged and very difficult to reach.  For that reason the work that social workers do is extremely complex,  yet it attracts a deal of criticism from people who should know better but who are probably not very well informed in these areas.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, like every profession there is bad practice but unlike other professions there is not sufficient examination of that bad practice.  In medical negligence that practice is examined in forensic detail in court hearings and allows for learning within the profession.  Might it not be appropriate to have more examination of those types of cases in social work?  It strikes me that the reason this has never happened is that the clients and their families who avail of social work services are generally not well off and probably not aware of their rights or the type of compensation to which they normally might be entitled in the event of professional negligence.  Negligence is not widespread in social work, or no more so than in any other profession, but it would benefit from the same type of forensic analysis that takes place in the medical negligence cases with which we are all familiar.</P>
        <P>It is very clear from the debate to date that all Deputies share the view that we must do everything possible to avoid negligent care in the first instance.  Patients have a right to a high standard of care and to patient safety, which is a priority for the Government.  I will concentrate on measures which the Government has initiated on patient safety and quality assurance.  There have been several developments in patient safety in recent years which reflect the Government&rsquo;s determination to deliver in this area.  Two of the most significant are the establishment <Col N="874"/>of HIQA in 2007 and the work of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance which was also established in 2007.</P>
        <P>HIQA has statutory responsibility for setting standards on safety and quality of services throughout the entire public health service with the exception of mental health services, which are the responsibility of the Mental Health Commission.  HIQA also has responsibility for undertaking investigations as to the safety, quality and standards of services where it believes there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving services.  I want to take this opportunity to thank HIQA for the enormous contribution it has made to the development of child protection services in the State, particularly in the children&rsquo;s detention schools and in the area of youth justice.  The standards it has set and the work it has done with the HSE is phenomenal and it has made a huge contribution to the implementation plan that followed the Ryan report.</P>
        <P>HIQA has developed standards on care in symptomatic breast disease, hygiene, infection prevention and control and residential care for older people.  It completed the hygiene service quality review of acute hospitals in 2007 and 2008 and it has also undertaken three major investigations, the result of which has been clear significant recommendations to improve the safety and quality of our health service.  These are at an advanced stage of implementation.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the patient safety and quality environment which our public service delivers has seen a marked improvement in the past two years in particular.  It is interesting to note that two weeks ago the European Health Consumer Index saw the Irish health service rising a further two places from last year and a total of almost 15 places over the past four years to 13th position among European health services.  This gives us ample room for improvement but also cause to remark that the HSE has made a contribution to improvement in those standards.  It is important that we challenge the often undisputed received wisdom that the HSE has made no difference since its establishment.  I fundamentally reject that argument.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, is the one development acknowledged by the European Consumer Health Index, as having contributed to the improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s position in the past four years.  Due acknowledgement should be afforded to the HSE because it is an issue of morale for the thousands work in it who are routinely and systematically vilified in the media and this House.</P>
    
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The work of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance is also significant.  It was established in 2007 to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that the safety and quality of care for patients is paramount across the health care system.  The commission&rsquo;s report, Building a Culture of Patient Safety, was approved by the Government last January and is being implemented.  The report contained 134 wide-ranging recommendations, including proposals for legislation and licensing of all public and private health care providers, the development of standards on patient safety and quality that will apply across the service, a comprehensive national programme of clinical audit, mandatory reporting of adverse events and the introduction of a system of credentialing and privileging of health care professionals.</P>

        <P>On the licensing of all public and private health care providers, the commission recommended that it should begin with acute hospitals and other health facilities based on an analysis of potential risk to patient safety.  It specifically stated the first phase of licensing should include facilities where medical treatment is given under anaesthesia or sedation and obstetric services, a welcome recommendation.  Following the introduction of this framework in these areas, the commission&rsquo;s view was that the licensing system should be subsequently rolled out to other <Col N="875"/>facilities, such as primary, community and continuing care, following comprehensive consultation with all the relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>We cannot underestimate the complexities involved in this major task.  Preparatory work has already commenced in the Department and it is intended to bring detailed proposals to the Government next year.  In the meantime, in advance of the introduction of legislation for licensing and in line with the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is working towards the development of national standards on safety and quality to be applied to hospitals and all future licensed health care facilities with priority in areas where a high and immediate risk to the health and welfare of patients is identified.</P>
        <P>HIQA has developed a model for quality and safety based on research and analysis of international and national literature on safety, quality and standard development.  The process of wide consultation with stakeholders, including patient, service-users and patient advocates, clinicians, and service providers both in public and private health care, has commenced.</P>
        <P>Credentialing is a process whereby health care organisations will be enabled to review the qualifications and track record of doctors and other professionals.  Privileging is used by health care providers to define the scope of practice of health care practitioners.  It is an important area with the development of private medicine.  The intention behind the commission&rsquo;s proposals on these is to develop systems which will enable employers and regulatory bodies to share and verify information regarding the qualifications, competencies and disciplinary records of regulated health professionals operating in the public and private sector.  These systems will enable employers to make informed decisions as to the appropriate range of treatments and services to be provided by each regulated professional, thereby enhancing patient safety and promoting the quality of care.</P>
        <P>While the full implementation of these proposals will take some time, it is intended to prioritise work and information already in the public arena which could be more efficiently organised and shared without the need for significant changes.  It is fully intended these systems will work across borders both within the EU and internationally.</P>
        <P>I welcome the agreement by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, particularly in light of the complexities and sensitivities of medical indemnity insurance, to give the issues raised in the Bill detailed reflection from a legal, administrative and practical perspective.  In particular, the issue of the further consideration of how best to provide for mandatory professional indemnity cover for medical practitioners will receive careful attention.  Many issues arise which must be carefully thought out to ensure solutions are practical, proportionate and workable.  Most important, the solution to this complex issue must have at its heart the protection of the public and the promotion of public safety.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Reilly for introducing this necessary Bill.  I respect the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s leadership in not taking a partisan stance on this issue.  I also welcome the establishment of a group to examine the issues raised, with a view to returning to the matter by the end of January 2010.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children proposes the Bill be re-examined fully.  Its stated purpose is &ldquo;to regulate doctors so that they must have appropriate insurance in order to practice medicine in Ireland&rdquo;.  This needs to be done to update legislation so it moves and adapts with the changing nature of medical law.  The public needs to have confidence in the medical services.  The relationship between a patient and their general practitioner is personal and intimate.  It is important patients treated in an improper manner are fully compensated.</P><Col N="876"/>
        <P>The State, under the clinical indemnity scheme, takes responsibility for the indemnification and management of clinical negligence claims arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients.  The scheme was established because commercial insurers were not interested in continuing with many medical practitioners or were not in a position to provide cover at affordable rates due to ever growing court costs and high awards.</P>
        <P>The State Claims Agency, established in July 2002, manages the clinical indemnity scheme.  It was imperative that it would rationalise the many and varied indemnity arrangements which applied up until then.  The scheme allows legal liability for various health centre&rsquo;s employees&rsquo; alleged clinical negligence.</P>
        <P>While this Bill is needed, we need to analyse further its implications from legal, administrative and other angles.  As the indemnity scheme is not an insurance-based scheme, it would, therefore, fall outside the current drafting of this initial Bill.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s desire to re-examine this Bill in its entirety so as to ensure further add-on amendments are not needed to cover provisions that may have been missed.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that safety and quality of care for patients existed across the health care system.  The commission&rsquo;s report, Building a Culture of Patient Safety, was published in August 2008 and approved by the Government in January 2009.  It contained 134 wide-ranging recommendations.  The implementation steering group, chaired by the Department&rsquo;s chief medical officer, was established in June this year.  The group&rsquo;s initial report is due presently and I look forward to its publication.</P>
        <P>HIQA is already well advanced on the development of national standards of patient care.  We need the highest levels of quality and safety across all health care sectors.  Patients and their families demand and deserve nothing less.  HIQA has developed a model for quality and safety based on research and analysis of international and national literature on safety, quality and standard development.  There has been wide consultation with stakeholders which is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for Health and Children and her Department as she aims to restore the confidence of the public in the health services.  This is being achieved through the establishment and continued strengthening of HIQA and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services.  The significant developments in patient safety including quality and risk, complaints management, incident reporting and learning in the HSE, particularly in the past two years, are also acknowledged as is similar work in the regulatory bodies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important we continue to create a culture of openness in the health system.  A patient&rsquo;s dignity must always be respected.  Many are often vulnerable and must believe they are protected from malpractice.  Members on this side of the House recognise several issues raised in the draft Bill need further analysis.  This will allow the space, time and expertise to deliver more fully fledged legislation.  I acknowledge Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s efforts in introducing this Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this significant Bill and to recognise the considerable work that Deputy Reilly has done in putting it together.  It will no doubt lead to legislation.  Like my colleagues I am happy to recognise his input, professionalism and experience.  He is well positioned to do this type of work.  It shows that while we often cross swords in this House we have the capacity to share the wisdom of all in an effort to provide a better outcome for our citizens.  I hope that this will be respected on another day.</P><Col N="877"/>
        <P>It is vitally important that the appropriate mechanism is put in place to give security to those who work on behalf of the citizens and allow them to do their job without fearing the threat of negligence or of a risk that might evolve later.  We need to change the method of communication between patient and doctor, something on which I am not qualified to speak except as a rare patient.  The patient&rsquo;s belief that the doctor is infallible and there is no risk creates a barrier.  The patient sees a visit to the doctor as a mechanical situation like bringing one&rsquo;s car to the garage where a part is taken out and a new one slotted in and everything is solved.</P>
        <P>With advances in medical science the expectation of the medical practitioner becomes greater.  We must accept that there are limitations to medical practice and that there is a risk inherent in almost all visits to hospitals or when one undergoes an operation or any other clinical procedure.  That needs to be communicated and the patient needs to be more cognisant of it.  We must recognise, as a consultant once said to me, that medicine is more an art than a science, and that we cannot always expect a 100% successful outcome.  There is work to be done from the layman&rsquo;s perspective which hopefully would help to bring about a culture of more openness and transparency.  Clinical professionals have not been good at that.</P>
        <P>Several celebrated cases from my constituency have been discussed in this House particularly two cases of misdiagnosis in Ennis General Hospital, of young Edel Kelly and Ann Moriarty.  I do not mention them to cause any distress to the families concerned but to highlight the point that there should have been more openness and transparency and communication with the patient rather than a desire by some of the professionals at all levels to conceal, perhaps because of the potential for medical negligence claims, fear that not having done what they should have done would result in a negative peer review, or not wanting to admit blame.  One doctor pursued a woman who was at an advanced stage of her illness to plant in her mind and the minds of her family the belief that everything that could have been done was done.  That kind of culture has to change because we must all accept that mistakes can be made and ensure that when they happen they are dealt with and addressed in a professional and upfront way.</P>
        <P>The Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA, has a role in developing standards.  The greatest work remains to change a culture of secrecy based on the notion that the professionals are in some way infallible which they cannot be and perhaps never wanted to be.  We need to move that thinking along.  If this Bill and the final legislation achieve anything to change the communication strategy and to develop a culture of openness and transparency and the acceptance of reality it will have gone a long way to resolving the issue from the points of view of the patient and his or her family.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the passage of this Bill in some shape or form.</P>

        <P>I am somewhat surprised that professional indemnity insurance is not mandatory.  One assumes when one goes to a doctor that he or she has professional indemnity cover.  When the Bill goes to Committee Stage I would like the committee to consider the ups and downs and pros and cons of the solicitors&rsquo; professional indemnity system because it seems to be causing some difficulties.  I believe that some solicitors are calling for the removal of the compulsion to carry insurance.  I suppose this is for reasons of cost and because of the way insurance has gone and voluntary schemes have operated.  That is not a runner and will not happen.  It is essential that every professional is appropriately insured.</P>
        <P>While scandals and crises arise in hospitals caused by one doctor or because the system has caused wrongdoing, such as the examples Deputy Dooley cited and some in my constituency, <Col N="878"/>it is important to remember that mistakes will happen to the best doctors and professionals.  That is why insurance exists.  I have noticed an unjustifiable level of outrage in certain isolated cases of negligence.  We and the public must accept that professionals will never get absolutely everything right and mistakes will be made.  That is why they have insurance and I am glad that this Bill is being put forward to force doctors to carry insurance.</P>
        <P>It is an important aspect of practice to give people confidence that if anything goes wrong one is insured.  In my experience as a solicitor it was very important that one posted one&rsquo;s insurance certificate on the wall in the practice, outlining the level of insurance available, to give clients confidence.  If one&rsquo;s insurance was not high enough one could tell one&rsquo;s clients that one could not do a transaction.  Maybe some of the problems being discussed in other professions would not have arisen if the terms and conditions of insurance had been adhered to and clients been made aware of it.</P>
        <P>I am slightly concerned that the Bill leaves a lot to the Medical Council although we do that anyway.  It is crucial that the council always has the interest of the patients and the doctors at heart.  This is in a doctor&rsquo;s interest too.  There has been controversy about doctors who fly in to carry out certain procedures, particularly plastic surgery.  More comprehensive regulation may be required.</P>
        <P>This is a welcome Bill.  It is very short and sensible and I am sure the Select Committee on Health and Children will debate it quickly and it will be made law.  For most doctors it will presumably make no difference whatsoever but it is necessary to ensure that 100% of the public can have confidence in doctors.</P>
        <P>It is a good that the Government is accepting the Bill because there has been some legitimate criticism of the Government&rsquo;s failure to accept certain Bills on which it had agreed.  There is at the same time a duty on the Opposition not to misrepresent Government legislation as happened recently, particularly with the NAMA Bill and there was another example of that today.  It works both ways and I am glad to see the Government accepting this Bill.</P>

	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Reilly, for bringing forward this Bill and having the Government accept it.  It is a great honour to have one&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill accepted in the House.  I hope that Deputy Reilly is more successful than I have been when a Bill was accepted on Second Stage but the Government blocked it on Committee Stage.  I hope this Bill will go through Committee Stage and be enacted into law.  A period of reflection is being considered, as proposed by the Minister for Health and Children, but I hope this will not delay the passage of very valuable legislation.</P>
        <P>I wanted to speak on the Bill because of a comment I heard on the radio last Sunday week.  In a news report, the Government indicated it would give unlimited indemnity to the manufacturers of the swine flu vaccine to ensure the companies involved would not be held liable for any possible adverse effects arising from the administration of the vaccine.  What stuck in my craw about that media report was the comment attributed to the State Claims Agency, which stated the move for indemnity was essential to ensure it can pay out compensation to anyone who deserves it and to protect the taxpayer from fraudulent compensation claims.  The reason I was so annoyed by that comment is that the State Claims Agency, along with various agents of Government, including the HSE, the Medicines Board and others, has <Col N="879"/>been sitting on a committee since 2007, looking into the provision of a no-fault compensation scheme in respect of the administration of State-run vaccines over the past 30 to 40 years.  This committee sat at the end of a very long process initiated five years previously by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, because Ireland was the only country in Europe that did not have a compensation scheme in place for people damaged by vaccines administered on behalf of the State.  We are seven years further down the road since that Minister promised to look into this issue.  I became involved because I know a number of the families around the country who have profoundly brain-damaged children.  They firmly believe their children were damaged as a result of the State-administered vaccination programme in the 1960s and early 1970s.</P>
        <P>I have debated this matter at length in this House.  The State has admitted that in at least some of those cases, particularly with reference to 16, it offered a &pound;10,000 <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the children involved in 1982 and 1984.  That sum was supposed to deal with the long-term needs of those children.  It is vitally important that the State should admit, for the first time, that children have been damaged as a result of the administration of a vaccine.  The reason the State Claims Agency is involved in the provision of liability indemnity in respect of the current vaccination programme is that there is a risk.  It may be a very small risk but it exists nonetheless and that fact has never been acknowledged in this State.  It is the only state in Europe that has never acknowledged it.</P>
        <P>One speaker after another has said, rightly, that we need honest and frank admission by medical professionals with regard to mistakes they make.  In many cases such issues would not have ended up in the courts costing the State astronomical sums of money if there had been a basic admission in this regard at the start.  That has never happened on the part of the State concerning the issue of children who were damaged by the State-run vaccination programmes.</P>
        <P>The committee in question took oral submissions on 19 November 2007 and I gave oral evidence at that stage.  The one thing I asked for was a quick decision on the matter.  The parents wanted that because this has been going on for 30 years.  I was given an indication by the group that it would make a quick decision and would make recommendations to the Minister on the matter.  However, in December 2008 the Minister for Health and Children was still waiting for that report.  She said she would have it very shortly and received it earlier this year.  She indicated it was her intention to publish the report when she had deliberated on it.  She informed the House of that on 19 May, yet by 16 September she was still considering the report and had made no decision.  She said she would make a decision on it shortly.</P>
        <P>It is frustrating.  A week beforehand, in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which Deputy Reilly is a member, officials within the HSE and the Department said they were to introduce a compensation scheme for children who had received a toxic batch of whooping cough vaccine 40 years ago.  That was the first acknowledgement from anybody on the State side with regard to that issue.  It is greatly frustrating that there has been a cloak and dagger approach to the admission of a wrong that happened to these children over a long period.  The frustrating thing for many people on the receiving end of problems with the medical profession is that there is no admission and nobody is honest and up-front in stating that a mistake was made and they are very sorry about it.  The families whose children were damaged by the State vaccination programmes were told consistently and repeatedly by medical professionals up and down the country that the matter was all in their imagination, the child had been born with a profound disability and the vaccine had absolutely nothing to do with it.  The administering general practitioners had kept grossly inadequate records and, as a result, those parents were not able to go down the road of taking a case against the manufacturers of <Col N="880"/>the vaccine.  The only exception was the case of Kenneth Best whose mother succeeded in gaining compensation.</P>
        <P>Even at this late stage I urge the Minister for Health and Children to publish the report and publicly acknowledge that it is possible and, in all probability, likely that some of these children were damaged by the administration of the vaccine, that the State was grossly negligent in not ensuring full records were maintained either by the State or the GPs and that we must establish for once and for all a no-fault compensation scheme regarding vaccination programmes in this country.  We are the only country in Europe that has not put a scheme in place.  The State Claims Agency made its comments last Sunday week, using the argument that similar indemnity is provided in every other member state in the EU, including the United Kingdom.  However, every other member state, including the UK, has a compensation scheme in place because people are damaged by vaccines administered by the State.</P>

	<P>That is factual and has yet to be acknowledged by this State which is still living in the dark ages regarding this point.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill concerning private clinics and private hospitals.  I remember the case of the Barringtons Hospital misdiagnosis.  Many women from the west were involved in that incident.  I was amazed that HIQA and the State agencies could not get involved or carry out an investigation into it because the hospital was private.  Complaints cannot be made through the organs of the State to have such issues investigated in private clinics.  I hope this will form part of the Bill and that we will have legislation that will put protections in place for patients and bring about a complete culture change in this country regarding the admission of liability.  I hope people will at least stand up and be honest with patients once and for all.</P>

	<P>I highly commend my colleague, Deputy James Reilly, on introducing this Bill.  I hope that due consideration will be given to what is a complex area.</P>
        <P>Since it does not often occur, it is no harm to mention that an Opposition spokesperson like Deputy Reilly can bring his great expertise in the medical profession to the floor of the House.  This procedure is good for Parliament and I hope that, when the Bill has been put together, we will have fine legislation.</P>
        <P>This is an important Bill because many people would be surprised that insurance cover for medical practitioners was not mandatory.  I must admit that I did not know it.  From my research today, I understand that most doctors are covered.  However, it is not an inexpensive business, with an ordinary practising doctor&rsquo;s premium amounting to &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 per year or a part thereof.  I am surprised that the Department of Health and Children does not know how many <Col N="881"/>doctors are not insured, but there is no register.  This is difficult to understand, but I am told that as many as 40 or 50 people are not insured or have inadequate insurance.  Some may be based outside the country yet working in Ireland, although I am not just referring to that cohort as such.</P>
        <P>When people digest this debate, there will be an element of worry.  I can only speak as a lay man, but doctors are rightly held in high esteem in society.  In polls taken over the years, this esteem does not seem to have diminished and I know why.  When one is a sick patient, one is in the doctor&rsquo;s hands.  Given that the majority of people with whom I have had contact down the years, although thankfully not on a personal basis, have reason to be grateful to doctors, it is a fine profession.</P>
        <P>Like every other profession, however, there are always problems.  Everyone finds it difficult to say &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; and that they have made a mistake.  It is a personal failure among many of us, but it is certainly a failure in medicine.  Through the years, I have found this to be the case where obvious mistakes had been made.  Mistakes will always be made, but I will discuss that later during the few minutes at my disposal.</P>
        <P>Many families have told me that they knew whether their loved ones had been wronged by hospital procedures.  The problem is proving it in a court of law.  The Minister of State will know as well as any other Deputy that once an issue enters the realm of law, one can certainly take it that the issue will not be patient-centred.  Everyone else seems to make more out of it than the patient.  This is a significant problem and I hope that something like this Bill will eventually overcome the culture of secrecy.  I do not know why that culture has remained, but I suppose it is because ordinary people can be bamboozled by medical jargon.  This is understandable.  It is against this background that this Bill and related Bills &mdash; the Bill before us cannot solve all problems &mdash; will overcome that situation.  Many people would be less afraid to take on the medical profession, hospital authorities and so on to get their rights.</P>
        <P>Now that I know not all doctors might be insured, I have noticed something else.  In a car accident involving a driver who, like many people, is not insured, it is bad news for the injured party, but at least there is another stage, in that a case can be brought before the motor bureau for compensation.  While this takes many years, it provides some safety.  There is no safety in respect of the medical profession.  For this reason, a practical provision needs to be introduced and, as such, Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s thoughts will find favour across the country.</P>
        <P>I cannot claim to be a professional, but another matter must be considered in this Bill or the eventual legislation.  A practising doctor may be duly covered by insurance now, but we all know that, if certain procedures go wrong, problems might not manifest until several years later.  There would be no trouble in legally and medically pinpointing which procedure caused a long-term illness.  Would it not be the patient&rsquo;s hard luck if the doctor, who had been covered at the time, was no longer covered because he or she had retired or had not bought cover for subsequent years?  The jargon in this respect is run-off insurance.  This matter is important and I can well imagine the difficulties with an insurance company indemnifying people after a long period.  As the Minister of State knows well, the case of a car accident is different.  Whatever the injuries, they are caused on that day and any subsequent illness will come about as a direct result.  Not so with inappropriate medical procedures, the effects of which might not arise until years afterwards.  Have I much time remaining?</P>

	<P>On that note, prior to undergoing a surgical procedure many years ago, I passed a flippant remark to a receptionist to the effect that I hoped that the surgeon in question collected all of the tools afterwards.  The reply was, &ldquo;You have heard about that&rdquo;.  This was not very reassuring.  For better or worse I came through the procedure safely.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy James Reilly, for bringing this Bill before the House.  It is progressive legislation which should have been here earlier for a series of reasons.  We must ensure the general public can rely on the full scale of medical procedures available and that they can rely entirely on the fact they are covered in the event of something going wrong.  If something goes wrong compensation is little consolation to the unfortunate patient, particularly if he or she is left with a disability for life.  We must strive for the best possible practices and the highest possible standards.  A situation whereby anyone would be allowed to provide a medical procedure without the necessary insurance cover should be incredible.</P>
        <P>I refer to two types of insurance cover, one for the individual carrying out the procedure and the other for the institution concerned, which in this case are the private institutions.  Other speakers have referred to situations where patients have found to their cost that there was no cover and therefore no compensation and no recognition of their plight in the aftermath of a procedure.  It is incredible that this situation should occur in the current climate under both national and EU law.  The highest standards must prevail at all times and those standards are applicable across the European Union, whether in the public or private sector, to ensure the maximum protection for the patient and the general public.</P>
        <P>Deputy Denis Naughten made an interesting intervention regarding various procedures and vaccinations.  He made a distinction between pharmaceutical companies, practitioners and the State.  Where the State advises a particular procedure and if as a result of the procedure being followed the outcome is not in accordance with the plan, in my view the State is liable and we should not walk away from that responsibility.  I held this view with regard to hepatitis C many years ago in this House.  I believe I was correct at that time and subsequent events have proved me correct.</P>
        <P>There are new and ongoing procedures about which a patient may know very little and may be swayed by the views expressed by the person carrying out the procedure.  This may well be for the benefit of the person carrying out the procedure.  The State has a duty in those circumstances to make it quite clear to any patient the risks involved in any procedure.</P>
        <P>With regard to those providing the indemnity, many of us know of instances where the insurers will maintain that the small print of a policy will stipulate that a person was not covered <Col N="883"/>under a certain set of circumstances.  I have a cynical view of such practices.  Like many Members I am familiar with many cases where individuals believed they were covered for a particular procedure and that they had indemnity in the event of something going wrong but the insurers countered by saying the small print contained the information.  This is unacceptable.  We must endeavour that the customer, the patient and the public are protected in those circumstances.  We should not tolerate the old-fashioned attitude with regard to reading the small print.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to deviate too far from the main argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">We have all met mothers whose children have been given the three-in-one vaccination, now called the five-in-one vaccination.  They have at times expressed concern about the effects of the procedure.  I do not know if there were negative effects because I am not an expert in that area.  However, there are worrying factors which have not been clearly and conclusively proven one way or the other.  A parent of a child being inoculated will be questioned about family medical history.  The parent may not know the history of the extended family members, for instance, whether a relative has had emphysema.  It could be that it is unadvisable for that child to be inoculated but this can happen.  Parents will say their child was well until he or she was inoculated but this is not always as a result of the parent&rsquo;s desire for compensation because compensation does not address the outcome or the tragedy.  I am not completely convinced that we have confronted that situation and that adequate information is made available to parents as to which vaccination should be taken, the three-in-one, two-in-one or five-in-one.  Two children from the same family can have varying reactions to the same procedure and this is a cause for worry.  Deputy Reilly and I soldiered together on a health board a long time ago and the argument arose on many occasions that in general, in the interests of wider public health, it was preferable to take the procedure because it prevented the spread of disease or a pandemic.  I was dubious then and I am still dubious about that argument.  This is an issue that needs to be examined over time and which Deputy Reilly will consider in the compilation of this Bill.</P>

        <P>We need to explain the risks to the patient.  The area of dentistry needs to be considered in this regard, particularly as dental patients are being treated in other European countries.  This is not a reflection on the type and quality of the procedures but it is necessary that the highest possible standards apply at all times and that a clear indication is given to the potential patient about the situation in the event of a procedure going wrong and that financial help will be available in some form.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to recognise the contribution of Deputy James Reilly and to acknowledge the importance of the proposed legislation.</P>
        <P>It is unusual that such important proposed legislation attracts so little attention from the public as demonstrated by the empty Public Gallery.  Deputy Paul Connaughton made the point that the public would believe that all medical practitioners are covered by insurance.  This <Col N="884"/>brings the matter into sharp focus and the proposed legislation before the House is timely.  It strikes me as strange that it has not come before the House before now.  I was pleased to hear the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, reflect last night on the proposal made by Deputy Reilly.  She agreed to remain in close contact and introduce legislation sometime in the new year, which I welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s Bill makes several proposals which the Minister for Health and Children and the Government consider merit serious consideration and analysis.  I am pleased that the proposal has not been long-fingered.  There is a specific timeframe involved, leading to early in the new year.  I am pleased that the debate has focused on the protection of patients in their dealings with the medical profession, something upon which all Members agree.</P>
        <P>In her contribution last night the Minister emphasised the importance of a health system characterised by trust, patient involvement, responsiveness, fair processes and continual learning.  I acknowledge these are the hallmarks of and the background to Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s proposal.  We have made great strides towards achieving a system characterised by such principles and the developments which have been implemented to date support that assertion.</P>
        <P>Much has been said of the role of the Medical Council, the significant changes to its functions and the procedures arising from the implementation of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  The new role is characterised by open procedures, accountability, patient involvement and, most important, producing a system which will require doctors to maintain their skills and competencies on an ongoing basis.  This point shows the importance of the proposed legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Connaughton asked if the Department had a full database of those who were insured and those who were not.  I acknowledge that I did not know and I had to check with officials.  The presumption was correct and there is no such register.  This underlines the importance of what is before us.  We can presume that legislation will come before us and will succeed in going through the House.  Medical practitioners will ensure that they will continue to upgrade their skills.  Hopefully, the day will come when insurance will become mandatory.  The new role is characterised by open procedures as I pointed out previously.</P>
        <P>Many interesting points have been made by Deputy Reilly and his colleagues on both sides of the House regarding the issues arising from the debate.  The Government is supportive of the principles of Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s Bill.  However, it is keen to ensure that the method we use to introduce more defined requirements for medical practitioners will be practical and workable.</P>
        <P>There is a requirement on doctors to have adequate professional indemnity for the work they perform and the need for this has been mentioned by many Deputies.  There are circumstances in which doctors have reneged on this ethical requirement and it is the patient who is left with no definitive avenue or means of redress.</P>
        <P>I refer to the main points of the debate.  Several Deputies expressed concern with the lack of regulation of private clinics.  I look forward to the legislation that will come before the House eventually to address this area.  There is no point repeating everything that has been said.  I recognise the contribution of Deputy Reilly in bringing forward this debate.  I am amazed someone did not think of this long before now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I with to share time with Deputy Reilly.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Medical Practitioners Bill.  It is very important and timely legislation that will ensure the protection of patients.  It is important to ensure doctors have appropriate insurance to cover all aspects of their very important work.  There is no implication that doctors do not <Col N="885"/>have insurance.  I could not put a percentage on it &mdash; I am certain Deputy Reilly would agree &mdash; but I suspect more than 90% of doctors have insurance.  As the Minister stated, the Department does not know how many doctors have insurance or not.  The Bill makes insurance compulsory for all doctors.</P>
        <P>I refer to the registration of medical people, including the areas of counselling and psychotherapy.  There is no registration of counsellors and psychotherapists.  There is growing interest in the issues related to counselling and psychotherapy and their regulation in Ireland.  The roles of counsellor and psychotherapist are now recognised as being part of best practice in dealing with the health and social care needs of our population.  We have regularly discussed multidisciplinary, community-based psychiatric services, which should include the availability of counsellors and psychotherapists as part of the team dealing with psychiatric illness in the community and in hospitals.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that the public is protected by promoting high standards of conduct.  Education, training and competence in the professions of counselling and psychotherapy are crucial.  Protection is currently offered through self-regulation.  The relevant bodies drew up the public protection report and made a submission related to the statutory regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists in Ireland.  It was commissioned by the Government and reported in 2008.  Some 12 of these bodies provide codes of ethics and practice by which their members must abide.  Each organisation also provides standards which a person must attain before he or she is accredited as a counsellor or psychotherapist.  While this form of self-regulation provides protection to clients of those organisations, it falls far short of optimal protection because under our common law system it is possible for any person to take the title of &ldquo;counsellor&rdquo; or &ldquo;psychotherapist&rdquo; and practice accordingly without the required teaching and competence.  The current anomaly does not lend itself to good clinical governance and maintenance or the improvement of standards of patient care.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt> <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 creates a mechanism to drive forward the clinical governance agenda.  It creates a framework through which practitioners are accountable for continually improving the quality of their service.  It safeguards high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence will flourish and optimal protection is offered.  Regularly, I raise with the Minister the matter of having counsellors and psychotherapists included under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act.  In other medical professions there is a requirement for a basic qualification in medicine and professionals then continue to specialise.  The absence of clear roles and dedicated procedures for those roles creates confusion in the absence of regulation.  It also creates a situation in which many calling themselves counsellors in the community and in private practice do not warrant professional recognition.  One does not need a recognised qualification or skill base to call oneself a psychotherapist or a counsellor.  All that is required is a premises, a gold plaque outside the door and a neck to charge the fee.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>At present, there are no means to regulate the situation.  The opportunity for untrained people to act as psychotherapists and counsellors and the opportunity for such people to do damage is frightening.  I welcome the report in response to this, although it is now more than 12 months old.  The report contains the submissions of the psychological therapist forum and outlines a programme of qualification, training and evaluation of skills before practitioners would be admitted under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act.</P>
     
        <P>Vulnerable people in crisis who need professional help can be severely damaged.  This situation has been exploited by some practising alternative medicine and some people have been duped out of life savings.  There is an urgency by which a regulatory process is introduced <Col N="886"/>in the area of administration of all areas of therapeutic intervention.  There is ignorance and not a little confusion among the public as to what is entailed by psychotherapy and counselling and the difference between them.  This is compounded by the fact that, according to United States estimates, there are over 400 different named therapies which are used to tackle many medical and social problems, including marriage and family difficulties, anxiety, depression, addiction, sexual abuse, rape, psychosexual difficulties, eating disorders, bereavement, adolescent difficulties, Aids, HIV and many more.  There is a range of people operating in these areas, but they must be supervised and regulated to ensure best practice so that people entering them have the necessary training.  I have come across people who had bad experiences with so-called counsellors who were not professional and only had a few weeks&rsquo; training.  This was totally inadequate but they set themselves up as counsellors.  People have had bad experiences following treatment from such individuals.</P>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Many issues have been raised and I wish to comment on them because they are important.  Deputy Neville&rsquo;s statement on psychotherapy and counselling in particular is something I have been concerned about since my time on the health board with Deputy Durkan.  As a GP, one refers people to a physiotherapist or another fellow professional who has a base qualification.  In the area of counselling, unfortunately, without the required regulation, patients end up going to people who may have done six weekend courses and consider themselves qualified.  This is highly dangerous and detrimental to patients.  The matter needs to be addressed, but not tonight.  </P>
        <P>Similarly, Deputy Dooley&rsquo;s concerns were well expressed.  As I have said before, we need a patient safety authority that can act as an advocate for patients.  HIQA admits that it cannot do this.  The idea of a patient safety authority would allow for a discussion of problems without recourse to law.  It would be a safe place for patients to go who feel aggrieved where their issues could be addressed.  Their advocate could address the medical profession or the hospital concerns, allowing for an honest conversation to take place.  According to insurance companies, at the end of the day most patients want an acknowledgement that wrong was done, an apology for the harm caused to them and an assurance that things will change so it will not happen to another patient.  In most cases they do not want to go to law, but when they have no other option, frustration will lead them to the courts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Naughten raised a point on which I have commented previously.  Childhood vaccination is safe, but nothing is 100% safe.  When parents vaccinate they are making a decision to protect their children.  However, if they decide not to vaccinate that is not sitting on the fence &mdash; it is a decision not to protect one&rsquo;s child.  Parents should bear that in mind.  Some children are at risk and need to be identified.  In addition, vaccination can cause adverse effects; it is well known and the statistics are there.  It is not due to any fault of the doctor who administers the vaccination, the patient who receives it or the manufacturer who made it.  It is simply a fact of life that  people have different immune systems and some may get bad reactions.  We need a no fault compensation fund to catch those people, compensate them and look after those who have suffered as a consequence.  They should not have to go to law and mortgage their homes in order to get justice for their child or other loved ones.  In this respect, I am interested in New Zealand&rsquo;s no fault compensation fund, which is working quite well.</P>
        <P>I wish to thank everyone who took part in the debate on this Bill today and yesterday.  Their contributions have been informative and useful, and will be considered on Committee Stage when any necessary amendments will be made.  It is important to reassure all interested groups, such as the Medical Council, the IMO, the IHCA, insurers, indemnifiers and other groups with <Col N="887"/>concerns in this area, that there will be time for them to have an input during this three-month moratorium.  Their concerns can be considered on Committee Stage and any necessary amendments made.  In getting this Bill to the floor of the House, I fully acknowledge that it is by no means perfect.  However, the thrust and principle of the Bill is to protect patients from uninsured rogue doctors, or doctors who through negligence or otherwise inadvertently let their insurance lapse.  There will be resource issues for the Medical Council in getting the necessary expertise to carry out that function, but it is important and worthwhile doing.  We will find our way around this because where there is a will there is a way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to Deputy Connaughton&rsquo;s comments, I am told by experts in insurance and indemnity that there could be 30 to 40 doctors in this country who do not have the necessary insurance.  This is a tiny number out of the thousands of doctors who are responsible and have insurance.  Our citizens and our health service depends on them.  I do not think doctors have anything to fear from this proposal.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, this is of no consequence for most doctors because they have insurance.  This Bill is aimed at the rogues who let their colleagues down, and for people who come from abroad and do not have appropriate insurance.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to close off the loophole which allows doctors to register here with the Medical Council without having insurance.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the ethical behaviour guide expects that doctors will be insured.  It advises that they should be insured, but this Bill will make it a legal obligation punishable at law if it is not observed, which is not the case at present.</P>
        <P>I wish to thank the Minister for not opposing the Bill.  I construe this as an acknowledgment that all sides of the House seek to improve the protection of patients in the area of medical litigation.  In this regard, I also want to thank Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and the Labour Party and the Sinn F&eacute;in Party for their support.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>We are at a crisis in this situation.  The banks have got a guarantee of being bailed out by the Irish taxpayer, but they are not doing enough to bail out businesses, farmers and home owners.  I have heard farmers complaining that they do not have enough money to feed cattle, but the banks do not even answer their phone calls.  Sometimes cheques to the value of &euro;50 are being returned, while the banks are charging up to &euro;15 for dealing with a bounced cheque.  That is happening to tens of thousands of people around the country, but the banks are not showing enough flexibility to secure jobs.  I have given the banks a hard time over the years, as well as in more recent times.  The banks have been bailed out by the taxpayer, so the Government should ensure that they give support to small and medium enterprises, the farming community and home owners.  These are very difficult times, but we will get out of this <Col N="888"/>recession by keeping jobs.  It begins and ends with jobs, but not enough is being done because we are in denial.</P>
        <P>The elephant in the room concerns the six banks which have been guaranteed by the taxpayer.  Three of those banks, including Anglo Irish Bank, are getting in huge deposits because they are giving priority rates, but they are not lending one cent to any business or farmer around the country.  I would like to highlight other banks not covered by the Government guarantee scheme, which are also offering rates.  I do not mind what is happening but people who deposit money in these banks may not get it back because they are taking money out of the economy.  As a country, we have protected banks.  Individuals and companies, including major insurance companies, should put their deposits in the three main banks because that is the only way to get money back into the system, although I acknowledge they will also be recapitalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Feighan for sharing time and I commend him on the work he has done and the commitment he made to highlight the necessity of funding for small businesses.  Small businesses in my area are under pressure from both sides.  They cannot access money from the banks while, at the same time, they are being put under pressure by their suppliers because of the difficult times they are experiencing.  Deputy Feighan has continually raised the cheque clearance issue.  It is taking longer for cheques to clear nowadays and I know of business people whose cheques have bounced even though they had lodged money in their accounts.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>I met a shopkeeper recently who two years ago applied to the bank for money to upgrade his business and, thus, generate employment.  He asked for &euro;50,000 and he was offered &euro;300,000.  He was cautious at the time as he wanted to establish whether his figures would hold up and he did not take money.  Last week he went back to the bank seeking &euro;50,000 because the figures he presented two years ago had held up but his application was refused.  That is also not good enough.  Whatever has to be done to free up money for such individuals must be done.  We regularly hear reports of companies closing with job losses of between 200 and 500 and so on but we never hear about the loss of one or two jobs in businesses.  The individual to whom I refer would have created two new jobs if he had secured his loan of &euro;50,000 because he hoped to provide a new service in his shop.</P>
        <P>I was also approached by a farmer who applied to the bank for funds to restock his farm.  He had been granted larger loans in the past and he could not keep the money back from the bank but it would not give him the money to restock the farm.  I commend Deputy Feighan.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies Feighan and O&rsquo;Mahony for raising the issue.</P>
        <P>The covered institutions financial support scheme, which guarantees the liabilities of the covered institutions, was put in place in September 2008 to maintain the stability of the financial system in Ireland.  Without it the covered institutions would not have been in a position to lend to the real economy.  However, the scheme did not impose any lending requirements on covered institutions.  Both Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland have made explicit commitments on lending in the context of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February this year.  The banks reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, the additional capacity will be available to SMEs.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to <Col N="889"/>actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.</P>
        <P>Building on the banks&rsquo; commitment to the indigenous venture capital sector, both banks have further committed in excess of &euro;15 million each to new or existing seed capital funds in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s seed and venture capital programme to further create and develop indigenous enterprise.  The banks&rsquo; funding will be matched as appropriate by funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s programme and-or by funding from other national or international investors.  The supplementary documentation on the National Asset Management Agency issued in September gives details of SME lending by AIB and Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Prompt payment is important to underpin cashflow, particularly for small businesses.  The recapitalised banks have committed to prompt payment arrangements in future customer contracts, which will involve payment within 30 days and a late payment interest charge on any payments made after 30 days.  The Financial Regulator has been monitoring compliance with the above commitments and no issues have arisen requiring attention.  The Government has introduced arrangements to reduce the payment period by Departments to business from 30 to 15 days.</P>
        <P>In addition, my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has set up a clearing group, including representatives from the main banks, business interests and state agencies, which is chaired by her Department.  The purpose of the group is to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  Businesses have been invited to send details of such credit refusals to a dedicated e-mail contact point at the Department.  Although the group cannot act as an appeal mechanism for individual cases of credit refusal, it is charged with seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to any patterns identified.  Information provided by businesses will inform and assist this work.</P>
        <P>There was some controversy about the perception of credit availability in the economy.  The Government, therefore, investigated the issue through a comprehensive independent review of SME lending from both the demand and supply perspective.  This was undertaken in the context of the recapitalisation and was published in July.  The review showed that demand had fallen sharply, with the value of new applications for credit down by 42%.  Stock of credit remained static, indicating that new credits matched repayments.  I understand that in a normal year between 15% and 20% of outstanding credit might be repaid and, therefore, significant lending must take place, even to keep the figure constant.  The review, conducted by Mazars, found that refusal rates vary markedly by sector from 6% to 48%, according to the SMEs surveyed.  This finding clearly contradicts the allegation of a blanket refusal to lend.  Mazars also examined a sample of files where credit was refused and found that, in general, &ldquo;refusal seemed reasonable in the context of normal commercial and business criteria&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A follow-up review covering the period to September is under way.  The institutions covered by the guarantee are monitored by the Financial Regulator on a regular basis and monthly figures for SME lending indicate that substantial flows of credit are taking place, even though activity is down on previous years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.  I commend the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on its contribution to the debate on this subject and for its advance over the past days.  I am drawing from information received at the 13th annual conference of the Irish Association of Suicidology held on 1 October, the theme of which was, <Col N="890"/>Surviving Recession: Promoting Mental Health and Preventing Suicide.  The Minister of State was very kind to attend and officially open the conference and to launch guidelines.</P>
        <P>Research going back to the 1890s demonstrates suicide and mental illness increase at times of recession.  The World Health Organisation, WHO, stated earlier this year: &ldquo;It should not come as a surprise that we continue to see more stresses, suicides and mental disorders.&rdquo;  The director of the WHO also stated: &ldquo;There is clear evidence that suicide is linked to financial disasters.  I am not talking about the millionaire jumping out of the window but about poor people.&rdquo;  The potential psychological impact of economic recession on public health is severe.  Job loss, job insecurity, job uncertainty, economic strain, loss of income, home repossession and restricted access to credit lead to a reduction in mental well-being, an increase in mental health problems and mental ill-health, increased substance misuse, especially alcohol and drugs, and intimate relationship breakdown and divorce.  There is a loss of perceived social worth.  There is a loss of purpose and daily structure, reduced social contacts and an increase in social isolation.  An increased risk of suicidal behaviour occurs, both non-fatal self-harm and completed suicides.</P>
        <P>People who are unemployed are two to three times more likely to die of suicide than those in employment.  This high rate is partly because people with psychiatric illness are at a greater risk of losing their jobs.  There is an association between unemployment and suicide.  However, even among people with no record of serious mental illness, unemployment is associated with a 70% greater suicide risk.  Prospective individual level studies show that unemployment has a causal influence on depression and suicidal thinking.</P>
        <P>Job insecurity is associated with a 33% greater risk of common mental disorders, mainly anxiety and depression.  People with mental disorder are more likely to be in debt than those who have no mental disorder.  A United States research document indicates that a loss of income rather than low income was associated with suicidal ideation.  In Hong Kong, 24% of all suicides in 2004 concerned people in debt.</P>
        <P>Alcohol consumption rises during recessions, and this correlates with suicide.  The figure for the 1990s in this country was a 44% increase in alcohol consumption and a 41% increase in suicide.</P>
        <P>Analysis of suicide rates in Latvia during a period of massive economic and social change showed that the sudden decline in GDP was associated with a rapid increase in suicide.  In Russia, mortality, especially suicide, increased substantially after the economic crisis in 1989.</P>
        <P>I put it to the Minister that in times of recession there is a need for the State to respond to this problem.  A little over &euro;3 million has been given to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I put it to the Minister of State that a modest &euro;10 million to meet this crisis is not too much to ask.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not want to respond by way of the prepared reply.  I acknowledge the major contribution of Deputy Dan Neville to this area.  I attended the conference in Limerick to which the Deputy referred and I saw at first hand the huge amount of respect shown to him for his involvement.  I want to say that again publicly, and will continue to say it.</P>
        <P>Rather than just read out the reply it is important to tell the House that at long last a director has been appointed to drive forward reform on mental health.  I am pleased to tell the House that the person concerned is Martin Rogan.  I wish him well.  Since coming into this Department I have always believed that a director should be in place.  It is also important to say that we cannot hang everything on the director&rsquo;s shoulders in terms of driving the reform programme.  All of the issues raised by Deputy Neville are relevant also.</P><Col N="891"/>
        <P>The next process is for the director to sit down with the 14 regional clinical directors throughout the State and drive forward the commitments and the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  It has been made clear to me in the Department in recent months that people are not satisfied with the pace of reform, and I want to recognise that also.</P>
        <P>The next part of the process must be to put together the capital programme to deliver what is contained in A Vision for Change.  It is also important to be proactive, and in January I will be coming forward with a national programme on the issue of stigma.  I had intended doing that in December.</P>
        <P>I will not give a full account tonight but I am pleased to tell the House that I took up many of the points raised by Deputy Neville when I chaired the health committee, which did a review of the high incidence of suicide levels, the subject of this Adjournment matter.</P>
        <P>I accept the point that when we compare the investment in the reduction of suicide levels, and this point has been made by Deputy Neville and many others, to the funding allocated to the road traffic area, for instance, it is obvious that the level of funding is not the same.  I have put a proposal before Government for the forthcoming budget on the issue of trying to determine how we can best use the funding of &euro;4.5 million that is currently available; an additional &euro;1 million was dedicated.  It is also important to tell the House that on Monday last I was in Trinity College dealing with young people who brought forward their proposals on being more aware of their mental health and mental well-being.  I intend involving all of the local radio stations and local print media in a direct localised campaign to deal with the issue of stigma.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the points raised by Deputy Neville.  There is no doubt that the recession is putting greater stress on individuals, families and communities.  I meet individuals and representative groups every day, and many people have expressed particular concerns and fears about the impact the recession is having on their lives.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue and to confirm that at the conference organised by Deputy Neville&rsquo;s group, the professor from the United Kingdom who was the first speaker and whose name I forget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;went on to show specific and clear evidence of the effect of a downturn in the economy, not just in this country but throughout the world.  The figures were obvious.  Unemployment and high stress levels unfortunately lead to serious mental health issues.</P>
        <P>We are here to discuss the impact a recession and unemployment may have on suicide rates.  I will not contradict anything that has been said.  Our financial difficulties do not in any way dilute the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the area of mental health reform.  Deputies will be aware of the greatly increased funding base for mental health services that has been built up over recent years.  Overall spending on mental health services in 2007 and 2008 amounted to an estimated &euro;1 billion annually.  I do not intend simply to go through figures in the House because that can be more annoying than anything else but I want to be able to show in the coming two to three months that regarding the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering the mental health reform programme, A Vision for Change, I intend doing a public appraisal some time in January.</P>
        <P>By way of acknowledging what has been done I will be writing to all the people who had an input into A Vision for Change to ask them to make me aware of the barriers they have encountered in delivering the reform programme.  I look forward to giving more information on that in more detail in a future debate.</P>

      <sTitle>Bee Mortality Rate.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the serious increase in bee mortality rates in this country and across the European Union, given the role bees play in the pollination of commercial crops, and the findings the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and his Department have presented to the European Food Safety Authority on the current survey of member states on this issue.</P>
        <P>We know there are many complex challenges facing the country and the global economy but the important fact of bee pollination of our crops must rate as one of the greatest.  There is climate change but there is also the serious problem which is becoming evident from a decline in the world bee population.</P>
        <P>Research into this issue, otherwise known as colony collapse disorder, has shown staggering declines in bee populations.  In North America, one third of the bee population is said to be lost.  In France it is somewhere between 10% and 25%.  Japan and South America have seen dramatic falls, and in the Middle East there is said to be a fall of somewhere between 20% and 80%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have kept bees for many years in County Carlow, underneath the Blackstairs Mountains.  My own bee colonies died from varroa, which affects their immune system.  It is a horrible disease and one hates to see that happening but if what is happening with small bee keepers is replicated across the world and the devastating impact this could have on our crops, it deserves a serious response from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the European Food Safety Authority has commissioned a survey of member states on bee population levels and what might be causing their decline.  I am aware An Taisce has said that among the important factors which can help sustain our bee populations are the avoidance of pesticides, the protection of our hedgerows, increasing our biodiversity and creating buffer zones between hedges and woodlands.  We must realise that the way we treat our environment is linked to the way we treat our society, and in turn our economy.  The country must protect its natural environment.  I want to know what analysis the Department has done on this environmental problem and the measures it is adopting to protect the 100 or so species of bees in this country, almost 30% of which are apparently under threat.</P>
        <P>This is an economic issue.  The role bees play in the pollination of commercial crops is worth &euro;85 million a year to the economy.  A third of the Western world&rsquo;s diet requires the pollination of plants by bees, particularly fruit and vegetables.  We must protect these colonies.</P>
        <P>This problem is another reminder of the threat of climate change.  The declining migration of bees because of climate change is a grim reminder of what global warming is doing to our biodiversity.  Our world without bees would be a devastating place to live.  Albert Einstein once said that if the bee disappeared from the surface of the Earth, man would have only four years of life left.  We may have more than four years but we must address the issue now for the future of mankind.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gCeann Comhairle as an ceist seo a ligint anocht.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta Mary White as an ceist t&aacute;bhactach a ord&uacute; chomh maith.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department offers support to bee keepers through a number of initiatives.  We administer the national apiculture research programme 2007-10, which provides some &euro;267,000 in funding over the three years.  The European Union co-funds &euro;245,000 of this amount and the main <Col N="893"/>element in the current Irish programme is a research project led by Professor John Breen and Dr. Mary Coffey at the University of Limerick.  The current programme aims to develop integrated methods to control varroa mites in Ireland, to which Deputy White referred.  The Department also works closely with the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations, FIBKA, on many issues of relevance to Irish beekeepers.</P>
        <P>The main cause of significant bee losses across Europe at present is colony collapse disorder, which has been mentioned.  This phenomenon has been responsible for the loss of large numbers of colonies in America since late 2003.  I have read research indicating that if the current rates of loss in the USA are not turned around, there will be no honey bees there by 2035, which would be devastating not just for American but world agriculture.  Similar large scale losses also began to be reported in continental Europe around 2003.  The causes of colony collapse disorder are not yet certain although various factors are thought to be responsible, including starvation, viruses, mites, nicotine-based pesticide exposure, genetically-modified crops and climate change.  Even sub-lethal doses of a chemical can damage a hive if the navigational abilities of bees are compromised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">FIBKA currently represents over 1,700 bee keepers nationally.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that to date FIBKA reports no significant evidence of colony collapse disorder in Ireland.  The weather in Ireland over the last three summers, and especially this summer, has however been very difficult for bees.  Often queen bees failed to mate properly due to the poor weather and a number of colony losses last spring have been attributed to poor mating conditions in summer 2008.  FIBKA sees good bee husbandry and bee keepers&rsquo; practices as the key to successful bee keeping.  For this reason all beekeepers should register with the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations.  It is important that people know its website, which is <i>www.irishbeekeeping.ie</i>, and I urge people to register with the organisation if they are thinking of beekeeping or have already begun doing so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In January 2009 the European Food Safety Authority was awarded funding to conduct a project aimed at identifying the factors which may contribute to colony collapse disorder and highlighting gaps in scientific knowledge in order to guide future research in this area.  Ireland was approached to participate in a recent survey as part of the EFSA project.  Although we do not operate a planned bee surveillance network, we supplied detailed information in respect of our sector.  In summary, we indicated that we have approximately 2,200 bee keepers, almost all of whom are non-professional.  Most but unfortunately not all are registered with the federation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We estimate that each bee keeper has an average of ten hives and they produce honey for their own personal use and direct local sale in farmers&rsquo; markets, for example.  My Department has registered some 620 beekeepers as primary producers of honey and we believe this figure includes all those operations which are obliged to register under the EU food hygiene regulations.  My Department also maintains a database to record details of registered beekeepers, bee importers and exporters, disease outbreaks and the findings of apiary inspections.  My Department also monitors imports of bees and takes samples of bee exports as required.</P>
        <P>Dr. Mary Coffey, the principal researcher working on Ireland&rsquo;s national apiculture programme, is also participating in the international COLOSS network which is investigating bee colony losses globally.  Dr. Coffey will survey Irish beekeepers on colony losses over this autumn through to next spring as part of her role in this network.  Irish participation in this worldwide integrated approach to colony losses is most welcome and will help mitigate the detrimental impact of honey bee colony losses for beekeepers, agriculture and natural biodiversity.</P><Col N="894"/>
        <P>In regard to disease control, beekeepers are obliged to notify outbreaks of American and European foul brood disease to my Department.  There have been no cases of small hive beetle or tropilaelaps mite detected to date and positive cases of American and European foul brood are routinely followed up and all infected hives are destroyed.  Adjacent hives are also sampled for foul brood disease.</P>
        <P>This issue goes beyond the needs of beekeepers, as Deputy White mentioned.  Pollination by honey bees has been estimated to deliver &euro;85 million of services to Irish agriculture in general, especially in my own area of responsibility in horticulture but also in clover, which affects dairy and meat production.  This is one of the many reasons I take a keen personal interest in biodiversity and beekeeping.  Apart from keeping abreast of the international research in apiculture, I expect to take delivery of my own hive in February in an orchard in Balbriggan, near Bremore where St. Molaga, the early Christian beekeeping monk, lived.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad a ghabh&aacute;il don rud uaf&aacute;sach.  I wish to raise the matter of a site for Gaelscoil Chluain Meala in my home town in Tipperary.  It is an important matter but it has proven very difficult, as there has been a long gestation period in the search for a new school for the community.  This perilous position has persisted for almost 15 years.  There is a wonderful school community, which includes the board of management, the parents&rsquo; council and an excellent principal in Treasa Nic Diarmada agus na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; eile.  It also includes pupils, caretakers and others.</P>
        <P>There is a long history to the efforts to gain a site for this school.  I have correspondence from as recently as 20 September 2007, when the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, indicated: &ldquo;I absolutely appreciate how long the school (Gaelscoil Chluain Meala) has been in its current accommodation.  I assure you that the Department will do all that we can to have a site for the school by the end of 2007&rdquo;.  It is now October 2009 and we have seen no progress on this important issue for Clonmel and the surrounding area.  A site has yet to be located and purchased.  When the school was established it was initially given temporary status, and I thank South Tipperary County Council because it used an old county council building in Irishtown in Clonmel.  That was over 14 years ago and the year after establishment, it was recognised as a viable establishment, even though it was in temporary accommodation, a position that has not changed since.</P>
        <P>Teachers and pupils are in cramped and unsuitable conditions by any standard and in recent years, parents have been forced to fund-raise just to keep the doors open and look after the present school building in Irishtown, keeping it maintained and in a habitable condition.  They also contribute to the rent to the county council.  With a site still to be identified and negotiations yet to begin on getting it developed, teachers, parents and the public are extremely frustrated and disillusioned with the lack of advancement of this project to date.  While I was a member of South Tipperary County Council I remember being party to a motion in 2006 relating to tract of land in Ballingarane.  It is a great site overlooking Clonmel and incorporating Balingarane House.  The management, however, refused to allow a national school to be built on that campus because it was of the view that it would not be proper for it to be co-located there with a third level institution.</P>
        <P>We then considered every site available north and south of the River Suir.  I compliment the board of management, Mr. Se&aacute;n Carey and the principal of the school on their efforts to obtain a site.  I also pay tribute to Professor Drumm and Mr. Brian Gilroy of the HSE who came up <Col N="895"/>trumps in late 2007 by offering a three-acre site on the N24 outside Clonmel.  Unfortunately, the waters were again muddied when the county manager decided to purchase the relevant lands from the HSE.  However, that proposed sale did not, in fact, proceed.  The site was held in abeyance in the intervening period and I have informed the county manager &mdash; who, I am sure, will not mind me taking his name in vain &mdash; of that fact.</P>
        <P>I am extremely unhappy about this matter.  In frustration, the board of management, the teaching staff and the parents&rsquo; council came up with the idea of trying to retain the school at its current premises and to extend it into the old machinery yard that is located adjacent to it.  I took a deputation to meet the Minister &mdash; I thank him for receiving us &mdash; and his officials to discuss this proposal.  We thought it had met with a good reception.  Unfortunately, however, bureaucracy has again got in the way.  We are awaiting the arrival of an official to value the site in order that the Department can purchase it from the county council.  It appears the latter is now intent on housing an arts centre for Clonmel on the same campus.  I am in favour of such a centre being put in place but I do not want the resolution of the problem delayed any further.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to use their good offices to ensure the valuation is carried out in order that a deal might be struck with the county council.  The site can then be purchased and we can move to proceeding with the various stages of the building process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What has happened is extremely frustrating.  I recall a line from the poem, Cill Chais, which runs &ldquo;Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmaid?&rdquo;.  The new line and motto we might use is, &ldquo;C&aacute; bhfuil &aacute;r nGaelscoil Chluain Meala?&rdquo;</P>

        <P Just="Left">I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who regrets that he cannot be present.  I thank the Deputy for raising it because it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position in respect of the future plans for Gaelscoil Chluain Meala, Cluain Meala, Contae Thiobraid &Aacute;rann.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Minister intends that it will be one of his priorities.  The Government has dramatically increased capital investment in the school building programme to an unprecedented level.  This reflects its commitment to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas, while continuing to develop the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Public Works, OPW, which acts on behalf of the Department in respect of site acquisitions generally, was requested to source a greenfield site for this gaelscoil.  The OPW advised the Department that the Health Service Executive had formally conveyed its approval to dispose of a site for the gaelscoil.  Officials from the Department met representatives of the local authority and the school authority in June of this year.  On foot of those meetings, the Department is examining a number of options regarding the proposed site for the school.  The further progression of the acquisition of this site and the accompanying building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings in general.</P><Col N="896"/>

	<P>Significant progress has been made since the State, acting through my Department in a co-ordinating role, took over custody of the Irish Ispat site from the liquidator in June 2003, as mandated by Government.  The mandate required my Department to co-ordinate all legal actions in relation to the site and to cover issues such as ongoing site security, maintenance and other such issues arising once the site was vacated by the liquidator. This has necessarily included elements of site clearance to avoid negative environmental impact and for reasons of health and safety. It has also involved an extensive site investigation to determine the extent of environmental damage and to guide further consideration of the future development/use of the site.</P>
        <P>To date the State has expended c.&euro;50 million on investigations, site works, disposal of waste material, testing and sampling, analysis, topographical and foreshore ecological surveys, project management, professional fees and security. In relation to safety concerns at Haulbowline the comprehensive site investigations which were conducted in 2005 and 2008 by Consultants, White Young Green, concluded that while there is significant contamination of the site it posed no immediate threat to human health or the environment in the area.</P>
        <P>The Government recently considered the position in relation to the site at Haulbowline and decided that the Office of Public Works will chair a Working Group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site.  The establish<Col N="898"/>ment of this Group is a matter for the OPW, and I understand that the necessary arrangements are underway.</P>

	<P>To date, my Department has issued full funding approval in respect of some 842 properties under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative.  In addition to this, a further 367 units have been issued with provisional approval. This gives a total of 1,209 properties approved to date, covering 17 different housing authority areas. Furthermore, there are a number of leasing proposals currently being assessed by my Department, which together with other proposals expected to be brought forward in the weeks ahead, should result in the achievement of our ambitious 2,000 unit target by year end.</P>
        <P>I also recently announced the extension of the leasing arrangements to the voluntary and co-operative sector, so that in addition to local authorities being able to provide leased accommodation, the voluntary sector will now also be able to provide such accommodation. This will, I believe, contribute greatly to the provision of many more homes under the leasing programme.  Delivering on the target of providing 2,000 units under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative in 2009 will continue to be one of my Department&rsquo;s key priorities for the remainder of the year, with a view to making a significant contribution to meeting housing needs and, at the same time enabling the State successfully to avail of the cost effective opportunities in the market.</P>

	<P>The 2002 National Spatial Strategy (NSS) sets out a 20-year Strategy aimed at achieving a better balance of social, economic and physical development across Ireland, supported by more effective planning.  Regional Planning Guidelines made in mid-2004 as a key implementation mechanism for the NSS are now under review with the intention of adopting new Regional Planning Guidelines by the middle of next year.  Since the current Regional Planning Guidelines were published, 2006 census and other data have become available providing a more updated analysis of recent population trends.  In January 2009, my Department set out population targets for 2016 and 2022 for each of the eight regional authority areas having regard to the most recent data available; the population targets must be incorporated into the updated Regional Planning Guidelines.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 contains key provisions linking development at local level with population targets contained in the Regional Planning Guidelines and with regional development objectives set out in both the Guidelines and the NSS; the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas provides an opportunity to debate this issue.  My Department is currently finalising an NSS Review and Outlook Report which will take stock <Col N="899"/>of NSS achievements to date and outline remaining challenges and actions to enable the NSS to contribute to national economic renewal and enhanced competitiveness, through for example better alignment and prioritisation of sectoral infrastructure investment, especially in the Gateway cities which act as economic drivers for their wider regions.</P>

	<P>The achievement of value for money is the primary focus of authorities when negotiating leasing costs and other associated terms and conditions provided for in lease agreements under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative. In normal circumstances, each lease agreement entered into will be the subject of a rent review. However, there will be some exceptions to this, including situations where, based on the discount on the current market rent obtained, an agreement is made to fix the rent for the full term of the lease.  Generally, however, it is expected that each lease agreement will have a rent review in place and my Department has advised authorities that where provided for, rent reviews should follow market conditions, so that rent can be adjusted upwards or downwards. </P>
        <P>While the new leasing initiative does not specifically require that properties achieve a minimum BER rating, it does require that all dwellings must be compliant with planning and building regulations and with the new standards regulations for rented accommodation, and a BER certificate is required to be provided for each unit of accommodation leased.  In recent years, significant efforts have been made to ensure that all new dwellings are designed and built to high energy efficiency and sustainable development standards. To that end, while the leasing initiative has no specific minimum requirements on energy ratings, the initiative is designed in part to leverage the current value in the housing market due to large numbers of unsold <i>new </i>properties. Under the recent building regulations, it is expected that the majority of these dwellings would therefore achieve ratings of at least C3.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the new Social Housing Leasing Initiative will provide quality housing to those who need it, further support the Government&rsquo;s objective of delivering more energy efficient social housing and deliver value for money for the State.</P>

	<P>This Question anticipates legislation that is currently before the House and as such it is premature to arrive at firm conclusions regarding its impact on my Department, agencies under the aegis of my Department, or local authorities.  </P>
        <P>My Department has no land or other assets which are subject to borrowings.  The valuation of assets in the accounts of agencies is a matter for the board of the agency concerned; the <Col N="900"/>accounts are prepared in compliance with relevant accounting standards and are audited.  As I indicated in reply to Question No. 105 on today&rsquo;s order paper, my Department and the Department of Finance met with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in July.  It was agreed that the Authority would await the publication of the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 and also have regard to the guidance for the treatment of impaired assets, prepared by the European Commission and the European Central Bank, in valuing its property assets.</P>
        <P>Local authorities possess a number of assets, including land, which have been acquired or developed on foot of authorised borrowings. These assets are utilised and developed by local authorities, as appropriate, or remain available to the local authority for future development. Their accounting requirements are set out in a Code of Practice on Local Authority Accounting in Ireland issued under the Local Government Act 2001.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Implementation Plan for the Government&rsquo;s Homeless Strategy, The Way Home, was launched on 21 April 2009 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.  It provides a robust framework to guide the action required at national level to promote and support effective implementation locally.  The Plan sets out a sequence of strategic aims, key approaches, priority actions and constituent/supporting measures, along with relevant timelines, necessary to pursue the objectives of the Strategy.   </P>
        <P>Implementation of the Strategy involves action by a number of statutory and non-statutory agencies and achievement of its objectives depends particularly on the effectiveness of action by such agencies at local level.  My Department works to promote and co-ordinate the role of these agencies through the Cross-Department Team on Homelessness, the National Homelessness Consultative Committee and direct engagement with local authorities and other relevant organisations.</P>
        <P>A number of key actions under the Strategy more directly involving my Department are being progressed. New legislative provisions relating to homelessness were enacted in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 under which statutory structures and action plans to address homelessness will come into being at local level. Major reconfiguration of homeless services in Dublin is in progress in accordance with a model developed pursuant to a comprehensive evaluation of services. Approval has been given to the development of a new homeless services shared client database. A new scheme of mainstream housing and supports to help people in homeless facilities to progress to independent living has been launched, and the procurement process for support services in Dublin will be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the Homeless Strategy is a high priority for my Department as evidenced by the level of funding available in 2009 for homeless accommodation and related services, which increased by 5% in monetary terms, and significantly more in real terms relative to trends in prices, over 2008.  Implementation of the Homeless Strategy is, therefore, well underpinned by funding, structural arrangements and legislative provisions.  Achievement of its objectives, which is being driven by my Department, will ultimately be determined by the performance of all of the statutory and non-statutory agencies involved.</P>

	<P>Primary responsibility for the prevention of pollution from septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems rests with owners or occupiers of premises served by such systems.  In its Water Quality 2004-2006 Report published in 2008, the EPA noted, <i>inter alia, </i>that greater attention needed to be given to groundwater protection, and in particular to prevention of pollution at source including from septic tanks.  A number of measures have been taken or are underway in this area. These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />strengthened legal provisions under the Water Services Act 2007 requiring the occupier or owner of a premises to ensure that waste water from the premises does not cause nuisance or risk to human health or the environment;</P>

	<P>The information sought in respect of 2008 and 2009 is not available in my Department.  The National Waste Report 2007, published by the EPA in January 2009, reported that brown bin collections were provided to households in thirteen local authority areas in 2007 through both public and private sector service provision.  A total of 18,705 tonnes of food and garden waste was collected from householders representing an increase of almost 20% on that collected in 2006.  A further 19,611 tonnes of such waste was collected at local authority civic amenity sites in 2007.</P>
        <P>Improving our recovery rates for organic waste represents a considerable challenge and one that must be addressed as a matter of urgency if Ireland is to achieve its prescribed diversion targets under the EU Landfill Directive.  Meeting these targets will entail doubling the existing levels of diversion of biodegradable municipal waste, which includes organic waste, from landfill by 2010 with exponential increases in diversion in the subsequent target years of 2013 and 2016 respectively.  Against this background, it is my intention to issue a further circular to all <Col N="902"/>local authorities aimed at accelerating progress in the roll out of brown bins to households and further promoting the benefits of home composting.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is currently holding a public consultation on draft regulations which will require the source segregation and appropriate treatment of food waste arising from commercial premises.  This, I believe, has the potential to divert significant amounts of food waste from landfill towards more sustainable and environmentally beneficial practices.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Following a Government decision in 2004, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) was established to meet the accommodation needs of rent supplement recipients with a long-term housing need. In the period from the commencement of transfers in September 2005 to the end of August 2009, some 22,412 households have been transferred from rent supplement. Of these, 11,987 were housed directly in RAS accommodation and a further 10,425 were accommodated under other social housing options.  In terms of activity this year, some 4,401 households had been transferred from rent supplement by the end of August, equating to 65% of the total annual target of 7,000. I am confident that the transfer rate for the rest of the year will deliver the remaining 35%.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific issue of reviewing the 18 month qualifying criterion, while in general a household must be in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more in order to qualify for RAS, housing authorities do, on occasion, accept households on to RAS where they have been less than 18 months on rent supplement. This occurs where there are exceptional circumstances and where a long term housing need can be demonstrated. In addition, while in most housing authority areas there remains a significant cohort of households in receipt of rent supplement for longer than 18 months, there are a small number of authorities who have accommodated most of the 18 month cohort at this stage, and are now in consultation with the local Community Welfare Service to identify other rent supplement households that have a long term housing need and are suitable for transfer to the scheme.</P>
        <P>It is considered, particularly in the current economic climate where rising unemployment is resulting in an increase in the numbers on rent supplement, that the 18 month threshold remains an appropriate juncture at which to review a household&rsquo;s ongoing need for housing. As the economy recovers, it is likely that many of these households will return to employment. In that context, the type of support provided through rent supplement i.e. short term income support, is more appropriate to the needs to these households rather then pre-determining that the households have a long term housing need. Should some households find themselves with a long term housing need, they will be provided for under the normal 18 month rule.</P>

	<P>As previously advised, the proposed facility in question received planning approval from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in November 2007 and was granted a waste licence by the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2008.  It is the subject of continuing correspondence with the Dublin City Council.  In line with national policy the Exchequer does not fund new heavy waste infrastructure, landfills or waste to energy (incineration) plants. These are to be provided as purely private sector commercial initiatives or by way of public private partnerships with local authorities and accordingly the capital costs of this project will not fall to be met by the Exchequer.  Enforcement of competition law is in the first instance a matter for the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General sought and received, on my behalf, the contract for the Poolbeg incinerator from Dublin City Council earlier this year.

	<P>The Government has decided to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing this charge on all non-principal private residences, including private rented accommodation, holiday homes and any other residential property that is not the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence. The charge has been set at &euro;200 per annum.  When the Bill was at Second Stage in the Houses, it was indicated that the charge could be expected to raise about &euro;40 million a year, based on collection from approximately 200,000 properties. However, census and other data suggest that there may be 400,000 properties in the State liable for the charge and the annual potential yield could therefore be significantly higher than estimated at present.  The amount raised as at 12 October 2009 is just under &euro;25 million, 82% of which has been collected through on-line payments.</P>

	<P>My Department does not collect details on the number of social housing applicants waiting for a housing needs assessment to be completed, or the proportion of those who are waiting for a determination on Rent Supplement.  It is a matter for each housing authority under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009 to carry out housing needs assessments and to allocate appropriate resources to undertake this function.  However, service indicator information is collected annually by the Local Government Management Services Board, and provides information on the average time taken to inform applicants of decisions regarding their application for local authority housing.  The latest published figures relate to 2007 and show an average time of twenty eight days.  The 2008 figures are expected to be available shortly.  </P>
        <P>The operation of Rent Supplement is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, given the necessary close relationship between this support and the delivery of social housing, my Department liaises closely with that Department on any changes in the scheme&rsquo;s operation.  In the context of the recent introduction of a new approach to the assessment of housing need for rent supplement purposes, both Departments have undertaken to establish new systems at both national and regional level to monitor and review the new working arrangements.  These systems are currently being put in place, and in the interim my Department is using the existing Rental Accommodation Scheme Steering Group, on which the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Community Welfare Service are represented, as a forum for ongoing monitoring of the operation of the new arrangements and to address any issues arising.</P>

	<P>There are currently almost 2,900 persons registered with Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) as Building Energy Rating (BER) assessors for dwellings, with 270 registered as BER assessors for buildings other than dwellings.  At present there are some 74,000 Building Energy Rating (BER) certificates in place in respect of dwellings and over 2,000 BER certificates in place for buildings other than dwellings.  While a significant level of BER activity is taking place, it is clear that the number of registered assessors for dwellings is far higher than is required to meet current and anticipated demand for BER certificates in the market place.  </P>
        <P>There are no proposals under consideration by my Department at present in relation to the waiver of registration fees in respect of unemployed persons who are interested in becoming BER assessors. I understand that SEI strongly advises applicants for registration to review the number of BER assessors who are already servicing their intended target area in order to ensure that they are satisfied with the potential business opportunity before investing money in registering with SEI.   A database of all registered BER assessors, searchable by county, is included on SEI&rsquo;s website (www.sei.ie).</P>
        <P>With regard to continuing to improve compliance with and awareness of the BER system, my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, SEI and the 37 local Building Control Authorities to promote awareness of the obligations which arise under the Regulations. SEI has already conducted a wide range of information and awareness campaigns and, later this Autumn, will engage in a further comprehensive advertising campaign to remind buyers of their rights and vendors of their obligations under the Regulations.</P>

	<P>It will be a matter for each authority to negotiate the terms of the lease arrangements they enter into, subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval under a broad range of sustainable communities and other criteria. The lease arrangements, once entered into, will apply for the full term of the lease regardless of whether or not property prices rise or fall, unless a break clause, purchase option or other provision is specifically included in the arrangements.  The primary focus in negotiating leasing costs will be the delivery of value for money and I would expect that authorities would be able to secure leasing costs of at least 20% below market rental value.  This reflects the element of risk, such as the vacancies and management and maintenance responsibilities, being transferred to the housing authority.  </P>

	<P>One of the key aims of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 is to secure a more coherent approach to the zoning of land and a better alignment between national, regional and local planning policies and objectives.  As a statutory consultee on draft development plans and local area plans, my Department regularly provides specific comments on zonings and other planning policies to councillors, with more than 300 comments submitted to planning authorities on over 80 draft development plans in the last 5 years at the plan-making or variation stages.  In addition, I have issued Ministerial Directions under section 31 of the Planning Act in respect of a number of development plans where there was excessive levels of zoning and where members failed to take due account of my statutory comments and concerns.  My views and the views of my Department on zoning issues have, therefore, been well articulated in recent years. </P>
        <P>Following publication of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 in June, I received a detailed submission from the County and City Managers Association setting out the views of local authorities in relation to the published Bill. These views have been carefully considered by my Department and a number of changes will be brought forward at Committee Stage of the Bill.  Second stage of the Bill has commenced in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and will continue in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I have maintained ongoing contact with the elected members&rsquo; representative associations since I took office on a broad range of issues relevant to the local government sector. Detailed consultation has also taken place before and after the publication last year of the Green Paper on Local Government, which examined a broad range of issues in relation to local government. I expect that the White Paper will be published later this year.</P>

	<P>By its nature homelessness is difficult to quantify definitively. The <Col N="908"/>Counted In survey, which is a special purpose count of people using homeless services carried out in Dublin every three years since 1999 through the Homeless Agency, supported by my Department, is generally considered to provide the most robust indicator.  </P>
        <P>The results of the most recent survey in March 2008 reported a total of 1,436 homeless households in Dublin, compared with 1,361 in 2005. While this was a numerical increase of around 5%, the position relative to overall population was unchanged.  A further 708 households were recorded as residing in long &mdash; term or transitional accommodation; however, it would not be correct to regard all of these as homeless, particularly where, for example, households were resident in suitable accommodation that would be likely to provide their most appropriate home in the long-term, or where they had begun to make a transition out of homelessness. Additional summary counts will be carried out in Dublin in 2009 and 2010.</P>
        <P>The Counted In survey method was also used for the first time in Cork, Galway and Limerick in 2008. The results indicated a total of 767 households homeless in these centres.  However, that figure includes households in long term and transitional accommodation some of whom, as indicated above in relation to Dublin, should not properly be regarded as homeless.  Data for the total number of homeless persons are not available on a monthly basis.</P>

	<P>There is a commitment to introduce comprehensive legislation on noise pollution within the lifetime of this Government. Earlier this year, following an extensive consultation process, the General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was prepared in my Department and approved by the Government. The Noise Nuisance Bill is included in Section A of the Government Legislation Programme published on 16 September 2009.  The Bill will include provision for the introduction of secondary legislation for purposes of the prevention, management, limitation, reduction or abatement of any noise which is likely to give rise to a nuisance or disamenity, constitute a danger to health, or damage to property. </P>
        <P>I intend that the new legislation will provide local authorities with stronger enforcement powers to deal with nuisances from particular noise sources, such as continuously sounding alarms, through a system of fixed payment notices in relation to noise nuisance offences.  In addition, the General Scheme of the Bill includes provision for a potential role for mediation services to assist in the prevention, limitation or abatement of noise in certain circumstances.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has no direct function or involvement in this matter.</P>
        <P>Rates income is an important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities, such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  All rates collected within a local authority are spent exclusively in providing services in that area.  These services are of considerable benefit to all and any diminution of rates income would directly affect the provision of such services.</P>
        <P>I am nevertheless acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses at the present time and I specifically requested that local authorities exercise restraint in setting commercial rates in their 2009 budgets in order to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities.  As we move into 2010 I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under regular review.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Water Pricing Policy, adopted in 1998, requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes.  Accordingly, when the Water Framework Directive was adopted in 2000, the established practice in Ireland was to exclude domestic users from water charges.  The renewed Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce charging for treated water use on a basis that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  The system will be designed to allocate a free basic allowance to households, with charging only for water use in excess of the allowance.</P>

Additional information in relation to progress on individual contracts or water conservation works under this Programme, or in relation to activity generally under the small public schemes measure of the devolved Rural Water Programme, may be obtained from the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>As additional water supply capacity through leakage control is a viable alternative to capital infrastructure provision, the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 includes a National Water Conservation Sub-Programme.  This sub-programme has been in progress for a number of years and has led to reductions in Unaccounted for Water, improved knowledge of the condition of water distribution networks and consumption patterns and an improvement in the level and quality of supply to consumers.</P>
        <P>Local authorities were asked in July to submit an assessment of needs for both water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009.  These assessments will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme, which it is anticipated will be published in early 2010.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities have been asked to prioritise schemes and contracts, including water conservation projects, for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  A provision of &euro;500 million is available for investment in water services infrastructure in 2009.  Future investment in the sector will be determined by Government in the normal course as part of the Estimates process.</P>

All Departments have been notified of the key elements of the scheme and they will be required each year to calculate their carbon dioxide emissions and associated offsetting costs based on total air kilometres travelled.</P>
        <P>The scheme applies to all Government Departments and Offices, and covers all flights by Ministers and officials on both commercial airlines and Government passenger aircraft.  It also applies to bodies under the aegis of Departments and it is a matter for individual Departments to decide which bodies are to be included.  The price of offsetting a tonne of carbon in the period 14 June 2007 to 31 December 2008 has been set at &euro;13.  My Department will continue to provide a carbon price each year to reflect the average price in the voluntary offsetting market as the basis for Departments to calculate their offsetting costs.  The overall cost of the scheme, estimated at some &euro;420,000 per annum, is modest relative to the benefits likely to accrue.</P>
        <P>The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) will seek to invest the total offsetting funding in small scale &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Ireland&rsquo;s priority Overseas Development Aid countries in Africa.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding his statement that there is enough land zoned in parts of the country to provide for housing needs up until 2075; if he will take steps to ensure that further land is not rezoned in upcoming development plans for the local authority areas concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is currently progressing through second stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, will address land use zoning reform through requiring an evidence-based core strategy in development plans which must provide information on how the plan and the housing strategy are consistent with regional planning guidelines and with the National Spatial Strategy.  The core strategy will outline the location, quantum, and phasing of proposed development over the period of the plan as well as details of transport plans and retail development and proposals for development in rural areas where appropriate.  This more strategic approach to zoning should facilitate development to take place in a phased and sequential manner and will enable the State to coordinate and deliver the necessary infrastructure and services with much greater certainty and more efficiency.</P>
        <P>I am also strengthening the status of Regional Planning Guidelines in the Bill and the role of regional authorities in the preparation or variation of development plans.  The ongoing <Col N="913"/>review and update of the Regional Planning Guidelines to be finalised in the middle of next year will be crucial to giving effect to these new legislative provisions.</P>

        <Quest> the action he will take to meet Ireland&rsquo;s need to divert an additional half a million <Col N="914"/>tonnes of biodegradable waste from landfill by 2010 to meet its targets under the European Union landfill directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am committed to implementing the measures necessary to ensure that Ireland meets the 2010, and subsequent, EU landfill diversion targets.  The Government has decided to introduce primary legislation to allow significant increases in the landfill levy.  In addition, I have initiated a public consultation on a statutory instrument which will require the source segregation and appropriate treatment of food waste arising from commercial premises.  This consultation ends today and I will consider the results of the consultation as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Last year, my Department issued a circular to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins and promote the use of home composting and the EPA National Waste Report 2007 indicates increased quantities of biodegradable waste are being dealt with by home composting.  I am confident that all of the above measures will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of waste from landfill and a reduction in our overall use of such facilities.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that only 7% of properties registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board were inspected by local authorities in 2008; if he will commit to fully resourcing local authorities in order that they may implement regulations under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009; the mechanisms he will introduce to ensure that local authorities can inspect all relevant properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority. Following commencement, shortly, of the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, a strengthened sanctions regime will be available to local authorities and fines for non-compliance with the Regulations will be significantly increased; the maximum fine will be increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence will be increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are supported in their enforcement activity by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department. This funding increased significantly between 2005 and 2008, rising from &euro;1.5m to &euro;4m per annum.  The latter figure is being maintained in 2009, bringing total funding allocations since 2004 to &euro;15m. Details of the amounts paid to each local authority <Col N="916"/>in respect of the years 2004 &mdash; 2008 and of the first funding tranche for 2009 are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i> and in the Oireachtas Library. My Department keeps the level, and the methodology for payment, of this funding under review.</P>
        <P>In general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity in recent years with the number of inspections more than doubling in the period 2005 to 2008, reaching some 17,200 inspections last year.  More detailed information on the number of inspections carried out each year up to and including 2008 is included in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.   The significant increase in inspection activity reflects the positive impact of the overall Action Programme on Standards, including increased funding, introduced on foot of a commitment in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, and the ongoing progress with the implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</P>
        <P>In interpreting the data, it is important to note that registrations with the Private Residential Tenancies Board are registrations of tenancies rather than registrations of rental properties.  The tenancies registered are of varying duration and a single property may be the subject of a number of registered tenancies. As such, the number of registrations with the Private Residential Tenancies Board does not reflect the number of rental properties in the market at any particular point in time.  Accordingly, in considering the level of inspections by local authorities, the total volume of actual inspections is the key measurable indicator.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that, in line with the wider housing market, there can be considerable variation in the type and quality of accommodation provided by the private rented accommodation. As such, in order to best use the available resources, local authorities should focus their inspections on accommodation that is more likely not to be compliant with the regulations. While it is a matter for each individual local authority to decide on the specific details of its inspection arrangements, my Department encourages authorities to have regard to the report Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement, published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on matters relevant to inspection procedures, including identifying and targeting inspection requirements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>It is essential that all State investment in housing support, including through leasing arrangements, complies fully with the &ldquo;sustainable communities&rdquo; philosophy at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy, as outlined in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities<i>.</i> In this context, while my Department has not specified a limit on the number of housing units that can be leased for social housing purposes, a circular and guidance note issued by my Department to housing authorities states that authorities must have regard to the concentration of social housing in a particular development or in the general area where leased properties are proposed. This would include taking account of how much housing has been acquired for social purposes under Part V of the Planning and Development Act.</P><Col N="917"/>
        <P>In seeking approval for proposals, authorities must provide details of the overall development concerned and the breakdown of the types of occupancy i.e. market/private housing, affordable housing and social housing.  This is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the mixed income, mixed tenure objectives of the overall &ldquo;sustainable communities&rdquo; policy and these details are considered by my Department when assessing proposals.  Leased properties, because of their broad geographical distribution will facilitate, rather than impede, the widely endorsed aim of supporting the development of mixed-income and mixed-tenure communities. The unacceptable alternative is a return to previously pursued flawed approaches of developing large mono-tenure estates, with all the attendant issues of social, economic and educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Even prior to the introduction of leasing arrangements, the quantum of social housing in any particular development could be influenced by a number of factors.  In addition to units delivered under the Part V mechanism, units could also be acquired by local authorities as part of their normal acquisitions programme, where this was considered appropriate, or could be secured through the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Climate Change Strategy signalled the possibility of supplementing greenhouse gas emission reductions with the purchase of up to 3.6 million carbon units on average each year in the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012 or 18 million units in total, costing &euro;270m, at a projected unit price of &euro;15.  Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency has been designated as purchasing agent for the State.  In 2008, the Agency purchased 3.455m certified emission reduction units at a cost of some &euro;53m.  In 2009, they have purchased 1.8m units at a cost of some &euro;21.6m. These units were generated under the Clean Development Mechanism provided for in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P>The economic downturn has implications for the purchasing programme. The most recent EPA projections suggest that with full implementation of all announced emission reduction measures the purchase requirement for carbon units will now be between 1.3 and 1.8m units per annum over the 2008-2012 period.  In the circumstances, the National Treasury Management Agency has been asked to put its purchasing programme on hold for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Prior to the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent, my Department committed &euro;10 million each to the Carbon Fund for Europe and the BioCarbon Fund operated by the World Bank.  Management of these investments is a matter for my Department and, since enactment of the 2007 Act, payments are made through the Carbon Fund process as they arise. In 2008, my Department refunded &euro;3.72m to the Carbon Fund in respect of these investments in the World Bank in 2007.  To date in 2009 two further payments amounting to &euro;1.9m have been made to the Carbon Fund for Europe.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, my Department entered into an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to invest &euro;20 million in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund. The investment was made in 2006 on foot of a once-off provision from the Department&rsquo;s vote.  Purchasing requirements to ensure Kyoto compliance are being kept under review and will be revised as necessary in the light of future projections.</P>

	<P>The Support to Live Independently Scheme (SL&Iacute;), details of which issued to local authorities in July 2009, forms an important element of action to end long-term homelessness by providing suitable long-term accommodation in mainstream housing with appropriate supports to help people make a successful transition from homelessness to independent living.  Responsibility for implementation of the scheme rests with local authorities. The scheme is being implemented initially in the Dublin area and arrangements for the provision of accommodation, assessment of households to be accommodated and procurement of support services, are progressing and tenancies under the scheme are expected to commence shortly.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council and the Homeless Agency have been urged to continue to prioritise this scheme and are very conscious of its importance in helping to achieve the aim of ending long-term homelessness.  My Department is engaging with local authorities regarding roll-out of the scheme to other areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158, 265 and 290 together.</P>
        <P>The Nitrates Directive and Ireland&rsquo;s National Nitrates Action Programme are given legal effect by the consolidated European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2009. The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.</P>
        <P>Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of slurry as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters. In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast.</P>
        <P>In view of the prolonged period of favourable weather that has prevailed since September, the risk to water quality posed by an extension to the period for slurry-spreading and the major investment on the part of the State and farmers in the provision of adequate waste storage facilities in recent years, no extension to the spreading periods for organic fertilisers is proposed.</P>

	<P>Details of awards made to County and City managers under the Performance Awards Scheme for the Local Government Sector are contained in the annual reports of the Committee for Performance Awards (CPA) which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Awards are defined in terms of their distribution as a percentage of pay, the range of monetary values, and the number of recipients.</P>
        <P>The scheme was introduced in 2003, with the pool for performance awards set at 10% of the pay bill for the group concerned and with individual participants eligible to receive payments of up to 20% of pay.  Awards were made each year from 2003 to 2007.  No performance awards have been made in respect of 2008. The scheme for the Local Government Sector is currently suspended.</P>
        <P>Awards of 15% to 20% have only been made in the most exceptional situations where performance has surpassed all reasonable expectations and has resulted in the achievement of a major goal of the local authority.  Awards of more than 10% and up to 15% have only been made where performance has substantially exceeded the targets defined. Awards of more than 5% and up to 10% have been made where stretched targets have been fully met or exceeded (but not to a major degree).  Awards of 0% to 5% have been made where stretched targets have not been fully met.</P>
        <P>Each local authority manager who has participated in the Performance Award Scheme has submitted a statement of objectives to the CPA for approval. Awards have been determined by the CPA, based on achievement in the relevant year for the approved objectives.</P>

	<P>As part of the preparatory work for the 2011 census the CSO conducted a public consultation by inviting members of the public and various interest groups to make submissions on the topics to be covered, and on the outputs to be produced.  A notice to this effect was published in the national press in September 2008 seeking submissions, and all government departments were contacted for their input. This phase of the process has now concluded.  A Census Advisory Group was set up in Autumn 2008 to consider the submissions received and advise on the questions to be tested in a pilot survey carried out in April 2009. The Census Advisory Group is representative of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data along with the relevant CSO personnel. </P>
        <P>Over 90 submissions covering 31 topics were received in total, among them submissions on the subject of disability, and in particular on the subject of autism. A specific sub-group was convened to consider the disability questions on the census form. This sub-group was composed of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the Equality Authority, the Dis<Col N="923"/>ability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  The proposal to list specific disabilities within the disability question, namely to make specific reference to autistic spectrum disorder, or downs syndrome, in the category &lsquo;A learning or intellectual disability&rsquo; was considered at the second meeting of the group.</P>
        <P>The group concluded that it would not be appropriate, nor would there be enough room on the census form, to list all individual disabilities. However, in order to go some way towards accommodating this request, the existing (2006) category &lsquo;<i>A learning or intellectual disability</i>&rsquo; was split into two categories &lsquo;<i>An intellectual disability</i>&rsquo; and separately &lsquo;<i>A difficulty with learning, remembering or concentrating</i>&rsquo; for testing in the pilot survey. The group felt that this approach narrowed the categories and thus helped address the issue of autism, while allowing the question to remain as inclusive as possible.</P>
        <P>The new wording of the disability questions which were tested in the Census Pilot Survey in April 2009 were as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The CSO, in consultation with the Census Advisory Group, is currently finalising its analysis of the results of the census pilot, including the revised questions on disability. It is important to bear in mind that only questions that have been tested and have been proven to have worked will be considered for inclusion in the 2011 census.  It is envisaged that the Census Advisory Group will have concluded its deliberations before the end of October and that a proposal in relation to the content of the 2011 census questionnaire will be brought to Government before the end of 2009.</P>

	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency, as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas, and not one in which I have a function.  In order to cater for the specialised high utility intensive needs of the Biotechnology and ICT sectors, IDA Ireland is in the process of developing a number of largescale, fully-serviced industrial sites throughout the country.  In this connection and as part of IDA&rsquo;s plans to enable the West of Ireland to compete for global investment, IDA purchased a site of 97ha (240 acres), located approximately 1km to the south west of Athenry, which was previously owned by Teagasc.  The purchase was completed in December 2007, but for reasons of commercial sensitivity the purchase price of this land is not disclosed.</P>
        <P>IDA is currently progressing with the delivery of infrastructure and services to the site.  I am informed by the Agency that Phase I of these works commenced in September 2009, and is scheduled for completion in the Spring of 2010.  Phase 2 is currently at design stage and will be put out to tender in 2010.  IDA is also working with Galway County and City Councils regarding water and waste water capacity.  The remaining infrastructural services are scheduled for completion over the next three to four years.  It is not possible to outline at this stage details of costs for completed and projected works.  However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department is informed regularly, in line with normal reporting procedures, of expenditure by IDA on property related activities.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Agency that this site will be marketed for new Research Development &amp; Innovation investments in the Bio-Pharma and related industry sectors.  Expenditure by IDA on its property function is largely self-financing.  The Agency&rsquo;s costs in acquiring and developing sites are met through the sale of existing properties or recovered when the developed site is sold on to an individual project promoter.  Indeed in 2008 and 2009, IDA received slightly in excess of &euro;3m. per year of exchequer funding towards its industrial property function.</P>

	<P>On 5 January, 2009, CIGNA announced that it would reduce its global workforce of 28,000 by four percent, including all 180 positions in Loughrea on a phased basis from March, 2009.  The closing of the Loughrea operation arose mainly due to developments in the US market, as the Irish company supported U.S. based customers.  IDA is continuing in contact with CIGNA to discuss alternative future activities for Ireland. The company has worked closely with IDA in the marketing and promotion of the building at Loughrea as a location for other IDA target companies.</P>
        <P>Last May, I visited Loughrea and met with local CIGNA management and assured them of the full support and assistance of the State development agencies as regards any future proposals that they might have.  Senior Management from Enterprise Ireland, along, with IDA, <Col N="925"/>F&Aacute;S, City &amp; County Enterprise Board, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Local Authority have met on three occasions under the chairmanship of the County Manager to ensure that an integrated and strategic response was put in place to address the loss of 180 jobs in Loughrea.  The 4th Meeting is planned for the 20th October, 2009.</P>
        <P>On the 24th February Enterprise Ireland and the City and County Enterprise Board visited Cigna for a workshop on Start Your Own Business.  Arising from this, there were ongoing discussions in response to various staff queries.  F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Welfare were also actively involved with the staff on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>Another initiative from the response group involved the County Manager inviting representatives from three groupings in Loughrea who had demonstrated a wish to be involved in the process to meet with all of the Agencies.  This meeting was held on the 12th March in the County Buildings Loughrea and the three groups involved included Loughrea Chamber, Enterprise Development Committee and the Town Commissioners.  The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the appropriate strategy to foster Enterprise Development in Loughrea.</P>
        <P>Outside of the above meetings, Enterprise Ireland has met with the Loughrea Enterprise Group on four occasions and it has ongoing regular discussions with its Chairman. In this difficult economic environment, Enterprise Ireland is in very early discussions with two entrepreneurs regarding developing their business plans.  Discussions have also been held regarding a Community Enterprise Centre for the town.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department received applications in June under the Insolvency Payments Scheme from the administrator of this company for minimum notice and holiday pay on behalf of Mr. Duffy. These claims are currently being processed. I understand that it is hoped to complete processing of the claims for Mr. Duffy, along with those of other former employees of the company, and make payments within the next week.</P>
        <P>I should point out that the impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in a significant rise in the level of company receiverships and insolvencies.  Consequently, an increasing number of claims are being submitted to the Insolvency Payments Section, with 17,933 new claims recorded from January 1 to September 30 &mdash; an increase of over 144% against the corresponding figure for this period in 2008.  My officials endeavour to process all claims as quickly as possible and claims are dealt with in order of date of receipt.</P>

In 2001, the Minister for Finance delegated his investment authority to the NTMA.  As a result of increases in social welfare expenditure it is now expected that the surplus will disappear during 2010.

	<P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  As medical appliances such as the Lokomat machine were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to the supply of such products.</P>
        <P>In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. Annex III allows the provision of a reduced rate for the supply of medical equipment, aids and other appliances to alleviate or treat disability which is used for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person.  However this provision does not extend to the supply of medical equipment for the use of multiple persons, which is the intended use by Cois Ceim Eile of the Lokomat machine.  In this case the only rate that can apply to the Lokomat machine is the standard VAT rate of 21.5%.</P>
        <P>However, there is an option open to Cois Ceim Eile to apply for a VAT Refund for the purchase of the Lokomat machine under the VAT refund scheme for certain donated medical instruments and appliances (SI 58/92).  The main conditions relating to this refund scheme are that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance or instrument is donated to a hospital;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance costs &euro;25,390 or more in value (exclusive of tax);</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance is designed and manufactured for use solely in medical research or in diagnosis, prevention or treatment of illness;</P><Col N="927"/>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance is purchased through voluntary donations, such that no part of the funds used in the purchase is provided directly or indirectly by the State, a State body or any public or local authority, which includes lottery funding; and,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance is subject to a recommendation by the Minister for Health and Children that, having regard to the requirements of the health services in the State, a refund of tax would be appropriate.</P>

	<P>No valuer firms have been appointed by NAMA to date. The appointment of valuation firms covering Ireland and foreign jurisdictions is subject to an EU public procurement process which is still underway with a closing date of 23rd October 2009. The Pre Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) issued as part of this process is available on the www.etenders.gov.ie website. This PQQ sets out all the criteria in relation to qualifications and the scoring scheme to be applied. The assessment of valuation tenders will be overseen by the NTMA with Mr. Maurice O&rsquo;Connell (ex Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland) acting as Process Auditor.</P>

	<P>Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides for tax relief on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies. All primary and post primary schools providing education based on a programme prescribed or approved by the Minister for Education and Science automatically qualify as approved bodies for the purposes of the donations scheme. There is no separate tax exemption for church groups but most churches qualify for relief on donations on the basis that they are eligible charities for the purposes of the scheme. A separate tax relief is available for donations to Sports Bodies under Section 847A TCA 1997. The administration of these schemes is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out details of the refunds of tax made in respect of qualifying donations made by individual PAYE donors to eligible charities and approved bodies under section 848A of the TCA 1997 for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Comparable figures are not available for earlier years.</P><Col N="928"/>

	<P>Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies. The provisions of the Donations Scheme were introduced by Section 45 of the Finance Act 2001 and became effective from 6th April 2001. The administration of this scheme is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varies depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer only, is a chargeable person subject to self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE donor, the relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the eligible charity or approved body, as the case may be, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor.  The claim for refund is made by the eligible charity or approved body.  In the case of a donation by a chargeable person subject to self-assessment, that individual claims the relief and there is no grossing up arrangement.</P>
        <P>PAYE taxpayers with additional non-PAYE income can be deemed to be chargeable persons depending on the source and gross amount of their additional non-PAYE income. Such PAYE taxpayers who are deemed chargeable persons for self-assessment claim all the relief on charitable donations made by them in their Income Tax return. In such circumstances, a refund to the charity or approved body does not arise.</P>

This objective will be pursued, as far as possible, in the context of the on-going Estimates process and framing Budget 2010.</P>

	<P>&rsquo;<i>A Vision for Change</i>&rsquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy recommended that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and <Col N="934"/>implemented and that the resources released by these closures should be re-invested in the mental health service.  The Departments of Finance and Health and Children have agreed in principle to the release of the proceeds of the disposal of properties prior to 2006 for reinvestment in mental health capital development.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for property disposal require Department of Finance approval in each case, the lodging of the proceeds as Exchequer Extra Receipts and the re-voting of the funds for approved projects.  The HSE has disposed of a small number of psychiatric properties in recent years and the proceeds of these sales, which amount to just over &euro;42m, have been surrendered to the Exchequer.  A submission detailing the priority projects to be funded from these historic disposals has been received from the HSE.  The submission was examined in detail in the Department of Health &amp; Children and some preliminary discussions took place with the Department of Finance.  However, a number of issues required clarification and a revised submission has now been submitted to the Department of Finance.</P>

        <P>The immediate next step, following completion of phase 1, will be for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to undertake a detailed evaluation of phases 2 and 3 with a view to arriving at precise costs to undertake the works. I am committed to progressing planning on the Western Rail Corridor. The current funding environment is very difficult and it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisioned at its launch. Nevertheless, I am seeking to progress planning of the Western Rail Corridor phases 2 and 3, to ensure that we are in a position to move speedily to construction as soon as financial circumstances permit.</P>

Following the consideration of the case of the person concerned under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of him on 15 September 2006.  This Order was served by registered post which placed a legal requirement on the person concerned to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 3 October 2006 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>The legal representative of the person concerned lodged a request for revocation of the Deportation Order pursuant to Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended).  Following consideration of this application, a decision was made to refuse the application with the consequence that the original Deportation Order was affirmed. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 10 June 2008.  The person concerned has continued to meet the presentation requirements of the Garda National Immigration Bureau in accordance with Section 8(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).   The person concerned remains the subject of a valid Deportation Order and, as such, there are no residency issues outstanding in his case. The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>The Spent Convictions Bill 2007 was introduced in October 2007 as a Private Members Bill by Mr Barry Andrews, TD (who has in the meantime been appointed to the post of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs).  Deputy Andrews had previously introduced the Rehabilitation of Offenders Bill in March 2007.  It addressed similar issues to those dealt with in the Spent Convictions Bill.  However, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Bill fell with the dissolution of the <Col N="938"/>29th D&aacute;il.  The Government agreed to take over the Spent Convictions Bill 2007 and to progress it through all stages in Government time.  The Spent Convictions Bill 2007 is now awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, having completed Second Stage on 18 December 2008. </P>

        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.

        <Quest> if consideration has been given to reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s record on citizenship applications to international comparisons in terms of rejection rates and application processing times; his views on whether the processing time in Australia is generally 90 days, in the UK is six months, in Canada is 11 months as opposed to over two years here, and that the refusal rate in Canada is 3%, in Australia and the UK is 9% as opposed to 47% here; if he will establish a more efficient system for dealing with such applications here. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The immigration policies adopted by a country have a significant influence on the naturalisation process as both systems must link seamlessly.  Immigration and naturalisation policies and systems vary from country to country and are therefore not directly comparable.  For example, in the Australian system, the application for citizenship is only accepted once an applicant has satisfied other requirements, which are not part of the naturalisation process in the State. Because certain processing requirements are completed prior to allowing an applicant to submit their application, a quarter of applications in Australia receive a decision on the date of application, with the average being 3 months. </P>
        <P>A review of the current framework for the acquisition of Irish citizenship is underway in my Department.  Statutory provisions for the acquisition of Irish citizenship are contained in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  While the provisions of that Act have been amended on a number of occasions, in 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004, to take account of significant policy developments in the State, it is now timely to look again at those provisions having regard to our recent immigration experience.</P>
        <P>The review will consider a wide range of issues relating to the current statutory framework as well as other administrative arrangements in the granting of citizenship.  Among the issues to be considered are eligibility periods for naturalisation, appropriate language and integration tests, proposals for a citizenship ceremony, as well as methods by which the current application procedures can be improved upon.  Many countries have adopted integration, culture and language tests along with a number of other concepts such as earned citizenship in conjunction with longer residency requirements.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, which is currently before the House, contains significant proposals which will streamline and overhaul our immigration legislation.  It will therefore be necessary to ensure that any new <Col N="940"/>proposals on citizenship link with the policies outlined in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>I expect to publish the review in 2010 and the review will be subject to public consultation before final proposals are published.  In conducting a review of our citizenship requirements it must be remembered that the granting of an Irish citizenship application by the State is a privilege for its recipient, not an entitlement.  It cannot be regarded as being automatically awarded to applicants who have simply been lawfully resident in the State for a specified length of time.  On the contrary, naturalisation should be seen as a major and mutual commitment by the prospective citizen and the State.  It is entirely appropriate in those circumstances that the State should require that the applicant demonstrate a real commitment to the nation.  It is with this overarching principle in mind that the review is being conducted.</P>
        <P>For clarity, the refusal figure quoted by the Deputy includes applications that were ineligible/invalid.  The percentage of applicants who were refused a certificate of naturalisation in 2008 was 9%.  In terms of efficiency, the average processing time has been reduced from 30 months to 24 months during a period of rapid growth in the volume of applications received. I am assured by my officials that all the procedures involved in processing an application are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are conducted as efficiently as possible. A number of refinements have been introduced this year.  These include conducting identity checking and application quality assessment at the initial processing stage and giving the applicant feedback on the initial assessment within a week of receipt of the application.</P>

	<P>I am very aware of the concerns of victims of crime and addressing those concerns is one of my priority objectives.  Very shortly after my appointment to this post I established a dedicated Victims of Crime Office within my Department with a view to better coordination and delivery of services to victims. The Office works closely with groups representing victims of crime. </P>
        <P>The establishment of the Office was part of my <i>Justice for Victims</i> initiative.  The <i>Initiative </i>also includes making important legislative changes; those changes are contained in the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009.  That Bill was presented to the Seanad on 21 May 2009 and completed Second Stage on 10 June 2009.  I expect that Committee Stage will be scheduled soon. It is my aim to have the Bill enacted before the end of the year.  The Bill updates and expands the arrangements for victim impact statements and provides for three sets of circumstances where acquitted persons may be re-tried, including situations where new and compelling evidence emerges. The Bill will also contain provisions that will protect the good name of victims who have died or are seriously incapacitated from attacks on their character by the accused.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I, as Minister, have no function in relation to the prosecution of offences, that is the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions who is independent in the discharge of his functions.</P>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  Representations were submitted by the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was subsequently notified of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The first named person concerned applied for asylum on 22 October 2001. Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 October 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should not have a Deportation Order made against her.</P>
        <P>Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted. On 10 September 2003, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned. This Order was served by registered letter dated 30 October 2003 which placed a legal requirement on the person concerned to present herself at Ennis Garda Station, Ennis, County Clare on Thursday 6 November 2003 in order to make arrangements for her removal from the State. The person concerned &rsquo;presented&rsquo; as required and was given three further presentation dates which she kept. According to our records, she last &rsquo;presented&rsquo; on 13 January 2004. She has not &rsquo;presented&rsquo; since that date and is therefore classified as evading her deportation. This being the case, she is liable to arrest and detention for the purposes of effecting her deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>By correspondence dated 16 January 2007, the first named person concerned sought permission to make an application for Subsidiary Protection. Following consideration of the case made, the request was refused because the first named person concerned was the subject of a Deportation Order. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 5 February 2007.  The first named person concerned remains the subject of a Deportation Order and the enforcement of that Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>With regard to the second named person concerned, it is not the practice to comment on individual asylum applications where a final decision has not been made.  As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted or refused.</P>
        <P>The third named person concerned applied for asylum on 28 June 2002. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 13 June 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making rep<Col N="946"/>resentations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should not have a Deportation Order made against her.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted. On 10 September 2003, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the third named person concerned. This Order was served by registered letter dated 30 October 2003 which placed a legal requirement on the third named person concerned to present herself at Ennis Garda Station, Ennis, County Clare on Thursday 6 November 2003 in order to make arrangements for her removal from the State. The person concerned &rsquo;presented&rsquo; as required and was given three further presentation dates which she kept. According to our records, she last &rsquo;presented&rsquo; on 13 January 2004. She has not &rsquo;presented&rsquo; since that date and is therefore classified as evading her deportation. This being the case, she is liable to arrest and detention for the purposes of effecting her deportation from the State.  The third named person concerned remains the subject of a Deportation Order and the enforcement of that Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>In light of the above, the Deputy will appreciate that there are no residency issues outstanding in the context of the first and third named persons concerned while the position in the State of the second named person concerned remains to be determined. My Department has no record of the fourth named person concerned.</P>

	<P>The visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Abuja on 14 August 2009.  It was refused by the Visa Officer on the 1 September 2009 for the following reasons:</P>
        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />It is not the general policy to grant a visa to dependent family members who are not spouses or children of persons granted residency in the State.  The case was fully examined and there were no compelling grounds shown as to why an exception to this policy should be made;</P>
      <P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />The Visa Officer was not satisfied as to the authenticity of certain documents submitted, in this case the birth certificate;</P>
      <P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />There were inconsistencies in the information supplied, this is linked to the above refusal reason;</P>
       <P el="5">4. <Miles com="ix" />There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application in that there was no P60 provided.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is open to the person concerned to submit an appeal within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before the 1 November 2009.  Where doing so the applicant should be in a position to address the concerns of the Visa Officer.</P>

	<P>The first person concerned arrived in the state with her two children in November 2007 and they made an application for asylum on the 27th November 2007. The application for refugee status was refused following consideration of the case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 6th March 2009, that I proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. The letter also informed her of the three options now open to her, one being to make written representations setting out reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the state. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the state in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The second person concerned was born in the State on the 4th January 2008 and is the infant daughter of the first person concerned. On the 23rd January 2008, an application for asylum was made on her behalf by her mother. This application was refused following consideration of the case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 6th March 2009, that I proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. The letter also informed her of the three options now open to her, one being to make written representations to myself setting out reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the state. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the state in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The people concerned submitted representations for Leave to Remain and Subsidiary Protection dated 6th April 2009 to my Department. The application for Subsidiary Protection was considered and refused by my Department on the 20th May 2009. An examination of the file under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 was then compiled and the file was forwarded to myself recommending Deportation on the 20th May 2009. I considered all aspects of the files and made Deportation Orders in respect of the people concerned on the 27th May 2009.</P>
        <P>The persons concerned have instituted Judicial Review proceedings on the 15th June 2009 challenging the refusal to grant Subsidiary Protection and seeking to quash the Deportation Orders made in respect of them. Accordingly, this case is sub judice and I do not propose to comment further.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the budget for overseas aid has been cut by 21.8%; if there is a link between aid and national income; if so, the reason there has to be a cut and if it is proportionate. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2008, Ireland spent &euro;920 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA).  This represented approximately 0.59 % of our Gross National Product (GNP) and maintains Ireland&rsquo;s position as one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.  For 2009, the total <Col N="951"/>budget for ODA is expected to reach at least &euro;696 million.  Based on current projections this will represent at least 0.48% of GNP.  The Government fully recognises that the reduction in the 2009 ODA budget was significant.  However it follows a period of unprecedented growth.  At the start of this decade, Ireland&rsquo;s ODA stood at &euro;254 million &mdash; by 2008 it had reached &euro;920 million, more than trebling in volume.  In the same period, our percentage share of GNP spent on development assistance increased from 0.30% to 0.59% &mdash; effectively doubling.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the 2009 ODA budget was a necessary but regrettable decision that was made solely in the context of the exceptional economic situation currently facing the country.  Its core objective is to assist in stabilising the public finances in order to establish a solid platform for renewed economic growth.  The Government is firmly of the view that this is the only secure and sustainable way for Ireland to meet its commitments to ODA.  The Government has a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012.  This percentage is a UN established target and is the internationally recognised measure of a country&rsquo;s commitment to ODA.  Ireland is significantly ahead of most EU donor countries in achieving this percentage &ndash; Ireland was ranked sixth in 2008.  This ranking is likely to be maintained in 2009.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless the Government is fully aware that achieving the target by 2012 will be a challenge in the current difficult economic circumstances.  During the estimates process for 2010 which is currently under way, the Government will make a comprehensive assessment of our capacity to achieve this target.  Finally, I would point out that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the best in the world.  Our peers in the OECD have described it as &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo;.  I can assure the Deputy that this quality will be maintained while we continue to ensure maximum value for taxpayers&rsquo; money in our aid programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On 25 May 2009 my Department informed Galway County Council that a grant capped at &euro;1.7m had been allocated under the Department&rsquo;s Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme towards the construction of a pool at Loughrea.</P>
        <P>At this stage it is for Galway County Council in consultation with the developer to make progress in moving the project on.  However, I understand that Galway County Council wrote to the developer setting out the Department&rsquo;s Terms and conditions, on receipt of same, and requested him to confirm that he could comply with those elements, which were relevant to him.  The developer has informed Galway County Council that he has spent considerable time over the past few months progressing the project and working through the detailed requirements including taking advice on operational requirements which need to be factored in at this stage.  It is expected that agreement on the Terms and Conditions and progression towards construction stage will be significantly advanced in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>Waterways Ireland is responsible for the matter raised by the Deputy and I understand that it has responded to the correspondence concerned.  I am informed by Waterways Ireland that it is at present finalising a draft policy that will determine the future manner of regulation and management in relation to this issue and that Shannon Harbour is under consideration as a pilot location in this context.</P>
        <P>With regard to the location referred to particularly in the correspondence supplied by the Deputy, I am advised that boat access to that location for mooring purposes is suspended at present, due to a number of ongoing and planned major infrastructural improvements, including structural repairs and the extension of a surface water outfall pipeline through the area by the local authority.  I am further advised that further progress in regard to the issue raised by the Deputy will not be possible until the works in question have been completed and the appropriate planning approvals received.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, as with many Government Programmes and initiatives, the economic realities reflected in the Supplementary Budget allocations in April 2009 inevitably mean that the amount of funding available for the Community Development Programme is considerably less than in recent years.  My Department is aware that this presents significant challenges for Community Development Projects.  The revised allocation for the Community Development Programme for 2009 is &euro;20.9m.  It is a matter for the boards of the projects to decide how best to operate with reduced budgets.  I am not in a position to review the 2009 allocations to Community Development Projects.</P>

Under the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 Axis 3 and 4(LEADER), funding is available under the Basic Services for the economy and rural population measure, which includes general community and recreational infrastructure.  All applications for such funding should be made directly to the relevant Local Action Group.

	<P>Local Offices notify claimants up to 13 weeks in advance of the expiry date of their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit entitlement.  The person may then make an application for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is a means tested payment.  If they do not qualify for this payment they may continue to sign-on for jobseeker&rsquo;s credits to preserve the continuity of their insurance and to protect their entitlement to benefits and pensions in the future.  The Department has introduced a more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance when their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit expires and the department plans to further enhance this process later this year.</P>
        <P>The average processing times for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims decided in September was 7.53 weeks.  Over 60% of local offices are achieving shorter processing time.  I know that some offices are performing less well and the Department is making every effort to improve processing times generally at these offices thereby eliminating the possibility of a delay in payment in the transition from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on any social welfare claim may apply to their local Community Welfare Officer for supplementary welfare allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of different scenarios in relation to entitlement to a social welfare payment, including the rate of the relevant payment, for people participating in a Community Employment scheme. In the first instance, such participants are not eligible to receive either jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit. In the case of other social assistance payments, the Community Employment payment is assessed as earnings and the earnings disregard and tapering arrangements which relate to a particular scheme are applied. One parent family payment and disability allowance are the two main social assistance schemes whose recipients participate in Community Employment. </P>
        <P>In the case of one-parent family payment, the first &euro;146.50 per week of employment income is disregarded in full and half of any balance between that and &euro;425 per week is also disregarded. For example, a lone parent with one child who receives &euro;254.70 per week on a Community Employment scheme (&euro;228.70 plus &euro;26 child allowance) is regarded as having means of &euro;54.10 for one-parent family payment and consequently, receives &euro;182.80 per week in one-parent family payment (as opposed to the maximum rate of &euro;230.30) in addition to the &euro;254.70 from Community Employment, bringing the total income to &euro;437.50.</P>
        <P>In the case of disability allowance, the first &euro;120 per week of the Community Employment Payment is disregarded and the balance up to a ceiling of &euro;350 per week is assessed at 50%. For example, a single disability allowance recipient receiving &euro;228.70 per week on a Community Employment scheme is regarded as having means of &euro;54.35 per week and, consequently, <Col N="957"/>receives &euro;151.80 per week in disability allowance (as opposed to the maximum rate of &euro;204.30). This is in addition to the &euro;228.70 from Community Employment, bringing the total paid to &euro;380.50.</P>
        <P>Given that the level of a Community Employment payment depends on the family composition of the participant, the precise level of reduction in entitlement will vary in the case of social assistance schemes generally.  Persons in receipt of illness benefit and invalidity pension may participate in Community Employment, subject to the approval of my Department that the work involved is therapeutic and rehabilitative. In such cases they continue to receive their social insurance payment at its full normal level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 to 250, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The legislation covering the Social Insurance Fund established a tripartite funding arrangement with the Exchequer acting as a residual financier to contributions from employees and employers. It has never been envisaged that the fund would ever have to operate solely on the basis of being in surplus on foot of contributions from employees and employers.  In fact Exchequer contributions to cover funding shortfalls from the other two sources have been the norm since the establishment of the SIF. For example the State contribution to benefits paid from the fund was 38% in 1967 and almost 29% in 1985.</P>
        <P>Only since 1996 has the fund been in surplus as a result of contributions from employers and employees. During 2008 the fund experienced a deficit on a current basis and the excess of outgoings over expenditure is being met at present from the accrued surplus.  The approaches to the current and future deficits are matters for the Government to consider in a budgetary context. The table provides data on social insurance income and expenditure.  The data for 2008 is provisional, pending completion of the audit of the Social Insurance Fund by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The estimated outturn for 2009 is based on provisional PRSI income and expenditure data to end July 2009 and predictions of likely trends to the end of year.</P><Col N="958"/>
        <P>Estimates as to the likely level of PRSI income future years and the likely impact on the Social Insurance Fund of both income and expenditure demands during this period is dependent on macro-economic data which will be updated by the Department of Finance in the run-up to the forth coming Budget.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under <Col N="959"/>66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.  The person concerned applied for Disability Allowance on 26 May 2009.  His claim was assessed by a Medical Assessor on 23 September 2009 and he was deemed not medically suitable for Disability Allowance.  Further medical evidence was received from the person&rsquo;s doctor and this was reviewed by a Medical Assessor on 12 October 2009 who deemed that he was medically suitable for Disability Allowance.</P>
        <P>The person concerned&rsquo;s file was forwarded to a Social Welfare Inspector in order to determine his weekly means.  The Inspector called to his address on 26 August 2009 and 6 September 2009 but he was not at home.  An appointment was made for him to call to the Social Welfare Inspector&rsquo;s office in Newbridge on 9 October 2009 but the applicant was unable to attend due to illness.  The Social Welfare Inspector will be in contact with him shortly to arrange another appointment.  A decision on the Disability Allowance claim will be given upon receipt of the Social Welfare Inspector&rsquo;s report and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.</P>
        <P>The age profile of personnel recruited for general service into the Defence Forces in 2009 and over the past 10 years is presented in the attached Tabular Statement.  The number of personnel recruited for general service in each of the past 10 years is also attached in Tabular Statement.  The 2000 White Paper on Defence and the earlier Defence Force Review Implementation Plan (DFRIP) both identified the requirement to address the high age profile in the Defence Forces.  The key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness.  This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the military authorities that the strength of the Defence Forces at 30 September 2009, the last date for which figures are available is 10,081.  I am keenly aware of the impact that measures such as the moratorium on recruitment, promotion and acting appointments are having on the Permanent Defence Forces in light of the very high turnover rate that is part of any military organisation.  My focus is on retaining the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles. T his will represent a significant challenge in the coming months. I am in contact with my colleague the Minister for Finance with regard to targeted exemptions from the moratorium.  I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas.</P>

	<P>The strength of the Army for each of the past ten years and as of 30 September 2009 is set out in the following tabular statement.  This statement also provides figures for the Air Corps and the Naval Service for the same period.  The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.  I am advised by the military authorities that on 30 September 2009, the most recent date for which figures are available, the actual total of the Permanent Defence Force was 10,081 comprising 812 Air Corps, 1,038 Naval Service and 8,231 Army personnel. </P>
        <P>In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment was suspended.  My focus at this point in time is on ensuring that the Defence Forces retain operational capability.  I am acutely aware of the impact of the moratorium on the permanent Defence Force particularly in light of the very high turnover rate that is part of any military organisation.  I am in ongoing contact with my colleague, the Minister for Finance regarding limited exceptions to the moratorium which are targeted at maintaining the operational capability and command arrangements of the Permanent Defence Force.  I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas.</P>

	<P>Ireland has participated in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force.  Since then, the Government has reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF.  Continued participation in overseas missions is considered in the context of the viability of the operation, the threat assessment, existing Defence Forces commitments, the costs involved, the benefit of the operation to the Defence Forces and Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests, in particular in relation to the maintenance of international peace and security.  While there are no plans at this time to withdraw from the mission in Afghanistan, continued participation will be reviewed again in the context of the estimates and available resources. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
        <P>The Air Corps helicopter fleet comprises two light utility EC135 helicopters and six utility AW139 helicopters.  The Dauphin helicopters were withdrawn from Air Corps service in January 2006, and the Alouette fleet was withdrawn in September 2007.  The helicopters are operated by the Air Corps in a general purpose military operational and training role.  Primary taskings include security, aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport.  They are also used to perform air ambulance, non-maritime search and rescue, aid to the civil authorities, community support and ministerial and VIP air transport tasks.</P><Col N="963"/>
        <P>Helicopters are used from time to time for ministerial air transport in situations where, for operational reasons, fixed wing aircraft may not be available, the point of destination may not be close to an airport and in circumstances where there is a requirement for greater flexibility than can be delivered by fixed wing aircraft.  In 2008, ministerial transport represented approximately 5% of total helicopter flying hours.</P>
        <P>Approval for the use of Air Corps helicopters for ministerial transport is a matter for the Taoiseach, providing the helicopters are available and have not been otherwise tasked in their military role.  Guidelines regarding the use of the Ministerial Air Transport Service are set out in the Cabinet Handbook.  The guidelines specify that requests for the use of the service should be made to the Taoiseach in respect of every mission, giving details of the justifying need, the destination, route, timings, passenger details and purpose of travel.</P>
        <P>Details regarding the number of times Air Corps helicopters have been used for ministerial or related transport in the past five years are listed in the following tabular statements, including the date of each trip, the helicopter type tasked, the ministerial time on board and the requesting Minister.  Each trip was in the conduct of official engagements and had the prior approval of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>I have availed of Air Corps helicopters for transport in connection with my ministerial duties, most recently in November 2008.  With regard to the cost, the Department of Defence follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings:  the direct cost, i.e. the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown including maintenance, fuel and support services; and the total cost, i.e. the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft, i.e. depreciation and personnel costs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that the costs associated with having the aircraft, which are costs arising for having aircraft available for their primary taskings in their military operational and training roles, arise regardless of whether or not the aircraft is tasked with ministerial transport.  The current rates per hour used to establish these costs in relation to helicopters are also set out in the following tabular statements.  The costs are an approximation to actual costs.</P>

        <Quest> the progress local government has had in increasing housing supply via leasing; the estimated cost to the State over a 20 year period; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>To date, my Department has issued funding approval in respect of some 842 properties under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative.  In addition, a further 367 units have received provisional approval subject to additional information being provided to and reviewed by my Department.  This gives a total of 1,209 properties that have received approval this year.  There are also a number of other new leasing proposals currently being assessed to determine their suitability for inclusion under the initiative.  </P>
        <P>To support this new initiative, &euro;20 million has been set aside by my Department in 2009 to facilitate the leasing of at least 2,000 units.  However, the cost of the scheme in future years will be determined by the number of homes leased, the rental payments involved, and the length of time for which leases are procured.  From a value for money perspective, there is a clear benefit to the State, particularly in light of the current constraints on the public finances, in entering into such lease agreements as a greater number of units can be provided to house<Col N="967"/>holds in need than could otherwise be provided through more traditional supply mechanisms such as construction or acquisition.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if he will correct the anomaly under section 4(6)(a) of the Local Government Charges Act 2009, whereby an arbitrary two kilometres governs the liability for the charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36015/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has decided to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing this charge on all non-principal private residences, including private rented accommodation, holiday homes and any other residential property that is not the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence.  The charge has been set at &euro;200 per annum.  The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which sets out the detail of the charge, is premised on a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge.  It exempts certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.</P>
        <P>Section 4(6) of the Act includes an exemption for property in which a relative of the owner is living rent-free, as long as that residence is on the same property or within two kilometres of the owner&rsquo;s main residence.  This provision was intended principally to cater for situations in which accommodation might be provided for an elderly parent by a son or daughter, and follows precedent from Revenue legislation dealing with the home carer tax credit.</P>

	<P>Having regard to the existing high level of commitments under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), it is not possible to approve the funding application submitted by South Tipperary County Council at this time. The application will be considered in the light of the Estimates provision for the CLSS in 2010, social housing needs locally and the potential for market based social housing delivery mechanisms such as long-term leasing and the rental accommodation scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary purpose of the levy on plastic bags is not to generate revenue but to change consumer behaviour and maintain the significant reduction in the consumption of plastic bags, <Col N="969"/>dispensed at retail outlets, that was achieved when the levy was first introduced in 2002.  To this end, I am bringing forward legislation that will provide for greater flexibility in amending the level of charge as circumstances require.  While the provisions of the proposed legislation will allow for greater increases in the level of charge any amendment will have regard to both the level of plastic bag usage and changes in the consumer price index.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis has been carried out in respect of this proposed legislation and my Department is in regular contact with the various stakeholders having an interest in the operation of this economic instrument.</P>
        <P>The amounts received from the Plastic Bag Levy for each year since its introduction in March 2002 are set out in the tabular statement below.  Details of levies received are published in the Environment Fund Annual Accounts.  Copies of the Environment Fund&rsquo;s Annual Accounts up to and including 2007 are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The 2008 Annual Accounts will be lodged in the Oireachtas Library in due course after they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System is used to measure the impact of the plastic bag levy on an ongoing basis and my Department also studies the receipts from the plastic bag levy to monitor trends in the average per capita consumption of plastic bags.  These data will be used to ensure that the plastic bag levy is set at an appropriate level.  Future revenues will be largely determined by the usage of plastic bags by the public.  I would welcome a reduction in receipts in future years as this would demonstrate that the proposed legislation has succeeded in its aim of reducing plastic bag usage.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 967 of 6 October 2009, the number of rental subsidy recipients who have been transferred by Kildare County Council to the rental accommodation scheme since 1 January 2009 to date in 2009; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, while the RAS does not preclude applicants who are in part-time employment, the <i>de facto</i> situation in County Kildare is that such applicants are precluded by Kildare County Council, who have adopted a policy of offering RAS accommodation exclusively to persons in receipt of the maximum level of rent supplement, therefore excluding everyone in part-time employment; if he is satisfied that this national scheme should be implemented in such a limited fashion; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the period January to end of August 2009, Kildare County Council have transferred 60 households from rent supplement to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) or other forms of social housing, with a total of 692 households transferred since the commencement of the scheme in 2005.</P>
        <P>The qualifying criteria for RAS are that a household must be in receipt of rent supplement, usually for 18 months or more and have a long term housing need. Households in part-time employment or households not in receipt of the maximum level of rent supplement are not precluded from the scheme.  It is not national policy that such households would be delayed or deferred from transfer to the scheme on the basis of the amount of rent supplement they receive. Indeed, my Department has over the past number of years introduced a flexible financial model for RAS, to ensure that households such as this could be transferred to the scheme.  While it is a matter for each individual authority to manage the transfer of rent supplement households to RAS, the Council has advised that they are implementing the scheme in accordance with national policy and that they will not exclude persons from the scheme who are in part-time employment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 275 and 276 together.</P>
        <P>The monitoring, assessment and management of ambient air quality in Ireland is carried out according to the requirements of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive.  This Directive became law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations, 1999.  Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants; sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead  (2002); carbon monoxide and benzene (2002); ozone (2004); and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009).</P>
        <P>Where the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the EPA, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants.  The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants through its website:http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/.  My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.</P>
        <P>The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report on Air Quality in Ireland 2008 (September 2009).  This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2008 based on data from 30 monitoring stations.  In addition there were a further 18 monitoring stations operated by local authorities to measure black smoke.  The Report did not identify any area in the country where ambient air quality is under threat and confirmed that Ireland is fully compliant with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants.</P>
        <P>As part of a commitment on monitoring air quality made under the 2007 Programme for Government my Department requested the EPA to undertake an overall review of the adequacy of the air quality monitoring network in light of population change in urban areas.  The review has now been completed and a report of its findings is currently being finalised by the EPA.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 288 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government published in 2007 contained a commitment to establish new ambitious waste management targets for maximum prevention, re-use, recycling and modern waste treatment to ensure that we match the best performance in the EU for recycling with the objective that only 10% of waste or less is consigned to landfill and to ensure that the landfills currently provided for under regional waste management plans should be the last to be constructed for a generation. The reviewed Programme for Government underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that Ireland reaches its ambitious targets in waste management.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Programme contained a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and act on its conclusions.  This review is currently underway and a significant milestone was reached last week when consultants delivered a major international report on waste management policy. My Department is currently examining this report and its recommendations which will be central to informing what further measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste management services, whether delivered by the private or public sectors.  Ireland must also meet challenging targets under the EU Landfill Directive for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>Following extensive consultation, the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006 and is aimed at diverting 80% of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill through segregated collection and the generation of compost.  I have also indicated my <Col N="977"/>intention to introduce primary legislation to allow significant increases in the landfill levy.  My Department, in addition, has initiated a public consultation on a Statutory Instrument which will require the source segregation and appropriate treatment of food waste arising from commercial premises.</P>
        <P>Last year, I issued a circular to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins and promote the use of home composting and the National Waste Report 2007 indicates increased quantities are being dealt with by home composting.  I am confident that all of the above measures will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill and a reduction in our overall use of landfill.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government had decided not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland. Since then, a process has been put in place to address the issues that arise from the decision. An Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by my Department, has been established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the  equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  The first meeting of the Task Force was in July 2009.</P>
        <P>In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with  environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is underway to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.</P>
        <P>In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified  by Returning Officers for this purpose.  It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.</P>

	<P>Regulations made under the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003 established requirements for local authorities to ensure that information regarding local authority activities is provided to members of the Oireachtas. These include: the local authority budget, draft development plan etc. It is a matter for each local authority to deal with requests for access to information by a parliamentary representative as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with a proper level of customer service. In this regard local authorities are required to put in place arrangements to ensure that systems, procedures and time frames equivalent to those used by them in relation to correspondence from local authority members also apply in respect of parliamentary representatives.</P>
        <P>My Department has gathered information from local authorities on a periodic basis, most recently in March 2009, on the practical application of the arrangements established by the above Regulations. Based on the information received, I understand that local authorities are generally complying with these arrangements.  However, I will continue to monitor their operation.</P>

	<P>Section 10(8) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 already contains a provision to the effect that there should be no presumption in law that any land zoned in a particular development plan should remain so zoned in any subsequent development plan. The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill makes no change to this provision. </P>
        <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 146 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 will address land use zoning reform through requiring an evidence-based core strategy in development plans which must provide information on how the plan and the housing strategy are consistent with regional planning guidelines and with the National Spatial Strategy.  The core strategy will outline the location, quantum, and phasing of proposed development over the period of the plan as well as details of transport plans and retail development and proposals for development in rural areas where appropriate.  This more strategic approach to zoning should facilitate development to take place in a phased and sequential manner and will enable the State to coordinate and deliver the necessary infrastructure and services with much greater certainty and more efficiency.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Development Plan Guidelines (2007) already clearly state that, in setting objectives for the zoning of land, an appropriate balance needs to be struck between:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />making sure that enough land is zoned to meet the anticipated economic and social development needs and to allow for an element of choice over the plan period and for a reasonable period (e.g. 3 years) beyond, and</P><Col N="979"/>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />avoiding the zoning of too much land, thereby creating a situation where priorities for development are not clear and where as a result it is difficult to secure an orderly and progressive approach to the development of that area, particularly in the provision of essential infrastructure and services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system.  The draft guidelines provide that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly flood plains, should be avoided unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a sequential approach must be adopted to flood risk management when assessing the location of new development based on avoidance, reduction and mitigation of flood risk; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />flood risk assessment must be incorporated into the process of making decisions on planning applications and planning appeals.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Therefore, the draft guidelines provide the basis for planning authorities to identify, assess and take appropriate steps to manage flood risk in a sustainable manner.  The draft guidelines are being finalised by my Department, in conjunction with the OPW, having regard to the submissions received on foot of a public consultation process, and I expect to issue finalised statutory guidance very shortly.</P>
        <P>In addition, where my Department provides funding for local authority sewerage schemes in urban areas, these schemes may, on occasion, provide limited measures to prevent flooding where inadequate collection networks exist.  These schemes may also provide storm water drains and outfalls, to facilitate the separation of foul and surface water, to create additional capacity within existing combined systems.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to developing both domestic and commercial scale renewable technologies and has introduced a range of measures designed to increase market penetration of renewable energy in the heat, transport and electricity sectors.  The grant programmes are not specific to any one county but are open to anyone who can fulfil the required criteria. The Deputy will also be aware that the another project in the same Local Authority Area, Cloughjordan Eco Village, has been in receipt of funding under both the House of Tomorrow Programme and the general Renewable Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Programme.</P>
        <P>The programme aimed at domestic renewable heating is the Greener Homes Scheme (GHS), which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), and provides grant support to individuals wishing to install renewable energy heating technologies in their homes.  This scheme, in operation since early 2006, has already established a very strong supply industry for renewable energy products, services and fuels while the application of strict product standards and installer training and quality schemes has ensured that consumers are informed in relation to their choices.  All installers must be registered with SEI, be qualified and certified in each technology that they are registered in and have achieved certification from an accredited training course in each of the technology areas they wish to work in.</P>

        <P el="0">The capacity of a vessel which was lost at sea before the coming into operation of the Register set up by the 1989 Regulations will, as an entirely exceptional measure, be accepted as replacement capacity provided that the Department is fully satisfied, by reference to appropriate documentary evidence, that: (a) the applicant was the owner and skipper of a registered Irish sea boat which was lost at sea;   (b)   the boat in question was lost at sea after 1 January 1980 as a result of an accident, and that such loss has been verified by the emergency services or another independent source acceptable to the Department; (c)  the boat in question is shown, by reference to log sheet returns or other appropriate records, to have been in active and continuous use for a considerable period of years by the person concerned for sea fishing of a category now covered by the replacement policy rules, until its loss at sea; (d)  the lost vessel was the sole means (i.e. the only vessel) of the applicant for engaging in sea fishing; (e)  the applicant was unable, for verified financial or related reasons, to acquire a replacement vessel, or any other registered vessel, before the introduction of the new Register pursuant to the 1989 Regulations; (f)  the applicant has been unable also, for verified financial or related reasons, since the inception of the new registration system, to acquire a fishing vessel to engage in sea fishing of the same class or description as was carried out by the vessel lost at sea, or any other sea fishing vessel which is subject to the replacement policy regime; (g)   the applicant did not receive any financial benefit from the loss.</P>
        <P>The capacity of a fishing vessel lost at sea will be accepted as replacement capacity for licensing purposes only if it is to be used for the purposes of sustaining or maintaining a family tradition of sea fishing.  Any capacity accepted as replacement capacity must, therefore, be used for the purposes of introducing a replacement for the lost vessel which will be owned and skippered by the applicant or by an immediate relation of the applicant.  Any capacity from a lost vessel so used may not be sold or otherwise disposed of.</P>

	<P>On 15 July last, the Government approved my plan for a reorganisation of my Department&rsquo;s Local Office Network.  The plan involves reducing from 57 to 16 the number of offices from which the Department will operate District Veterinary, Forestry and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services in the future.  This will result in a reduction of some 400 in the number of staff working in my Department and yield significant savings for the exchequer.  As part of this overall reorganisation 74 staff will be relocated to Mellows College, Athenry and three offices currently occupied by the Department in County Galway will be closed.  Apart from furnishing and minor costs associated with the transfer of files, etc., there are minimal other costs associated with the move from Dockgate Centre, Galway to Mellows College, Athenry.  There are no costs associated with the cessation of the existing facilities at Dockgate Centre as the Office of Public Works has identified an alternative use for that premises.  While this reorganisation will yield significant savings for the Exchequer, no staff will be made redundant.</P>

A vibrant responsive higher education system will be crucially important in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s future development and the strategy group is cognisant of the need to fully engage with all stakeholders in the sector and wider society.  A first round of consultation was completed in the summer under which an open call for written submissions elicited a significant and valuable response.  More than 100 submissions were received and are available on the HEA website, <i>www.hea.ie</i>.  I understand that the group is planning to undertake additional detailed consultations to fully inform the development of the new strategy.  I expect that the overall process of finalising the strategy report will be completed early in the new year.</P>

	<P>A major capital project for the school to which the Deputy refers is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  The proposed project will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2010 and subsequent years.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.  Earlier this year, the school made two applications to my Department for the replacement of boilers, the replacement of windows and the insulation of a technical graphics room.  Both applications were approved and the school has since drawn down funding in respect of these works.  An application under the summer works scheme 2009 for an intercom system was also approved.</P>

	<P>While my Department has no record of an application for emergency funding from the school to which the Deputy refers, the school made an application for funding to my Department under its temporary accommodation scheme.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that funding has been approved for the school under this scheme to either purchase or build two 80 sq. m. classrooms.  This will allow the school to replace existing prefabs and to re-configure the use of its existing mainstream accommodation.  The school will receive a formal letter of approval shortly.  The school can apply for summer works scheme funding to carry out improvement works to its permanent structure when the scheme for 2010 is announced later this year.</P>

	<P>Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the day-to-day operation of school transport services throughout the country.  This is a complex national operation operating during each school year supporting in the region of 75,000 post primary pupils, 52,000 primary and 8,000 special needs pupils.  The majority of pupils are allocated a reserved seat on a dedicated contracted service with approximately 9,000 pupils, generally residing in urban areas and environs, using regular public transport services where these exist.  A separate payment is made by the Department in respect of those pupils travelling on such regular transport services.</P><Col N="988"/>
        <P>Children travelling under the school transport scheme on either dedicated school transport services or general public scheduled services are provided with seats to and from schools.  This arrangement enables children to attend classes during normal school hours.  A school transport ticket is not a general commuter ticket that is valid on all regular public transport services at all times and it is not offered as such. Given the numbers being transported nationally, it would not be possible without incurring additional expenditure to offer the flexibility to all eligible pupils to travel on the regular public transport services, other than in accordance with the terms specified on their tickets.</P>

It is open to unemployed people to apply for places on further and higher education programmes.  In addition, since the beginning of the year the Government has launched a number of new initiatives to support unemployed people return to education and engage in upskilling.  In the further education sector, the Government has provided an additional 1,500 PLC places, bringing the total number of PLC places to 31,688 nationwide.  In the higher education sector 2,500 places have been provided on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses for people who are unemployed.  This scheme is open to people who have been on the Live Register for at least six months or who have been awarded statutory redundancy and participants are entitled to retain their social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Other initiatives in the higher education sector include 280 places on a range of newly developed accelerated Level 6 Certificate programmes and over 900 places on a range of newly developed part-time transition programmes.  The accelerated and transition courses were targeted specifically at unemployed people and the institutes of technology that were running the programmes worked closely with local F&Aacute;S and Department of Social and Family Affairs offices both in terms of marketing the courses and advising participants of their entitlements in relation to social welfare payments.  Up to 700 additional training places are also being made available for redundant apprentices under a new Redundant Apprentice Institute of Technology Training Scheme.
