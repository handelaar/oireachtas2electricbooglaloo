	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Planned expenditure levels for my Department and the associated offices in my Vote group will be considered as part of the 2010 Estimates and budgetary process.  The report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes will be considered.  Decisions on all issues arising from that report will be a matter for the Government.  While the Estimates process is ongoing, I assure the House that my Department and the associated offices will play their part in achieving the overall expenditure reductions required by the Government.  In that context, separate programme funding for the work of the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership and the Taskforce on Active Citizenship will cease in 2010.  The future work of those bodies will be supported by existing staff in my Department.  The separate offices in these areas have been discontinued, which will give rise to significant savings on my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The National Forum on Europe has been discontinued, which will also give rise to significant savings.  When the budgetary process for 2010 has been completed by the Government, I antici<Col N="3"/>pate that significant additional savings will be achieved in my Department, the National Economic and Social Development Office and the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <P>There has been a reduction in staff numbers in all Departments and offices as a result of Government policies that have been introduced since the economic crisis began.  In the case of my Department, I anticipate that the number of core Civil Service staff will fall by approximately 10% as a result of the various schemes introduced to date.  I am aware of particular pressures on demand-led areas of expenditure in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, which may make it difficult to achieve substantial reductions in expenditure in those areas.  In that regard, the House recently approved a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4 million for this year in respect of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As the Minister for Finance outlined in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate, it was financed from savings in my Department and the Central Statistics Office.  The need to continue to ensure sufficient funding for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor is to the fore in the current discussions on the 2010 Estimates.  I assure the House that my Department and the associated offices will make significant savings on expenditure in 2010.  This process will be managed in a way that minimises disruption to the valuable public services they provide.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment beyond that at this stage, pending the outcome of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to pursue the Taoiseach on some of the information he has given to the House.  Have the Taoiseach and his Department formed a finalised view on the implementation of the recommendations in the report of an bord snip nua that apply to the Department?  Given that four months have passed since the publication of the report, I presume its recommendations have been assessed.  It is a &ldquo;chicken and egg&rdquo; scenario, in the sense that it is not entirely clear whether the report of an bord snip nua reflects what the Department wants to do, or whether it is the other way around.  I assume the Taoiseach and his Department have formed a definitive view on which of the recommendations will be implemented.  The Taoiseach indicated some direction of thinking in the case of some of the bodies with regard to 2010.  He mentioned that the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership will be discontinued in 2010.  He referred to the National Forum on Europe, which has already been discontinued.  However, he did not comment on a number of other bodies under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, which were referred to in the report of an bord snip nua, including the National Economic and Social Forum and various partnership bodies.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention regarding those bodies in 2010?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to a 10% reduction in staff in his Department.  The reduction recommended in the report of an bord snip nua appears to be higher than this.  It refers to a reduction of 36 out of 237 staff in the Department of the Taoiseach and a total of 77 for the entire range of Departments and agencies under his remit.  Do I take it from what the Taoiseach is saying that the staff reductions will be lower than recommended in the report of an bord snip nua?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in my reply, these reports are being considered in the context of the Estimates process and political decisions.  We have indicated the savings we are seeking, namely, an adjustment of &euro;4 billion for next year.  The McCarthy report recommends a higher figure.  It is not a question of making all the cuts in 2010 but a matter of political consideration as to which savings or recommendations will be agreed upon as relevant in this instance.</P>
        <P>In the context of the adjustment that is to be made, my Department will make the necessary contribution in line with the ongoing political deliberations and considerations.  I have indicated some of the areas under review and where we are doing things differently already.  I do not wish to elaborate on that as it is a matter for the Government to sign off on these issues when <Col N="4"/>discussions are complete.  We will seek to make decisions in a way that meets the Government&rsquo;s objective of having every Department contribute towards the adjustment according to its means based on the size of its budget, and also in a way that will seek to minimise the impact on public services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government&rsquo;s position on the report of an bord snip nua?  Since it was published, the Taoiseach has maintained it will inform the Government&rsquo;s decisions in respect of the Estimates and the budget, yet individual Ministers have taken a pop at it as they have seen fit, including the T&aacute;naiste, who stated there was a lot in it that did not make sense.  Has the Government accepted the report?  Do I understand from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s last reply that the Government&rsquo;s intention is to implement the recommendations of the report, but not all in 2010?  Is it the case that the Taoiseach intends to implement some of the recommendations in 2010 and the remainder in the remaining years?  Has any decision been made to rule out or reject recommendations in the report?  Alternatively, are we to assume all the recommendations will be implemented incrementally and that we will be told what recommendations are to be implemented in the budget for 2010?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The report has been submitted to the Government.  It forms part of the considerations of the budgetary process.  This process is confidential until the Government makes its ultimate decisions.  The outcome of our deliberations will become clear when the budget is announced and the Estimates process is complete.  The deliberations are ongoing and there are bilateral discussions taking place as the Estimates process takes shape.  Progress is being made in this regard.  As with any other Government, including those supported in the past by Deputy Gilmore, the budgetary process remains part of the deliberative process until final decisions are taken.</P>
        <P>In a previous reply, I was simply making the point that the assumption the Deputy seemed to be making in his first supplementary question was that all the recommendations of the McCarthy report, which advocate cuts of &euro;5.4 billion, are about to be implemented.  That was an exercise conducted on behalf of the Minister for Finance and his Department by the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and its report is for consideration by the Government in the context of bilateral discussions taking place between the Department of Finance and other line Departments as we seek to identify the necessary expenditure savings that will be made.  Those discussions are ongoing and are taking place in the context of the budgetary and Estimates process.  How we intend to proceed will become very clear.  When the report came to Government, Ministers were invited to comment on it and to suggest savings either in line with the recommendations or by an alternative means.</P>
        <P>The bottom line is that an adjustment of &euro;4 billion will have to be made in the context of the budget, primarily on the expenditure side, as the Minister has indicated.  The preparation of the budget is an ongoing process.  The McCarthy report is helpful in the discussions that are taking place.  The ultimate decision has to be taken on the recommendations, on whether they are modified, adapted, changed or not to be proceeded with.  That is a matter for political decision by Government when the process is complete, which will be in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach become involved in the discussions between the Department of Finance and the various Departments on Colm McCarthy&rsquo;s report and its implications?  In particular, is the Taoiseach aware of the sense of anger and fear that has been created by that report?  Some have suggested the report has faded into the background and that he has done the Government&rsquo;s dirty work because he has delivered a report proposing massive cuts in public services and if one does not implement its recommendations, one can <Col N="5"/>say to the people, &ldquo;There you are; at least I didn&rsquo;t go as far as McCarthy, I am the best thing since sliced bread, or at least my Minister for Finance is.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">Key areas of the McCarthy report have not had much concentration to date.  I refer in particular to an area I know is close to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s heart, namely, molta&iacute; McCarthy i leith maoini&uacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  Nach bhfuil siadsan ag teacht salach ar an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag an Taoiseach nuair a thoghadh &eacute; ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, nuair a d&uacute;irt s&eacute; go mbeadh s&eacute; s&aacute;sta taca&iacute;ocht ioml&aacute;n a thabhairt don Ghaeilge?  An raibh aon chomhr&aacute;ite ag an Taoiseach leis an Aire &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v faoi impleachta&iacute; tuairisc McCarthy i leith athbheochan na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I said in an earlier reply to Deputy Gilmore, the McCarthy report was an examination of every area of current expenditure that was undertaken by a group of people, who were asked to do so by the Minister for Finance.  They duly reported.  It is now a matter for political decision by the Government what role and part that report will play in our final decisions relating to the adjustments that have to be made.  That is where that is at.  Those people undertook a job based on the terms of reference they got, they did that job, and I thank them for doing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Maidir leis an nGaeilge, agus sc&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; ann don Ghaeilge, ba cheart go mbeadh sc&eacute;imeanna r&eacute;ala&iacute;ocha againn &oacute; thaobh an &aacute;bhair sin mar gheall ar an fhadhb airgeadais at&aacute; i gceist go ginear&aacute;lta &oacute; thaobh airgeadais phoibl&iacute; sa t&iacute;r seo.

T&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sin ar si&uacute;l idir an tAire Airgeadais agus an t-Aire &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mar at&aacute; le gach Aire eile.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ar intinn againn taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht agus go mbeidh sc&eacute;imeanna r&eacute;ala&iacute;ocha againn mar gheall ar na polasaithe sin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Mas sin an c&aacute;s, n&iacute; bheidh deireadh leis an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta. M&aacute; t&aacute; muid chun cabhair a thabhairt don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht, cuireann s&eacute; isteach orm f&eacute;in mar ionada&iacute; poibl&iacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; ar &aacute;r gcumas faoi l&aacute;thair leabhair as Gaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhalta&iacute; sna me&aacute;nscoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.  We are still unable to provide up-to-date Irish books for students who pursue their courses through Irish.  It is an absolute disgrace that we cannot manage that in this day and age.  I simply make that point on foot of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh in respect of the Gaeltacht and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Public Service Modernisation Division has responsibility for promotion of the modernisation of the Civil and wider Public Service. . . . The Group observes that there is an overlap between the work of this division and the activities of the Public Service Modernisation Division in the Department of Finance . . .  The Group considers that responsibility for the implementation of public service modernisation decisions should be located in the Department of Finance given its mission to achieve greater efficiencies across the public service and its leading role in managing many of the recent important public service modernisation initiatives e.g. rationalisation of State agencies.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That has implications for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.  Arising from the report&rsquo;s observation that there is an overlap between the public service modernisation division and the Department of Finance, how does the Taoiseach envisage his Department being reformed to deal with what the report recommends in this regard?</P><Col N="6"/>
        <P>Second, does the Taoiseach agree with the statement made by the T&aacute;naiste, that many of the proposals in the McCarthy report make no sense at all?  She made that comment when speaking on behalf of the Government in the House.  Does he accept that comment?</P>
        <P>I understand there are 259 staff in the Department of the Taoiseach at present.  The Department of Finance has taken responsibility for economic affairs, social partnership has run into difficulties and Northern Ireland and European affairs are dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  What is the role of the Department of Finance in assigning people to areas where there are co-ordination, leadership and other responsibilities?  The Taoiseach said that the role of the Department of Finance does not rule out &ldquo;the need for us to assign people to these areas because we have co-ordinating, leadership and other responsibilities&rdquo;.  I accept that.  How does the Taoiseach envisage his Department fitting in with what the McCarthy report proposes?  Does it have relevance to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and does he still envisage the leadership, co-ordinating and other responsibilities his Department has continuing as heretofore?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy said, there are recommendations in the McCarthy report on that matter.  All these recommendations must be subject to political scrutiny and decisions will have to be taken on them.  Some are more urgent than others, while some are more important than others.  However, all of them must be considered on their merits.</P>
        <P>As I listened to the Deputy&rsquo;s supplementary question, I thought for a moment he was going to suggest that the Department of the Taoiseach should be got rid of altogether since it was not doing this, that and the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Others would, but I would not go that far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought: &ldquo;Surely to God he will not try to talk himself out of the only job that might be available to him.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No, just the incumbent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The co-ordinating role in the Department of the Taoiseach across a range of Government policies must continue.  The question of how we can do that most effectively and efficiently is the issue under consideration.  However, it does not absolve the Taoiseach of the responsibilities of the office or the Department of its efforts to service the requirements of a Taoiseach and ensure that it has the expertise and people available to assist the Taoiseach in reaching points of view and contributing to the debate that goes on across the Government on a range of issues.</P>
        <P>I have established a Cabinet committee on public service modernisation and transforming public services, and I chair that committee.  It is important that the authority of the Taoiseach be behind that effort.  It is an ongoing effort and it is part of the discussions that are taking place at present.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance has various responsibilities, including that which relates to the public service.  There would also be people attending to ensure that the overall co-ordinating role of the Department of the Taoiseach is understood, stated and seen in that context.</P>
        <P>People refer to overlaps, but there are complementary roles to be played here.  There is expertise in both Departments which must be used co-operatively on an ongoing basis in order that all the perspectives might be brought to bear in the context of how management can seek to advance the necessary agenda that is under discussion at present.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of public service numbers, there is currently a ban on recruitment in place and this is having an impact.  To what level will public service numbers be reduced in 2010?  Does the Taoiseach believe there is a role to be played by a voluntary redundancy scheme?  The HSE commented on this matter earlier in the year and my party put forward the view that up to 15,000 voluntary redundancies could be accommodated.  I am sure many Deputies have been in contact with people who have indicated to them that they would like to leave the public service now but that they cannot obtain sanction in respect of redundancy.  A flood of experienced people &mdash; garda&iacute;, nurses and others &mdash; are leaving the public service at present.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach have any information with regard to the status of the HSE&rsquo;s announcement some months ago in respect of voluntary redundancies?  People are extremely concerned &mdash; they have probably contacted the Taoiseach in this regard &mdash; about the possibility of their gratuities being taxed, which is adding to their concerns in respect of leaving the public service early.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated previously, it is unavoidable that there will be an adjustment in the public service pay bill, particularly as it forms such a large part of public expenditure.  At present, approximately 35% of day-to-day expenditure &mdash; &euro;20 billion per annum &mdash; relates to public sector pay and pensions.  The final decision on how the necessary reductions will be achieved is a matter for the Government to consider in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I must emphasise that progress in talks with the public service unions would be of great assistance to the Government in reaching its decisions.  During the past week there has been a series of meetings involving public service employers &mdash; led by the Department of Finance &mdash; and the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  In an effort to explore the possibility of savings in each part of the public service, a number of sectoral level meetings involving, for example, HSE management and the health unions, the Department of Education and Science and teachers&rsquo; unions, etc., have also taken place.  These meetings adjourned over the weekend in order to allow the parties involved to refine and cost options and will formally resume this afternoon.  Some sectoral level engagement did occur yesterday.</P>
        <P>In light of the level of detail required on a sector-by-sector basis and the complexity of assessing the impact of particular measures in calculating associated cost savings, it is expected that talks with the unions will continue &mdash; and, we hope, intensify &mdash; during the course of this week.  The examination of options and the costing exercise is without prejudice to agreement by either side, Government or trade union, as to the acceptability or adequacy of measures or proposals put forward.  We must all ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that measures to achieve the essential reduction in the pay bill will have the least possible impact on services to the public.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the talks is to explore the possibility of achieving the necessary reductions in the public service pay bill on an agreed basis.  The parties must be given the space to do that.  A range of options is being considered.  However, it would not be of assistance to go into further detail at this stage.  Time is short and the Government needs to see signs of progress this week, particularly in light of the comparatively short lead-in time to the December budget. </P>
           <P Just="Left">I wish to acknowledge that during the course of this year all public servants have been obliged to adjust to the fact that the pensions levy has been imposed by Government and come to terms with pay freezes, etc.  In many respects this is a difficult time for everyone in the public and private sectors, particularly in the context of their commitments.  The fact of the matter is that there exists an issue that must be dealt with.  In fairness, the interaction taking place is at the initiative of trade unions which suggest there are alternative means or measures that could <Col N="8"/>be considered in an effort to make the adjustment we deem to be necessary.  In this regard, people need to be given the time and space to consider all the issues in as wide and comprehensive a manner as is possible.  We will have to wait to see what emerges.  As I said, the process is without prejudice.  This is a complex area as people associated with the industrial relations area will be aware.  Sector by sector different issues in terms of the structures in pay scales arise.  We must allow people to engage in a constructive fashion to see, based on the realities that confront us all, how we can move forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department doing to co-ordinate the production of a new e-government strategy to take advantage of the cost savings that could be achieved in health care, education, social welfare delivery, perhaps, through working with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources?  More than 18 months ago, the Government agreed with the Fine Gael motion on the need for a new e-government strategy and the savings and efficiencies that could be achieved in this regard.  I understand the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department is co-ordinating that effort.</P>
        <P>An assurance was given at the time that a new e-government strategy would be published two months later but this was subsequently abandoned on the basis that it was being worked on.  We have seen nothing since then.  An opportunity exists, in the context of being forced to make savings, to introduce new measures that can utilise technology to try to save Government money and to provide people with services in their homes which they would otherwise have to travel to avail of.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Coveney that the situation confronting us makes it imperative that all initiatives, including the e-government initiative, form the basis of a broader agreement on how we can provide more efficient and effective public services in the future.  It is true that there is a need to utilise technology in a way that will deliver services that are more customer oriented and citizen focused while at the same time ensuring those areas of the public service where personal interaction between the service provider and the person requiring the service is maintained.  There are applications where technology can apply that will bring important savings.  We are committed to doing this.  The template for transforming public services is a considered approach in this regard.  The renewed programme for Government refers to the need to appoint a chief information officer to assist in ensuring the expertise available in the public and private sector on technology is brought to bear in terms of the manner in which we currently deliver public services and how we use technology to improve the delivery of that service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will a new strategy be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from publishing strategies, discussions are ongoing which provide us with a good opportunity to make real progress on an agreed basis for the introduction of a greater level of e-government in our deliberations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has just taken the opportunity to put on the record of the House a statement in respect of the talks that are under way between officials of the Department of Finance and the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government&rsquo;s objective with regard to the talks?  When I questioned the Taoiseach earlier about the report of an bord snip nua, he responded that it would inform Government decisions in respect of the Estimates and the budget.  He placed emphasis on the Government making those decisions and its prerogative in that area.  Does the Government intend to conclude an agreement with the trade unions in respect of pay and <Col N="9"/>adjustments in the public finances in advance of the budget?  With regard to the sectoral discussions to which the Taoiseach referred, are the recommendations in the report of an bord snip nua on the table?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the identification of savings or expenditure adjustments that would help to assist the process, the recommendations of course would form part of the discussion.  Where we can find agreement on the implementation, it is all the better for us.  The Government has decisions to take and wants to do this on the basis of the greatest measure of agreement &mdash; full agreement if possible.  It wants agreement not just on the pay issue because social partnership can provide an opportunity for agreement on other issues also.  However, the issue I was talking about today related to public sector pay and what we seek to achieve in that area.  Discussions are ongoing and they involve considering and costing all options and seeing what might form the basis of a solution.  These discussions are on a without prejudice basis.</P>
        <P>The negotiators and people discussing the issues should be accorded the time and space to enable them to get on with the task of seeing whether it is possible to find an agreed way forward that will provide us with the necessary savings on the basis of maintaining public services as best we can while meeting the financial targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow a final supplementary question, as we have spent some time on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that, but the issue is central to what is happening in the country.  The Taoiseach has said that he is anxious that time and space is given to everybody in the process to talk.  The problem is that the budget is due in five weeks&rsquo; time.  What is the Government&rsquo;s objective in this matter?  Is its objective to try to conclude an agreement on these matters in advance of the budget or is it engaging in a consultative exercise which will guide or inform it in its decision making when the time comes to make those decisions?  The reason I ask is that I am a bit confused as to the Government&rsquo;s disposition in this regard.</P>
        <P>The original questions were in respect of the McCarthy report.  However, on one hand the Taoiseach has been giving the impression that this is a document that is of some interest to the Government in making its decisions on the budget, while, on the other, we are being told that sectoral discussions are taking place.  It is difficult to understand how we could have meaningful sectoral discussions if the issues identified in the McCarthy report relating to particular sectors are not the subject of discussion.  What is the game plan or what is the Government&rsquo;s intention or objective?  I appreciate the Taoiseach cannot predict the outcome of discussions, but what is the Government&rsquo;s objective?  Is the objective to try to reach an agreement or not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made the situation clear and there should be no confusion about it.  I made it clear in a previous comment to the House that the purpose of the talks is to explore the possibility of achieving the necessary reductions in the public service pay bill on an agreed basis. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, the talks are just exploratory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are more than exploratory.  Everyone recognises the seriousness of the situation the country is in and the need to make an adjustment.  A range of options is being considered and it is not helpful to go into further detail at this stage simply because discussions are under way.  Time is short and the Government must see signs of progress this week, given the comparatively short lead-in time to the December budget.  That is the position.  The purpose <Col N="10"/>of the talks is to explore if the necessary reductions in the public service pay bill can be achieved on an agreed basis.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the public sector unions, they suggested they believe there are alternatives to simply looking at pay rate reductions.  We were anxious to explore with them how they would see that being implemented given the size of the reduction required.  That is being discussed on a without prejudice basis and it would remiss of any Government not to sit down with their employees&rsquo; representatives in an effort to find a way forward that meets the requirements of the situation and to see if agreement is possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the statement the Taoiseach made following Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s supplementary question, is it the view of the Government that an agreement in the first instance would be formed across the public sector or would it be done on a sector by sector basis?  I was interested in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks that discussions are going on sector by sector, with teachers talking to the Department of Education and Children and the Department of Finance, while health workers are talking to the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance.  Is the Taoiseach saying that if savings and efficiencies can be found on a sector by sector basis and a potential agreement arose from that, those sectors could be saved from a blanket reduction in pay if such savings were to be found?  Is the Government looking for a global agreement or a sector by sector agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the purpose of Government to find a saving of the order that we have outlined throughout the public service.  There are different personnel involved in every sector who engage in industrial relations issues on an ongoing basis.  We would use that expertise and interaction on a sectoral basis as part of an overall effort to obtain the savings.  There are different pay structures and issues that arise because there is not a uniform pay structure across the public service, it depends on the sector a person is in.  That leads to complexity, and the need to cost options, to sit down to discuss this and go through it in detail so people are satisfied about what has been suggested and the costs and savings involved, which must be allowed to take place as talks intensify during the week on a strictly without prejudice basis.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  the balance between spending savings on the current side, on the capital side, and additional tax measures which will make up his fiscal strategy for the coming years.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the supplementary budget last April, the Government set out a multi-annual plan to correct the public finances.  This plan has been welcomed by the European Commission.  The immediate need is the stabilisation of the deficit <Col N="11"/>in 2010 and this is Government&rsquo;s proposed aim.  This will require difficult decisions to be made for budget 2010 which will presented to the D&aacute;il on 9 December.  The bulk of the corrective action in budget 2010 will have to come from the expenditure side as further significant increases in the tax burden would impact on enterprise and growth prospects.  The measures that must be introduced will undoubtedly be difficult, but the imperative for action is clear and we must make the necessary adjustments now in order to stabilise the public finances. </P>
        <P>At the publication of the end September Exchequer returns, my Department announced that tax revenues could finish the year in the region of &euro;32 billion.  Later today, my Department will publish the most recent Exchequer returns for the period covering to the end of October.  While the poor performance of tax revenue has continued, it is not out of line with what had been anticipated.  To put this in perspective, overall tax revenue in 2009 is back to 2003 levels while gross voted expenditure has increased by about 70% since 2003.  Consequently, we will have to borrow approximately &euro;26 billion this year to fund the voted services and the central fund.</P>
        <P>Bridging the gap between income and expenditure through ongoing increased borrowing is not a viable solution in the medium to long term.  Taking the necessary action now will ensure that confidence is maintained in the Irish economy and that Ireland is favourably placed to benefit from global recovery as it takes hold.  Delaying the necessary action is not an option and would require harsher measures to be taken later.  It would also result in ever increasing amounts of scarce Government resources being used to service the mounting debt.</P>
        <P>In 2009, gross voted spending divides into three main areas with 37% going on social welfare spending; 35% on the public service pay and pensions bill; and 28% on other programmes, including the capital programme.  The priority must be the stabilisation of the deficit next year.  It is clear, therefore, that all areas of expenditure will have to be considered in the context of deciding on the adjustments.</P>
        <P>The pre-budget outlook, which my Department plans to publish in mid-November, will provide an update on the macroeconomic outlook and set out a technical fiscal forecast.  The House will have the opportunity to discuss these forecasts in a pre-budget outlook debate.  The budget will be published on 9 December and will provide full details of the nature of the corrective measures being undertaken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not answer my question about where the savings would come from.  Has there been a fresh Government decision overturning the proposal set out in table 6 of the April budget that in the next two years it would earn &euro;4.6 billion in extra taxes, &euro;2.5 billion of which was to come in next year?  Has the Minister rescinded that proposal?  He has said frequently that &euro;4 billion must be found and none of that will come from taxation.  Is that a Government decision or is it different people interpreting their individual thoughts?  Does the Government still intend to reduce capital spending by &euro;750 million next year and by &euro;1 billion the following year?  Such a move would severely undermine investment at a time when investment value can be obtained in the marketplace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The table to which Deputy Bruton referred must be read in the context of the speech I delivered at the time of the supplementary budget.  Then, I clearly stated the figure for taxation was an absolute maximum and the figure for expenditure reduction was an absolute minimum.  I am sure Deputy Bruton would appreciate it is important that a Government keeps its options open in such a matter and reviews it having regard to developments on the general fiscal front.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the decline in tax receipts that has continued to take place this year, albeit not on as spectacular basis as last year, that the scope for increased taxation in this year&rsquo;s <Col N="12"/>budget is limited.  I have made that clear in numerous public statements in recent months and that is also the general view of the Government.  Of course, the precise composition of the balance between taxation and current and capital expenditure will finally be determined on budget day.  What I have been doing is outlining the general character of the challenge facing the Government, which is to find the bulk of the expenditure savings on the expenditure side and to indicate clearly that the scope for taxation is limited.</P>
        <P>As to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question about the capital budget, as he stated the indicative target stated in the Stability and Growth Pact was &euro;750 million.  Again, because of various decisions taken in the past year much of that target is readily achievable in the year ahead.  It should be borne in mind that there has been a substantial reduction in tender prices in the interim.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm or deny whether the Government made a decision on changing the balance on the amounts that must be found from current and capital spending?  When the Minister says he is keeping his options open, does that mean he is open to some of the suggestions advanced by the social partners that the balance should be different from the Government&rsquo;s current position that the bulk of the &euro;4 billion will be found in spending cuts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has decided, and made it clear at all stages, that the &euro;4 billion must be found to comply with our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.  Apart altogether from our obligations under the pact, the Government has decided the figure is essential, having regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am about to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  Having reviewed the end-September returns, the Government further decided that not only was this requisite to comply with our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact, it was also essential in addressing the deterioration of the percentage ratio of debt to gross domestic product that was emerging this year.  That ratio stands at approximately 12% and the Government does not see any room for slippage in regard to that target.  We need to stabilise that target now.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on the most recent Central Statistics Office quarterly national accounts which showed a decline of 7.4% of gross domestic product, and a decline of 11.6% of gross national product, in the first six months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008; his further views on the most recent Central Statistics Office quarterly national household survey which showed a decline in employment of 8.2% in the year to end June 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[37967/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office published national accounts data for the second quarter of 2009 at the end of September.  These data show that gross domestic product and gross national product fell at an annual rate of 7.4% and 11.6%, respectively, in the second quarter of this year.  Combined with the first quarter data, the figures show the annual rate of decline in the first half of the year was 8.4% in gross domestic product terms and 12.4% in gross national product terms.</P>
        <P>The sharp declines in housing output and in personal spending were the main reasons for the contraction in the second quarter.  While these results are poor, one positive feature of the data is that the rate of export decline was not as large as that in many other export-oriented economies.</P>
        <P>Data which have been published since then suggest the rate of contraction has slowed in the intervening period.  As a result, I am advised the forecast for a gross domestic product contraction of 7.75% this year, contained in the April supplementary budget remains broadly valid.  My Department will publish in mid-November the pre-budget outlook which will update the macro-economic outlook.</P>
        <P>Regarding labour market developments, the latest quarterly national household survey from the Central Statistics Office shows an annual employment fall of 8.2% in the year to the second quarter of this year.  On a sectoral basis, the sharpest falls were in the construction, followed at some distance by the retail sector and then at another considerable distance, the manufacturing sector.</P>
        <P>In April, my Department projected that employment would fall by 7.8% for this year as a whole.  The data which have subsequently been published are in line with this.  So while we are seeing a sharp fall in employment, which is clearly a concern, it is not unexpected.</P>
        <P>There are a substantial number of measures in place to support the unemployed.  The Government is devoting substantial resources to training and up-skilling so that those losing their jobs in declining sectors can gain future employment in expanding sectors of the economy.  The number of places for the unemployed in training, education and other support programmes has doubled this year.</P>
        <P>The Government is also implementing measures to benefit from the global recovery when it eventually takes hold.  The most important of these short-term measures include restoring confidence to our banking system and stabilising the public finances.  Also, from a medium and long-term perspective our future pattern of growth will, by necessity, be predicated on a more sustainable export-led economic model.  This will require a continued focus on improving our competitiveness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>At this stage the Minister knows the Exchequer returns due to be published in the next hour.  Does he expect the tax receipts for the year to be closer to between &euro;31 billion and &euro;32 billion than the &euro;34.4 billion he projected at the time of the emergency budget six months ago?</P><Col N="14"/>
        <P>Does he accept that the past two deflationary budgets have hit tax revenues hard, worsening the already perilous state of the public finances?  The Minister, in his reply, drew attention to the fact that exports are holding up, confirming that it is the collapse in the domestic economy and demand which is at the heart of the deflationary and depressive spiral in which the county finds itself.  As the economy faces a collapse in demand, the current cause of the crisis, does he accept there is a revenue crisis as much as there is a spending crisis in the public finances?  If the Government keeps cutting key services and public spending, the deflationary spiral will get worse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked two broad questions.  First, I have not been briefed as of yet about the end of month forecast which will be published in an hour&rsquo;s time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be.  Is he sure he has not been briefed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The monthly forecasts are not briefed in the same way as the quarterly or the end-November forecast.  They are the subject, as the Deputy knows, of a press conference at the Department and are briefed to the Minister in advance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I was referring to the Exchequer figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to them too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister astonishes me.  How can he talk about them?  He should be poring over them all morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally, the monthly figures are posted on the departmental website.  They are not the subject of a separate presentation by the officials or briefing to the Minister.  If there were anything out of the ordinary in them, the Minister would be briefed about them specifically.  In the case of this month, there is nothing out of the ordinary in the forecasts.  As I made clear at the end of September, I anticipated a &euro;2 billion shortfall in tax.  The tax receipts disclosed in the end-October receipt side are broadly in line with that forecast. Therefore, to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the drop is of the order of &euro;2 billion on the April forecast.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the matter of the Deputy&rsquo;s general thesis on the operation of deflation in the economy, she is laying far too much stress on budgetary considerations as a motor for deflation in the economy.  I will illustrate that point in one way.  On the tax side, our estimation this year is that the number of income earners who will fall outside the income tax net will be of the order of half the income earners in the State.  That will be an increase from the 39% or 40% forecast in the October budget last year.  Equally, those on the top rate, some 21% in the forecast last year, have fallen to 10%.  All that suggests is that a substantial wage adjustment has taken place in the economy in response to international developments.  That wage adjustment does not always illustrate itself in CSO analyses of pay rates because they are often based on basic rates.  However, we know that a great deal of private sector remuneration took the form of overtime, bonuses or additional remuneration.  That features somewhat less in the public sector but reductions in that respect in that sector have been also a significant factor.</P>
        <P>That huge wage adjustment is one reason we have witnessed the amount of deflation that has occurred in the economy.  The other factor in this context, which the Deputy neglected to mention, is the enormous depreciation in sterling that has taken place.  That was already under way in 2008, but that has fed into cheaper import prices within the State this year because our trade position with Britain is in deficit.  We buy more from Britain than we export to it.  There<Col N="15"/>fore, any depreciation in sterling has a knock on effect in terms of a fall in the current standard of living in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am rather surprised and a little shocked that the Minister will not be very much involved in examining the details of the October Exchequer figures.  The deflationary spiral is all about tax revenues falling.  Much of the Minister&rsquo;s budget strategy appears to be around cuts, which will further deflate spending capacity and receipts of taxes such as VAT.  He referred to the UK.  Does he agree that the single most disastrous mistake he made as Minister for Finance was to raise the higher VAT rate by 0.5%, which has sent hundreds of thousands of people across the Border to shop in Northern Ireland?  </P>
        <P>In regard to employment figures, the Minister acknowledged the figures were deteriorating even if the rate of unemployment was slowing down.  Does he agree that we are looking at close to 500,000 people being unemployed and that one in five of the people on the live register are now under 25 years of age?  Has he had a chance to study the comments made by Professor Blanchflower, a recognised international expert on youth employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must call the Minister to make a brief reply as we have spent well over the time allocated for this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is essential to have measures in place, in terms of education, training, internship and gaining experience, to get young people back into work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to be brief in his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many matters to which to reply.  Briefly, I agree with Professor Blanchflower to the extent that training measures are exceptionally important.  However, I should point out that the CSO figures to the end of October will show for the first time that the live register has not increased in the month of October.  There is clearly a stabilisation in the growth of unemployment at this stage.  I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s prediction that it will grow to 500,000.  That is no longer an official prediction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I said it is heading towards 500,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, heading towards it &mdash; it is not reaching that figure.  I mentioned the extent to which I agree with Professor Blanchflower.</P>
        <P>The matter of thousands of shoppers proceeding across the Border had very little to do with a half percentage increase in the VAT rate.  It was caused by the fact that there was a very substantial reduction in UK VAT rates, which policy, incidentally, is now a proven failure.  There was also a disparity in excise duty arrangements between this State and Northern Ireland, especially in regard to the price of alcohol.  All the research on the subject of Northern Ireland has demonstrated how crucial and central a part that is in the inducement to shop there.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Richard Bruton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his strategy for the reform of political expenses of office holders and of ordinary Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[38095/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>First, it must be stated that Members of these Houses and officeholders incur legitimate expenses as part of their parliamentary duties both in attending Leinster House and as part of their constituency duties.  It is appropriate that the amount of any <Col N="16"/>such expense should be kept under review to ensure they are appropriate to reflect the cost of these duties, as well as the prevailing economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Bruton will be aware, I have already reduced the cost of the expenses.  Expenses generally have been reduced by 10% and mileage rates have also been reduced by 25% in line with the general reduction in public service mileage rates.  Members of the Oireachtas and officer holders are therefore making a contribution in recognition of the current economic position.</P>
        <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission brought forward proposals earlier this year to introduce a single composite parliamentary allowance in place of a number of separate allowances. This summer I introduced the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and other Parliamentary Officeholders Act 2009 which, among other things, provided an enabling provision for a single composite allowance.  This allowance would replace some or all of the many separate allowances payable at present. The legislation also allows for the proposed composite allowance to be linked to attendance.</P>
        <P>At the time I introduced the legislation, I stated clearly that I was of the view that there was a need for further consideration and discussion of the proposed composite allowance before I brought forward the necessary regulations.  In the interim, over the summer period, I introduced and adopted the regulations which provided for the 25% reduction in travel expenses and the 10% reduction in all other expenses.  That is now law and is operative.  Since then, I have had discussions with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, and there are continuing contacts at official level.</P>
        <P>At present I am in the process of finalising the most appropriate revised arrangements, which will give a transparent, verifiable and cost-effective system of parliamentary expenses.  When I have completed my consideration of the matter, regulations setting out the new arrangements will be laid before the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As we approach probably the most difficult budget in the history of the State, does the Minister agree that the Government must be seen to lead by example in this field?  Does he believe the size of ministerial offices working for constituency purposes should be controlled among office holders and that Ministers drawing a cash allowance <i>in lieu</i> of secretarial assistance should be discontinued?  Does he believe we need to have proper verification of expenses, both that they are properly incurred and that they are for proper purposes?  I am sure he will share my dismay at reports of cases where the purposes for which allowances are being deployed do not appear to follow proper criteria.  When does he believe he will have final decisions, particularly in regard to Ministers&rsquo; pay and conditions and the Oireachtas expense regime?  Does he expect to have those matters decided prior to the budget in order that they will be a factor in putting together an overall package?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  Will he remind me of his first question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister answers the questions he remembers, perhaps I will recall the first one I asked him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked if it is intended to apply similar changes to the expenses of Ministers.  The answer is, yes, it is.   The Deputy&rsquo;s first question was in regard to Ministers&rsquo; offices.  There are guidelines in existence on the operation of ministerial constituency offices.  In respect of those guidelines, there also has been a requirement since April that further savings be made by Ministers on that account.  </P><Col N="17"/>
        <P>Clearly, the verifiability of expenses is an important issue.  I accept that the commission proposed to me that the new regime should be based on attendance but no verification mechanism was proposed for attendance.  I am not satisfied in regard to all expenses that attendance of itself verifies the incurring of the expense &mdash; it may in some cases but not in all.  These issues are being worked through with the commission at present.  I agree with the Deputy that even in the context of a block grant, a total absence of verification is not an adequately transparent system to carry the public confidence that must be carried in any system of expense.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s last question related to when it is proposed to bring forward this regime.  I have already had extensive consultations with the commission and with the delegation representing the major parties in the House.  It is the intention to announce a revised regime in advance of the budget.</P>
        <P>I am open to persuasion by the other parties on the appropriate day, but it would seem to me that the appropriate course of action would be to bring it into operation from 1 January next.  We already introduced expenses changes half way through this year, involving substantial reductions in the amount of expenses.  For ease of administration, the best course of action would be to introduce them from 1 January next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s indication that he will make a decision before the budget because the credibility of the entire House will be on the line unless we are shown to be able to reform the way we operate ourselves.</P>
        <P>The approach of Ministers to allowances and to their own ministerial offices needs to be significantly curbed.  To state that there is an arrangement in place does not meet that requirement.  There would be an expectation that adjustments would be greater by those who hold ministerial office and have greater access to support.  That would be a fair expectation in a system of reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not necessarily accept the assumption that, for example, as Minister for Finance, I have fewer opportunities to engage in constituency work than many Members of the House who are not Ministers.  There must be some balance in the provision of assistance in that area for Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister keeps us here most of the time he is here too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It should also be noted that those who are assigned to assist in constituency offices are expressly prohibited in the terms of their contracts from engaging in political work.  That said, I will take into account what the Deputy has said and I agree that whatever is adopted on expenses for Members of the House must equally apply to Ministers.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  if the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes report is the basis of the spending savings which he intends to achieve in 2009; and the instruments that have been developed in the human resource area to implement these proposals.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[38093/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The basis of the expenditure savings for 2009 was set out in my budget of 14 October 2008 and supplementary budget of 7 April 2009.  A range of instruments has been developed in the human resource area to contribute to the implementation of these savings, notably the incentivised scheme of early retirement in the public service, ISER, the special Civil Service career break scheme, ICB, and the shorter working year scheme, together with the moratorium on the filling of public sector vacancies by recruitment or promotion. <Col N="18"/> Details of these schemes were announced in the context of the supplementary budget in April last.  In addition, and as signalled in the April budget, an adjustment of approximately &euro;4 billion is required for next year to meet the Government&rsquo;s fiscal consolidation targets.</P>
        <P>Given this context, the Government must consider all expenditure areas.  In this regard, one must bear in mind that approximately one third of gross current expenditure is on social welfare, approximately one third on the public service pay bill and one third of all the remaining expenditures are on the programmes, including the capital programmes.  The Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children and Education and Science, collectively, make up approximately 80% of current expenditure.  It is not feasible that an adjustment of the scale envisaged can be made without significant contributions from these various areas.</P>
        <P>Naturally, this will involve difficult decisions for the Government in the lead up to budget 2010.  In this overall context, the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes will be taken into consideration.  As regards the human resources implications of the forthcoming expenditure savings, discussions are ongoing with the social partners on the achievement of the required savings, including savings of &euro;1.3 billion in 2010 from the public sector payroll.  While the task ahead is challenging, it is one the Government is determined to see through in the best interests of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the line Ministers taking into account the McCarthy report in terms of their budget savings and have they reported back to the Minister for Finance on that matter?</P>
        <P>Could the Minister indicate how many public servants have taken up the various schemes to which he referred &mdash; the career break option, the shorter working week and the early retirement scheme?  What staff reduction costs does he envisage in the forthcoming budget?  For the 2010 budget, the McCarthy report made recommendations of reductions of &euro;5 billion?  How much of the McCarthy report recommendations in terms of value does the Minister expect will form part of budget cost savings in 2010 budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give a precise estimation at this stage.  However, the procedure adopted on the McCarthy report has been that it was circulated to each Department and it is being examined, Department by Department, in the context of the Estimates process.  Each Department is being interrogated on the report&rsquo;s recommendations and on what contribution it can make to savings within public expenditure.  At the conclusion of that process of interrogation, there is then a political decision-making exercise by the Government on any recommendations.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that the McCarthy report did not preclude the Government from looking at other areas.  It is worth noting that, for example, the report did not have any mandate to evaluate capital projects except where there were current expenditure implications.  Equally, the McCarthy report did not deal with the question of pay and remuneration in general.  It is true that some of the savings referred to in the report are payroll savings in that it examined certain special allowances and premium payments, for example, in the health and justice sectors.  However, the report did not deal with pay as a general subject and it is now under discussion with the social partners.</P>
        <P>The non-pay recommendations of the McCarthy report related primarily to social welfare and other programmes and they are under examination by the Government in the context of the Estimates process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked how many civil servants have availed of the schemes.</P><Col N="19"/>
        <P>In terms of the forthcoming budget, how much of the &euro;4 billion does the Minister expect will be contributed by cost savings as distinct from taxation increases?  That is critical, and he has spoken at length about looking at the matter.  However, the Minister cannot tax his way out of a recession and he must look at it in that context.  He has not answered the question.  In the context of the McCarthy report, he should give us a firm figure.  How much of the &euro;4 billion that he needs to find in the forthcoming budget will comprise cost savings?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, on 26 June 2009 the European Commission approved, under EU treaty state aid rules, a recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank of &euro;4 billion.</P>
        <P>The State investment occurred in the form of ordinary shares to help preserve an adequate level of core tier 1 capital.  Part of the recapitalisation was used to buy back at a significant discount certain outstanding subordinated loans Anglo Irish Bank had issued in previous years, to provide further support for the bank&rsquo;s capital position.</P>
        <P>As highlighted in the Commission decision, the recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was required as a matter of urgency to preserve the financial stability of the bank, which is of systemic importance.  The recapitalisation was accepted by the Commission as appropriate to remedy Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s solvency problems at that time, maintain confidence in the Irish financial system overall and remedy a serious economic disturbance that would otherwise have been expected to arise.</P>
        <P>The aid was approved as a rescue measure on the basis of a commitment to submit a restructuring plan for the bank by the end of November 2009.  The board of Anglo Irish Bank is currently preparing the restructuring plan, which will consider all options for the future of the bank.  In advance of the finalisation of the plan and its submission to me, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the plan.</P>
        <P>As I stated on Second Stage of the NAMA Bill in the D&aacute;il on 16 September last, it is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to the agency and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital.  I made it clear that the Government would expect such an institution to explore all <Col N="20"/>available options for raising such capital as it is the Government preference that private market solutions are found and implemented.</P>
        <P>However, to the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally, the Government remains committed to providing such banks with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements.  This will be done in a manner consistent with EU state aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy.  I recently confirmed this position to the Financial Regulator in the case of Anglo Irish Bank to facilitate the regulator in granting that bank derogations from certain regulatory capital requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister seriously think that private investors will come over the mountain for Anglo Irish Bank?  He did not answer the question.  The Minister told the European Commission he would get no return from the &euro;4 billion which was put into Anglo Irish Bank by way of recapitalisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not as bluntly as that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the language is plainer but the essence of the point is the same.  The Minister will effectively get no return.  He is now talking about putting another &euro;20 billion into Anglo Irish Bank by way of NAMA, which makes &euro;24 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money that will see no return.  The EU has been clear in regard to state aid rules.  Either this is an orderly wind-down or there should be a proper business plan for restructuring to take place.</P>
        <P>Since last May, we have seen no figures in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, which we own &mdash; the May figures applied for the period up to 31 March.  We have seen the figures up to 30 June for AIB and Irish Life &amp; Permanent, and up to 30 September for Bank of Ireland.  The people are entitled to know what is happening with regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  The Minister should accept that the bank needs to be wound down in an orderly way, that he cannot get a return for the taxpayer and that he would be putting good money after bad with any further investment in the bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not accept what Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell says because it is not a policy that is capable of implementation.  What is capable of implementation is, first, what has been required since last February, namely, that the bank be stabilised.  The effect of the National Asset Management Agency approach will be to stabilise Anglo Irish Bank.  Whatever bonds are issued on foot of that are issued by the Irish State but they are issued for valuable consideration, namely, the assets for which they are taken.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are of dubious value.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>NAMA, for all practical purposes, amounts to a bad bank in the case of Anglo Irish Bank.  The completion of the NAMA exercise will then enable the making of a strategic decision in regard to the direction the bank should take.</P>
        <P>Given the character and size of the risk the bank posed to the economy since last February, the downsizing of the loan books, which NAMA entails, will be a welcome development on world markets and with the European Commission.  Building on that, at the conclusion of that exercise &mdash; because it stabilises the bank and puts it in a position to fund itself &mdash; a decision can then be taken about the strategic direction the bank should take.  The Deputy must remember that if we continue the orderly wind-down which he advocates in regard to that part of Anglo Irish Bank which is not part of the NAMA process and which remains in the bank, the certainty that the taxpayer will be at a loss is accelerated rather than diminished.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="21"/>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made the argument that one must take account of the credit needs of the Irish economy in terms of any recapitalisation of the banks.  Anglo Irish Bank, into which &euro;24 billion will shortly have gone, will provide no credit.  The bank is not systemic for the banking system in the economy.  Does the Minister not, therefore, think it appropriate at this stage in terms of value for money for the taxpayer to commence an orderly wind-down of the bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>All of these questions can be weighed up on the completion of the NAMA process but, as I said earlier, the rapid wind-down of a bank of this type, after the removal of the at-risk assets in it, will only accelerate a loss to the taxpayer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, in February of this year, the Government decided to pursue a general 8% reduction on fees to legal, medical, veterinary and other professionals engaged by the public service from 1 March 2009.  My Department wrote to each Department outlining how this decision should be implemented.</P>
        <P>I have informed this House previously that I have received advice in regard to the banking crisis from various sources, including the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the NTMA.  I have also received advice from Arthur Cox solicitors.  The 8% reduction has been applied to fees paid to that company since March 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Treasury Management Agency has engaged HSBC, Arthur Cox and PricewaterhouseCoopers to provide advice in regard to the National Asset Management Agency.  In July 2009, the NTMA issued a tender to procure general banking advisers in regard to the whole financial system through the procurement website <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> and Rothschilds was awarded this mandate to 30 June 2010.  I have been advised by the NTMA that all firms priced the work at a substantial discount &mdash; indeed, multiples of 8% &mdash; to win the business.  I also understand from the NTMA that the agency-related tenders will use the public procurement website and any prices sought will be subject to the 8% reduction.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has advised me that it is operating in accordance with public sector requirements under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 when awarding any contract for the provision of professional and consultancy services to it.  It is important that all sectors play a role tackling the serious problem of the deterioration in the public finances.  The 8% reduction in professional, consultancy and other professional services are part of the overall savings package which the Government has announced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply.  We know the Department of Finance and its associated agencies, such as the NTMA and the Financial Regulator, have committed approximately &euro;23 million over the period of the banking crisis.  We know, as the Minister has just said, that this has so far involved fees to Arthur Cox of &euro;1.6 million in 2008 and a further &euro;8.4 million covering 2009 and 2010; PricewaterhouseCoopers seems to have got at least &euro;3.8 <Col N="22"/>million; Jones Lange LaSalle seem to have got at least &euro;1 million which we know of so far; and Merrill Lynch got &euro;7.3 million.  This all adds up to approximately &euro;23 million to date.  The Minister also referred to further consultants, HSBC and Rothschilds, which got the Merrill Lynch contract.  In addition, the Minister announced in the NAMA draft business plan that he intends to spend &euro;240 million a year on consultancy, some of which would go into the banks and much of which would go into the private firms in regard to legal affairs, accountancy, auctioneering, valuation and so on.</P>
        <P>Does the Minster understand that this amount of fees is staggering?  I would like to know how the 8% is calculated.  I have not seen any evidence that the Merrill Lynch fee income to the Department has actually been reduced by 8% or, indeed, that the accountants and the various other banks have actually reduced their fees by a real 8%.  Is there a tender document which the 8% is knocked off?  We have not seen any actual evidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>To take the contentions made by the Deputy in turn, first, an estimated figure of &euro;23 million to date was cited by her.  Of course, the bulk of that sum was discharged by the banks themselves as part of the recapitalisation arrangement &mdash; the banks were obliged under the recapitalisation arrangements to defer these expenses.  In view of the crisis that emerged in September 2008, Merrill Lynch was engaged on the recommendation of the NTMA and, at my direction, without a tendering process.  For that reason, a subsequent tendering process took place and Rothschild secured that particular tender.</P>
        <P>The figures mentioned in the business plan are indicative figures.  We will have a further opportunity to discuss them on the establishment of the NAMA board.  Clearly, those figures include a substantial amount required to be paid under EU rules, where the loans are left under the management of a particular financial institution.</P>
        <P>The question of the 8% is something that is implemented in the context of each particular contract.  I will write to the Deputy with further clarification on it, because I do not have information to hand about whether the 8% is factored into the tendering procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s view of the current in-house experts available to him and their competency on a range of matters for which he feels he needs to employ consultants?  When will the Minister recruit in-house experts on these matters to eliminate the need for many of these consultants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the sanction of the Government, the Department is recruiting an in-house banking analyst to analyse bank matters.  That person will be appointed as a civil servant within the Department, although it was not possible to appoint such a person by way of transfer from an existing Department.  I was advised at the outset of the banking crisis that the Department required such advice, and that the advice was required in any event for the protection of both the Minister and the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister provide the D&aacute;il with information on the hourly rate charged under these tender prices?  Would the rate be in excess of &euro;1,000 per day for the senior people working on the contracts?  I find the &euro;7.5 million fee charged by Merrill Lynch extraordinarily high.  In his report on NAMA, Mr. Bacon referred to Merrill Lynch, but it is very difficult to know what bit of the company&rsquo;s advice was useful.  The Department or the NTMA recently hired an economist to give the Minister advice on banking trends.  The Minister claimed he had engaged an expert&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="23"/>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the cost of employing that person per annum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that information to hand.  Merrill Lynch staff were constantly on call and available up to and during the guarantee period, during subsequent discussions with the financial institutions, in connection with the decisions surrounding the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, and in decisions surrounding the capitalisation of Bank of Ireland and AIB.  As Merrill Lynch had been retained otherwise than by way of tender due to the urgent circumstances of the time, the NTMA took the view that it was desirable to re-tender for the business.  Perhaps because of changes in world economic conditions, Rothschild tendered at a very reasonable rate for the services.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on the contrast between prices set or regulated in the public sector and those in the private sector; and his plans to improve the competitiveness of public sector prices.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[37727/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Prices set in the public sector make up only about 4% of the basket of goods and services used in compiling the consumer price index.  However, public sector prices make up a much smaller component than in the past.  Some services such as telecoms have been privatised, and the setting of more prices has been devolved to independent regulators, particularly in the energy sector.</P>
        <P>Prices in the public sector are generally set by Ministers or at local authority level.  Due regard is given to the cost of providing the service, the length of time the price has stayed static as well as affordability.  Consideration is also given to ensuring that a high level of quality is provided to the public.  The regulation of ESB customer supply electricity tariffs and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002.  The Government has no function in setting these tariffs.  A key role of the CER is to oversee the transition to a more competitive market structure in line with EU and national policy.  Independent suppliers are now offering significant discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB unit rates.</P>
        <P>An issue of concern is that Ireland has lost competitiveness in recent years and it is essential that this position be improved if we are to benefit when EU and world growth resumes.  A key part of this loss of competitiveness has come about from wage costs increasing at a rate not justified by gains in productivity.  Changes in prices set by the public sector can only make a very small impact in either direction.  However, pursuing appropriate incomes policies is critical, particularly within a monetary union, and is essential to restoring our lost competitiveness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acknowledgment that we have lost competitiveness, but I must express dismay at his suggestion that the Government has no function in the area of prices set by the Government.  Has he considered the competitiveness report, which shows that all of the non-pay business costs in control of the Government are in the &ldquo;red light&rdquo; danger area?  Many of the most chronic cases, such as electricity, telephones, broadband, waste disposal and health insurance, are directly controlled by the Government.  How does the Minister expect ordinary workers to accept that there is a need for making cuts in <Col N="24"/>their pay, when he sits on his hands and claims that the Government has no role on key public sector prices that are way out of line with all of our European competitors?  Surely the Minister sees the need for a competitiveness pact led by the Government addressing these issues and others such as boardroom pay, so that we can see that if sacrifice is to be made, it is made in a way that is fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not indicate in my answer that these are matters in which the Government has no function.  I indicated that the sectors to which the Deputy referred were sectors in which the prices were set by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Electricity and gas tariffs are the responsibility for the CER, and that is the statutory position.  With respect, they are not the responsibility of the Government and these were the particular examples given by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not mention gas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but it is pertinent as well.  The Deputy did give the example of electricity, and the regulator there is responsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I could have given health, education, communications or any one of 1,000 areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the Deputy did not give an example of those areas, but an area which is of great importance and which is under the tariff control of a regulator. I have considerable sympathy for the point the Deputy has expressed.  If we are to grapple with our problems, it is not enough simply to have an adjustment in the public sector or an adjustment in the competitive public sector.  We also need to see what adjustments can take place in the sheltered private sector.  I made that point to IBEC in the course of a recent meeting in the social partnership discussions.</P>

	<P>Who is going to lead if the Government does not do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESB is not allowed to reduce its prices because these are being kept artificially high by the regulator in order to encourage market entrants.  That is also what has happened in the telecoms sector.  We have a regulatory system of a cost and structure that would be suitable for the United States of America, but is totally inappropriate for a small country like Ireland, with a relatively small market and population.  What will the Minister do about the person who, having been asked to take a wage cut and taken such a cut, will continue to be asked for &euro;60 when he or she takes his or her child to the doctor with a flu because he or she does not have a medical card?  No reduction in fees will apply to people who have to purchase essential services like health services.  On the contrary, they have gone up and they have never come down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

	<P>We have heard this three times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a succinct reply, so the Deputy might get a few supplementary questions in.  I published the draft NAMA business plan, which was prepared by the interim NAMA management, to inform the debate on NAMA.  It is clear from its title that it is a draft report.  The actual business plan cannot be initiated until NAMA is established and a board is appointed.  The function of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to review performance, to audit expenditure and to report on the accounts of public bodies.  The suggestion that he should be involved in a review of the draft business plan is misguided.  I do not see a role for him in the review of the NAMA business plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that just 6% of the land and development bank is performing, whereas the business plan forecasts that 80% of it will produce a full refund, can the Minister understand the scepticism of some people?  Similarly, does he understand why people are dubious about the use of a risk discount rate of just 5% for highly risky projects, not to mention the expectation that the administration costs of this operation will be just 0.4%?  In light of such dubious assumptions, will the Minister agree that someone should vet the soundness of this plan on behalf of the taxpayer?  If he does not believe the Comptroller and Auditor General should perform such a function, who does he believe should be responsible for protecting taxpayers from rushing into decisions without a proper foundation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to institute value for money reports, a series of changes have taken place since the draft NAMA business plan was prepared.  Property values have continued to fall.  We have received information from various court cases and legal actions.  We have learnt that the value of the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend has decreased stupendously from more than &euro;400 million, at the last count, to between &euro;60 million and &euro;80 million at present.  The draft NAMA business plan does not provide for any such falls in value.  The Minister is trying to make savings on the ordinary budget.  Does he agree he should try to cut the &euro;54 billion cost that the taxpayer is undertaking?  Does he accept that it would make sound business sense, in the national economic interest, to do so now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The valuations that will be reached, under the separate and independent valuation procedure that is envisaged in the Bill, will establish whether Deputy Burton is correct.  The 5% discount rate in the draft business plan, which was mentioned by Deputy <Col N="26"/>Bruton, is based on the current cost to the Government of funding ten-year bonds.  This is an appropriate discount rate as the term of NAMA is expected to be approximately ten years.  Private investors enjoy higher discounts that are linked to returns over shorter periods.  I accept that the valuations used by NAMA will have regard to the discount rates in the private sector, when appropriate.  I was also asked about the breakdown of the discounts.  Deputy Burton referred to a particular case.  It has to be said that a substantial discount is already factored into the draft business plan.  The yield assumptions in the plan assume a fall of 40% in commercial rents for new leases.  The yield figures already assume a 20% fall in rents and a 50% fall in property values.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There already has been a catastrophic fall in the value of the Irish Glass Bottle site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In April of this year, the Minister for Finance forecast that some &euro;34.4 billion in taxes would be collected this year.  The Minister later indicated that the Government was &euro;2 billion shy of that forecast for the nine months to the end of September.  The most up-to-date figures will be released in the next few minutes.  What is the figure for the overall tax revenue for the year to the end of October?  What is the likely impact of that figure on the projected annual revenue forecast for the year?  How do the tax revenues for the ten months to the end of October 2009 compare with the figures for the ten months to the end of October 2008?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start by responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s second point.  Just over &euro;26 billion in tax revenue had been received by the end of October.  That figure represents a year-on-year decline of 17%.  Against the profile, overall tax revenue was down 4%, or &euro;1.074 billion, by the end of October.  VAT and income tax continue to be the weakest tax heads against the targets that were set.  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s first point, the returns to be released by the Department of Finance at 4.30 p.m. show that there was an Exchequer deficit of just over &euro;22.7 billion at the end of October 2009.  The main factors in that year-on-year deterioration are the year-on-year decrease in taxes of just over &euro;5.4 billion; banking-related payments, such as the payment of &euro;4 billion to Anglo Irish Bank; and the increase of &euro;1.7 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund payment, by comparison with the payment that was made in the year to the end of October 2008.  A total of &euro;3 billion in front-loaded contributions has been paid to the National Pensions Reserve Fund to date in 2009, compared to the payment of &euro;1.3 billion that had been made by this time last year.  When the Exchequer returns were published at the end of September, the Department of Finance signalled that there would be a shortfall of approximately &euro;2 billion in tax revenues at the end of the year.  That implied that there would be a year-on-year decline of approximately 20% in tax revenue.  I understand that the data in the October returns is consistent with the earlier end-of-year forecast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Bruton has pointed out on a number of occasions, particularly over the last 12 months, that one cannot tax one&rsquo;s way back to prosperity.  What is the projected shortfall that the Government will have to deal with when it compiles its budget on 9 December next?  Does the Taoiseach attribute the fall-off in taxes to the fall in employment?  Does he now accept it was a mistake to impose taxes amounting to &euro;6 billion last year?</P>
        <P>It is difficult to accept projections of this nature from the Department on a year-on, year-off basis when that Department produced a NAMA business plan asking us to believe monetary values for ten years down the line.  Clearly, the range of taxes imposed by the Minister for Finance is now creating very difficult circumstances.  When the tax figures of the self-employed are submitted at the end of November, it will be discovered that circumstances are even worse.</P>
        <P>Job creation must be central to our approach.  Given that almost 500,000 people are out of work, and leaving aside the well-recognised problems associated with the public finances, the banking sector and the extension of credit to businesses, will the Taoiseach state the three main priorities of the Government to get people back to work?  As he well recognises, the only way to deal with social welfare lists, to get capital moving again and increase revenue is to put people back to work.  Everyone is very concerned and angry about the circumstances that obtain at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the year as a whole, an Exchequer borrowing requirement in the region of &euro;26 billion is forecast.  This implies a general Government deficit in the region of 12% of GDP by the end of 2009.  Continuing to borrow at a high level to bridge the gap that has emerged between revenue and expenditure is not a sustainable solution in the medium to long <Col N="28"/>term.  Our priority is to address this gap and stabilise the deficit in 2010.  Central to the process of stabilising the deficit at this year&rsquo;s level are the adjustments to be introduced in budget 2010 on 9 December.  The corrective action in budget 2010 will have to come primarily from the expenditure side as we have already increased taxes significantly.  Further increases in the tax burden could have a negative impact on enterprise and growth prospects.  The measures that must be introduced will undoubtedly be difficult but the imperative for action is clear and we must make the necessary adjustments now.</P>
        <P>On the question of jobs, Deputy Kenny should note it is not a question of there being 500,000 unemployed.  While 12.5% of people are on the live register, 70,000 of the 412,000 or 415,000 people on the live register are in part-time work and therefore must avail of social welfare for some part of the week.  It is important to point out there are still almost 1.8 million people working.</P>
        <P>The purpose of Government policy is to make the economy more competitive.  We have seen a major contraction in the economy this year and we hope to see growth return during 2010, even if the first full year of growth is in 2011.  It is clear from the European Commission, forecasters and commentators that there is a need to stabilise the deficit.  That is the nature of the correction we are seeking to undertake in the forthcoming budget.  I welcome the fact that Members on all sides of the House have indicated their support for that approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has just given us the general outline of the deteriorating state of the Exchequer.  It is now just five weeks before the budget, which we are told will be the harshest in history.  I am quite concerned about the general mood in the country as we face the budget.  Many are angry about their own declining economic fortunes in addition to the declining economic fortunes of the country.  We are hurtling headlong into a period of conflict, strife and considerable social division.  There are three contributing factors, the first of which is the Government&rsquo;s determination to proceed in its own way and unilaterally impose a range of so-called solutions in respect of matters ranging from pay to the general public services.  The second contributing factor is the chorus coming from hardline commentators, many of whom got things very wrong in the past and who appear to be urging the Government to maximise the pain, as if pain itself were some kind of political or economic objective.  Third, there is the threat of widespread strikes, including that threatened for 24 November.</P>
        <P>Given these circumstances, the solution to our economic difficulties will require people to pull together.  There should be an agreement for national recovery, underpinned by five pillars.  The first encompasses getting people back to work, keeping people in employment and providing training and education for those who have lost their jobs.  Second, there should be a guarantee that people will not be put out of their homes during the recession.  I invite the Taoiseach to accept the Labour Party motion on the home protection scheme this evening.  The third pillar is that the principle of fairness should underpin the budget.  Fourth, there should be a negotiated agreement on the reduction of the public service pay bill which would include reforms and economies rather than an imposed cut across the board.  Fifth, there should be industrial peace or the avoidance of strikes.  Does the Taoiseach agree that such an approach is now necessary to get us out of the difficulty we face?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>During Priority Questions today, I outlined to the House the current position on the effort to find an agreed way forward on negotiating a public pay position that would see a reduction in the public pay bill.  That is ongoing and we have continued to work towards this.  We have sat down with the public sector unions to examine what alternatives may exist to allow us to achieve this objective, apart from considering exclusively the cutting of pay.  It would be remiss of any employer, most of all the State, not to do so.  It would be remiss of the <Col N="29"/>State not to discuss with employee representatives, over the coming days, what progress can be made in this area, without prejudice on either side, so as to enable people to consider all the various options and costings that need to be borne in mind.  This process is taking place.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s statement that there is no option but to hurtle headlong into confrontation, no one is seeking confrontation.  All of us are seeking to communicate the seriousness of the situation in which the country finds itself.  Anger is not a policy and does not provide a panacea.  Everybody understands people&rsquo;s disappointment over the sharp change in our economic fortunes and the fact that people have lost jobs.  Every public representative in this House is continually meeting constituents who feel this way.  However, the issue is that the world has changed and we are in different circumstances, to which we must respond.</P>
        <P>The Government has simply been outlining the fact that it does not have a policy to impose hardship, pain or difficulty, but to confirm that the current circumstances are not sustainable.  In the interest of protecting people to the greatest extent possible, taking action now is unavoidable.  This action must be taken in addition to the action that has been taken heretofore.  The basis for doing this is to ensure that we make an adjustment that will effect recovery more quickly than it would be effected if we prolonged our approach over what could well be a prolonged period of stagnation rather than one characterised by a quick return to growth, as we all desire.  In that respect, all of us, including all social partners and political parties, have the same objective.  When people were asked about it in the media and elsewhere they accepted that there was a need for this level of adjustment, which is about stabilising the rising deficit situation for next year.  It is not a question of Government seeking to impose unnecessary hardships.  It is about Government seeking to avoid by way of inactivity the imposition of even greater hardships on the more vulnerable people in our community were action not to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Inactivity is the word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reason we have to proceed in this way.  There will be an opportunity in this House for everyone to put forward his or her position in terms of pre-budget statements.  On the issues raised by Deputy Gilmore or any other party on trying to maintain jobs, we are seeing twice as many people in activation programmes now than previously.  We have introduced the stabilisation fund and brought forward the employment subsidy scheme, which we are seeking to improve as we go along.  We are looking at reviewing the mortgage subsidy scheme to see in what way we can assist people, in addition to the 14,000 people who are already obtaining relief under that scheme.</P>
        <P>We all know the exposure of banks in this country, as in other countries, to the residential property market, and we do no service if we suggest that we are about to see an avalanche of repossessions when the total number of repossessions we have seen in the covered institutions this year to date is 20.  To give an impression that mortgage arrears are a greater problem than is currently the case is doing nothing in terms of trying to ensure funding to an Irish banking system that still depends on the international wholesale credit markets for funding.</P>
        <P>We must ensure we assist everyone, in so far as we can, with the right policy responses in all of those areas, which do not have unintended consequences or knock-on effects, which in fact negative or take away from the validity of taking the initiative in the first place.  We are committed to seeking to do that in as fair a way as possible.  Fairness in some respects can be a subjective thing but it is also an objective thing.  It is about trying to find a sustainable way forward at a level of provision that will seek to minimise hardship on the service users and to ask those who are providing the services, in the knowledge that they have already made a contribution, to see what further contribution can and must be made now in the interests of trying to ensure that the country comes through this particularly difficult time as safely and as <Col N="30"/>well as possible so that we can build again for the future and reposition the country to take the upturn when it comes.  It is a difficult time for the country and our people but we must face the problem, confront it and deal with it.  I agree that must be done with as much collective action as possible, seeking agreement where we can but also not avoiding the obvious conclusions we all have to come to in view of the state of the public finances as they currently stand.</P>

	<P>It never ceases to amaze me that every time the Taoiseach is presented with a few constructive suggestions from this side of the House that he responds with an Ard-Fheis style speech.  People are angry.  The Taoiseach is correct, anger is not a policy but it is very understandable given what he and his Government have done to this economy.  What we need to focus on now is how the problem is going to be resolved.  The situation we are in at the moment is that one can take the route of deciding, as the Taoiseach repeatedly comes in here to tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The choice the Taoiseach is faced with now is between going down the route of confrontation &mdash; I know there are people encouraging him to go that route but that would be a disaster.  We are already seeing considerable signs of the degree of conflict to which it will lead.  We are beginning to hear quite disturbing noises from some of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own people.  A Minister described the relationship between two sets of workers in this country, namely, those in the private sector and those in the public sector as being in a state of civil war.  That is not the kind of language that is conducive to getting co-operation and agreement on what needs to be done.</P>
        <P>I hear it said all over the country that there is an opportunity for the Government to get people to pull together.  That is preferable to having people ripping each other apart, as is being encouraged.  That will require, not discussions between departmental officials and some of the public service trade unions but the Taoiseach and his Ministers directly engaged in talks to seek an agreement on national recovery.  I have outlined to the Taoiseach the things that should form the pillars on which that national recovery plan should be built.  He has that opportunity <Col N="31"/>now.  There is not a great deal of time in which he can do it, because the budget is approaching and some of the threatened industrial action is fast approaching.  I again invite the Taoiseach to take that approach to try to reach a national agreement rather than to take the route of conflict and strife, which is not good for anyone.  I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to ask the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect to the Deputy, I was simply replying in substance to all the points he made.  I was suggesting that there were areas where we had agreement and areas where perhaps we have a difference of emphasis.  That is all I was doing.</P>
        <P>On the supplementary points made by Deputy Gilmore, that is precisely what I am seeking to achieve.  On all occasions I have sought to point out that the best way forward is an agreed way forward, one that is about solving the problems not avoiding them.  All of us who are involved in the social partnership process have that major challenge to confront and overcome.  It has been my approach throughout the course of this year, to seek out and obtain agreement.  Where it was not possible to obtain agreement, ultimately, on the pensions levy I had to come to this House on the following day and put a proposal to the House and proceed with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was not serious about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me, I was very serious about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Taoiseach was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the framework that has been set up since February, we came back in June and put forward proposals on those issues.  We have doubled activation during the course of this year despite the financial difficulties, and made efforts on the pensions framework, which we intend to publish before the end of the year.  In a very difficult situation where there is very little room to manoeuvre I have been seeking to provide the sort of initiatives and responses that bolster the prospect of collective and concerted action among all actors in society to try to pull through this issue.  That has always been my approach.</P>
        <P>I have also been seeking to point out the scale of the issues involved.  I have been involved personally and will be involved again in this matter in an effort to obtain agreement, knowing that on 9 December there are decisions to be taken and they are best taken with the greatest measure of agreement beforehand than not.  That effort is being made and will be made on a continuous basis.  However, we must also acknowledge the period of time in which we have to do this and the scale of the issue this year, regardless of that other question, it remains the same, that a correction of &euro;4 billion is required.  In fairness, Deputy Gilmore publicly agreed with that, as did Deputy Shortall, Deputy Varadkar and Deputy Bruton.  From memory, the correction suggested for 2010 in the Fine Gael submission on the April supplementary budget was in the region of &euro;5.4 billion.  Those are the facts.  The way we spend our money is made up as I have set out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the way the Taoiseach spends it all right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A contribution has to be made on all sides to achieve it.  That is what I am seeking to do.  Any suggestion that I am seeking out confrontation or taking encouragement from people who seek confrontation could only be made by people who do not know me.  Since my first ministry, as Minister for Labour, I have sought progress by way of agreement.  I also know it is ultimately the responsibility and duty of Government to make the decisions that we have to make.  I would rather them to be made on an agreed format than on a non-agreed format.</P>

	<P Just="Left">With regard to Second Stage of the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009, my understanding was that the Government only intended to allocate an hour and a half for that debate.  Is it the intention to guillotine this Bill or is this just the start of the Second Stage debate with no intention of concluding it today?  It is major legislation that requires serious analysis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not intend to guillotine the Second Stage debate, certainly not today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is not proposed to conclude the debate today after an hour and a half?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the supreme court in the Czech Republic dealt with the case before it this morning and I am happy that President Klaus has signed the Lisbon treaty.  It is a source of great consolation that the Irish people, in their wisdom, gave an emphatic endorsement of the treaty.  That decision of the people has paved the way for having the treaty implemented and for putting in place the structures of a 27 country Europe with a population of 500 million.</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach used to play corner forward, he was a formidable foe and moved quite fast in that position.  I am glad he has come to the conclusion that an Irish candidate for the Presidency of the Council, that is, former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, is worthy of support.  The Irish people have paved the way for the appointment of the High Representative and the President of the Council.  As Leader of the Fine Gael Party and a vice-president of the European People&rsquo;s Party, I will be happy to assist the Taoiseach in this work and to make direct contact with the Heads of Government of the 14 countries in which our group, the European People&rsquo;s Party, has prime ministers.  I believe the credentials of the candidate involved are precisely what Europe requires at a time of necessity for cohesion and coherence and for establishing a Europe that is seen to be strong and energetic.  In addition, the person involved led a Government which comprised what would be considered in Europe to be socialist and conservative or right of centre parties.  As the Head of Government, what direct contact does the Taoiseach intend to make on behalf of the candidacy of former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, for the position of President of the Council?  Obviously, I will fully support him in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Lisbon treaty was signed in the Czech Republic by President Klaus.  The ratification instrument was signed in Prague at 3 p.m. today.  This clears the way for the treaty to enter into force in the near future, which is excellent news both for Ireland and the European Union.  I welcome the fact that the court made its decision and that we have the signature of the Czech President.</P>
        <P>On the other matter raised by Deputy Kenny, I was not asked by former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, to put forward his name on behalf of the Irish Government and I was not asked to conduct a campaign on his behalf.  In the letter he forwarded to me, he said that he wished to express his interest in being considered for the position, particularly in the event that no <Col N="33"/>serving member of the Council is available.  As the Lisbon treaty will now come into effect, the President of the Council as envisaged in that treaty will be appointed.  The Swedish Presidency will proceed with confidential bilateral discussions with Heads of Government to ascertain what level of support exists for any prospective candidate or any existing member of the Council who might be interested in the position.  Until the Swedish Presidency does that and conveys to me its assessment of the situation, I do not believe anything can be done other than consider what is the position.  If it is the case, as Mr. Bruton has outlined, that no member of the Council is emerging as a prospective President, he is making himself available as a candidate.  We must wait and see how the situation develops.</P>

        <P>I congratulate and compliment the finance committee on the outstanding work it did in this House last week in its line by line scrutiny of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, legislation.  It did a fine parliamentary job and it was most unfair of the Government or Government sources to suggest that because members of the finance committee were doing their duty in scrutinising the legislation, they were somehow delaying the legislation.  However, since the Government took that unfair approach, will the Taoiseach explain why the Report Stage amendments that were to be put down by the Minister for Finance will not be dealt with on Report Stage in this House but will be tabled in the Seanad instead?  Can he indicate the additional time it will take for the NAMA legislation to pass as a result of taking the route of having these amendments brought before the Seanad first and then having them brought before this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not spoken to the Minister for Finance about that matter.  I am not sure of the veracity of Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s understanding and whether that is the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Adoption Bill is on the Order Paper after coming from the Seanad.  Before it is taken in the House, could the Taoiseach ask the relevant Minister to make a statement on foreign adoptions?  A number of people have contacted Deputies to convey their concern that if this is ratified under the Hague Convention, people who have spent two or three years negotiating the adoption of a foreign child could find themselves with the process being brought back to naught.  It would do Members a power of good if the Minister would clarify that those who are in the process of seeking to adopt a child from abroad will not be affected in any way by the passing of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The organisation representing these parents and parents-to-be has been asked by the Minister to come back to him with proposals.  It would be useful if an indication were provided as to how provisions of this kind might be included in the Bill or put in place in some other way.</P>
        <P>This is a burning issue and I am sure the Taoiseach, like every other Member, has been presented with cases where, for example, a child from Ethiopia will now be prevented from <Col N="34"/>having a brother or sister from that country.  It has been argued that the Hague Convention prevents the making of provisions by the Government but that is not the case.  The Government is in a position to ensure that where proper standards apply, arrangements can be made in respect of adoptions from these countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister concerned has been very much seized of this issue and various organisations have been bringing to our attention the need to clarify the position as quickly as possible in the interests of the many couples and families that are awaiting the completion of adoptions or who are interested in pursuing the process of adoption.  Priority questions are due to be taken on this matter tomorrow.  This will provide the Deputy with the earliest opportunity to engage in a detailed debate on the issue with the Minister.  I am of the view that this is the best way to pursue the matter in question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also interested in this issue, which is causing a great deal of anxiety among parents.</P>
        <P>In light of the millions of euro that are still being spent on tribunals, when will the legal costs Bill be brought before the House?  This legislation has been on the list of promised legislation for years.  A commitment was given by a long-departed former Deputy to introduce the Bill as a matter of urgency.  People are extremely annoyed with regard to the level of moneys being paid to legal professionals at a time when they cannot obtain any money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is due to be introduced next year.  We have taken steps in the interim under which commissions of inquiry can be regarded as an alternative to full-blown tribunals of inquiry and can assist in avoiding the cost ramifications experienced in recent decades in respect of the latter.  In a way, the Oireachtas has acted to ensure that, pending the introduction of the Bill to which the Deputy refers, there is an alternative model available to it should issues worthy of inquiry arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I raised the legislation relating to management companies.  Members have been raising this matter for approximately five years.  We were eventually informed that this is a complex issue and that everyone, including the Attorney General, was examining it.  Following a five-year gestation period, two Bills have been produced, namely, the Multi-Unit Development Bill 2009 and the Property Services Regulation Bill 2009.  When I inquired about these Bills last week, I was informed that they had been sent to the Seanad and that we would be obliged to await their return.</P>
        <P>I made some inquiries with the Seanad as to why these two items of legislation have not been returned to the D&aacute;il and discovered that the two Ministers responsible for them have failed to bring forward the amendments which they indicated to the Seanad would be required before it would be possible to proceed.  It is, therefore, the relevant Ministers who are delaying progress in respect of the two Bills, which have been with the Seanad since the summer.  Will the Taoiseach intervene with the Ministers concerned and seek to have the Bills returned to the House as quickly as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>It is not a matter for the Seanad, it is one for the two Ministers involved.  Excuse my language, but the Seanad cannot do a damn thing about the matter because the Ministers in question have not tabled the necessary amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Finance Bill is due to be introduced in the near future.  As Members are aware, 150 people, including a little girl named Joy, are awaiting heart surgery in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  Some 25 of these individuals have missed their opportunity to obtain optimum outcomes.  Will a provision be included in the Finance Bill to set aside the &euro;10 million necessary to build a modular unit, which would ensure that an intensive care unit, ICU, could be put in place in order to allow the waiting list to which I refer to be addressed?  The longer this matter goes on, the more children will be affected.  In addition, the outcomes for those children will be adversely affected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask a question in respect of another item of legislation.  This matter affects the area in which the Ceann Comhairle lives, namely, the north east, which as been beset by so many scandals.  The people in that area have suffered a great deal as a result of the activities of Mr. Shine and Mr. Neary and the cancer scandal, where 6,000 X-rays were misread.  The events to which I refer are indicative of a hospital under serious stress and reports today indicate that there are ten cases of patients being infected with clostridium difficile at the hospital in question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Title of that legislation, the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill, makes one wonder about its value and purpose.  When will the people of the north east, which comprises, among other places, Monaghan and Dundalk &mdash; the area from which the Ceann Comhairle comes &mdash; can expect to have a full hospital service restored to them.

	<P>As the Leader of the Labour Party stated, the Minister for Finance was anxious to conclude Committee Stage of the National Asset Management Agency Bill in order to bring forward, as quickly as possible, his amendments.  However, we have not received those amendments.  In addition, we understand that the amendment relating to the 80% windfall tax &mdash; the Green Party amendment &mdash; is to be introduced in the Seanad.  My view is that an 80% rate of windfall tax is a confiscatory rate and is probably outside what is permitted by the Constitution.  The amendment will be introduced in the Seanad when it ought properly to be debated in this House.</P>
        <P>If the National Asset Management Agency Bill is not to appear farcical, I appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure that this critical amendment be introduced in the D&aacute;il.

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to introduce the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009 for the consideration of the House.  This Bill places the bus passenger at the centre of a new transformed national bus licensing regime which will replace the current antiquated and inadequate regime that has applied for the past 77 years and brings the legislation governing the licensing of commercial bus services into the modern era.  This is a development which all stakeholders have agreed is essential.</P>
        <P>The Bill establishes a uniform licensing framework for service providers, both private and State bus operators, thus eliminating any differences under the current regime which may have been perceived as conferring a market advantage. We are introducing a completely new consumer centred system for bus operators.  This is reflected in the provisions of the Bill, to which I will refer specifically later.</P>
        <P>The 1932 Act was designed primarily to protect the then rail network from competition by road-based transport.  It has never been amended in the light of changed economic and social circumstances which, obviously, almost a century later, have radically altered.  The Dublin <Col N="40"/>Transport Authority Act 2008 was the first stage in the roll-out of this Government&rsquo;s programme of legislative reform in the area of public transport, to fulfil the commitments in the programme for Government 2007.</P>
        <P>The 2008 Act, allied to the passage of this Bill, will result in a comprehensive re-fashioning of the legal framework around the planning, regulation and control of public passenger land transport in the State.  The changes include the establishment of an independent transport authority, the introduction of public service contracts with quality standards for the provision of subvented transport services, a flexible but fair licensing system for commercial public bus passenger services and transparent regulatory mechanisms to achieve this.  I am satisfied that they will benefit the consumer and taxpayer in years to come.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to establish a new legal framework for the licensing of all commercial public bus transport services.  In doing so, the clearly stated objective of the legislation is the promotion of regulated competition on a national basis in the public interest, as well as the promotion of integrated, well-functioning and cost efficient services.  The essential key to the approach being proposed is that the regulation is being applied in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The new licensing system will encourage competition in a manner that is geared to the needs and demands of consumers.  The identification and pursuit of commercial opportunities will always be a matter for the operators. However, the authority will decide based on customer needs if a proposed service adds value.  The industry requires regulated competition.</P>
        <P>The licensing regime promoted in this Bill reflects the reality that there are different markets with different considerations attending.  It is this general theme which is the basis for the adoption and application of the term &ldquo;regulated competition&rdquo; within this Bill.  Addressing the needs of consumers is also the central tenet of the new EU Regulation 1370/2007, which establishes new contractually based requirements for the future provision of subvented public bus and rail passenger services.</P>
        <P>The regulation promotes the premise that where public service obligations are imposed in respect of the provision of such transport services they must reflect the need that exists to ensure the adequacy of those services in the general economic interest.  I raise this important issue at this early point of this overview of the proposed legislation because the issue of public service contracts provided for under the DTA Act 2008 was the subject of significant debate during the passage of this Bill through the other House.  That debate centred on the reasons section 52 of that Act promotes the pursuit of direct award contracts between the authority and Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail for the continued provision of their existing range of subvented bus and rail services within the GDA.</P>
        <P>Section 52 of the 2008 Act provides the companies in question with exclusive rights to continue to provide services, and mandates the authority to enter into direct award contracts so as to establish a basis for the maintenance of State funding for those services that is consistent with the provisions of EU Regulation 1370/2007.  In that context, the section makes it clear that the single overriding reason for the establishment of those contracts is the need to ensure the adequacy of public transport services in the general economic interest.</P>
        <P>The approach adopted in section 52 in relation to direct award contracts recognises in the first instance that such contracts are required so as to ensure that the existing subvented public bus and rail passenger services in the GDA can continue to operate and attract necessary State subvention given the importance of those services to the travelling public.  Were that course not pursued, the maintenance of the existing bus and rail services in the GDA would have been threatened.  The Bill before the House provides that the legislative framework for under<Col N="41"/>pinning the existing subvented bus and rail passenger services in the greater Dublin area will be extended to all similar existing services in the rest of the State.</P>
        <P>The House will recall that in recognition of the approach to direct award contracts established in EU Regulation 1370/2007, section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act incorporates significant powers for the Dublin Transport Authority to review the contracts relating to public bus services, which can give rise to the unilateral amendment or termination of a contract as appropriate.  The Bill will also realise the transfer of the Commission for Taxi Regulation to the authority.</P>
        <P>The amalgamation of a number of important functions relating to the regulation and control of all land-based transport modes on a national basis within the authority is in line with the Government&rsquo;s decision to rationalise the number of such agencies in order to optimise efficiencies and savings.  It also prompted my decision to confer it with the title of &ldquo;National Transport Authority&rdquo; to reflect its wider role now and the prospect of additional functions in future in the light of experience gained, as provided for in section 30 of the Bill.  The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to public transport.</P>
        <P>The Bill now proposes that the bus route licensing regime in respect of commercial bus services will be the same for all bus market participants, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It will establish a clear template against which applications for bus route licences will be considered, as well as a modern system of penalties and associated powers for revocation of licences.  As I indicated at the commencement of my speech, the new commercial bus licensing regime will operate side by side with the new contractual based regime to apply in respect of subsidised bus and rail services.</P>
        <P>These subsidised services are in EU terms the subject of &ldquo;public service obligations&rdquo;.  The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 has already established a contractual framework for the procurement of public transport services in the greater Dublin area by the authority in respect of these services.  The 2008 Act established a basis for a new performance-based and transparent contractual structure relating to the provision of bus and rail services in the greater Dublin area deemed to be the subject of a &ldquo;public service obligation&rdquo;.  This will ensure the best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from the still significant subvention being provided by the Exchequer for public bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann or other service providers in the future.</P>
        <P>The Public Transport Regulation Bill provides that the contractual framework under the Dublin Transport Authority Act for the future subvention of non-commercial bus services and rail will be extended to apply to such services nationally.  Parallel with this Bill, work is proceeding in the Department on drafting direct award contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann with a view to having such contracts concluded in the coming weeks.  These contracts will be for a period of five years in the case of bus services and ten years for rail services.  Given the comparatively recent development of other modes of public transport, it is often forgotten that the bus network is by far the main provider of public passenger services in the State.  It provides the backbone to the public transport system in Ireland, particularly in the greater Dublin area, with almost 150 million passengers carried by Dublin Bus in 2008.  To put this in perspective, this accounts for almost half of all public transport passengers in the State.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the provision of well-functioning bus services is vital in areas outside the greater Dublin area.  In some of these areas, there are no other alternative public transport facilities available, save for the limited suburban rail services provided in respect of certain cities.  Legislative reform, through the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932, is an <Col N="42"/>essential part of the interrelated structural and regulatory modernisation process of public transport.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that taxi, hackney and limousine services comprise a significant element of national public transport services.  Accordingly, it is appropriate that the regulation of this sector should be undertaken by the same authority, which is being given responsibility for the regulation and control of all other modes of land based transport in the State.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the further rationalisation of the institutional arrangements in the public transport sector by proposing that the Commission for Taxi Regulation be amalgamated with the Dublin Transport Authority to form a single entity.</P>
        <P>I now propose to discuss the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 sets out a series of provisions that are standard in all legislation, including the interpretation of specific words and phrases that have a particular relevance to the provisions in the Bill as a whole.  Part 2 establishes a new regulatory regime for the licensing of commercial public bus services.  Its immediate focus is the replacement by a single licensing regime of the existing legislative regimes that separately authorise the provision of bus passenger services by private and the State-owned public operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  A level playing field is being created for all market participants with no distinction between the treatment of future bus route licence applications by either private or public operators.  Furthermore, the replacement of the existing codes, especially the Road Transport Act 1932, will address fundamental issues that have served to deter and stifle rather than encourage and support the instigation of new bus services.</P>
        <P>At the outset, Part 2 sets out certain fundamental elements for an appropriate licensing system.  It addresses issues such as the requirement to hold a licence, a description of the services to be provided in terms of the route, frequency, timetable etc., categories of licences and the form of application that must be followed.  Deputies will note that in establishing all of the elements of the proposed system, the Bill is deliberately descriptive rather than prescriptive in its approach.  It does not mandate the making of regulations or orders by the authority, but rather directly addresses issues and allows the authority the flexibility to make determinations on an ongoing basis on a range of matters so as to better allow the authority to adapt the system to meet changing demands and consumer needs.  These powers are balanced by the mandatory requirements on the authority to consult broadly in its activities.</P>
        <P>The needs of consumers are central to the consideration of the overall licensing system and this is a focal point in this Part.  It reflects the advice given by the Competition Authority in the development of that particular theme.  In that context, I refer Deputies to two sections in particular, sections 10 and 23.  Section 10 is a pivotal element of this Part in that it sets out the general provisions for the consideration of applications for licences.  The section places that consideration within the parameters of the general objectives of the authority as set out in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, and amended by the current Bill.  This highlights the importance I place on ensuring that the provision of properly regulated commercial bus services will be central to the future growth of passenger services.</P>
        <P>Having regard to those objectives, the consideration of applications must take account of the demand that exists for services with particular reference to the needs of consumers.  Again, this must be seen in the context of the general objectives of the Dublin Transport Authority.  Its purpose is not to be restrictive but to regulate services to ensure service provision meets service demand.  The consideration of demand gave rise to an interesting debate in the Seanad as to whether it was necessary for the authority to consider this issue at all.  The argument was made for its removal on the basis that it was unnecessary in a competitive bus market where it is a matter for individual bus operators to apply for licences based on their perception of the market and having regard to commercial decisions.  However, as I outlined in the Seanad, it must also <Col N="43"/>be recognised that there is no guarantee that such commercial decisions will be made in the interests of consumers in all cases.  The incorporation of this requirement with regard to the consideration of all applications for licences will ensure that the interests of operators will not take precedence over consumer interests.</P>
        <P>It must also be recalled that the bus market is not a single entity in respect of which demand is a constant issue.  The characteristics of urban, rural, inter-city and provincial bus services are different and demand considerations for one may be fundamentally different for others.  The criteria that may be applied to the licensing of services must reflect those fundamental differences of emphasis.  The incorporation of demand tests that are targeted at each of those generic types of services should be a fundamental feature of the consideration of applications.</P>
        <P>Section 10 also gives latitude to the authority, in so far as it considers it necessary, to address a range of other important matters, as well as dealing with the consultation required.  This discretion arises because the consideration of all or part of these matters may not be necessary in the case of all categories of licences.</P>
        <P>Many licences are issued by my Department for which these considerations would have no relevance, for example, licences for once off events.  The authority can consider the potential impact &mdash; which could be positive or negative &mdash; of a proposed commercial bus service on existing transport services being provided under contracts, the need to increase the availability of transport and the promotion of integration and competition.</P>
        <P>In addition, it can bring to bear more general factors, such as the national spatial strategy, planning guidelines and the sustainable travel and transport action plan.  Deputies will see that there is a wide menu provided for the authority in the consideration of applications.  Subsection (6) specifically requires the authority to inform applicants of the reasons applications are refused.</P>
        <P>Section 23 provides that the authority must prepare and publish guidelines in relation to this part.  The guidelines must in particular set out how the authority will consider applications under section 10.  It is my view that this pivotal element of the overall licensing framework must be pursued in an open and transparent manner.  Accordingly, drafts of guidelines must be published.  They also must be specifically submitted to the Minister for Transport and the Competition Authority for their respective views.  This will ensure that at all times the approach to licensing is in line with national transport policy and competition policy generally.</P>
        <P>Section 19 identifies a range of circumstances where licences can be revoked, including an amending provision introduced in the other House providing for the automatic revocation of a licence granted under this Bill in the event of the person&rsquo;s road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licence being revoked or withdrawn.  Section 24 establishes a system of significant penalties for those who breach mandatory elements of the overall licensing system.  This has been in need of urgent reform for some time with current penalties insufficient to enforce compliance with existing requirements.</P>
        <P>Part 3 consists of sections 29 and 30 and provides the framework for the re-focusing of the Dublin Transport Authority into a national body.  That re-focusing is prompted by the fact that as a result of this Bill, the authority is being vested with a range of new functions that have national application, in particular the bus route licensing system, as outlined in Part 2.  The introduction of the new licensing system and the interrelationship between it and the provision of subvented bus services through contracts, underlines the logic to the authority taking responsibility for its administration nationally.</P>
        <P>Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the authority, on its establishment, will be responsible for the contractual framework for the provision of land transport in the greater Dublin area.  With the addition of the bus route licensing functions under this Bill, it is clearly <Col N="44"/>appropriate that the authority&rsquo;s engagement in contracts for transport should also apply nationally.  Section 29 provides for that linkage.  The chairman of the DTA is currently working with my Department in making the necessary arrangements to set up the DTA on a formal basis in the coming weeks.  When this Bill is enacted, it will assume the additional responsibilities.</P>
        <P>Resulting from the Bill, the regulation and control of all land based public transport services, bus, rail, metro and light rail, will be centred in one national authority.  Against that background, there is a clear logic in further expanding those linkages to incorporate the regulation and control of taxis, hackneys and limousines.  Section 29 therefore also provides that the functions currently carried out by the Commission for Taxi Regulation are being subsumed into the overall remit of the authority.</P>
        <P>To reflect the significant broadening of its role, section 29 also amends the application of the authority&rsquo;s overall objectives to ensure that they are relevant to the carrying out of the new functions it will have to carry out nationally.  Section 30 specifically provides for the re-naming of the authority as the National Transport Authority.  It also recognises the possibility of a further expansion of the national remit of the authority into the future to include all of its powers, duties and functions under the DTA Act and the current Bill.</P>
        <P>At this point I would like to reiterate that I am convinced of the robustness of the reasoning and need for the establishment of a body to oversee the co-ordination and control of both the delivery of the major programme of transport infrastructure and the integration of transport modes in the greater Dublin area.  In the Bill before the House today I am not seeking to expand those roles to the rest of the State.  However, through section 30 of the Bill, the prospect for the further expansion of the remit and functions of the authority can be pursued against the background of the experience gained by the authority in pursuing its initial remit and role in that regard.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill addresses practical and legal issues that arise as a result of the transfer of the functions of the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the authority, sections 39 and 40, which address the transfer of both the employees of the commission and the office of commissioner and, finally, section 41, which gives overall effect to the transfer of all of the commission&rsquo;s functions to the authority.</P>
        <P>Part 5 consists of 3 sections and two associated Schedules and provides the basis for amendments to a number of existing Acts.  In particular, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 is the subject of a series of amendments.  In the first instance, section 42 addresses the repeal of provisions relating to the establishment and governance of the Commission for Taxi Regulation that are consequent to the amalgamation of that body into the new National Transport Authority.  Secondly, section 43 provides for necessary changes to titles and references in that Act that also arise from the proposed amalgamation.</P>
        <P>Part 1 of the First Schedule presents a series of amendments to the 2003 Act which have arisen as a result of recommendations by the Commission for Taxi Regulation. In particular a restatement of section 43 of that Act is proposed.  This is to ensure that the prohibition on providing a service without the necessary licences applies equally where a vehicle is the subject of a lease arrangement.  It gives powers to authorised persons under the Act to seize and detain vehicles being used in the commission of offences established through the section.</P>
        <P>Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Schedule 1 address minor amendments to the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 and the Roads Acts 1993 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The Second Schedule provides for a further range of changes to provisions in the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 that provide for the substitution of the existing references to the commission <Col N="45"/>to references to the authority in respect of a range of functions currently carried out by the commission.  It also provides that the existing advisory council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be known as the advisory committee on small public service vehicles.</P>
        <P>Section 44 of the Bill provides for amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to give the authority a role in relation to the preparation of regional planning guidelines outside the greater Dublin area or GDA.  The DTA Act 2008 already provides that the DTA will have involvement in the planning processes in the greater Dublin area.  This involvement is mandated primarily by reference to the requirement imposed on the authority to make a strategic transport plan for the GDA under section 12 of the Act.  The GDA is unlike any other area of the country in terms of its transport needs.  Members of the other House impressed upon me the necessity that this should not be lost sight of in giving the authority a national role.  However, given the importance of co-ordinating transport infrastructure and strategies and the lead-in time for their implementation, I consider that the DTA should have a limited role in relation to land use planning issues outside the GDA.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, following consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Bill proposes to give the DTA a role in relation to the preparation of the regional planning guidelines outside the GDA through amendment of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  I consider that regional planning guidelines is the appropriate level at which the authority should be involved.</P>
        <P>All regional authorities will consult with the authority when they are preparing the guidelines for their areas and will include a statement of proposed actions to ensure effective integration of transport and land use planning.  The amendments are modelled substantially on the relevant provisions of the DTA Act 2008 in relation to the GDA.</P>
        <P>I would also remind Deputies that my Department produces its strategy statements at least every five years.  It also produces specific national policy documents when required, such as the Transport 21 investment programme and the more recent sustainable travel and transport action plan.  There is not a deficiency in national strategic planning.  The NTA will therefore follow the policies of the Government and the implementation strategies set out in the Department of Transport strategy statements.</P>
        <P>The transport strategy for the GDA is a different matter.  It addresses an issue that is specific to a single geographical region, and is intended to be a very practical document that sets out to solve current transport issues of the GDA.   There is widespread recognition of the need for such an approach to dealing with the greater Dublin area. The approach offered in the DTA Act of a transport strategy, an integrated implementation plan and a traffic management strategy, is specific to dealing with the transport issue in the GDA and not for general application across the State.  If at some time in the future there is a view that such an approach should be tried in other areas, then I would be open to considering it at that time.</P>
        <P>Part 6 of the Bill addresses two separate issues.  Section 45 deals with a legal obligation under EU law to provide for the transposition of Article 6 of EU Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification into Irish law.  It designates the Minister for Transport as the competent authority in this regard.  Section 46 seeks to clarify the powers of local authorities to provide bus priority measures and cycle facilities and, where necessary, provides a step-in power to the DTA.  The section exempts bus priority measures from regulations applying to local authority developments under section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, known as the &ldquo;Part 8&rdquo; procedure.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that bus priority measures will be delivered under the road traffic legislation as an executive function of the relevant county manager, with the exception of such <Col N="46"/>measures involving road widening.  The purpose of these amendments is to streamline the delivery of bus priority measures.</P>
        <P>The provisions of this Bill will replace the current outmoded and inadequate licensing regime that has applied to the authorisation of bus routes for some 77 years.  The passage of the Bill facilitates not only the modernisation of the current licensing system, but also the rationalisation of the regulation and control of all land transport modes under one body.  Subsuming the regulation of taxis, hackneys and limousines within the same body also supports that rationalisation.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the Bill will bring greater clarity and fairness to the bus route licensing code and that its provisions in general will strike the correct balance between the needs of the public for high standard, integrated public transport services, while also promoting regulated competition in the provision of public transport services in the public interest.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my appreciation to the people who helped me to prepare the Fine Gael response to this Bill, in particular Angela Flanagan, Paul O&rsquo;Brien and Nick Miller.  I also compliment the Oireachtas Library on presenting a very balanced view of the issues involved.  </P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister on several points.  It is 77 years since this legislation was changed and it is important that there is full and proper debate on the proposed changes now.  The weakness in this, however, is that the Minister proposes to take Committee Stage of the Bill next week.  I cannot understand why, after 77 years, we are rushing this through the House.  I understand the Minister has a deadline of 1 December for the passage of the legislation.  That does not add up.  We in Fine Gael want more buses, more transparency about routes and the subsidisation of public service obligation, PSO, routes, more frequent buses, more routes and cheaper fares, all of which is possible.  The rushing of the legislation does not contribute to a proper debate on some or all of these issues.</P>
        <P>It is a wide-ranging Bill but I will try to deal with some of the issues as quickly as I can.  We in Fine Gael fully support the principle of one regulation body for public transport in Ireland.  When the Minister brought the DTA Bill to the House, I made it clear that we favour a national transport authority over a Dublin one.  We oppose this Bill because it maintains a protective veil around CIE and does not offer any real competition in the Irish bus market.  The proposed new licensing system states that Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail are not subject to the new system as they will come under the direct award contract, that is, no competitive tendering.  The Bill also allows the new national transport authority to renew contracts under direct award without necessarily being subject to the tendering process.  As a result, if new public transport services are required, or when existing contracts come up for renewal, the new authority will be free to enter into new contracts with CIE companies without investigating whether other operators could provide a better service and-or require a lower level of subsidy.</P>
        <P>This Bill represents a massive lost opportunity for the State to save on subsidised public transport.  In 2008, CIE received a total grant to cover public service obligations and railway safety of &euro;321 million.  This is an annual State expenditure that could be dramatically reduced with competitive tendering.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I will but I hear some noise from my right.  It sounds like the extreme right of this House. </P>
        <P>CIE received a total grant to cover public service obligations and railway safety of &euro;321 million from the taxpayer.  I believe we can get much better value for money if we have more competition, not privatisation, through which everybody competes for the routes, for a better service, and is not fighting over political dynasties or State control of issues that go back to Soviet Russia and other such places.</P>
        <P>With no competition in the market, there are few incentives for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to improve quality, frequency and reliability of service or to cut costs and improve efficiency.  CIE has traditionally viewed any attempt to introduce competition in the market, even by expanding the number of routes and services, as a threat rather than an opportunity for the company.  CIE must view itself as a co-provider, not the sole provider, of a public transport service.  Reform of the bus market would provide opportunities for private operators and for CIE, particularly as competition in the market would increase the demand for public transport options.</P>
        <P>The Public Transport Regulation Bill does nothing to address these issues and much of the detail of the Bill would be a matter for our proposed Irish transport authority.  That detail includes increasing licence fees and deciding whether individual routes could be tendered for or are part of a network of routes.  We are being asked to pass legislation, the implications of which are not clear.  Fine Gael believes that the bus will remain the most significant public transport option in the short and medium term.  For this reason we need to reform our bus networks dramatically to increase capacity, frequency and attractiveness as a public transport option.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael model for a new bus network would be based on competitive tendering for bundles of bus routes.  That means identifying the PSO routes and which routes make money for the main carriers.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled some time ago, asking whether CIE could identify through its companies, or if the companies could identify, which routes were PSOs, the Minister said that all routes are PSOs.  That does not make sense.  There is no transparency and accountability surrounding how Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus spend money.</P>
        <P>Deputy Broughan will be happy to hear that a model similar to ours operates in London and has worked exceptionally well, with bus use increasing by 68% between 1999 and 2008.  In Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway competition resulted in significant cost reductions.  Many of these countries have a social democrat tradition, which shows that competition can operate in a social democracy.</P>
        <P>Our new national transport authority would define public transport needs, the routes and services required and benchmark the level of public service subsidy required to operate these routes.  It would create a national transport strategy, define the bundled routes and invite <Col N="48"/>tenders for the provision of these services on routes or in a geographic area, in order for operators to service profitable and PSO-supported services.  Both CIE companies and private operators would be open to tender for routes in the first instance.  This is not privatisation but competition.</P>
        <P>Winning operators would sign a five-year contract with the proposed authority to set out service standards such as frequency, cost, reliability and cleanliness.  The authority would take ownership of State-owned bus stations and city centre depots.  Upon signing of transport contracts, the authority would then allow bus companies to use stations and depot services as part of their service provision contract.  It would have primary responsibility in developing park-and-ride facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key problem is that nobody has statutory responsibility for park-and-ride facilities.  As someone who travels frequently to Dublin, I do not have a park-and-ride facility from my hometown in the greater Dublin area.  While I accept local authorities in the greater Dublin area are examining plans for such facilities, it is critical their construction is speeded up if we wish to reduce our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and get more people on to public and private buses.  Fine Gael will ensure this transport authority will drive that agenda.</P>
        <P>An integrated ticketing and pricing structure along with real time transit information is the hallmark of a modern efficient transport network.  Work on these projects should be prioritised after years of inaction and delay.  Fine Gael will amend planning laws to make local transport plans an integral part of all county council development plans.</P>
        <P>The Minister dealt with this in the latter part of his speech stating that within the greater Dublin area, planning permission for a new large housing estate will not be granted unless the developer agrees an access to public transport plan with the National Transport Authority.  Using my constituency as an example, the greater Dublin area runs to the River Boyne.  North of the River Boyne, however, it will not apply which will exclude Drogheda, a fast growing area in which commuters to Dublin live.</P>
        <P>This is the problem with this legislation.  Will the Minister consider an amendment to include a north of the River Boyne catchment area in the legislation?  One weakness of this process is all amendments must be tabled by 11 o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning.  That is not enough time to get this important legislation right after 77 years.  Will the Minister consider that towns and cities with a population of 36,000 and over would have the same exacting transport-planning regulations as the greater Dublin area?  These growing towns and cities need a proper planning strategy.  It is not good enough to say there must be due regard to the regional transport issues.  They simply will not percolate down to the county development plans for towns and cities outside the greater Dublin area.  County Louth, for example, is in the BMW region when it is in effect in the greater Dublin area.  The planning and economic issues, such as the North-South corridor, it faces are essentially eastern seaboard development issues, not BMW ones.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy has identified specific areas across the country which require specific investment models for how they will grow over the years.  The issues facing all the strategy&rsquo;s growth centres and other towns without transport plans warrant the attention of the Minister and his officials.  Although Fine Gael opposes the legislation, if an amendment to this effect was included it would make a good and constructive change to the Bill.</P>
        <P>Transport issues have changed radically since the 1930s.  We had out-of-control developers and bankers and a planning system which has led us to the appalling vista we have now in NAMA.  The bankers, the builders and the planning were wrong.  How many communities have no proper transport plans?  They are legion.</P><Col N="49"/>
        <P>The provision of public transport services in Ireland is still largely dominated by the State transport company CIE.  In the Dublin region, Dublin Bus still controls the majority of the Dublin bus market as outdated bus licensing law maintains its historical monopoly.  However, Dublin Bus has not been able to increase or change its services to meet the demands of a growing city region.  I acknowledge I met recently with Dublin Bus which informed me it is putting in place an implementation plan to deal with some issues by the end of 2010.</P>
        <P>More than 200,000 of all new homes built in the State from 2000 to 2008 were in the greater Dublin area yet the number of buses in the Dublin Bus fleet remained almost static.</P>

	<P>Indeed and I will look after Tallaght as well.  Hysterical interventions point to the hysterical person making them rather than the reality on the ground.</P>
        <P>In 2000, the total number of buses in the fleet stood at 1,039 and was only marginally increased in 2007 to 1,182 buses.  During these boom times there were still newly developed areas in Dublin such as Clondalkin and Swords that still lacked a frequent or reliable bus service.  More critically, Dublin Bus is in the process of reducing the number of buses on the road by 120 due to financial difficulties.  This will bring Dublin Bus services back to 2000 levels even though the demographics of the city have dramatically changed since then.  Dublin Bus has not managed to match the demographic needs of the people.  The Central Statistics Office figures from the past census showed clearly the high numbers travelling into Dublin by car.  The key point is that the public service obligation &mdash; what the taxpayer paid &mdash; to Dublin Bus was &euro;16.8 million in 1999.  That figure rose to &euro;82 million in 2009.  While the number of buses has remained static, the population has increased and the subsidy has increased massively.  The subvention for Bus &Eacute;ireann was &euro;7.4 million in 1999 and it has now increased to &euro;44 million, which is significant.</P>
        <P>While people may have a problem with these points, we must address the arguments presented, and the truth is we all have to change.  The country and the bus system have to change.  The bus system has not changed sufficiently in terms of what has happened in the recent past and in the context of this legislation, it will not change fundamentally for probably a period of at least five years.</P>
        <P>The effect of urban sprawl was amplified by the inefficient use of the Dublin Bus fleet, which the 2009 Deloitte report claimed could act as a barrier to use.  In essence, Dublin Bus failed to adapt or alter routes to meet the changing needs of the city.  What Dublin needs is better planning, route planning and network mapping to ensure that routes connect areas of high <Col N="50"/>population density and places of employment.  While the Luas has been a success story, the city is basically reliant on Dublin Bus, which still carries more than 70% of public transport passengers in the city centre area.</P>
        <P>When a private operator was granted a licence to operate buses in the Maynooth area, he put a significant number of buses on the route.  His view, the information I gleaned from the Freedom of information Act and the views of the Department of Transport officials all bear out that he was operating under conditions of unfair competition.  The record will show that on the first day his buses operated on that route, Dublin Bus ran a bus on the route before and after his bus and when he approached the bus stop he could not stop at it because a bus operated by Dublin Bus had pulled in at the stop.  He was not allowed to operate freely on that route.  The Department has cited a number of cases where it has been found that Dublin Bus has abused its dominant position in the marketplace.  Having such a dominant position is the wrong way of thinking.  Everybody has to change and Dublin Bus has to change.  Private operators should be able to operate in conjunction with Dublin Bus and with Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>When competition was introduced in the bus market in Dublin it did not work because Dublin Bus abused its dominant position.  That has to change too.  In this legislation the Minister is still giving Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann such a position because it will give them a direct award as opposed to introducing competitive tendering for those routes.  That is where the legislation is weak.</P>
        <P>From my discussions with Bus &Eacute;ireann, it appears it has greater synergy outside of Dublin in terms of the bus market, competition and working with other operators.  Bus &Eacute;ireann uses private operators on many of its routes and they operate with such a synergy.  They have a symbiotic relationship from which Bus &Eacute;ireann benefits because its route is being covered, the private operator benefits because his or her spare capacity is available to operate the route and the public benefit because they have the service.  That is the sort of service I want to see in this country.  Deputy Bannon will deal with the other implications of that.</P>
        <P>When I have asked the representatives of Dublin Bus to approach private operators in this city and ask them if they could assist their organisation by providing a better service on route A, B, C, or D,  they have said to me that they will wait for the Act and it will allow them to do that.  I have asked them to do that now.  That is what is needed.  Why should operators who provide buses at their own expense and no expense to the taxpayer have them lying idle while the taxpayer is paying for the other buses on the route?  We should use the facilities and the buses available for the benefit of everybody.</P>
        <P>I want to address the core of our argument in regard to the legislation, as set out in section 52, with which we disagree.  I acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Library in preparing this background document.  The Minister is operating a direct award system under the legislation for the State companies.  The document states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A direct award system seeks to address some of the shortcomings of state operation without jeopardising the state&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of public good. The system, in essence, allows for an operating agency which is bureaucratically and administratively distinct from the regulatory authority under whose aegis it exists. While, in theory the contract to operate is subject to renegotiation at periodic intervals, in practice there is not much possibility for the operation to be awarded to a competitor, as the incumbent operator will have scale and informational advantages which would represent an insurmountable obstacle to a potential market entrant  . . . .</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Instead, contract negotiations represent an opportunity for the government to exert control on the direction of the operator&rsquo;s policy, and for the operator and the government to co-<Col N="51"/>determine wider issues of transport provision, such as intermodal fare integration, infrastructure and urban planning.  As such, the system goes hand-in-hand with an agency approach to government, in which technical operations of government functions are carried out by administratively distinct bodies under government license or oversight, whose relative independence allows them to respond more fluently to changing market conditions and technologies.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">However [this is where we disagree] the system of direct awards may not be sufficiently distinct from state operation to ensure market efficiencies play out.  In essence the market still lacks any real competitive dynamic, and the close partnership between regulator and operator may lead to a situation of regulatory capture, in which the regulator becomes complicit in allowing cost-inefficiencies, to the detriment of the consumer.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The core of our policy is that there should be competitive tendering in this market.  In regard to the market spectrum, the document states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0">. . . the system of competitive tendering is designed to maximise the benefits of competition in a market, while seeking to protect the public interest in terms of route coverage, safety standards and possibly price controls. In essence, the regulator defines routes and/or bundles of routes, on which the participants in the market must bid for the right to operate. In general, the bundles will be geographically cohesive, in order to maximise scale efficiencies to the operator, and will attempt to consist of a balance between &lsquo;profitable&rsquo; routes and &lsquo;social&rsquo; routes [or PSO routes in case of individual routes]. ... the tender could range from concession charges paid by operators for the privilege of operating profitable routes to route-specific subsidies received by operators to compensate for the cost of operating social routes.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt> <P>I do not understand why the Minister cannot reconsider these issues in the legislation.  Furthermore, I do not understand why  Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are not asked to examine whether routes are profitable and do the best deal that can be done for the population.  No argument can be made for the taxpayer subsidising routes that can be operated at a profit or for the taxpayer paying for all routes.  We do not know which routes are profitable.  However, with competitive tendering all operators could enter the market.  I have spoken to Dublin Bus about this and it does not envisage any barrier to this.  It envisages this happening in five years as provided for in the legislation, but under it they could be given the right to work hand in hand with the private operators.</P>
        <P>The document further states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A system of competitive tendering was found in the ISOTOPE report to best combine the advantages of cost savings while minimising the impact on consumers. The research estimated that even without [any reduction in costs such as costs] ... efficiency gains for European bus markets from switching to a system of competitive tending could be in the order of 15% (Cordis, 1997).</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Such a system of targeting the social dimension of routes more directly by applying the subsidy on a route bundle or route-by-route basis has an advantage over the &lsquo;block subsidy&rsquo; implied by direct award, in that it becomes possible to evaluate the expenditure of public funds on a route-specific basis ....  In the case of direct award, it becomes difficult to disentangle the effects of subsidy in meeting social needs from its effects on fuelling .... other cost inefficiencies which may occur.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That is the summary of our point.</P><Col N="52"/>
      <P>In Dublin city there has been increased car use over the years.  The result of a growing city with a stagnant public transport service has been the explosion of car usage in recent years.  From 2002 to 2006, there has been a 22% increase in the number of persons driving to work by car, lorry or van.  In 2006, in the Dublin region alone, only 77,000 of the 546,096 workers took the bus to work compared to the 261,154 who drove.  The simple fact is that an increasing number of people spend more time sitting in cars on congested roads commuting to and from work.</P>
        <P>The Dublin road network has proven itself extremely fragile with minor accidents having the potential to cause long tailbacks at rush hour, for example, an accident on the M50 can bring the city to a halt.  Basically, we need change.  In addition, more people taking buses we will reduce our carbon footprint.</P>
        <P>There are many other points I want to make, but the Acting Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, would be cross with me if I tried to make them all.  In summary, my party is happy, notwithstanding the brevity of Second Stage, to tease out some of these issues on Committee Stage.  I would genuinely urge the Minister to reconsider some of the fundamental issues.  If he changes this legislation and allows more open competitive tendering, we will get a better deal for the taxpayer and for the commuter, more buses, more routes and cheaper fares.  If we do not do that, unfortunately, notwithstanding what the Minister wants to do, it will be more of the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009, which is a critical piece of transport legislation for which this House has been waiting for many years.  Clearly, reform of the Department&rsquo;s chaotic and opaque system of bus licensing has been desperately long overdue.  Labour&rsquo;s key aim in this regard is the development of a comprehensive, responsive and accessible bus system which is commuter-focused and has the highest possible health, safety and working conditions for all passengers and staff.  The taxi industry has seen a shocking deterioration of standards and conditions and I, therefore, also welcome the Bill&rsquo;s provision to subsume the Commission for Taxi Regulator into the new Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Party has long called for a national system for regulating public transport.  However, we envisaged a Dublin Transport Authority and a National Transport Authority working side by side, since transport challenges in a large urban region such as the greater Dublin area and the much more rural rest of Ireland are quite different.  Despite our antipathy to the multiplication of quangos, this may be a clear case where one size does not fit all.  The Labour Party has profound concerns about how the new National Transport Authority will be structured and how the regulation of public and bus transport in the critical greater Dublin area will evolve given the proposed absorption of the DTA into the NTA.</P>
        <P>Serious consideration must be also given to the Minister&rsquo;s stated decision to amalgamate the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority into the National Transport Authority.  I could also envisage a rationalisation of these two agencies into one aviation regulator, but since aviation and land transport are also different, I have strong reservations about the proposed merger and the manner in which the Minister is handling the matter in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I also regret that this just published legislation must be rushed through the D&aacute;il by 3 December to give full legislative effect to EC Directive 1370/2007 at the same time as the establishment of public transport service contracts for the protection of key public bus, rail and light rail services.  This is a direct result of the appalling dereliction of duty by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his three predecessors since 1997.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>The primary objective of this public transport Bill, as outlined in Part 2, is to overhaul how bus passenger services are licensed and regulated across the State.  The lethargy the Minister has shown on reforming the disgracefully inadequate and chaotic regulatory system for bus services is deplorable given that the current legal framework is 77 years old.</P>
        <P>The valuable briefing provided for us by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service &mdash; I thank this service and the Department &mdash; highlights the amazing survival of this antiquated system of laws, including the key 1932 Road Transport Act for licensing private road passenger services, and of course the Acts of 1944, 1950 and 1958.  The types, level, standards and frequency of transport services on offer bear little, if any, resemblance to that era, and yet we still rely completely on the antique, cumbersome 1932 law to regulate and organise our public transport services.</P>
        <P>As the Department&rsquo;s screening regulatory impact analysis of the Bill notes, the basis for approving an application under the 1932 Act is a proof of demand test which is &ldquo;undefined and the grounds for refusal circumscribed.&rdquo;  However, the screening regulatory impact analysis was thorough and I agree with its conclusion which is why I support the Bill.  There are numerous examples of Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and private operators who have wanted to run new services but who are left hanging on interminably for any kind of response from the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For example, the proposed Dublin Bus 41X service for the massively expanding Swords area through the Dublin Port tunnel was stymied endlessly by the Minister&rsquo;s interpretation of the 1932 Act.  Recently, Bus &Eacute;ireann applied to the Department to provide extra bus services to commuters via the Dublin Port tunnel to Balbriggan after the Broadmeadow Bridge collapse and in that case there was endless filibustering of that request.</P>
        <P>There also have been an astonishing number of cases of bus services being run where the licences have been disputed by the Department.  At present, the Citylink direct service between Dublin and Galway, which is run by one of the big four operators from the UK, operates even though the Department of Transport has publicly indicated that the company does not have a valid licence.  The ludicrous sanctions under the old Act is a fine of a mere &euro;6.35 a day.</P>
        <P>EC Regulation No. 1370/2007 was issued on foot of the key transport objectives contained in the 2001 European Commission White Paper, &ldquo;European transport policy for 2010: time to decide.&rdquo;  The directive aims to regulate how competent authorities in each member state can guarantee public transport services especially in the context of publicly funding certain transport services within the market economy.</P>
        <P>The regulation also provides stricter standards for the accountability of publicly funded transport services and the establishment of national transport regulators.  The key issue here, however, is the need under Regulation No. 1370/2007 for the existence of a contract between the competent authority and the publicly funded transport operator detailing the service that the operator is mandated to provide and the geographical areas that the contract covers.</P>
        <P>The 2008 Dublin Transport Authority Act established a new performance-based contractual procedure for public bus services in the greater Dublin area and the Public Transport Regulation Bill will eventually allow for these new contractual procedures to be extended nationwide.  I understand from the Minister&rsquo;s Seanad speech that work on drafting the necessary direct award contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail for current public transport services is still taking place, and the Minister might comment on that in his reply.</P>
        <P>If these contracts are not in place by 3 December the legal basis for thousands of critical public bus and rail services provided by Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail is completely and disastrously gone.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has been driven to distraction with the antics of Deputy Mattie McGrath and the drinks industry lobby in recent months on the <Col N="54"/>recently published Road Traffic Bill, but it is still impossible not to criticise his last minute approach on the Bill before us.</P>
        <P>I also hope that the Minister in his reply will provide a full briefing on how the establishment of contracts will affect the allocation of funding for public transport services in the 2010 budget.  The Minister will recall that he refused to do so at the Joint Committee on Transport.</P>
        <P>In recent years the Fine Gael Party, the defunct Progressive Democrats and some elements in the Minister&rsquo;s party clearly aimed to privatise key transport services no matter how short-sighted or detrimental to the public interest.  Dr. Se&aacute;n Barrett of Trinity College, for example, encapsulated this view a few days ago in an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Times</i> where he criticised the Bill before us for not going much further towards a more extreme deregulation and privatisation agenda, as he and Fine Gael clearly want.  Dr. Barrett totally ignores the challenges of providing a top-class bus service to all of our citizens no matter where they live.  We must avoid at all costs a deregulated system where operators could cherry-pick the more attractive and profitable routes and leave working class and lower income communities without a proper bus service, or seniors and other vulnerable citizens who rely totally on the bus paying through the nose for such services, and this is the record of many deregulated markets.</P>
        <P>International experience has shown that the market alone simply cannot provide a comprehensive and regular public transport system for all its citizens.  The challenges of providing decent urban and rural bus services with the disgracefully low level of PSO funding that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have historically received is laid out in the Deloitte review of efficiencies in public bus services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann, with approximately 1,300 buses and 2,700 staff, the Deloitte consultants described the national carrier as, essentially, a very efficient company.  This was even though its PSO contribution was as low as 12%, which was totally ignored by my Fine Gael colleague and which Deloitte concluded as &ldquo;low&rdquo; in European terms.  At Dublin Bus, with 1,050 buses and 3,600 staff, Deloitte highlighted a number of network issues that the company was already reviewing but, again, in general, the report found few, if any, glaring inefficiencies in the company.  Even Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd must know that year after year for the past 13 years Dublin Bus asked for more buses to run new services but it did not get them, which was a political decision by the Ministers formerly responsible, Deputies Brennan, Cullen and O&rsquo;Rourke.</P>
        <P>Deloitte found the Dublin Bus PSO payment &ldquo;equated to around 29% of total revenue&rdquo; in 2007, significantly lower than operators in cities like Brussels, Zurich, Amsterdam, Lyon and London, or even the 33% subsidy of the big four private operators in the UK outside of London.  We should not forget those operators also get an excise rebate of STG&pound;500 million.  Yet, in a privatised system, the government can end up paying significantly higher revenues to get operators to work less attractive and less profitable routes that most private operators simply do not want to touch.  This is starkly outlined in the recent report of the UK Office of Fair Trading, OFT, into the private bus sector in the UK, &ldquo;Local Bus Services: Report on the market study and proposed decision to make a market investigation reference&rdquo;.  This report is an important warning for us on how deregulation can provide seriously bad outcomes for consumers, passengers and transport authorities.</P>
        <P>The OFT investigation reports that the British Government spent STG&pound;1.2 billion in 2006-07 supporting bus services in the deregulated British bus industry, which totalled almost 33% of the total revenue of bus operators.  There was also an excise rebate subsidy, which brings the total subsidy to approximately 38% to 40%.  Yet, a Member has complained in this debate about subsidies of less than 30%.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P>The OFT report makes a number of disturbing findings which it referred to the UK Competition Authority.  It found that the UK market, excluding London, which has a different system, and Northern Ireland, which has a system more like ours, was dominated by four large companies &mdash; First Group, Stagecoach, Arriva and Go-Ahead &mdash; which control two thirds of the UK market.  The Acting Chairman, like myself, has probably travelled with some of these companies.  These companies concentrate on certain regions of the UK and rarely compete head to head.  There were significant barriers to entry and significant exclusionary behaviour to crowd out any new rivals.</P>
        <P>The allegation made about CIE in Lucan is heard again and again throughout the UK, where private companies are involved.  Average fares were highest where there is only one private operator and there are deplorable practices such &ldquo;salami-slicing&rdquo; or &ldquo;gaming&rdquo;, where parts of routes are abandoned.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd talks about privatising routes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Franchising, not privatising.  I have no problem with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Parts of routes may need a PSO.  That is the problem.  Private operators tend to abandon the unprofitable part of the route and then ask the authority for a subsidy for operating that route &mdash; that is UK practice after over 20 years of a private market.</P>
        <P>A further striking conclusion of the report was that bus users were generally price insensitive.  The report on price elasticity, within the OFT report, showed conclusively that people are insensitive to price.  If there is just one service operated by Arriva or Stagecoach, one has to take that bus.  We have controls whereas they do not.</P>
        <P>A core objective in Part 2 of the Bill must be the establishment of a level playing field for all operators in order to ensure that the bus system is strongly commuter-focused, as well as ensuring the highest possible standards of health and safety, public transport infrastructure and bus workers&rsquo; pay and conditions.  The Minister must greatly strengthen the focus on commuters&rsquo; needs in the Bill.  The Labour Party has long campaigned, for example, for the introduction of a series of technical enhancements for bus users, including integrated ticketing &mdash; which is now on the way &mdash; AVL and real-time information systems, a simplified fare structure and provisions for park and ride facilities.  I will return to these issues in my amendments.</P>
        <P>It is also generally disappointing that the Minister has not put more clear and stringent provisions into the legislation to protect the integrity of the bus network itself, especially in terms of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s network.  There are grave concerns about the string of small towns that are linked in a national network by the national operator, Bus &Eacute;ireann.  What will happen to them if we get direct point-to-point competitors, even under the legislation as it stands?  Grave concerns arise and we need to ensure that the critical role of public transport services as a public and social good is recognised within the new regulatory system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Fintan O&rsquo;Toole wrote earlier this year in regard to the savage and, in his words, contemptible programme of cutbacks to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, &ldquo;public transport is a function not just of an economy, but of a democracy&rdquo;.  It is a key right of citizenship, as the Acting Chairman knows.  One of the Labour Party&rsquo;s fears is that some of the ambiguous sections of the Bill could be used in the future as a Trojan Horse for pushing through a crass privatisation and private monopoly agenda.</P>
        <P>Section 10, of course, provides the critical &ldquo;general provisions&rdquo; for the consideration of applications for the grant of licences.  Given the inadequacy of the current laws, I welcome the fact that under Part 2, section 10(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill, the authority must take into account a range of considerations for granting a licence, including &ldquo;a well functioning, attractive, competitive, integrated and safe public transport system&rdquo;, the proposed new service&rsquo;s contribution to increasing public transport services, the national spatial strategy, the sustainable travel and <Col N="56"/>transport action plan and so on.  These are all valuable and I commend the Minister on including them.</P>
        <P>However, there remains much ambiguity in several of the provisions outlined in section 10 for assessing bus licence applications.  For example, section 10(1)(<i>a</i>) mandates that the authority take into account the &ldquo;demand or potential demand&rdquo; for public bus services in granting a licence.  How will this demand be measured, as the Minister mentioned in his speech?  How will the impact on public passenger transport services under the 2008 Dublin Transport Authority Act as outlined in section 10(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) be measured?  Do these two provisions not reinforce the uncertainty of the 1932 Act and potentially allow the authority massive and unverifiable scope in invigilating applicants?  I agree with my Fine Gael colleague that this highlights the need for full information and transparency on PSO and all other routes.  We need a system whereby we can get that information.</P>
        <P>Why is there no clear protection in section 10 for the bus network, especially the critical Bus &Eacute;ireann national network?  Bus &Eacute;ireann runs a very successful nationwide inter-urban service, often in competition with numerous private operators.  However, it also runs local and less profitable services that serve more rural and isolated communities.  If the Minister does not protect the core network, we could be left with operators vying to run the attractive inter-urban routes but no services at all on routes serving less populated and rural communities with many citizens who rely totally on their local bus.  I would, therefore, have very profound concerns that the Minister has failed to make specific provision that the new national transport authority has a clear statutory role in maintaining and protecting the integrity of the network.  Again, I will come back to this issue in my amendments.</P>
        <P>It is also exceptionally disappointing that in neither the general provisions in section 10(3) or the attachment of conditions to licences in section 23 has the Minister put any provision for the protection of labour standards and work conditions.  We must think first and foremost of commuters and consumers of transport but we must also think of the conditions of those who drive the buses and look after them.  In fact, the Minister has only put in place the bare minimum statutory tax and safety standards for the authority when considering bus applicants.  The Minister must be very careful to ensure the strictest standards apply to all operators within the bus industry and there is no scope for any unscrupulous or criminal activity.  Why is the onus of proof in applying for a licence not on the applicant to provide all relevant information to the authority in determining its application?</P>
        <P>The inadequacies in this regard in section 10 mean that, without amendment, there will be no level playing field for public and private operators.  Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann will rightly be operating within the framework of the highest labour standards and working conditions but it would appear that other operators will not be required to do the same.  There is a real fear that this failure of the Minister could lead to a type of McDonald-isation or Ryanair-isation in terms of standards and conditions for public transport workers.  Staff of Aer Lingus recently told me what is happening with regard to cabin crews throughout the airline industry, following Mr. O&rsquo;Leary and Ryanair, with staff working on contracts for two or three years in desperate work conditions with very low standards.  We could have that future for our bus workers as well, if we are not careful.</P>
        <P>Another glaring omission in the Bill is that no mention is made of a transfer of undertakings for CIE, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus staff even though the staff of the taxi regulator are referenced.  How many transport management and other staff will be affected and moved by this legislation and why were transfer of undertakings procedures not provided for in the Bill?  A further key problem is that the Minister has not specified that an application will not be considered unless the applicant&rsquo;s fleet is of a minimum and acceptable quality and the highest <Col N="57"/>health and safety standards are adhered to throughout the company?  The Minister refers to this for the period after the application is accepted but what about before that?  For example, of the approximately 6,600 private vehicle fleet, about half belong to single vehicle operators and, to date, no uniform fleet standards are applied.  Why also is there no provision that all applicants must have accessible fleets before they can apply for a license?  The Minister refers to accessibility but not in the earlier part of the Bill.  I hope he will agree to an amendment to this part of the Bill.  Will the authority insist on the vetting of all drivers at both public and private companies as they are interacting directly with the public?  We will talk in the coming days of the disastrous failure of the Financial Regulator.  We need to ensure that this regulator gets it right in regard to the matters I have raised.</P>
        <P>The attachment of conditions to licences under section 13 is another clearly deficient section, and will also need amendments.  Once again, the highest possible standards in health and safety, accessibility, quality of fleet and labour should be automatically attached as a condition of a licence being granted.  Section 13 does not mention infrastructure provision.  How will key bus infrastructure, including depots, bus stations and bus stops be maintained and regulated under the new NTA regime?  The UK experience shows the importance of depots in bus market structure, even though smaller operators tend not to have depots.  How will private operators be mandated to provide critical infrastructure for their passengers?  The Minister should have included a prescriptive section on depots and stop facilities.  Why is AVL not mandatory for all operators under section 13, given the proposed introduction of AVL and real time information for Dublin Bus services from 2010?  Why are only &ldquo;minimum accessibility standards and emission standards for pollutants and noise&rdquo; attached as a condition to a licence in section 13 (2) (<i>i</i> )?  What are these minimum standards?</P>
        <P>Provisions for the transfer of licences under section 18 are also of grave concern.  Why did the Minister simply not legislate for a non-transferable system of bus licences, so that the next company has to apply straight away for a licence?  We could be going back into the same morass we entered into with taxi regulation.</P>
        <P>Section 23 provides that the authority can prepare guidelines from &ldquo;time to time&rdquo; on the licensing of public bus services.  This section is vague and would seem to allow a future Minister or CEO of the NTA with an ideological bend towards whole-scale privatisation to re-write the entire system for regulating bus licences.  Why did the Minister not lay down core guiding principles in this section on protecting the network, and on quality, accessibility, health, safety and labour standards?  Surely there must be a public consultation before these guidelines are drafted and this should be included in the Bill.  Why has the national transport authority been mandated to submit a draft of new guidelines for opinion to the Competition Authority only?  Why not submit it to commuters, consumer organisations, to the health and safety authority, to NERA and, above all, to those of us on the Joint Committee on Transport?</P>
        <P>Even though its name is the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009, there is little mention throughout the Bill about how it will regulate the sector.  Part 3 amends section 10 of the 2008 DTA Act and refers to &ldquo;regulated competition&rdquo;, yet why is this not made specifically clear in section 10 of Part 2, which provides for the assessment of licence applications?  What procedures are in place if an operator goes bankrupt?  Will the NTA or the Department step in? I know the DTA is the operator of last resort.  Why is there no provision for a notice to quit period or a notice period for changed timetables for operators?  Abruptly stopping or changing timetables in the UK has been a major obstacle to delivering a reliable, consistent and integrated service in areas with different operators.</P>
        <P>One of the key problems with other regulators such as ComReg has been that their powers of enforcement and the sanctions they can use against errant operators have been incredibly <Col N="58"/>weak.  How will the bus licensing system be monitored and invigilated and will the Garda have a key role here?  The fine for committing an offence as outlined under section 24 is just &euro;5,000 on summary conviction.  This is much too low given the gravity of offences at stake here, and must be significantly increased up to and including a percentage of a transport company&rsquo;s turnover.  The appeals system under section 22 is unsatisfactory.  It appears that the NTA will be asked to adjudicate on itself through the use of an internal deciding officer with a facility ultimately to go to the Circuit Court.  Perhaps the Minister would consider using the board of the authority or the weak advisory council as the first course of appeal or establish an independent transport appeals system?</P>
        <P>Part 3 deals with the transformation of the Dublin Transport Authority into the national transport authority. As a long-term supporter of the DTA, it is disappointing that just as it was getting established, it is to be merged and changed beyond all recognition into a national transport regulator.  The greater Dublin area is a unique urban region in Ireland with special transport needs.  The transport needs of commuters outside of this area are very different and require a transport regulator specific to a large urban area.  This Bill clearly means the proposed governance structures of the DTA are obsolete. To use Vincent Browne&rsquo;s expression, we will be getting rid of the &ldquo;Toytown&rdquo; mayors in 2011 and we will have a real mayor of Dublin.  I presume that is still Government policy.  The elected Dublin mayor was supposed to be the chairperson of the DTA, so how can this possibly happen now?  This is a retrograde step for democracy in Dublin and the mid-Leinster region.  It is also regrettable that the major provision under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to provide for the development of a single transport brand for the greater Dublin area may also fall by the wayside with this new Act.  Section 29 of the Bill implies that the DTA will be automatically transformed into the national transport authority, but it makes no provision for a revised constitution of the new authority or the proposed advisory council.</P>
        <P>It is bizarre that the DTA&rsquo;s planning and land-transport integration powers are not immediately being extended to the whole country.  I would like to have seen in the Bill the same powers for the national transport authority outside of Dublin as the DTA has for the greater Dublin area.  This is very necessary, as has been clearly shown by examples such as the long-running campaign by Deputy Michael D. Higgins on the retention of land at Ceannt Station in Galway for an integrated and sustainable transport hub.</P>
        <P>My preference is for a DTA and an national transport authority, but given the current economic circumstances, I would propose at least the establishment of a separate Dublin division within the overall national transport authority structure, and I might propose this on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Mr. John Fitzgerald and Mr. Gerry Murphy have been appointed as designate chairman and CEO of the DTA.  Both these officials have had distinguished careers, but I was surprised that the Minister did not appoint individuals, from either the national or international scene, to these roles with direct and long experience in public transport and transport regulation.  It is also disappointing that the Minister has made no provision for the chair and CEO of the national transport authority to be approved by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport.  During the D&aacute;il debate on the DTA, I made it clear that it must not be allowed to turn into a type of &ldquo;HSE on wheels&rdquo;.  The national transport authority could become a HSE on wheels, without strict accountability to the citizens of Ireland and their elected D&aacute;il representatives.  This problem will become even greater with the extension of the DTA&rsquo;s far-reaching powers into the national transport authority.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>One profound issue the Minister must also address is the future role of CIE and its relationship with the national transport authority, especially given CIE&rsquo;s important pensions role.  I would like to know the connection there.</P>
        <P>One of the major transport regulatory reforms in the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009 is the abolition, in Part 4, of the current Commission on Taxi Regulation and its merging into the new national transport authority.  Given the massive regulatory failure across the taxi industry, many people will welcome this development as an opportunity to get a grip finally on the disgraceful free-for-all and chaos within the taxi sector.  Will all of the commission staff transfer to the NTA?  Will their current conditions and rights be protected, as is the case for the commissioner?  What will happen to the taxi advisory council?  Why did the Minister not use this Bill to amend the taxi regulator&rsquo;s powers to allow her to take into account taxi capacity and the balance of supply and demand for taxis as a key condition of issuing licences on a regular basis?   This was suggested by my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, and our legal advice at the transport committee showed this was possible.</P>
        <P>The recent programme of reforms announced by the taxi regulator has addressed some of the most serious concerns of taxi workers, but the Minister must use this opportunity to overhaul the taxi regulation and enforcement system to achieve the highest quality service for passengers, as well as providing a decent, sustainable income for all taxi workers.</P>
        <P>In contrast to the welcome that has been given to the dissolution of the stand-alone taxi regulator, serious doubts have been raised about the wisdom of amalgamating aviation regulation functions into the NTA.  I am not sure how the Minister is going to do this.  Will we have two different amendments or will there be separate legislation?  Unfortunately allegations have been flying in aviation circles that the Minister took this course of action because of pressure from Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary of Ryanair &mdash;  the &ldquo;real Minister for Transport&rdquo; as some have termed him &mdash; and that it was his intention to nobble Mr. Cathal Guiomard and his colleagues in the Commission for Aviation Regulation.</P>
        <P>Is this move only to save money or can the Minister provide evidence that will show how our aviation regulatory system will be enhanced due to this amalgamation?  Is there not an argument for one powerful but separate self-funding regulator covering all the aviation functions?</P>
        <P>Incredibly, there is no mention of the rural and community transport network and programmes in the Bill.  The disgraceful McCarthy report proposed the abolition of the rural transport programme on the spurious and untrue ground that everyone in rural Ireland has a car.  The programme received funding of just &euro;10 million &mdash; or a net &euro;8.5 million &mdash; from the Department of Transport last year.  The operators of the network provided more than 1.2 million passenger journeys in rural areas, where people have no other public or private transport options as they go about their daily lives, for example when going to the post office or to a hospital appointment.  The rural transport network is an essential service.  It is particularly important for senior citizens and other vulnerable people.  As the Minister is aware, it is an important source of local employment.  Some 80 drivers are directly employed by the 37 rural transport programme companies and a further 657 drivers are privately employed.  Pobal&rsquo;s performance and impact review found that the rural transport programme met or exceeded all its key performance indicators and targets.  The Minister said he was &ldquo;baffled&rdquo; by some of the transport proposals in the McCarthy report.  Was this one of the proposals that baffled him?  Access to rural transport is just as important as the urban transport network.  The bottom line for the Labour Party is that the rural transport programme should not be cut.  It should be fully integrated into Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s network of operators, under the remit of the National Transport Authority.  I intend to table amendments to that effect on Committee Stage.</P><Col N="60"/>
        <P>Although I welcome Part 6 of the Bill, I am astonished that this may be the first time for all the basic traffic management measures to be incorporated in law.  I have reservations about the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to extend the executive powers of city and county managers, in so far as they relate to quality bus corridors and bus ways.  Last night&rsquo;s events showed again that our councillors can be trusted to get things right, in general, when it comes to important traffic measures.  We should trust local government.</P>
        <P>In general terms, I warmly welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party, especially in the context of the contractual deadline of 3 December next, which is so important for our national public transport companies.  I hope I will get an opportunity to propose a series of amendments on behalf of the Labour Party during next week&rsquo;s Committee Stage debate.  I am getting a little worried because this is the second Bill on key matters that I have supported even though it was proposed by the Minister.  We normally have our daggers drawn.  I hope I am not losing my edge when I say that the Minister and his officials are taking the right approach, on balance, in this instance.  I disagree with my Fine Gael colleagues.</P>

	<P>I welcome the introduction of the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009.  The Road Transport Act 1932 belongs to a different era, when we had an extensive loss-making rail system and a bad road system.  The spirit of the times was perhaps closer to the command economy than to the era of competition.  The Minister is to be congratulated not only on bringing the reform of the 1932 Act, which had been discussed for at least 20 years, finally to fruition, but also on the establishment of the National Transport Authority.  He has struck a balance between the <i>status quo</i>, which is heavily weighted towards the public sector, and some of the reform proposals that were made in the past which, it could be argued, leaned too much in the opposite direction.  There is a strong case for the retention of a public service with a critical mass, in tandem with the creation of room for private competition.  That is broadly the spirit of the mixed social market economy in today&rsquo;s European Union.</P>
        <P>Bus services are the most essential and basic form of transport, especially for older citizens who do not drive.  When one travels on many buses, one can see elderly people who benefit from the mobility that is provided by the free transport scheme, which was introduced by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.  Many younger people use public transport because they do not drive for one reason or another.  They may be nervous about driving or may not be able to afford the cost of insurance.  Public transport is a good option for those who are sufficiently close to it to make it viable.  Although most adults drive, many of us regularly use public transport for convenience, to make better use of time or for environmental reasons.  I am glad to say I used the 92 bus when I arrived at Heuston Station this morning.  Last weekend, I spoke at the University of Aberdeen in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Research Institute of Irish and Scottish Studies.  When I returned to Edinburgh on Saturday afternoon, I took a bus to the airport to catch a Ryanair flight.  I do not have any problems with the services provided by Ryanair and the national carrier.  I normally use the 59 bus or the Luas once or twice a week.  I took the Luas twice last week to go to and from a couple of public engagements in Tallaght.  Public transport is and should be safe, reliable, <Col N="61"/>comfortable and convenient.  I am always grateful to those who provide it.  I recommend public transport to all Deputies, including officeholders, many of whom already use it.</P>
        <P>Although the motorway network is almost complete, other key primary routes such as the N24 are awaiting improvement.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is smiling because he knows I am about to mention the Pallasgreen to Cahir scheme, which will include the Tipperary bypass.  Other schemes, such as the Ennis to Galway scheme, the New Ross bypass and the Arklow to Wicklow scheme, need to be sanctioned as a matter of urgency.  I accept that the development of the motorway network will not solve the problems associated with access to city centres at peak times.  The Government&rsquo;s transport policy involves encouraging modal changes.  The Minister was photographed in the vicinity of the Dunboyne line last week as part of his efforts to get people to change from the car to the train.  It is worth mentioning that tax incentives are available for commuter tickets.  It is inevitable that much, if not most, of the Transport 21 investment will take place in what might be described as the greater Dublin area.  It is important that investment will also take place in other parts of the country, albeit on a much smaller scale.  There will be a focus on the maintenance of services, at least.  That will help to secure the consent of taxpayers in other parts of the country for the vast capital investment that is required in the capital.  After all, Dublin is this country&rsquo;s principal locomotive of economic development.</P>
        <P>I echo Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of rural transport and school transport.  It should not be forgotten that large towns throughout the country do not have any bus services, other than those regional services that happen to pass through.  I refer to towns like Clonmel and Tipperary, which would benefit from some kind of publicly or privately funded local bus service.  It seems to me that such a service will be the next step down the line.  Routes can often be refined to meet changing public needs or demographics.  They should link to other public transport services, where possible.  While competition is important, there must also be co-ordination.  Some cities outside Dublin have been slow to adopt bus priority lanes.  Perhaps certain local authorities have been dominated by road engineers.  It is important for the National Transport Authority to be given the reserved power to push such developments forward if they get stuck for various reasons.</P>
        <P>In the past, taxi services were often far too restricted, or even unavailable.  Today, Dublin, in particular, is awash with taxis, even to the extent of causing some traffic congestion in certain city centre areas.  I do not have all-embracing faith in the market as a cure-all for overall supply; it certainly did not work in the case of housing.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on the publication of the Road Traffic Bill, which we will have a chance to discuss in more detail later.  It is a compromise that will reduce road deaths and have the widest measure of public support.  A point that I have not seen referred to in any public comment is that country roads are dangerous, particularly at night and if one meets somebody in a state of intoxication.  A high number of accidents occur on these roads.</P>
        <P>I recently met one of the Minister&rsquo;s former colleagues, Mr. Michael Smith, a former Minister for the Environment.  He reduced the blood alcohol limit from 100 mg per 100 ml to 80 mg per 100 ml.  He faced exactly the same difficulties and arguments as the current Minister.</P>

        <P>I am convinced that people will adapt, as they have to other changes.  It is not the case that one can only drink alcohol in a pub; one can drink tea, coffee, minerals and non-alcoholic beers.  Much of the downturn in the trade has to do with other economic factors, the fact that there is a sharp recession and, in some cases, the fact that there has not been sufficiently sharp pricing.  That is a debate for another day.  I congratulate the Minister on the Public Transport Regulation Bill and look forward to the debate on the Bill he has just published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The publication of this Bill has opened up the debate on the extent of State intervention in the bus market.  There are certainly some calls to open the market to further competition.  Examples such as the success of aviation deregulation have been cited in support of this view.  My view and that of my party is that we must ensure public transport is strongly supported, particularly urban public transport.  CIE, including Dublin Bus, should be given the resources, fleets and permissions needed to improve their services.  They are going well down the road towards providing the desired service and they should be given further support.</P>
        <P>We should certainly be cautious about increasing competition in the market.  There were examples in recent times of cherry-picking of routes in some locations.  It is crucial that there be an integrated network.  If we do not have an integrated public transport network, everybody will suffer.  Unregulated competition is always at risk of diminishing the services that are offered to the travelling public, particularly those in more vulnerable communities.</P>
        <P>Those who advocate more competition as an attractive option for making up for the failings and inefficiencies of State bus companies, such as Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, conveniently ignore the important role of the State in providing public services as a social good.  We need much more clarity on what constitutes this social good.  In addition to merely granting a subvention every year, we must be forensic in determining what it is used for.  This would put an onus on public transport companies to be very clear about what they use their subvention for.</P>
        <P>Public transport is not a consumer commodity but a public service and the State has a significant role in providing it, as recognised ever since the early days of this State.  I am indebted to the researchers of the Houses of the Oireachtas for their research on the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009.  It points out that, as long ago as 1924, the Minister was responsible for ensuring services were adequate in regard to their frequency and daily duration and for ensuring they have regard to other forms of public transport available to the public in the neighbourhood of the proposed route.  While the language may have changed since then, an integrated service is crucial for all public transport users.</P>
        <P>We will finally be turning a corner when we provide for Dublin Bus services such as real-time passenger information, provided by automatic vehicle locaters.  We must move on from having bus stops that tell us when a bus was supposed to have left the depot.  We need clarity on when a bus will arrive at a stop.</P>
        <P>Smart card technology is improving and is almost as advanced as we desire.  Within the next 12 months, we will see significant progress in that area.  We need simpler fare structures.  I put <Col N="63"/>it to Dublin Bus, which, until a couple of years ago, had 40 different types of pre-purchasable tickets, that it should simplify its structures and make it easier for whoever is programming the integrated ticketing technology to bring all the public transport companies together.  A smart card should be provided that works with every type of public transport available in our major towns and cities.</P>
        <P>The operational remit and transport planning functions of the DTA will benefit greatly from strategic thinking in the transport field.  It is no disrespect to the Minister that, at present, applications for running public bus services that are submitted to the Department of Transport seem to be churned around therein at regular intervals for a couple of years.  I am not clear on the process.  It seems to involve an amalgamation of the legislation of the 1920s and 1930s along with some creative thinking from the past 20 years.  Dublin Bus and the private companies deserve clarity.  Thus, they can have a reasonable expectation as to how an application will be judged and that it will be adjudicated on in a timely fashion.  This is very important.</P>
        <P>Achieving this boils down to addressing the issues raised by section 10, which pertains to general provisions for the consideration of applications for the granting of licences.  While I welcome the inclusion of such guiding criteria as the national spatial strategy and the sustainable travel and transport action plan, I am concerned about what might be construed as a get-out clause in subsection 10(1)(<i>b</i>).  Before listing the criteria used in examining a licence application, it states, &ldquo;save where the application is in respect of a category of licence where the Authority deems it not to be appropriate, shall take account of any or all of the following: [...]&rdquo;.  At the very least, this clause is ambiguous.  It could be interpreted to mean that the authority would be granted a licence to operate a route or network of services that competes on the road with a route or network of services in receipt of a State subvention.  I do not particularly want to see on-road competition provided for in this Bill.  It has been a mess where it has been provided elsewhere.  It would have knock-on implications for State subvention and the public purse.  I would welcome clarification from the Minister in this regard.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to recent events in the area of transportation.  I was taken aback and saddened by the rollback in respect of the bus gate in College Green by Fine Gael and the Labour Party yesterday evening at a meeting of Dublin City Council.  I can well understand their frustration with intervention from the Minister for Transport and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  At least the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is a Deputy for that area.</P>
        <P>I wish to put my cards on the table.  I strongly support giving public transport a strong priority.  The decision made last night by Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors will mean that the 46A, for instance, will be less reliable and will take a longer time on its journey to and from Parnell Square and Mountjoy Square and the heart of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  That was a bad day for public transport and Christmas came early for the car park operators in Dublin city, courtesy of Fine Gael and Labour.  That is a backward step.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that we strongly support shops and businesses in the city centre, but 80% of the people who come to Dublin city do not use a car.  There is a strong role for bus services, and for services for pedestrians and cyclists as well as the car in the transport spectrum.  The signal given last night will give the SUVs stuck in traffic heading for Brown Thomas <i>carte blanche</i> to find their way around the city.  It was not a good evening for bus users or for those who wish to use our bikes and will now have to compete with private cars at rush hour in College Green.</P>
        <P>To be frank, I was surprised that the Labour Party and Fine Gael took what I believe to be a retrograde step.  I commend some members of those parties, such as Andrew Montague in the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>While I welcome the introduction of the Bill, I do so with serious reservations.  As a rural Deputy I am shocked that the Bill contains no reference to rural transport.  It is disgraceful to consider that we have waited more than 70 years for an update of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the subsequent Transport Act 1958 on the licensing of bus services, yet the Minister in his wisdom has, in effect, ignored rural Ireland.  That does not surprise me given that the Government is currently jaded, tired, weak and paralysed.</P>
        <P>The Minister does not seem to be performing.  He thinks that Ireland does not extend beyond the Pale, which is regrettable.  That is the case despite the latest Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions for 2007, which highlights the fact that just over half of all households in rural Ireland have difficulty in accessing public transport compared to 11% in urban areas.  The survey also found that the most significant factor in determining access to services was geographic location.  Householders living in rural areas were consistently more likely to report difficulty in accessing basic services than those in urban areas.  Given that the legislation deals with the regulation of transportation issues nationally rather than just those of the capital it is extremely puzzling that the Minister should, in effect, ignore the transport needs of rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is especially worrying at a time when the rural transport scheme has come under threat from the McCarthy report.  I recognise that the Government has bowed to pressure from the force of protest on the recommendations of the report, but rural transport is still an extremely grey area that urgently needs a resolution.  That is something I would like to see forthcoming from the Minister this evening.  In response to the protests, the revised programme for Government contains a brief reference to the rural transport scheme.  While I do not dispute the contention that the scheme has been extended to every county my concern is about funding.  It is all very well for the Government to state that it has committed to the retention of the scheme, but the reference to it in the revised programme for Government is to explore the provision of a full-scale transport system in rural areas using the network of expertise of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the physical infrastructure and personnel resources of the school transport system and the financial resources currently being spent on transport by the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The HSE bus service to hospitals in the midlands was discontinued approximately two years ago and the hackney service has been withdrawn from some patients in my constituency in recent weeks.  To me that sounds suspiciously like the robbing Peter to pay Paul approach normally adopted by the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Neither the HSE nor the Department of Education and Science is exactly flush with money to provide for their current transport needs.  Rural transport provision could utilise the fleet of school buses while they are lying idle between morning and afternoon school runs.  However, separate funding must be committed to the rural transport initiative and that is not the case to date.  Last July and August the Government faced massive public outcry against the proposals of an bord snip to save a mere &euro;11 million at a very large cost to our rural population.  I wish to see nothing other than a firm commitment to substantial funding for the rural transport scheme in the budget.  That will reassure people in rural areas that the Government has their well-being at heart.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Labour Party is calling this evening for a two-year moratorium on family home repossessions by all banks covered by the NAMA scheme, the provision of a service to assist mortgage holders in difficulty in coming to an arrangement with lenders and to establish as a principle of public policy, where possible and subject to reasonable limits, that a family making a reasonable effort to meet their obligations should be assisted in their efforts to remain in the family home.</P>
        <P>The dramatic downturn in the economy, and particularly the massive increase in unemployment, has created huge difficulties for families in meeting mortgage arrears.  As a result of the increase in numbers on the live register and the collapse of many small businesses, couples who bought their homes in the past decade and who took on heavy mortgages in good faith and based on their income, suddenly find that the loss of one or both jobs leaves them unable to meet their monthly repayments.  While the number of repossessions to date has been modest, there is a significant increase in the number of applications coming before the courts, as is clear from today&rsquo;s newspapers.  There is a real fear that when the position of the banks is solidified by the enactment of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, legislation a flood of repossession orders will be unleashed.</P>
        <P>The recent estimate that there could be as many as 35,000 mortgage holders in trouble is a ticking social time bomb that must be defused.  Apart from the social consequences for families, repossessions will do little for the financial institutions.  They may well be able to repossess a home but in the current economic climate they will have great difficulty selling it.  Given the number of households facing negative equity, banks will face large losses in selling repossessed homes.  Other actions, such as rescheduling mortgages, would mean the banks will eventually get their money back.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Party motion sets out a number of actions the Government should take to avoid this potential disaster.  The most urgent is a statutorily based 24-month moratorium on repossessions where reasonable efforts are being made to meet obligations.  We also propose the establishment of a mediation service to assist borrowers in coming to satisfactory arrangements with lenders, such as extending the period of the mortgage, putting the mortgage on an interest-only basis or rolling up interest for a period, and to act on behalf of borrowers in negotiating with financial institutions and public authorities in working out viable repayment arrangements.</P>
        <P>I wish to put this debate in its proper context.  An examination of the census figures demonstrates how unsustainable the Irish property market was.  Between 2002 and 2006, a net 181,563 additional households were created.  During the same period an additional 260,718 housing units were built.  Nearly 80,000 houses were built as holiday homes or as empty investment properties.  It was clearly unsustainable to have 30% of new housing empty.  However, the great mystery is that house and land prices continued to rise during this period, suggesting that demand was even greater than the unsustainable supply.  It was a false demand.  It was a demand buoyed up by falling credit standards, light touch regulation and lower interest rates, along with encouraged speculation and tax incentives on property.</P>
        <P>During this period we witnessed a financial game.  It was a game created by an unholy trinity &mdash; a union of a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, banks and greedy developers.  Why should the public believe this union has ended?  The property bubble might have burst but who said the <Col N="69"/>relationship died along with the game?  This was a game of passing on the liability for this recklessness to homeowners.  This is how it was played.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The developer would purchase an over-valued asset and the bank would provide the over-valued loan.  The housing units were built and sold at an over-inflated price to home buyers, who had over-valued loans provided by banks.  These mortgages were then sold on the international market and the banks released this money to developers once again to purchase more over-valued sites.  The net consequence is that the liability for these loans and loose banking practice has been passed to the home owners.  Of course, as part of the game, with the end of every football season the developer made his way to the Galway races tent in September and paid over his contribution.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of this game is how lending rules went out the window.  Take the example of the typical home mortgage.  Loan to value along with borrowing ratios and schedules of payment were allowed to increase without intervention.  The concept of somebody buying a home priced at four to five times their annual income was stretched to ten to 12 times their annual income, mortgage schedules went from 20 years to 35 years and the concept of 10% deposits was abandoned with the provision of 100% mortgages.  Matters got so out of hand that affordable housing was no longer affordable.  We saw houses being bought for &euro;250,000 under the affordable housing scheme.  Today&rsquo;s prices for those affordable housing units show how far off the mark the property market had become.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for duty of care, it did not exist on the part of the Government or lending institutions.  The only duty of care that was attended to here was getting re-elected to office and delivering for the shareholders in the banks.  The idea that home owners would be financially stressed or that there might be difficulties coming down the line were not part of the creed of greed driven by the unholy trinity.  The attitude was that it did not matter if people could not meet the loan repayments after a few months because it was assumed the property value would increase in that period and the bank would make a tidy profit in the event of foreclosure.  There was no harm in foreclosure because the bank would still make money.</P>
        <P>What is the position now?  It is estimated that the number of families in mortgage arrears is 35,000.  From 1 December, legal proceedings for repossessions will move from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  It is imperative that action is taken now and new measures are put in place to slow down the rate of repossession cases coming before the courts.  The issue of people being able to keep a roof over their heads is an issue of real systemic importance.</P>
        <P>What must be done?  In developing policy in this area it is important to move quickly but also to take account of the complex technical and legal issues that arise and the wide range of individual circumstances that are experienced by borrowers.  Policy must take cognisance of this diversity and, accordingly, I wish to set out a number of actions which must be taken by the Government.</P>
        <P>The core value of our policy must be that, whenever possible, families should be assisted to continue residing in their homes.  This will offer the least costly approach for the State and the best outcome for the families concerned.  It cannot, however, be seen as an absolute commitment.  Great care must be taken in circumscribing the rights of lenders and mortgage holders because, in the first instance, the relationship between the lending institution and the borrower is governed by contract and those mortgage documents are, in all cases, prepared by the lending institutions.  They are loaded against the borrowers and in favour of the lender.  Such mortgage agreements, therefore, create very extensive rights and interests in favour of lenders.  These rights are protected as property rights under the Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>I am of the view that it would be possible, as an emergency measure and in the public interest, to unpick these extensive rights &mdash; even if only for a limited number of years &mdash; particularly in light of the current exceptional economic upheaval and uncertainty.  In-built into this process must be a provision that borrowers must make an honest and reasonable effort to meet and discharge their obligations in full.  Such a scheme or provision cannot be applied in respect of very large or expensive houses and the dominant intention clearly must be that provision is being made for families residing in typical family homes.</P>
        <P>At present, the core of Government policy is the code of conduct introduced in February last.  This requires banks or building societies not to commence repossession proceedings until mortgages are six months in arrears.  In the case of AIB, the period is extended to 12 months.  Labour&rsquo;s position is that this period should be extended to 24 months from the time the arrears first arise and that this should apply in respect of all institutions.  Such a course of action would ensure that lending institutions would be strongly incentivised to actively engage with borrowers, rather than entering into an empty formula and circulating a few preprinted letters for the purposes of demonstrating technical compliance in the event that issues might arise with the Financial Regulator in respect of the consumer protection code.</P>
        <P>In practice, banks view the moratorium period of six to 12 months as a hit they must take.  However, they remain certain in the knowledge that they have an entitlement to interest on an ongoing basis and view the code&rsquo;s provisions as entirely manageable from their perspective.  The scheme we advocate, with its extensive extension of time, would ensure strong incentivisation on the part of the banks to enter into a process of restructuring whereby they could accommodate borrowers.  This process could take a number of different forms and could include, for example, extending the lifetime of a mortgage, adjusting the number of repayments per annum, accommodating for-interest-only repayments for a period or other arrangements that would suit the individual needs or expectations of the borrower.</P>
        <P>We made suggestions in respect of such changes during the Committee Stage debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill and we intend to table suitable amendments on Report Stage.  There is a need to put in place legislation which recognises the profound inequality of bargaining power that exists in respect of borrowers and banks.  This is not a level playing field.  Stressed borrowers require professional assistance and support in negotiating with their lending institutions.  In addition, it is vital that the code of conduct is strengthened and is adequately policed and enforced with a proper effective and efficient grievance mechanism.  It is important that the latter should be underpinned by legislation.</P>
        <P>To achieve our objectives a national home mortgage service, NHMS, should be established, within a legislative framework, to operate as an advocate for homeowners who face difficulties paying their mortgages.  The NHMS would, by means of a legislative framework, set out the criteria and rules as to how mortgage difficulties would be addressed and managed and would identify the obligations of Government lending institutions and borrowers.  In my view, the legislation to which I refer would have to deal with and outlaw penalties, surcharges and the endless adding on of fees and handling charges.  The legislation would also probably have to expressly provide that all such charges, other than those relating to the basic rate of interest, should be deemed to constitute a penalty or should be prohibited as being unfair under the terms of the consumer contracts directive.</P>
        <P>We envisage that the NHMS would be complementary to, but quite separate and distinct from, MABS and other voluntary groups.  Some amount of rigour would have to be attached to the operation of the process and under no circumstances is it envisaged that borrowers who make no effort whatever to meet their repayments would be granted security of occupation on <Col N="71"/>an indefinite.  There would have to be a rebalancing of rights between the conflicting interests.  It is envisaged that in all instances borrowers who remain in possession would be obliged to make repayments on an ongoing periodic basis.</P>
        <P>The NHMS could set out other eligibility factors including: that the mortgage variation would have to be fair to the borrower and fair to the lender; that an independent assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s true circumstances would have to be prepared and vouched; that assistance or relief could be made available only to owner-occupiers; or that an evaluation would have to be carried out to ascertain whether adverse changes in circumstances are irreversible or merely temporary in expected duration.  The latter point is particularly relevant because many of the mortgages that have been issued in recent years are unsustainable.</P>
        <P>Having give careful consideration to this matter, I am driven to the conclusion that a viable, robust mortgage modification programme can be delivered only by means of a statutory legislative code and that there is a need to establish a national home mortgage service.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion is designed to address an urgent and growing need.  The number of people in mortgage arrears is likely to reach 35,000 in the coming year.  The number of repossession orders in the courts has doubled during the past 12 months and there is a real concern that when the banks get back into gear, they will rev up to evict rather than assist those in trouble.  There is a need for the Government to show leadership.  The measures in this motion set out the way forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It serves no public good to force families out of their homes because they can no longer meet their mortgage repayments.  These are families who are caught in a property spiral caused by the greed, hubris and gross incompetence of developers, banks and a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  These people are so desperate that they rely on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  They are the self-employed, the recently unemployed &mdash; the new middle class poor.  They are young couples who bought under the shared ownership scheme run by local councils, often going to the very limits of their incomes in order to purchase homes.  Incredibly, there is no national data relating to arrears on this scheme but any Deputy will be aware of cases where people are in arrears.</P>
        <P>It is vital that the Government adopt this motion.  I congratulate Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch on introducing it.  The Government must do much more to address the housing crisis.  We must assist householders who are unable to meet their mortgage payments.  The motion should be also the springboard for a much wider policy approach.</P>
        <P>The position relating to housing practice has been completely transformed.  A change in housing policy is now required.  The old way of incentivising people at work to buy in the private market no longer works.  We are operating in a new landscape.  From a reasonable level, the construction of local authority housing has dwindled to a trickle.  According to the CIF, there are now more than 80,000 privately built housing units lying idle.  There are approximately 35,000 families and individuals who are seeking council housing but who cannot afford to buy.  Even if they could do so, the banks will not lend to them.  Rent supports, particularly the rent supplement, are  being reduced and threatened with further cuts in the budget.  The Government expects that tenants can negotiate lower rents with their landlords.  However, many tenants are too insecure to do this.  We must, therefore, get real.</P>
        <P>Opportunities exist in the context of policy development.  A carbon tax is promised in the budget.  The revenue generated by such a tax could be used to address the fuel poverty of householders in both public and private housing.  A housing strategy should provide for retrofitting older public housing stock, in particular.  Therefore, a new housing strategy is required.  By <Col N="72"/>supporting this motion, which is aimed at dealing with an urgent demand which has arisen and which was largely created as a result of its own reckless policies, the Government would be taking a first step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion.  I compliment Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch on its introduction.  This is one of the most important and practical motions to be placed before the House for many years and the Government should embrace it in its totality.  There should be no ifs, buts or maybes.  The Government should not hide behind the concept of the voluntary code of conduct for banks and credit institutions that was put in place last February.  The gap between something that is voluntary and something that is statutory is as wide as the Gap of Dunloe.  It means nothing.  One could drive a coach and four through it.  </P>
        <P>The spectre of repossession of and consequent eviction from one&rsquo;s home is an horrific prospect for anybody, in particular the families involved.  It leaves an indelible footprint on a person&rsquo;s mind and is an experience one never forgets.  I know of a family who emigrated in 1965.  I sought them out some 30 years later and spoke to the children, with some of whom I had attended school.  The spectre of emigration is once again raising its head.  We will be in severe dereliction of duty if we do not address it.  For this reason, the Government should embrace the motion before the House.</P>
        <P>During the debate on NAMA, I stated that it must definitively end the notion of housing as a speculative asset rather than a basic social need.  This debased approach has left us with more than 50,000 people on the housing waiting list while there are thousands of unsold houses in many towns and villages.  Weeds are growing through their windows and the builders are being rescued by NAMA.  If NAMA is to have the support of the taxpayers who fund it, we must ensure a social dividend for the wider community commensurate with the normal sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money necessary to fund it.</P>
        <P>Of concern to the Labour Party and many people we encounter on the streets or in our clinics is the significant increase in the number of people, in particular young people, who paid exorbitant or unsustainable prices for their homes.  They now find themselves unable to meet their loan commitments and in the zone of negative equity.  People say to me that there is no form of NAMA for people who find themselves in that position.  There is no NAMA to deal with the type of dilemma in which these people find themselves.</P>
        <P>It would be a significant dereliction of the duty of this House if the banks were not required, as part of the conditions for receiving the unprecedented injection of taxpayers&rsquo; cash, to recognise the difficulties these people are now in and to devise appropriate measures and schemes tailored to ensure that their homes will not be subject to repossession orders.  The banks have a recognisably defined obligation in this regard as set out so eloquently tonight by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.  It will be some kick in the teeth to taxpayers and the public if, as soon as the President signs the NAMA legislation into law, there is a frenzy of court applications for repossessions because unfortunate people have defaulted on their loans.</P>
        <P>This motion is not about people who deliberately refrain from honouring their commitments.  We all know there are people who engage in that process.  This is about people whose luck has run out and who find themselves on hard times.  I do not know whether the Government has given any consideration to the motion.  The Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, is in the House, but where is the Minister with responsibility in this area who should be here to debate the motion?</P>

	<P>This is a gaping wound that will continue to widen.  I do not trust the banks.  As soon as the Bill is signed into law, there will be a deluge of applications for repossessions.  They are all holding their powder; they are very cute.  Also, they will have statutory backing to do this.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 comes into force on 1 December 2009.  Under this legislation, proceedings in respect of mortgage repossessions will be dealt with in the Circuit Court rather than the High Court.  This will lead to speedy transactions and less costs.  While this may be good from the mortgagees point of view, it also gives less time for the borrower to find his or her feet.  One could have one&rsquo;s case processed before one knows what is happening.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like another hour.  We must focus on assisting people to continue to live in their homes.  What good will speedy repossession orders serve other than to transfer to the State the burden of having to find alternative accommodation for families through the supplementary welfare scheme?  We are already spending &euro;550 million in this regard.  What is the logic or sense of selling or attempting to sell repossessed properties in a depressed or falling market when it is highly probable that the initial mortgage capital outlay will not be redeemed?  It is easy, as Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch stated, for a credit institution or bank to purport to comply with a code of practice by merely sending out peremptory demands and engaging in a paper process rather than having proper and full engagement with the borrower in terms of negotiating, for example, interest only repayments, rolled up interest for a period, the extension of the period of a mortgage or an agreement on repayment schedule that suits the individual needs of the borrower.</P>
        <P>A question arises as to who is the advocate for the borrower when he or she finds themselves in this position.  All mortgage documents are drawn up by the banks who have every legal process behind them.  They are the ones who have real power.  The inequality of Ireland&rsquo;s provisions are loaded: the presumption of dominance is in favour of the bank and institutions while we, the little people, sit at the table and sign up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch has proposed that we should put this into abeyance for a specified period.  Twenty four months is a fair period to give people a chance to get back on their feet.  This proposal would need to be statutorily backed as a code of conduct is voluntary.  We must request the banks and building societies not to initiate repossession proceedings when a person defaults on his or her mortgage repayments for a specified period.  It is time the proposal put forward by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch this evening was adopted.  He proposed the introduction of a mechanism which would help tilt the balance in favour of the borrower experiencing genuine difficulties at this time.</P>

	<P>I, too, commend Deputy Lynch on bringing this motion before the House this evening.  I concur with Deputy Penrose who expressed disappointment that the Minister is not present tonight.  </P>
        <P>The wording of the Government amendment to the motion indicates the priorities of Government as opposed to the priorities of the Labour Party.  We are focused on the basic right of a person to have a home, to protect it and to remain in it in times of difficulty.  The Government&rsquo;s response is in stark contrast to what happened when in the dark of night approximately a year ago the banks went to the Minister for Finance and told him of their troubles.  All the guns were brought out blazing and &euro;54 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money was put at risk.  Everything was turned upside down to protect the banks.  There is absolutely no sense, given the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion, of caring on the part of the Government about the plight of families who are losing their homes, and there are many of them.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>I know of a family, a young husband and wife with two small children, who, when the husband lost his job owing to the downturn, had to walk away from their home and return to live with the wife&rsquo;s parents.  We all know of such families.  The contrast between the sense of urgency about the difficulties of the banks and the urgency of this matter is in the wording of the amendment which states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0">the introduction of a blanket two year moratorium as proposed runs the substantial risk of creating unfavourable perceptions in credit markets about the future performance of a significant part of Irish bank lending and that such a perception could increase funding difficulties and raise funding costs for Irish banks with damaging consequences for all of their customers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A caring Government should have as much concern for the lives of ordinary citizens of this country who are in difficulties as it has for the banks.  The preamble of the Government&rsquo;s response is about putting things off and having no sense of urgency.  The amendment also states that the issue of expanding mortgage support measures will be examined and that the renewed programme for Government envisages reform of debt enforcement.</P>
        <P>The final sentence of the Government&rsquo;s amendment states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0">expresses its confidence in the success of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to deal with the world wide financial crisis and its impact on Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government is delusional about the fact that there is a difference between cyclical and structural difficulties and in absolute and total denial of the part caused by mismanagement by Government during the past 12 months.  I despair, when I read statements like that, at the ability of Government to care about the ordinary citizens of this country and their right to a home and a job, the type of issues of concern to the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>The reason people are unable to repay their mortgages is that they were sold overpriced houses, given unsustainable loans, as outlined by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch in detail, and they have lost their jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;none of which is the fault of the people who took out the mortgages.  It is, as again outlined by Deputy Lynch, the fault of the triumvirate, the banks, the developers and the Government, who, in cahoots, totally inflated the price of houses for ordinary people.  These ordinary people are now in trouble, but it is obvious from the wording of the amendment that the Government does not care about their plight.  </P>
        <P>I strongly support Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch&rsquo;s proposal, which is reasoned and well thought out, which seeks a two year moratorium for mortgage holders given the circumstances in which we find ourselves with hundreds of thousands of people losing their jobs.  Most of those people have a genuine hope of getting back to work if we can get together and create a programme of national recovery, as outlined by the Labour Party leader this morning.  If we get together and figure out how to sort out the problems of the country, there is a prospect these people will be able to begin to pay their mortgages again in two years, but they cannot do it in six months.  There seems to be no engagement by the Government with the ordinary people who are affected by the downturn.  It is doing everything it can to sort out the problems of the banks and the developers, but nothing for the ordinary people.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre as deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an r&uacute;n r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Bh&iacute; an ceart ag an Teachta <Col N="75"/>O&rsquo;Sullivan nuair a d&uacute;irt s&iacute; go raibh g&aacute; leis an r&uacute;n seo a ghlacadh anois.  C&eacute; go bhfuil an t-am thart le rud a dh&eacute;anamh do go leor daoine, t&aacute; an t-am tagtha le rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh agus ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an bhfadhb seo go pr&aacute;inneach.</P>
        <P>This is an appropriate and timely motion and the Labour Party, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch in particular, has put forward a sensible proposal.  I welcome the motion and agree it is urgent to deal with the issue.  If one was unaware of the urgency, one would only need to look at the ESRI report of two weeks ago which stated that a further 35,000 families would be unable to pay their mortgages next year.  What is in store for these people?  They are at the mercy of the banks and credit companies who harass them and they face legal repossession and all that entails.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should remember that when people take out a mortgage their intention is to purchase a home in which they will live and put their personal mark.  They invest in a property and their future.  They do not want to be in a situation where they default and endanger their investment and home.  They want to be able to come up with some way to hold on to their home until such time as they can overcome the financial problems they face.  In the main, these financial problems and the predicament in which they find themselves are not of their making.  I know nobody who would gladly walk away from his or her investment.  The problem is these people are faced with no alternative, because the Government, despite warnings this was what was going to happen, has not moved in any urgent way to address the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The only criticism I would have of the motion is that it does not deal with the issue of the banks which are not covered by the guarantee.  We need to find a mechanism to ensure that those institutions are covered by the proposal put forward in the motion.  All of them operate under a licence given by the State.  Therefore, there is a mechanism to deal with the issue, but we must ensure we enforce it.  We must ensure that all banks and lending institutions, such as Smart Mortgages or Start Mortgages are included.  These companies seem to be intent on throwing out anybody who defaults for even one week or month on a mortgage.  Such companies operate under licence here, but the State has not moved to ensure they respect and have compassion for the people undergoing great financial strife.</P>
        <P>I do not expect the Government to do anything about this, because this is the same Government that allowed the financial institutions to have 190% interest rates in some cases.  Some credit companies are licensed by the State to charge that amount.  Therefore, I do not expect the Government to act.  However, we on the Opposition side of the House must try to force the Government to pay heed to what is happening.  We should remember that this is the Government that allowed a situation develop where mortgages of 100% and even 110% were offered to people who could not afford the repayments.  These are now the people stuck with a noose around their necks.  They have 30 and 40 year mortgages, but given their age they will not be able to reschedule them.</P>
        <P>There has been wanton breaches of the guidelines and the laws laid down by the Central Bank on lending.  However, the people who will be punished for the breaches are not the bank managers or the financial institutions that allowed these practices but those who took out mortgages.  They were encouraged by the Government and many others to invest and had no alternative.  The Government wanted people to have mortgages because this gave them the cash cow called stamp duty.  It raked in the duty for years but now is not willing to pay back people who paid duty.  If even a small portion of the amount of money taken in stamp duty had been set aside to help people in trouble in the current difficulties to reschedule their mortgages, bail them out or buy some type of equity in their homes in order to prevent repossessions, the stamp duty they paid would at least have some benefit.  However this is not the <Col N="76"/>case.  All the benefit went to the Government.  Not only did the Government get stamp duty, it also gained significantly from VAT.</P>
        <P>The only people who benefited were property speculators with friends in the construction industry who managed to avail of special tax incentives and reliefs.  They did not play their part as taxpayers but benefited from the Celtic tiger.  They may be struggling now, but they are the ones who are being bailed out.  I guarantee that many of them have personal wealth hidden away which will not see the light of day here.  We on the Opposition side of the House are being encouraged by the Government to support the bailout of these people through NAMA.</P>
        <P>What should happen is that empty and completed houses all around the country should be confiscated and given to local authorities so that if people end up on the street because of repossession there will be some kind of social housing available for them.  We already have a huge crisis with regard to local authority housing because local authorities do not have sufficient stock.  There are some 40,000 families on waiting lists.  If we consider the 35,000 families facing repossession next year because they will not be able to afford their mortgages, we could end up with 75,000 families on the housing waiting list then, with no Government plans to build or purchase any more social housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has an opportunity to act now.  Given that the State is bailing out developers, he has the opportunity to confiscate &mdash; not subsidise, pay for or compulsorily purchase &mdash; and transfer free of charge these homes and half-completed estates to local authorities.  He could even transfer them to co-operatives of residents or tenants who would be able to put some money towards completing them.  I put that suggestion to the Minister.  It is a pity the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Minister for Finance are not present.  We are going through major negotiations with banks and once NAMA is enacted, that will be the end of the negotiations and we will no longer have any opportunity to have these remedies pushed through.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This motion is a credible attempt to address the problem.  However, we also need to address the scandal of fixed rate mortgages.  People on these mortgages are being screwed day in and day out by banks we are bailing out, yet they are making no attempt to help those caught in the bind of a fixed rate mortgage.  We need to address this issue and ensure that no penalties are applied to those who want to reschedule their mortgages to take account of the substantially lower interest rate that pertains currently.</P>
        <P>The big challenge for us is that enactment of the legislation means we need a property boom in the future if NAMA is to be successful.  That means that interest rates will increase and those who are currently in dire straits will not benefit.  Unless we address their problems now, they will not be in the housing market in the future, they will be homeless and the State will have to pick up the tab.  That is why I encourage the transfer, free of charge, to local authorities of empty housing stock across the country.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;notes that:</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />legal repossessions of home owners reported by the institutions covered by the guarantee amount to 20 in the first nine months of this year;</P><Col N="77"/>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the mortgage interest subsidy scheme provides an important safety net for mortgage borrowers who get into difficulties and that more than 14,000 families are now benefiting from this support;</P>
      <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the number of home owners in arrears (90 days) with institutions covered by the State guarantee is currently of the order 15,000-16,000 and that the rate of increase in arrears has moderated notably since the early months of this year;</P>
       <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the introduction of a statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears earlier this year reinforces existing practices at mainstream mortgage lenders and extends legally obligatory protection to all mortgage borrowers;</P>
       <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the code of conduct on mortgage arrears already requires lenders to explore alternatives with borrowers in difficulty and prohibits seeking repossession &ldquo;until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative payment schedule&rdquo;;</P>
       <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the code of conduct on mortgage arrears already provides that, where circumstances warrant it, the lender must refer the borrower for guidance to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) or an appropriate alternative;</P>
     <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the renewed programme for Government envisages an examination of ways of expanding mortgage support measures and new measures to protect families having difficulties including the introduction of new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments;</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the renewed programme for Government also provides for the existing statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) and the MABS on debt default to be further reviewed with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations, including for example, the use by banks and lenders of more flexible mechanisms to avoid foreclosure in appropriate circumstances and that these could include:</P>
       <P LI="5" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />reduced rates;</P>
      <P LI="5" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />longer maturity dates;</P>
     <P LI="5" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />rolling-up of outstanding interest;</P>

   <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the renewed programme for Government envisages that ways of expanding mortgage support measures will be examined with reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions;</P>
       <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the renewed programme for Government envisages reform of debt enforcement in light of the deliberation of the Law Reform Commission, which has recently published a consultation paper on the matter, the regulation of debt collection agencies, a new system of personal insolvency regulations allowing for a statutory non-court-based debt settlement system, and the establishment of a central debt <Col N="78"/>enforcement office to remove as many debt enforcement proceedings from the courts as possible;</P>
      <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Irish banks continue to rely on international credit markets for a substantial part of their funding and that conditions in those markets, though easier than earlier this year, remain difficult;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />rating agencies, perhaps influenced by the high rates of default and repossession on mortgages in the US and UK, are known to be sensitive to anything affecting mortgage lending and are aware that it makes up a large portion of Irish banks balance sheets; and</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the introduction of a blanket two year moratorium, as proposed, runs a substantial risk of creating unfavourable perceptions in credit markets about the future performance of a significant part of Irish bank lending, and that such a perception could increase funding difficulties and raise funding costs for Irish banks, with damaging consequences for all of their customers;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">commends:</P>

        <P LI="3" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the Government for its increased support for the mortgage interest subsidy scheme; and</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>expresses its confidence in the success of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to deal with the world-wide financial crisis and its impact on Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">The Government is conscious of the high value placed on home ownership in Ireland and of the efforts Irish people make to<i> </i>secure and retain their own home.  Wolfe Tone&rsquo;s and Todd Andrews&rsquo;s &ldquo;men of no property&rdquo; have become, in 90 years of independence, in most cases the men and women of some property.  There has been a huge improvement in housing conditions to which all parties have contributed.  I hope the current experience will cure us for good of what Deputy Penrose referred to as seeing residential property as a speculative asset.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s objective from both a social and an economic policy point of view, an objective shared on all sides of the House, is that home owners who lose their jobs should be assisted to retain their homes during their period of unemployment.  This is being done through the application of the new code of conduct on mortgage arrears, support from the mortgage interest scheme under the supplementary welfare allowance system and the provision of advice on debt management through the Money Advice Budgeting Service.</P>
        <P>The housing market has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn.  I have a clear recollection in the other House of Deputy Noel Ahern, as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, expressing grave reservations about 100% mortgages, let alone anything higher.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, am I to understand that not only is the Minister not coming into the House, the script being read by the Minister of State on the Government position is not being distributed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no requirement for a Minister to circulate a script.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="79"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the script will be circulated nonetheless.</P>
        <P>Most of the proposals by parties in advance of the last election were measures to keep the housing boom going.  As far as Government revenues from stamp and other duties were concerned, they were used for economic and social purposes, such as extra special needs assistants, roads, higher pensions, child benefit and benchmarking for the public service.  It was not just used for the benefit of property developers.</P>
        <P>It is a large and complex sector but I want to focus initially on the proposals for a moratorium scheme that would provide a minimum period of 24 months from the time the mortgages first go into arrears.  It is a priority of the Government to ensure as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  Home repossession should be and generally has been the last resort for the lender.</P>
        <P>The new code of conduct on mortgage arrears which was published by the Financial Regulator last February applies to all regulated lenders on a statutory basis and replaces an earlier voluntary code operated by the mainstream lenders.  This code applies only to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in Ireland.  Lenders must distinguish between borrowers who are genuinely unable to pay and those who could pay some or all of the arrears but will not.  All genuine cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, who must explore with the borrower a number of alternate repayment measures.</P>
        <P>The requirements of the consumer protection code, including those on mortgage arrears, continue to apply.  The Financial Regulator will monitor compliance with the codes through its programme of on and off-site inspections.  In 2009 the Financial Regulator undertook an on-site themed inspection on arrears and repossessions handling in selected mortgage lenders.  This work is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The main features of the code include early recognition of problems, where as soon as even one payment is missed, lenders must communicate with the borrower to establish in the first instance why the repayment schedule has not been adhered to and, second, how the situation may be rectified.  There is also provision for active management of arrears problems &mdash; a plan for clearing the mortgage arrears can be developed that is consistent with the interests of both the lender and the borrower and having regard to all viable options open to the borrower.  Furthermore, there should be an examination of alternative solutions, where the lender must explore with the borrower alternative repayment measures including an arrangement changing the amount of monthly repayment to help address the arrears situation; deferring payment for a period where there is a temporary shortfall of income; extending the term of the mortgage; and changing the type of the mortgage.  Even where legal action is being taken, if agreement can be reached, and agreed regular repayments are being maintained, the lender must put a hold on proceedings.</P>
        <P>The lender must not seek repossession of the property until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment schedule with the borrower.  The code requires a lender to wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession.  AIB and Bank of Ireland, which have been recapitalised by the State, have extended this moratorium period to 12 months for the duration of the subscription agreement.</P>
        <P>Comprehensive statistics on mortgage repossessions have not been kept, but the Department of Finance has obtained reports from lenders covered by the State guarantee.  The total of legal repossessions of owner-occupier homes in this year to the end of September by those lenders is 20.  In all cases, mortgages were in arrears for over 24 months at time of repossession.</P><Col N="80"/>
        <P>Media reports of repossession cases taken through the courts show that most involve &ldquo;sub-prime&rdquo; lenders, who made mortgages available to borrowers who would not have been customers of the mainstream lenders, often because of perceived higher risks.  Cases where borrowers stopped payment after a few months, or failed to respond to repeated attempts to contact them, or even abandoned the house, feature regularly in media reports of repossession cases before the courts.</P>
        <P>A comparison of repossession figures for IBF members who are the mainstream lenders, not including sub-prime, with figures from the UK Council of Mortgage Lenders indicates UK repossession rates per 100,000 mortgages at 30 times those in Ireland.  The number of residential properties taken into possession by Irish Banking Federation members in 2008 was only 99 and, for the first half of 2009, the number was only 70.  These figures include some voluntary repossessions and buy-to-let properties.  There were very few legal repossessions of owner-occupiers.</P>
        <P>Since activity in the property market has remained low, it is very difficult to assess realistic price levels.  Many who bought at high loan-to-value rates close to the peak of the market are in negative equity now, but any estimate of how many there are, or how long the position is likely to last is largely speculative.  In any event, being in negative equity does not change the level of mortgage payments, so the problems it may cause are more long-term.  The Financial Regulator has estimated that only a small proportion of borrowers with the covered institutions who are in negative equity are in arrears on their payments.  For the moment interest rates have fallen considerably.</P>
        <P>Mortgage arrears continue to be closely watched.  The percentage of homeowners in arrears is notably lower than for investors according to the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s retail credit report on the covered institutions.  While the numbers in arrears are still rising, figures for the second quarter show a marked slowdown in the growth of arrears from the first quarter.  The number of homeowners in arrears for 90 days or more with institutions covered by the State guarantee is currently of the order 15,000-16,000.</P>
        <P>The proposal to extend moratoria has the potential to cause serious funding problems for Irish banks, and ultimately for the State itself.  It must be emphasised that Irish banks continue to rely to a significant extent on international credit markets for funding.   Those markets are aware that Irish banks are heavily exposed to the residential mortgage market.  Given that mortgage default rates are much higher in some other countries than here, there is already a perception of risk in connection with the Irish banks mortgage loan books that is higher than is justified.  When the 12 month moratorium by AIB Bank and Bank of Ireland was announced as part of the recapitalisation, Moody&rsquo;s rating agency was quite critical.   Recently the Fitch rating agency published comment with some negative material about mortgage lending in Ireland.  While the banks&rsquo; funding position has improved in recent months, it is still quite difficult, even with the benefit of the guarantee.  It is essential, therefore, that nothing is done to raise further fears about the quality of mortgage loan books.  It is fine to have caring attitudes, and we all share them, but we must be careful not to do things that will make matters very much worse for everybody.  That also applies to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s proposal for confiscation of properties which may sound good in a rhetorical sense but if it causes a collapse of confidence in the Irish economy, it is not a very bright idea.</P>
        <P>The mortgage interest subsidy scheme under the supplementary welfare allowance system provides money, subject to a means test, towards the interest payments on a home mortgage.  The number of people being assisted by the scheme has risen sharply from a low base and stands at over 14,000 since the end of September.  Applications to the scheme are regarded as <Col N="81"/>lagging unemployment by some months and the increase in numbers is expected to continue for some time.  Funding for the scheme has been substantially increased for 2009.  A review of the scheme is under way and is expected to be completed later this year.</P>
        <P>Those availing of part-time employment, that is, up to 30 hours a week, and-or training opportunities or who are in receipt of basic social welfare payments can receive mortgage interest supplement subject to satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  A person is disqualified from mortgage interest supplement while she or he, or her or his spouse, is engaged in full-time employment in excess of 30 hours a week.  The assessment for the existing mortgage interest supplement scheme, however, provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as employment and earnings increase.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest supplement is normally only paid for the duration of the period to which entitlement exists.  A community welfare officer may, however, award mortgage interest supplement for a period of not more than 12 months, where the amount of mortgage interest exceeds such amount as the community welfare officer considers reasonable to meet residential needs.  This allows time for the person to make alternative housing arrangements.</P>
        <P>In excess of 14,000 people are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of over 200% over those receiving payment at the end of 2007.  Over 71% of those are in payment for less than a year and almost 2,300 are in payment for 18 months or more.  Expenditure on mortgage interest supplement was &euro;12.2 million in 2007, some &euro;27.6 million in 2008 and &euro;40 million was included in the 2009 supplementary budget, although it is expected that final out-turn for 2009 may be &euro;60 million.  People are expected to make a contribution of &euro;24 from 1 June 2009.</P>
        <P>A review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is ongoing and this involves representation from the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a representative from the Financial Regulator.  The purpose of the review is to examine how the scheme can better meet its objective of catering effectively for those who need short-term assistance when they are unable to meet their mortgage interest payments in particular, given the increased number of those in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  All aspects of the existing scheme are being examined and the group hopes to issue recommendations by the end of 2009.  The initial output from the review has been the issue of guidance notes on specific and operational issues for community welfare officers operating the scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government funds the Money Advice Budgeting Service, MABS, which provides valuable help to those in difficulty.  A new debt protocol agreement has been finalised with MABS and the Irish Bankers Federation, which provides added reassurance for borrowers with the most difficult issues.  MABS is the main Government-funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  It is important that people coping with debt difficulties take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance.  This can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties.  The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.</P>
        <P>MABS is now dealing with increasingly complex debt situations in respect of clients who present with multiple creditors and debts.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country.  In 2008, over 16,600 new clients approached MABS for assistance with debt difficulties and the telephone helpline dealt with almost 11,000 callers.  In the first nine months of 2009, MABS staff saw some 14,700 new clients.  The MABS helpline received over 18,000 calls in the same period.</P><Col N="82"/>
        <P>Funding of almost &euro;18 million has again been provided to MABS to deliver its services in 2009.  An additional 19 staff are being recruited for MABS and this will bring money advice staff to over 270 in 65 locations around the country.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed under the renewed programme for Government to introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments.  The existing statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation and MABS on debt default will be further reviewed with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations, including, for example, the use by banks and lenders of more flexible mechanisms to avoid foreclosure in appropriate circumstances.  These could include reduced rates, longer maturity dates, rolling-up of outstanding interest, the bank taking equity in the house or the bank taking ownership and leasing back the property to the resident with rent payments coming off the loan.  With reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions, the Government will examine ways of expanding its own mortgage-support measures.</P>
        <P>In light of the facts I have outlined and having regard to the steps the Government has taken in respect of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the additional requirements we have insisted on with the recapitalised banks, the additional resources we have committed to the mortgage interest subsidy and to MABS and to the long tradition in mainstream Irish mortgage lending of repossession being a very rare event, it is disturbing that certain commentators seem to take delight in producing horror stories about what has been called in this House an orgy of repossessions that is always just over the horizon.  We heard these stories almost a year ago and we are hearing them again in recent times, yet the number of actual repossessions remains very small.</P>

        <P>The proposal for a lengthy moratorium is highly dangerous in terms of financial market perceptions and the effect they might have on the funding of the banks on which the whole economy ultimately depends.  Furthermore, the proposed moratorium is unnecessary because of the supports the Government has already put in place, especially through the mortgage interest subsidy, and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the improvements in protection for families envisaged in the renewed programme for Government.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, for giving me these few minutes.  I welcome Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch&rsquo;s initiative and congratulate him on it because, as Bill Clinton might remind us, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the economy, stupid&rdquo;.  That came home to many of us who went across the road to Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel today for the launch of the St. Vincent de Paul pre-budget submission for budget 2010, Don&rsquo;t Push Them Over the Edge.  I <Col N="83"/>suspect we will take the opportunity in other debates to raise many of the issues mentioned in that document.  </P>
        <P>I am a member of Fianna F&aacute;il and believe strongly that my party must continue to represent the needs and vulnerability of those who need assistance.  I am not of the view that social welfare cuts are inevitable.  I do not wish to draw attention to IBEC but I was disappointed by it recently.  As the employers&rsquo; group, representing those employers who have had to make workers redundant, it should find another way of dealing with the issue without saying that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important we challenge IBEC&rsquo;s statement that social welfare payments should not be immune from cutbacks.  There is a new poor which all Members are aware of in their constituencies.  They are people who were in good jobs until recently and kept up with their mortgage repayments but who now find themselves under pressure.  I am sympathetic to the points made in the Private Members&rsquo; business motion but the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech did address some of these.  We need to represent those who find themselves challenged by their banks on mortgage repayments.</P>

The office does a great job from its premises on High Street, Tallaght.

I look forward to further debates on this issue.</P>

	<P>I am glad this debate is taking place in the House tonight.  It should not, however, take place in an atmosphere of fear, worrying people, but of hope, letting people know options are available.  One of the most irresponsible statements I heard in this House since I was elected was that of the Labour Party leader claiming the world and its mother knows that as soon as the NAMA legislation is passed, there will be an avalanche of repossessions.  How frightening was that wrong statement for people genuinely suffering from arrears but not facing the prospect of repossession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be.  The President of the High Court said there will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fundamentally sound to say there will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The banks with certain exceptions are working with borrowers.  That is not to say what the banks are doing is always right; there are many flaws to their approaches to the matter.  By and large, on a case-by-case basis, the main banks covered by the State guarantee are working with their borrowers.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>I propose that the mortgages of the sub-prime lenders be bought by the main financial institutions.  Those with such mortgages are the most vulnerable in the repossession situation, examples of which we saw on television yesterday and in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  They are the people who are getting the constant calls from their lenders.  That is not happening, from my experience at constituency level, with the main banks.</P>
        <P>However, because of fears propagated people have become afraid of repossession.  Last week a constituent attended my clinic who had built up several months of arrears and had received letters from her bank.  She knew nothing, however, of the 12-month moratorium that applied to her lender, ICS Building Society.  When I gave her this news, it gave her meaningful hope.  This is the message we must get across.</P>
        <P>The banks are dealing with repossession cases on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  When I checked the website of CitiMortgage, a major US mortgage provider, its most prominent part was its home owner assistance programme which sets out the standards on how it deals with borrowers in arrears.  This was in strong contrast with the Irish banks&rsquo; <i>ad hoc</i> approach.  Their websites do not contain any information on assistance for borrowers in arrears.</P>
        <P>I welcome the assistance measures detailed in the programme for Government, particularly in cases where the State or the banks could take part ownership of the House in exchange for reducing the mortgage.  That will be an attractive proposition for many borrowers which will serve to give them hope and encouragement that they will retain their houses.  It is noteworthy that only 20 houses have been repossessed by banks covered by the State guarantee.  This debate must show people with mortgage arrears there is hope and the banks will work them if they are prepared to work with their banks.  The code of conduct on handling mortgage arrears has worked well but there is room for improvement.  The one missed payment is not enough.  It should be six months or 12-months cumulative arrears rather than the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal for two years.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains proposals for reducing rates, longer maturity dates and banks taking equity in houses under a rent and lease back scheme.  Many constituents have suggested these to me but these need to be systemised into a proper format.  However, we must give people in arrears hope and not unnecessary fears of repossession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion.  However, I believe no family home would be repossessed when the home owner is making a genuine attempt to repay his or her mortgage.  While extending the moratorium to 24 months may be helpful, the measures being taken by the Government to ensure the banks and building societies address this issue in an overarching way is significant.</P>
        <P>There is a need for banks to reduce interest rates or allow people to pay only the interest when they are in repayment difficulties.  The same applies to longer maturity dates and the rolling up of outstanding interest which can be added to the principal of the loan.  The other initiative of where the bank would either take equity or even ownership of a house and lease it back to the borrower using the rent as repayment of the loan is a good development.  It is important that people with mortgage arrears are not frightened.  While we criticise the banks and building societies in many ways, they are all anxious to engage with and be of assistance to their customers to ensure they can remain in their houses and make repayments to the best of their ability.</P>
        <P>Problems only arise when borrowers ignore the pleadings of the bank or building society to deal with the issue of arrears.  I have found in my constituency that borrowers get into trouble when they ignore the pleadings of the banks, not knowing there is assistance for them.  Those <Col N="85"/>unemployed are able to draw the mortgage supplement from community welfare officers.  Many are not aware that if they pay only interest on their mortgage, the community welfare officer will refund them the interest or a portion of it.  I urge the Minister to ensure that for the duration of this recession those who are genuinely unemployed will have the 12-month period extended on a yearly basis until such time as they come through their problems.  The Government has come up with a series of initiatives.  There is no need for people to be worried about not being able pay their mortgage.  Substantial assistance and various support mechanisms are in place to assist those who cannot repay their mortgages.  When this recession works itself through, they will be back in employment and be able to repay their mortgages, both interest and principal.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Terence Flanagan and Bannon.  Deputy Bruton will speak on the Bill tomorrow evening.</P>

	<P>That is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ironic that we are debating the plight of homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes during Opposition Private Members&rsquo; time, having regard to the amount of time that was spent debating the NAMA legislation.  One would have to question if we have our priorities right.  We have all met people who are experiencing such difficulties in our clinics.  They are typically young people who bought houses in 2004 to 2006, many of them having been granted 100% mortgages.  They have availed of the statutory code of practice from the mortgage providers, but the period covered is due to expire next February.  The Government amendment to the motion states that &ldquo;the number of home owners in arrears ... with institutions covered by the State Guarantee is currently of the order 15,000 &mdash; 16,000 and that the rate of increase in arrears has moderated notably since the early months of the year&rdquo;.  The only reason it has moderated is because the statutory code of conduct that was agreed with the mortgage providers is preventing that from happening.  Furthermore, mortgage interest supplement is being paid by the State to mortgage holders to enable them to keep their mortgage repayments under some control.</P>
        <P>For the Government to say that this issue is not a problem shows that it is completely out of touch.  It has no idea of what is happening on the ground.  This is an extremely serious issue.  If the moratorium on house repossessions is lifted, people who have incurred major arrears of mortgage repayments will face difficulties next February.  In many cases people are only making interest payments and many people cannot even make those payments.  Their mortgage repayments have accumulated and they face major arrears of payment.  They are under severe pressure and in many cases one partner has lost his or her job and in some cases both partners have lost their jobs.  This will have enormous repercussions for the banking sector and for home owners.  We are talking about people&rsquo;s homes.</P>
        <P>People were encouraged by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, when he was Minister for Finance, to buy houses, on the basis that the fundamentals were sound.  People took him at his word and bought houses that were grossly overvalued.  Some people obtained their mortgages by a range of means, through subprime lenders, mortgage brokers and the guaranteed banks who granted them 100% mortgages at factors of five and six times their income, which were ludicrous.  No proper stress testing of mortgage applicants was done.</P>
        <P>The Government was remiss in not working with the Central Bank to impose stricter capital ratio requirements to prevent the banks from giving 100% mortgages.  The Minister of State who is present understands this very well.  Such stricter regulatory requirements were imposed in other countries, including in Spain and in Canada.  The major beneficiary of all the houses that were built was the Government.  It received &euro;30,000 per unit sold.  Every sale was like all <Col N="86"/>three bars coming up on a slot machine for the Government.  It got &euro;90,000 for the sale for three houses.  Ultimately it was negligent, its thinking was short-term and it took the easy option.  We are now borrowing &euro;26 billion, virtually half of our current expenditure this year, just to keep the country afloat.</P>
        <P>The other consequence of the Government&rsquo;s actions is that people are fearful of losing their homes.  Countless people at this stage have fallen into negative equity.  The ESRI forecast that 200,000 will be in negative equity by next year.  Some 25,000 families face repossession of their homes.  The Minister had the gall to say there is not a problem in this respect.  A severe problem is coming down the tracks, as a consequence of the NAMA legislation.  We need to be mindful that this affects real people&rsquo;s lives, their homes and their families.  A man and woman&rsquo;s home is their castle.  The Government has created a situation where these people are at risk of losing their homes.  The Government is saying that it is not its problem, it did not cause it.  It provided the mechanism of a lack of regulation to allow this to happen.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was a cheerleader and said, &ldquo;Build on, buy on, we will all benefit&rdquo;.  The only person who benefited was the Minister for Finance in terms of the public coffers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We in Fine Gael have put forward a home owner scheme.  We are pleased to be given this opportunity by the Labour Party to support its motion and speak on it.  We want to put on record our proposal to put in place a home owner scheme.  We believe a moratorium on house repossessions is important.  A mechanism must be put in place to deal with this issue.  We propose to allow NAMA to do something of major use, to support home owners.  It should compulsorily buy properties from mortgage companies, allow people to continue to live in their homes, take a discount on buying the mortgage and allow the people to buy back their homes if they are in a position to do so, but at least allow them to have the security that they will not risk being thrown out of their homes, which would be soul destroying for people.</P>
        <P>Our amendment in this context to the NAMA Bill was ruled out of order because it posed a charge on the Exchequer.  Significantly, the charge it would pose would come nowhere near the charge posed to the Exchequer by NAMA.  This House must get its priorities right.  The key term here is &ldquo;equity&rdquo;.  There must be equity in everything we do here for all the people we represent.  That has not happened to date with the Government.  We must do something for home owners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Labour Party and, particularly, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, for bringing forward this motion, which aims to give home owners some breathing space through the introduction of a two-year moratorium for those home owners who find themselves unable to pay their mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are facing a serious repossession timebomb in this country, as Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell said.  Thousands of young people and families are facing mortgage difficulties as a result of they or their spouses having become unemployed or having had to take a cut in their take-home pay.  Therefore, they are unable to adequately service their mortgage payments.  Clearly, it is not all the fault of the home owners.  The banks offered them 100% mortgages and the Government helped create and fuel the artificial property bubble and did not cry stop at any stage to end the property madness.</P>
        <P>According to housing agency, Respond, 25,000 families currently in mortgage arrears face the possibility of repossession of their home next February when the mortgage moratorium expires.  This is a very real issue for people.  It is a major timebomb that needs to be defused by the Government, which is in a state of denial.  It is not listening to what is happening on the streets and in every town and city.  This problem will not go away.</P><Col N="87"/>
        <P>The ESRI forecast that by next year 200,000 families will face negative equity, whereby the value of their mortgage will exceed the value of their home.  It is shocking for these people to find themselves in that position.  They will have to continue to pay their mortgages for the next 20 to 30 years but their homes will be worth less than what they paid for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem of repossessions has been exacerbated by the fact that 15,000 people took out sub-prime mortgages during the past five years.  This is a concern.  When we read in the newspapers of companies such as Start Mortgages, Springboard Mortgages and others taking repossession orders, clearly, there is something wrong.</P>
        <P>The Government should have been worried as well when we heard the Master of the High Court state, in February of this year, that there will be an avalanche of repossession cases over time and that repossessions will be of historic proportions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has turned a blind eye to the problem of sub-prime lending and has not tackled it.  That is why we see, through the High Court, the number of homes being repossessed.  For instance, yesterday in the High Court 18 repossessions were granted.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s amendment, stating that only 20 houses have been repossessed to date, is clearly incorrect.  The number is double that amount.  Some 38 houses have been repossessed, when one considers the 18 that were repossessed yesterday.  These are real cases involving real families.  I accept the point that some of the houses were not occupied, but the others were.  Families are distressed and are being put on to local authority waiting lists which are long enough already, and this should not be the case.  Of the 76 cases heard yesterday, 28 were taken by sub-prime lenders, which highlights the Government&rsquo;s failure to regulate the sub-prime industry.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service annual report for 2008 reported 238 High Court possession orders in 2008, compared to 109 in 2007 and 61 in 2006.  The numbers are on the increase and the Government is in denial by stating that they are not.  The total number of houses repossessed last year was 99.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are home owners who have received redundancy lump sums and that money is being used to service their mortgages.  We have not seen the full effects of the current recession, and all that will happen in time.  In addition, when the NAMA legislation, which is on Report Stage here this week, is passed next week other lenders will go ahead and look to repossess homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government needs to get real on this issue.  It needs to extend the moratorium, as the Labour Party has looked for.  Home owners cannot be reliant on the mercy of judges to ensure they remain in their homes.  What we have in place is grossly inadequate &mdash; a voluntary code of practice for banks and an unregulated sub-prime industry.</P>
        <P>Since January last I have called continuously on the regulator to draft new industry guidelines on reckless mortgage lending and to create new penalties for mortgage lenders and professionals found guilty of reckless lending and deception.  Sadly, these calls have been ignored and we continue to see the results of the regulator&rsquo;s inaction, with the number of repossession cases escalating every month.  The Minister must move urgently to regulate the sub-prime industry and also introduce proper penalties for those who commit a crime.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the mortgage interest subsidy scheme is not working because one partner must be at work.  It also provides assistance only for the interest part of a loan and excludes those with sub-prime mortgages, at whose cases the Minister might look again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As much as moratoriums provide breathing space and help for home owners in difficulty, they do not deal with the underlying problem of those in mortgage difficulty.  That is why we, in Fine Gael, looked to introduce an amendment to the National Asset Management Agency Bill which was shot down on Committee Stage but which we will re-introduce, as Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell stated, on Report Stage.  The amendment would provide a social benefit for home <Col N="88"/>owners and ensure that NAMA would take over the loans of those whose homes are about to be repossessed and take an equity share, the home owners would deal directly with NAMA on the matter, and there would be strict eligibility criteria.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to look at what other jurisdictions have done to rectify this situation and take on board what has been stated already in this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate on the motion tabled by the Labour Party.  I support the motion in principle but would like to see certain Fine Gael proposals, such as the NAMA homeowner support scheme, adopted.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Terence Flanagan stated, the Master of the High Court warned that an avalanche of home repossession cases is anticipated in the courts in what he described as a recession of historic proportions.  He stated that most borrowers were not to blame for their arrears, as we go through this recession.</P>
        <P>The same cannot be said about the banks or, indeed, the Government, as I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will agree.  In the interest of fairness, there must be something akin to a moratorium on house repossessions or other proposals to achieve a similar outcome.  As the Master of the High Court stated, in the current climate where there are almost no house sales, there is really no good reason to grant an immediate order for repossession unless there was credible evidence that a sale might be on the cards.  There are no gains for anybody in rows and rows of houses being shuttered up and ghost estates developing throughout the length and breadth of this country.  This is not desirable.</P>
        <P>Not so long ago the much repeated catch-phrase in this House was &ldquo;getting a foot on the property ladder&rdquo;.  Ministers sung from hymn sheets all over the country on this issue, and the difficulties associated with such for young and not so young first-time buyers.  Now we see where the problem has arisen.  For those lucky enough to do so, or should I say, with the wisdom of hindsight, not so lucky in many cases, the trick is to avoid the grasping hands waiting to rip them off the ladder and crush the rungs under their feet, as is the case for many.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator stated that up to June 2008 almost 14,000 mortgages were more than three months in arrears.  Every day of the week there are frantic constituents ringing and calling to see me, wanting to know what they can do to save their homes from repossession.  They are extremely anxious to know what relief is available to them to meet the mortgage that they could afford before they lost their jobs, or had their wages cut by the Government.  This is one of the biggest problems for people already pushed to the limit.  Help is hard to come by.  The waiting period for mortgage relief, even if one meets the narrow criteria, is excessive.  I have come across constituents who have waited up to six months to get some such relief from the State, and this is unfair and unjust.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is unable to meet the demand and people with young families, who took on mortgages in line with different economic circumstances, are facing bureaucracy, red-tape and cruel delays before they can see hope on the horizon.  Many, however, are being refused mortgage assistance by community welfare officers because the eligibility criteria are too stringent.</P>
        <P>Currently, there are more than 14,000 households dependent on mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 244% &mdash; rather than 200% as the Minister of State said earlier &mdash; since the end of 2007.  This is factual.  The Minister of State can gloss over it any way he wishes, but what he stated earlier is untrue.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the Government is currently reviewing this scheme.  Were it to turn out that the aim of the review, which is not currently clear, was as is suspected, to make it more not <Col N="89"/>less difficult for people to be eligible for payment, this would be a particularly cruel blow, even by Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party standards.  None of the Greens has come into the House this evening even to listen to this debate, which shows the interest they have in the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When considering the current problems with the criteria for eligibility, anything is possible.  At present, claimants are not eligible for mortgage interest relief if, for example, their mortgage is considered to be too expensive.  Apart from the obvious leeway in interpretation by different community welfare officers leading to a lack of uniformity around the country, this begs the question as to who encouraged the mortgage holder to take out the loan.  It was the banks, with the co-operation and collusion of this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government &mdash; mostly those who attended the Galway races tent in years gone by.</P>
        <P>By any standard, it is ironic that the very people who caused the economic fall-out are being helped by the very people who colluded in their mistakes, and the innocent are left to carry the can.  As they say, &ldquo;truth is stranger than fiction.&rdquo;  If the extraordinary cronyism and shady dealings of the Government were to be made into a movie, it would be considered unbelievable and a bestseller.</P>

	<P>We raise this matter in the context of fears about the future of Shannon Airport, with particular reference to Ryanair threatening to pull out from April next year.  In effect, this would mean that 1.4 million passengers would be lost to the airport &mdash; 75% of Ryanair traffic &mdash; as the airline is planning on leaving only one aircraft there.  In 2007 Ryanair accounted for 46% of overall passenger numbers, while 59.6% of overall passenger numbers at the airport were Ryanair-generated in 2008.  This would create an enormous difficulty for it.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">While Shannon Airport faces many difficulties, the tax issue is one that has been cited by Ryanair.  I know that at times Ryanair tries to force unreasonable bargains but in this case it is absolutely right.  The &euro;10 tax is regressive and unfair, a barrier to travel and anti-competitive.  In the context of Ireland being an island nation which needs to encourage tourism, facilitate travel and have balanced regional development, the tax is clearly a threat to the future of Shannon Airport.</P>
        <P>It is also a problem in the context of tourism.  A statement issued today by the Irish Hotels Federation calls for its abolition.  It is worth noting that the federation gives statistics indicating that 200,000 people across the country are employed in the tourism industry and that its contribution to the economy in 2008 was &euro;6.3 billion.  All that the travel tax has brought in since it was introduced and became effective on 30 March is &euro;57.9 million, which is far less than what was predicted.  Some &euro;57.9 million in the context of a tourism budget of &euro;6.3 billion indicates that the tax needs to be totally reconsidered.  If it discourages tourists from coming to this country &mdash; tourism is such an important industry &mdash; the detrimental effect it is having throughout the country can be imagined.  We are particularly concerned about Shannon Airport.  This tax, if it drives Ryanair out, will pose huge problems for the airport and the region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my complete opposition to the &euro;10 travel tax.  The tax which was introduced in the rushed budget of October 2008 by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has caused and is causing extreme harm to Shannon Airport and the economies of County Clare and the mid-west region.  Absolutely no thought or consideration was given by the Government to the impact such a tax would have on tourist numbers.</P>
        <P>As an island nation, Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product is dependent on quality, affordable air connectivity.  There is huge pressure on airlines to stay in operation, with fuel price volatility and a dramatic slowdown in demand.  Many airlines have gone to the wall as a result of these factors.  We simply cannot afford to place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage in regard to other destinations but the Minister&rsquo;s travel tax does just this.</P>
        <P>This year Shannon Airport has already paid a high price because of the tax, with the loss of two Ryanair aircraft from its Shannon Airport base, the loss of five Ryanair routes and a reduction in the number of Ryanair flights from 136 to 116 per week.  Governments in other countries have acted quite differently in response to the global economic slowdown.  They have removed travel taxes and airport charges.  If this country is to bounce back from the economic doom it faces, it will have to do the same.  Since 2008 the Dutch Government has removed its travel tax, the Belgian Government has decided not to introduce a similar travel tax, having listened to stakeholders in its tourism industry, while in Spain and Greece the respective governments removed charges on all regional airports.  What did the Irish Government do?  It imposed a ridiculous travel tax which has pulverised the tourism industry.  Some hotels in County Clare are open only three days a week, bed and breakfast premises have closed down, as have restaurants and pubs, yet the Government response is to persist with a depressing travel tax.</P>
        <P>In 2007 Ryanair accounted for 46% of business activity at Shannon Airport and in 2008, for 1.85 million passengers, delivering 60% of the airport&rsquo;s passengers.  Last week Ryanair issued a very stark warning that the base which it established five years ago would be reduced by<?oasys _jy ?>75%.  I appeal to the Minister of State who comes from the mid-west and represents north Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I appeal to him to give a commitment to abolish the travel tax in the next budget.  If Ryanair strips 75% of its service at Shannon Airport, it will cause utter devastation in the region. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to take the opportunity to comment on the air travel tax and express my regret at the decision of certain airlines to withdraw flights and services from Shannon Airport.</P>
        <P>The Minister accepts that the airline industry, with other industries within the transport sector and beyond, continues to go through a difficult trading period.  However, he does not accept that the decline in passenger numbers experienced by the airports in the State is due to the introduction of the air travel tax.  The difficult trading period in the airline industry arises primarily from weak world economic activity.  The decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result, aviation services are contracting on a global basis.  As Deputies may be aware, Airports Council International, ACI, has reported that European passenger traffic from January to July was down 8.7% compared to the same period in 2008.  The International Air Transport Association reports also reflect such declines.</P>
        <P>In the case of Ireland, the decline in passenger numbers through our airports is broadly in line with that in our international counterparts, including those where there is no travel tax in <Col N="91"/>place.  This downward trend is evident for periods prior to the introduction of the air travel tax.  Furthermore, passenger numbers for other modes of transport such as railways have also experienced broadly similar declines.  While this is not desirable, it is clear that the air travel tax is not the substantive cause of the decline in passenger numbers.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in applying a tax on air travel.  Many countries worldwide and within the European Union apply similar taxes.  For example, our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, has applied a similar tax for a number of years.  It recently revised the air passenger duty to have four bands of 2,000 miles each and increased the rates just two days ago.  The new rates are as follows: band A, 0 to 2,000 miles, &pound;11&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Belgium and the Netherlands?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;band B, 2,001 to 4,000 miles, &pound;45; band C, 4,001 to 6,000 miles, &pound;50; and band D, over 6,000 miles, &pound;55 in the case of economy class.  These rates double in the case of tickets other than economy class.  One might be tempted to argue why the airlines which use UK airports &mdash; some use them very heavily &mdash; do not bully the British Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure they do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The base band A rate is being further increased to &pound;12 from 1 November 2010, with increases of 30% to over 50% being applied to the other three bands, B, C and D, also from that date.  In France, the civil aviation tax is charged at around &euro;4 for EU destinations and &euro;7 for other destinations.  Moving further afield, Australia and New Zealand which, like Ireland, are extraordinarily dependent on air travel also apply departure taxes.</P>
        <P>The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable, both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.  Taking the United Kingdom as an example, a person travelling within the United Kingdom will be liable to pay the UK air passenger duty of &pound;11, or approximately &euro;12, on each leg of the journey, that is, a passenger departing from Manchester to London will be subject to the &pound;11 tax and on the return journey departing from London to Manchester will also be subject to the &pound;11 tax, giving a total tax liability of &pound;22, or approximately &euro;24.  In Ireland, a person travelling within the State will be liable to pay &euro;2 in tax on each leg of the journey, giving a total tax liability of &euro;4.  Furthermore, the UK rates in respect of longer flights range from moe than four times higher to five times higher than the Irish rate.  The Government acknowledges that low cost travel has been good for Ireland.  The pioneers in this area deserve to be commended.  However, in analysing the new tax, we must not overplay its impact.</P>
        <P>At the moment, a fare from Shannon to London Stansted that is initially presented as &euro;15 with a similar &euro;15 return fare will actually cost a passenger over &euro;100 when all charges are included, excluding the air travel tax.  This assumes no luggage is checked in which would cost more.  Included in the &euro;100 is a &euro;5 credit card handling fee per flight segment.  This practice has been the subject of much criticism by consumer bodies.  In addition, there is a recently introduced on-line check-in fee of &euro;5 per flight segment.  If a person cannot check in on-line, there is a &euro;40 check-in fee per flight segment.  Incidentally, the on-line check-in fee for a return flight to the UK equates to the amount of the air travel tax for that journey.  It is also worth noting that in the case of a return journey within the State, the on-line check-in fee is two and a half times higher than the &euro;4 air travel tax liability for those flights.</P>
        <P>A person flying from London Stansted to Shannon, or indeed from any airport in the UK to Ireland, is already paying, through the airlines, &pound;11 or around &euro;12 in air passenger duty to the UK Exchequer.  Airlines do not appear to have any difficulty in applying the UK air passenger duty.  In the case of long-haul flights, a &euro;10 tax as a proportion of the total price of a return <Col N="92"/>fare is minimal. Visitors to Ireland are only subject to the tax on the return journey.  The additional &euro;10 or &euro;2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditure and so on, should have only a limited effect on tourist numbers.</P>
        <P>In addition to weak world economic activity, the spate of failures in the airline sector have been largely driven by a massive spike in oil prices in 2008.  Price pressures have subsided and fuel costs &mdash; which had increased to as much as 50% of some airlines&rsquo; cost base &mdash; have fallen considerably.  Airlines benefit from an international tax exemption on jet fuel.  The extent of this benefit is illustrated by the example that tax as a percentage of the price of a litre of petrol is currently in excess of 60%.</P>
        <P>We have to bring a sense of balance to this debate.  In the past few years we saw exceptional growth in air travel both to and from Ireland.  Strong disposable incomes and consumer confidence at home led people to take, in some cases, several air trips per year. However, it should come as no surprise that given uncertainties in the economy generally, consumers have shown some reluctance to take or plan trips abroad.  An air trip abroad generally involves expenditure of several hundred euro, so to blame singularly the introduction of a modest air travel tax of &euro;10 or &euro;2 for the reduction in passenger numbers is stretching credibility. It is difficult to understand how an airline that has complained vigorously about the &euro;10 air tax, on the basis of price sensitivity of customers, can then introduce a non-discretionary on-line check-in fee of &euro;5 per flight, or &euro;10 per return flight.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a relatively modest air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure in the context of the significant financial challenges we now face.  The Minister for Finance has no plans to review the tax as proposed by the Deputies.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government last week published Ireland&rsquo;s draft new tentative list of potential nominees to the world heritage list.  I am delighted that &ldquo;Dublin &mdash; A Georgian City and its Literary Tradition&rdquo;, was included on this draft list.  Since I was elected in 2007, I have sought for Georgian Dublin to be nominated as a UNESCO world heritage site.  This is a good news story and there is great credit due to the Minister, whose commitment to this proposal I welcome.</P>
        <P>Georgian Dublin is of huge cultural significance to Ireland and deserves to be protected and promoted as an historic and beautiful part of our country&rsquo;s history.  As has been highlighted in the draft list, the establishment of the wide streets commissioners, Europe&rsquo;s first official town planning authority, was visionary for its time and was later copied in other cities.  Furthermore, 18th century Dublin witnessed one of its most exuberant bursts of architectural development with the proliferation of fine municipal buildings, grandiose squares and wide, elegant streets.</P>
        <P>The period from 1714 to 1830 saw the development of the Irish Houses of Parliament, the Four Courts, King&rsquo;s Inns, City Hall, Leinster House, Dublin Castle, the Mansion House and Iveagh House among others.  Fine architects such as James Gandon, who designed the White House in Washington D.C., designed the Custom House Building and the Four Courts and left an indelible mark on the character and style of Dublin&rsquo;s built environment.  Likewise, the contribution of the city to world literature is far-reaching and exceptional.</P>
        <P>Becoming a UNESCO world heritage site would confer international status on Georgian Dublin and would endow it with a level of international protection and preservation.  Other <Col N="93"/>cities with Georgian architecture that have received world heritage site status include Bath and Edinburgh.  Ireland has only three UNESCO world heritage sites, namely, Newgrange, Skellig Michael and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.</P>
        <P>This designation would be invaluable for Dublin.  It would protect the cultural heritage of the city.  It would help to raise architectural and historical awareness and would enhance Dublin&rsquo;s reputation as a tourist destination of world class standard, as has occurred in Edinburgh.  I want to put on record my complete support for Georgian Dublin&rsquo;s elevation from the tentative list to nomination for inscription on the world heritage list.  This will only take place after consultation with the relevant stakeholders and interested parties, and I believe that the plan is for this to take place through a partnership forum established for each proposed nomination.  Can the Minister give more details of this forum for residents who are interested in making an observation on the list?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Chris Andrews for raising this important issue for the city of Dublin.  I fully agree that Georgian Dublin is of great cultural significance to this city.  It is internationally accepted that Dublin has made an extraordinary contribution to world literature.  It was, and continues to be, a city where people write and is the setting for texts of international significance such as O&rsquo;Casey&rsquo;s dramatic trilogy and Joyce&rsquo;s <i>Ulysses.</i></P>
        <P>Dublin has evolved over the years and is now a thriving multicultural city of social, cultural and economic activity.  I am aware that Dublin is currently seeking designation as a UNESCO city of literature.  Dublin City Council is considering the introduction of new policies within the development plan that include increasing public awareness of the heritage plan, promoting access to heritage sites, exploring UNESCO potential and the protection of Dublin&rsquo;s Georgian squares, particularly Mountjoy Square and Parnell Square.  This is very welcome news.</P>
        <P>As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I am responsible for world heritage policy matters under the convention for the protection of the world&rsquo;s cultural and natural heritage adopted in 1972 by UNESCO.  The convention was ratified by Ireland in 1991.  I have responsibility for the process of identification and nomination to the world heritage list of those properties in Ireland, which are considered to be of outstanding universal value and meet the UNESCO criteria for world heritage designation.</P>
        <P>A tentative list is an inventory of those properties which a state party intends to consider for nomination to the world heritage list in the next five to ten years.  Ireland&rsquo;s current tentative list dates back to 1992.  UNESCO recommends that state parties to the world heritage convention resubmit tentative lists to UNESCO at least every ten years.  Last October, I established an expert advisory group to carry out a review of the current tentative list and to identify those properties around the country which the group considered best meet the criteria required for inscription on the world heritage list.</P>
        <P>The expert advisory group has considered properties on the current tentative list and other properties around the country, including Georgian Dublin, on the basis of detailed reports compiled by members of the group or by experts commissioned by the group.  Members of the public and interested groups were also invited to submit potential properties for inclusion on the new tentative list.  Thirty one such proposals were received and assessed by the expert advisory group.</P>
        <P>The expert advisory group has now finalised a draft new tentative list which contains the details of the properties which the group considers are of outstanding universal value, meet the UNESCO world heritage inscription criteria in terms of integrity and authenticity and have the best potential for future inscription on the world heritage list.</P><Col N="94"/>
        <P>I can confirm that &ldquo;Dublin &mdash; A Georgian City and its Literary Tradition&rdquo; is on the draft new tentative list of potential nominees to the world heritage list.  This list was published in the daily newspapers and on my Department&rsquo;s website yesterday, inviting comments on the draft list.  Following the receipt and assessment of comments and submissions received by the expert advisory group, the new tentative list will be submitted to me for my approval with a view to the forwarding of the list to UNESCO.  I can confirm, in response to the specific question asked by the Deputy, that we are taking comments from the public.  That was the purpose of the newspaper advertisements.  If people log on to the Department&rsquo;s website, they will find an e-mail address they can use to transmit their comments on this matter.  If the Deputy has any further questions, I will be happy to answer them.</P>

	<P>The Grangegorman Development Agency has the important remit of constructing a new campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology, in advance of the relocation of the institute&rsquo;s seven faculties, which are currently distributed throughout Dublin, to the Grangegorman site.  Given that many of the buildings on the 70-acre Grangegorman site are quite old and were not built for these purposes, the agency will have the difficult task of pulling everything together so the institute will operate effectively.  This new initiative has a statutory basis, in the form of an Act that was passed by the Oireachtas some years ago.  The Minister is statutorily required to appoint a new board of the agency, as the term of office of the previous board expired in the middle of last month, but he has not done so.  Not only is he is awaiting nominations from the Department of Health and Children and Dublin City Council, but he is also consulting himself by looking into his own heart.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said that when he receives the nominations, he will present a draft memo to the Cabinet.  He will have to prepare such a memo, a strategic plan and a budget.  All of this is taking place in limbo, in the absence of a board.  The Minister has an obligation to appoint a board because in the absence of a board, the agency cannot continue its business.  As it has neither a chief executive officer nor a fully fledged board, it is pretty much stalled and stagnant.  It does not know where it is going.  It is rudderless and directionless as it waits for the Minister to make up his mind about what he intends to do.  One cannot develop a major project in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>Those who have been planning this project for years need to know where they are going.  It might take them much longer to get this project off the ground, now that everything has suddenly ground to a halt as a consequence of the Minister&rsquo;s failure to get his act together.  This is an important aspect of this important plan.  Action is also required in the interests of other developments, such as the extension of the Luas network through Broadstone and Liffey Valley, where it will connect with the Maynooth line.  One of the reasons the Luas extension was sanctioned was to allow Dublin Institute of Technology&rsquo;s 20,000 students to use public transport to travel to Grangegorman.  If the Minister does not get his act together in time, two projects might well be stalled.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister will give us details of the strategic plan that has been mentioned, as I have no idea what it is.  Such a plan should have been prepared well in advance of the date of expiry, so that the entire new board could be appointed and could get on with the job.  I have been appointed to the consultative committee, which has no remit in the absence of the appointment of a board.  Everybody is floundering because we cannot make progress with this important project.  It is time we got clarity, direction and a decision.</P>

	<P>I will respond to Deputy Costello on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to remind the House of the progress that has been made by the Grangegorman Development Agency since its establishment in 2006 and to outline the current position with regard to the board of the agency.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government appointed an interdepartmental committee in 2001 to examine the potential for the development of the Grangegorman site as a new Dublin Institute of Technology community campus.  When the committee&rsquo;s report was presented to the Government in November 2001, the main recommendation was the establishment of what ultimately became the Grangegorman Development Agency.  The Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 states that the general aim of the agency is to oversee the development of the lands at Grangegorman on behalf of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, Dublin Institute of Technology and the Health Service Executive.  The agency has done considerable work since its first meeting in November 2006.  It has developed links with all the relevant stakeholders and established a consultative group as required in section 22 of the 2005 Act.  The agency has completed the drafting of a strategic plan and budget for the development of the Grangegorman site.  It submitted the draft plan and budget to the Department in October 2008, as provided for in section 12 of the Act.  Copies of the plan and budget were also forwarded to the Minister for Health and Children for her consideration.</P>
        <P>Following their receipt of the strategic plan, officials from the Department of Education and Science, in consultation with their counterparts in the Higher Education Authority, commenced an assessment of the proposals.  The Department also sought the advice of the National Development Finance Agency on the funding portions of the DIT draft cost benefit analysis and the draft strategic plan.  In March 2009, the agency submitted a revised strategic plan and budget, taking account of the reduced prices in the construction sector by updating construction prices to January 2009 values.  The agency reduced enabling infrastructure costs and revised the estimated value of the DIT property portfolio to reflect market trends.  The revised plan, which proposes to deliver the complete project in phases, is being considered in the Department.</P>
        <P>Section 17 of the Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 provides for the appointment of members to the board of the agency.  As 14 members of the board of Grangegorman Development Agency were appointed for a three-year term in 2006, their term of office expired on 18 October 2009, with the exception of one member who resigned in March 2009 and was replaced.  The 2005 Act provides that the ordinary members of the agency shall consist of two people nominated by the Minister for Health and Children, at least one of whom shall be an officer of the Health Service Executive; two people nominated by the president of Dublin Institute of Technology; one person nominated by the city manager of Dublin City Council; one resident of the Grangegorman neighbourhood, who is nominated following an election process; and one elected member of Dublin City Council who is nominated by that council.  The Act provides that the remaining members of the agency, other than the chief executive, are nominees of the Minister for Education and Science and that all members of the agency are appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Act also provides that the Minister shall designate one member of the agency as chairperson.  In compliance with the Act, the Minister sought and has received nominations from the Minister for Health and Children, the president of Dublin Institute of Technology and the Dublin city manager.  The agency has completed the local election process for the selection of a resident of the Grangegorman neighbourhood and has informed the Department of the nominee.  Dublin City Council has also selected its nominee for the new board.  The nomination process is nearing finalisation.</P><Col N="96"/>
        <P>The Minister intends to address the appointment of a new board as quickly as possible.  I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to outline to the House how the Minister intends to address the appointment of a new board for the Grangegorman Development Agency.</P>

	<P>Almost three years ago, on 7 November 2006, a primary school student in my local area received an injury when he got a whack of a hurley into the face.  He lost four teeth but, as expected, he got good attention. He was lucky because the school dentist was in the neighbouring town of Portumna at the time.  The doctor in question took exceptionally good care of him.  On five occasions during November, the child&rsquo;s case was reviewed by the doctor, who must be commended on the care she offered.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The parents were told by the school authority that any bills accruing as a result of the accident would be paid by the insurance company.  Given the complexity of the case, the child was referred to a private orthodontist for root canal treatment and his four teeth were eventually re-implanted.  Two of them settled and two had to be extracted later.  Subsequently, on 8 December, the HSE communicated by letter stating the insurance would cover the costs of the orthodontist, which amounted to &euro;1,800.  The parents were asked to pay this on the day on which they visited the orthodontist.  The parent in attendance had only &euro;1,000 euro to hand and this was paid over.</P>
        <P>The teenager has suffered very severe pain over the past three years and has had to endure cosmetic difficulties and the consequences of his four teeth turning black.  This has social consequences.</P>
        <P>The accident happened on a school premises during school hours under supervision, as accidents do happen on occasion.  In this case, the insurance company has refused to compensate the parents in respect of the costs involved.  At all times they were assured, through the HSE and the school authority, that it would compensate them.  On the basis of my representations to the Minister and the HSE, I have been told this is not the case.</P>
        <P>Consider what occurs if an accident happens in school during school hours, be it to a pupil or member of staff or the public, and the insurance company does not compensate.  Will the Minister state whether all schools are insured if an accident as or more serious than the one I have described occurs?  We were told by the insurance company that unless the school building had fallen on the child in question, it would not have paid up.  If so, very many children are in danger.  Health and safety will become a much greater issue in national schools if insurance companies renege on the policies they are selling to school authorities, including boards of management.</P>
        <P>The parents to whom I refer are very dedicated.  They could follow the board of management, whose members are serving voluntarily.  The fact that they are serving voluntarily exonerates them from any charges as a result of accidents on school premises.  Will the Minister, through the Minister for Education and Science, refund the parents in question on a once-off basis such that people will not be misled again?</P>

	<P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to claims arising from an accident at school.</P><Col N="97"/>
        <P>A school&rsquo;s responsibility for the safety of children arises from the general law relating to duty of care and negligence.  The position is that the Education Act 1998 assigns each board of management and principal teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools.  The rules for national schools and the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time or on school activities.  Principals are required to organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours.  In particular, principals should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch breaks, assembly and dismissal.  Accordingly, it is the responsibility of all teachers, individually and collectively, to provide a duty of care at all times towards the pupils in the school in which they teach, including during periods of supervision.</P>
        <P>While the Department does not issue specific guidelines on requirements for supervision of pupils of different ages, it acknowledges that the degree of supervision required of school authorities varies with the circumstances, including the age of the pupil.  This duty, in the case of very young pupils, might include an obligation to ensure that such pupils do not leave the classroom without appropriate supervision.</P>
        <P>Schools have a responsibility under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to have a safety statement in place in their schools.  The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils.  The safety statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At primary level, the revised constitution of boards and rules of procedure for primary boards of management requires each board of a primary school to put in place comprehensive insurance cover to safeguard the school, the board and the trustees.  At second level, in the case of schools other than community or comprehensive schools, it is the responsibility of the individual school authority to put in place insurance cover.  Claims arising under these policies are processed directly between boards and their insurers without recourse to the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.  In cases involving community and comprehensive schools and where the State or Minister is joined in a personal injuries claim by any party, the State Claims Agency is the body appointed by Government to respond to such claims.</P>
        <P>In schools other than community or comprehensive schools, responsibility for arranging insurance cover, including the specific requirements of insurance cover against public liability, is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools concerned.  In this regard, each school should be satisfied that it is adequately covered by insurance against liability in respect of injury to pupils and teachers while participating in school activities including, as appropriate, any sporting events.  The parents of the child in question should, therefore, address the matter of their child&rsquo;s accident with the school concerned.</P>
        <P>The precise nature and terms of an individual school&rsquo;s insurance is a matter between the individual school and its insurers.  The Deputy will also be aware that in the event of an accident in the school, the responsibility in any particular case will be determined by the particular circumstances of that case.</P>
        <P>In addition to meeting the requirement for arranging school insurance cover, some schools also offer parents the option of availing of personal insurance policies which are paid for by parents.  Such policies are fundamentally different from the school&rsquo;s insurance policy as in general these personal insurance policies are not liability based and result in payment irrespective of liability.</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P>With regard to the specific issue of the provision of dental support services, the Department does not have responsibility for the provision of dental support services and I am not, therefore, in a position to comment on the matter of availability of dental treatment as raised by the Deputy.  This matter is more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>Once again, I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to address the House and to outline the position on the responsibilities of schools in regard to the putting in place of appropriate school insurance arrangements.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  the value of the charge made in respect of the bank guarantee for the most recent quarter in 2009 for which he has returns; the rate per cent of covered liabilities it entails; and if all covered institutions are paying at the same rate.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[39065/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008, each of the covered institutions pays a quarterly charge to the Exchequer which is held in a mandated account in the Central Bank.  As of 20 October 2009, there is &euro;548,642,029 in the mandated account.  The balance in the account will be returned to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The charge is paid quarterly in advance and all payments have been made in respect of 2009 which amounts to &euro;437m.  Of this total amount, &euro;176m was paid in October 2009.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the latest audited and verified figures for covered liabilities which were recently published in Iris Oifig&uacute;il, amount to &euro;275.3 billion.  The latest charge received in respect of the last quarter of this year would be equivalent to 0.065% of the latest published figure for covered liabilities and this would be equivalent to 0.26% on an annual basis.  But as the covered liabilities can vary on a daily basis, this unaudited figure should be regarded as an estimate only.</P>
        <P>In addition to the charge for the Guarantee levied on the covered institutions, institutions under the Guarantee are obliged to recoup the administrative costs of the Guarantee to the Minister.  To date payments of &euro;2.5m have been made, covering the period September 2008 to April 2009.  There will be further charges made periodically between now and the end September 2010. Administrative costs are received as an Appropriation-in-Aid in my Department&rsquo;s vote.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P>With regard to the rate the institutions are paying for the provision of the Guarantee, I can confirm that the rates are differentiated to reflect the relative risk position of the covered institution, as set out in Paragraph 16 of the Scheme.  Paragraph 22 of the Scheme allows me the discretion to review the application of the charging model every six months. The Guarantee charging model was recently reviewed by my Department to ensure the recovery of the aggregate cost borne by the State as a consequence of the provision of the Guarantee, and to ensure that the overall objectives of the Act are achieved.  Given the shortfall in monies raised from the charge to date, the charge factor levied on each institution has been amended and new, higher rates are being applied for the remainder of the Scheme.</P>

	<P>In relation to engagement with Opposition parties in the lead-up to Budget 2010, it is intended that my Department will publish in mid-November the Pre-Budget Outlook (PBO). This will set out an updated macroeconomic assessment based on the latest available data. In addition, the Pre-Budget Outlook will also set out the technical budgetary position as it is now emerging. I believe that the publication of the Pre-Budget Outlook will inform the debate in advance of Budget 2010, which will be presented to the D&aacute;il on the 9th December. I further intend that a Pre-Budget debate will take place following the publication of the Pre-Budget Outlook, during which all Deputies will have the opportunity to present their views. </P>
        <P>The Government has sought to engage all parties in our efforts to address the difficulties in the public finances.  In this context, the reports of both the Commission on Taxation and the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes have now been published and are important inputs into the decision making process.</P>
        <P>It must be noted that there is ongoing engagement with both Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as the various Committees, in relation to economic and fiscal matters. Furthermore, in recent weeks the Taoiseach and I, along with other relevant Ministers, have engaged with the Social Partners with a view to building a consensus for the action that is now required in terms of the need to stabilise the deficit in 2010. That said, it is the Government that will make the necessary decisions, taking all matters into consideration, in the context of the Budget in order to stabilise the public finances.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am happy to listen to what the Opposition have to say on what their proposals are in relation to the stabilisation of the deficit in 2010.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his estimate of the loss to the Exchequer in 2009 arising from cigarette smuggling; and the measures being taken and proposed to deal with this situation.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[37616/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible, as I have stated in response to a number of Parliamentary Questions over the past year, to provide a reliable estimate of the loss to the Exchequer as a result of cigarette smuggling. This arises from the fact that there is no proven internationally recognised method for determining such an estimate. </P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have given a tentative estimate that up to 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State in 2008 were untaxed in this State. However, this estimate included both smuggled cigarettes and also cigarettes legally purchased by cross-border shoppers for personal consumption. While most cross-border purchases involves travellers arriving from Spain, Portugal and certain East European countries where tobacco prices are low, Northern Ireland is also a destination for cigarette purchasers.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that both my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, are concerned at the level of cigarette smuggling. It is generally accepted that the high level of taxation levied on cigarettes in Ireland makes it a target for smugglers despite the comparatively small size of the market.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their strategy in relation to tobacco smuggling involves a combination of cargo and passenger profiling, intelligence gathering and mutual assistance co-operation with other Customs services. Where appropriate, x-ray scanning technology is used to detect and seize contraband in maritime and air transport. In this regard a second mobile container scanner has been purchased and is due to arrive in Ireland later this month. This scanner is expected to increase the overall level of detection at our major ports.</P>
        <P>Revenue and an Garda Sioch&aacute;na also carry out multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to controlled deliveries. Where relevant, these operations involve international law enforcement agencies. The Customs service continuously reviews its strategy which includes analysis of resource requirements and its optimum staff deployment.</P>
        <P>Revenue policy also entails close liaison with the legitimate tobacco industry and the Office of Tobacco Control. In addition intelligence driven and random checks are mounted at retail outlets and markets and other distribution centres in order to detect and seize illicit tobacco products which have evaded detection at the point of importation.</P><Col N="102"/>
        <P>Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners engage with the work of the European Anti Fraud Office which co-ordinates both international operations and other countermeasures undertaken by the authorities of the Member States against cigarette smuggling.</P>
        <P>This combined approach has resulted in the seizure of almost 200 million cigarettes to-date in 2009. Included in this amount is the seizure of an estimated 120 million cigarettes at Greenore on 27 October 2009 in the course of the multi-agency Operation Samhna. This is a prime example of the fruits of multi-agency cooperation in the fight against this organised crime.  The intelligence and operational strategy is backed up by a robust prosecution policy which has resulted in 101 convictions for cigarette smuggling or dealing in smuggled cigarettes during the first nine months of 2009. A significant number of other cases are already before the Courts awaiting hearing or are being processed for prosecution.</P>

	<P>The figure of E77 billion relates to the estimated book value of the loans of five covered institutions who have indicated their intention to participate in NAMA. When presenting this information to the D&aacute;il in September, I indicated that both the estimate of book value and the projected average discount of 30% to be applied in the purchase of these assets, was provisional in nature and based on summary information provided by the institutions concerned. </P>
        <P>The actual discounts to be applied will be determined on an asset by asset basis following the application of the valuation methodology. The aggregate discount by institution will only be available on completion of the valuation of the loan books of each participating institution. This will only be possible following the finalisation of the NAMA legislation, the designation of participating institutions and the designation of eligible assets among other issues.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may wish to note that, under the terms of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority is responsible for the regulation and supervision of the financial system including the banking sector.  In the exercise of its regulatory and supervisory functions under statute, the Regulatory Authority acts independently of the Minister of Finance. This independence is an essential pre-requisite for the proper exercise of these functions and is firmly in accordance with standards of international best practice.  In my role as Minister for Finance, therefore, I have no legal authority nor would it be appropriate for me to issue policy directions to the Authority.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware the system of financial regulation in Ireland is based on a detailed and comprehensive EU template and many of the functions and powers assigned to the Regulatory Authority are assigned under EU law.  As Minister for Finance, I do not have the authority to issue directions on matters covered by European law.</P><Col N="103"/>
        <P>Of course as a matter of routine, my Department liaises closely on an ongoing basis with the Financial Regulator on matters relating to the legislative and policy framework for financial regulation.  This reflects the expert advisory role played by the Financial Regulator in relation to the development of legislative proposals both at national and EU level.  Since the onset of the financial crisis all the public authorities have worked closely advising the Government on key elements of the Government&rsquo;s response &mdash; the Guarantee Scheme, the recapitalisation of the banks and NAMA.  This has helped ensure a cohesive and co-ordinated national response to maintaining financial stability in Ireland and ensuring that the financial system is restored to health to support economic recovery.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be and generally is the last resort for the lender. The preferred method of dealing with cases of arrears should be early intervention and engagement.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has a Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears. The Code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator. Under the Code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and he or she has to give consideration, on a case-by-case basis, to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest. Obviously cases will arise where the arrears situations persist despite newly agreed changes in repayment schedules. The Code provides that where the arrears situation persists, the lender may reserve the right to enforce the mortgage agreement. However, it must wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code also sets out requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.</P>
        <P>The Irish Banking Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service have agreed and put into effect an Operational Protocol on consumer debt.  The Operational Protocol will enable MABS and the IBF continue to work together effectively when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors who approach the MABS Service for assistance.</P>
        <P>I therefore have no plans to extend the moratorium on home repossessions. I am satisfied that the arrangements currently in place are sufficient to safeguard the interests of borrowers who experience difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments.  I will of course be keeping the situation under close review.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the supervisory oversight of credit institutions is based on a pan-EU legislative framework, most notably the Capital Requirements Directive.  In the light of events which have arisen in the context of the international financial markets crisis, the issue of the oversight of systemically important institutions is being considered, not only in the European framework, but also at a wider international level.  At G20 level, in their Pittsburgh statement of September last, G20 Leaders recommended action by end 2010 to address the issue of systemically important financial institutions to reduce the probability of their distress and impact of their distress or failure.  A report will be presented to G20 finance ministers in November on methodologies for determining whether a financial institution is of systemic importance.  While discussions are at a relatively early stage, the IMF, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are also currently working on the issue.  In parallel, the EU Commission is undertaking complementary work on systemically important financial institutions in the context of the current EU legislative framework. Ireland is participating fully in this work at EU level.</P>
        <P>In my speech on the Second Stage of the NAMA Bill I indicated that I was examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal with distressed financial institutions. The objective will be to ensure that the State has in place a range of tools to protect deposit holders and ensure financial stability and maintain international market confidence. I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in this area in the New Year. The development of this legislation will be informed by the work underway at the international level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On 16 October Eurostat (the Statistical Authority of the European Commission) informed the Central Statistics Office of its preliminary decision that the operations of the National Asset Management Agency should be recorded outside the general government sector in the Irish national accounts.  On 20 October, Eurostat published its preliminary decision on its website. </P>
        <P>The effect of this preliminary decision is that the acquisition of the assets from the financial institutions by NAMA will have no effect on our General Government Debt ratio or our general budget balance.</P>
        <P>This treatment puts the Irish asset protection scheme on an equivalent footing with bank support schemes in other member states, which are also being recorded off-balance sheet.  The main advantage of this is that it minimises the danger of the markets or international investors misinterpreting our headline debt or budget balance ratios when comparing us against other EU Member States.</P>
        <P>As I have repeatedly said, the statistical treatment does not change the fact that operations of NAMA will lead to an increase in the amount of the State&rsquo;s potential liabilities. This basic fact should not be overlooked.  However, neither should it be overlooked that these liabilities will be matched by a countervailing asset holding.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>Officials from the Central Statistics Office, the interim National Asset Management Agency and my Department had been in regular contact with Eurostat over the previous few months regarding the appropriate treatment of NAMA. The main rating agencies were aware that discussions were ongoing. Furthermore, I had also referred to the likelihood that the treatment would be off balance in the &ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; document published on my Department&rsquo;s website and the NAMA website at the end of July.</P>

	<P>The Credit Union Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions. The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflects and promotes the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions.  The approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act 1997 has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their Directors and members. It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard the members&rsquo; savings during a period of rapid growth.</P>
        <P>The future shape and operation of the legislative and regulatory framework will strongly influence the evolution of the credit union model.  The question is how best to integrate that framework with the strategic development of the credit union movement in a manner which remains fully consistent with financial stability and long-term sustainability.</P>
        <P>When, in June 2009, I announced major reform of the institutional structures for regulation of financial services in Ireland, I stated that no change is proposed to the current role and responsibilities of the Registrar of Credit Unions and that regulation of credit unions will remain within the Central Bank of Ireland structure.</P>
        <P>However, the need for some modernisation of the legislative and regulatory framework for credit unions has become evident over time and it is clear therefore that the current legislative framework needs reform.  I have asked the Chair of the Financial Regulator to initiate a review of credit unions which it is hoped will make an important contribution to identifying the appropriate way forward.</P>

	<P>From my inquiries with the Financial Regulator, the authority for licensing moneylenders, I understand that it has not issued any licences authorising moneylenders to provide pay-day loans, i.e. short-term loans intended to cover a borrower&rsquo;s expenses until her/his next pay-day, with the initial loan running for approximately one month.  Anyone who becomes aware of such non-licensed money lending activity should bring it to the immediate attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </P><Col N="106"/>
        <P>The Financial Regulator provides information about the different forms of credit available to consumers, including credit cards, overdrafts, hire purchase, personal loans and money lending and recommends that consumers take on the right type of credit for the right purpose.  It also recommends a number of steps that borrowers should take including shopping around for the cheapest loan, reading all loan agreements, reviewing their debts from time to time and not taking on more debt than they can afford.  I strongly endorse the recommendations of the Financial Regulator and urge consumers to avail of the detailed information on borrowing money and getting credit which is available through its publications, help-line (Lo call 1890 77 77 77) and website http://www.itsyourmoney.ie.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, provides a non-profit public service counselling service through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) at her Department.  This is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt or in danger of getting into debt.  The Irish Banking Federation (IBF) and MABS recently agreed an Operational Protocol on consumer debt.  The Operational Protocol will enable MABS and the IBF to continue to work together effectively when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors who approach the MABS Service for assistance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of March 2009, the Government introduced a moratorium on public service recruitment and promotion, while allowing for certain exemptions in the Education and Health Sectors for the filling of certain key posts.  Furthermore, in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget, I announced a range of initiatives which are intended to lead to savings in the public service pay bill &mdash; an <i>Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement </i>in the public service, the <i>Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme</i> and the <i>Shorter Working Year Scheme</i> which replaces the existing <i>Term Time Scheme</i>.  In the April Budget I included a tentative estimate of savings of up to &euro;300 million in a full year (i.e. including both 2010 and 2011) arising from all of these initiatives.</P>
        <P>Based on the information returned to my Department, the number of persons in the public service has already decreased by 1,497 between end-March and end-June of this year.  Officials from my Department are currently engaged in the process of collating the end-September numbers.</P>
        <P>As regards exceptions to the moratorium, the Department of Finance has received written applications for exceptions for the filling of approximately 1,710 specific posts comprehended by the moratorium, of which the filling of 802 posts has been sanctioned.  As regards the Civil Service there were applications for the filling of 337 full-time posts and sanction was conveyed in 224 cases.  The main areas of exception were the prison service, educational psychologists and social welfare staff.</P>
        <P>As regards the broader Public Service, applications were made for the filling of some 1,373 posts and sanction was conveyed in 578 cases.  The main areas of exception were in the Education sector (renewal of secondment of teachers to Education Service), the Health sector (mental health nurses) and the Defence Forces (in particular, sanction for once-off acting-up allowances for specific overseas deployment).</P><Col N="107"/>
        <P>In terms of the pay bill implications it is estimated that gross full year salary costs of approximately &euro;31.6 million arise in respect of 601 of the exceptions granted.</P>
        <P>Of the remaining posts, the following specific points should be noted:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Department of Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Food</i>: 14 posts have transferred to Teagasc following the closure of Warrenstown Private College, and 1 promotion post in Teagasc was already the subject of an acting up allowance;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Department of Communications, Energy &amp; Natural Resources</i>: Of 45 posts exempted under the moratorium, 32 are seasonal posts recruited for 2009 only and 13 are funded by non-Exchequer sources;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Department of Defence</i>: 108 posts have been exempted (recruitment of 42 cadets, 4 promotions and 62 once-off acting-up allowances for specific overseas deployments) and the annual additional cost of these exemptions is calculated on an incremental basis and amounts to some &euro;1.5m.  This cost will be met from the Department&rsquo;s existing pay allocation.  This figure does not take account of savings resulting from non-filling of existing consequential vacancies in the case of promotions (&euro;306,000) or vacancies arising from natural wastage;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform</i>: 33 exemptions have been sanctioned for the renewal of contract posts in the Irish Youth Justice Service.  These posts were already filled on fixed term contracts and the concerned persons were on the payroll at their particular grade.</P>

	<P>Schemes of performance-related awards were introduced for certain public service grades on foot of recommendations by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector. In making these recommendations the Review Body expressed the view that such schemes were a highly desirable element in the total remuneration of top public service posts.</P>
        <P>I announced in the D&aacute;il on 5 February 2009 that award schemes in the public service would be suspended. No awards have been approved for 2008 in the case of the schemes applying to Deputy Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries in the civil service, the ranks of Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the ranks of Major General and Brigadier General in the Defence Forces and senior staff in the local authorities and the HSE.</P>
        <P>Decisions on performance-related bonuses for chief executives or other senior staff of non-commercial bodies and agencies are a matter for the Boards concerned. However, in April of this year my Department asked Secretaries General of Government Departments to inform such bodies and agencies under the remit of their Departments that, in view of the current economic and budgetary difficulties, it was appropriate that consideration of any bonus payments should be suspended.</P>
        <P>The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector has recently submitted a report to me on the remuneration of the senior public service groups within its terms of reference and this is under consideration at present.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Bank last week issued the latest Irish results of the Bank Lending Survey, which showed that for Q3 2009, credit standards on loans to enterprises tightened and the demand for loans from enterprises decreased further.  However, it must be noted that the pace of tightening decelerated from the previous quarter and that credit standards on loans to enterprises are expected to remain unchanged during the fourth quarter of 2009.  The survey acknowledged that previous Government announcements regarding recapitalisation support and state guarantees have facilitated access to wholesale funding markets although access to these markets remained challenging during the third quarter of 2009. </P>
        <P>A comprehensive independent review of SME lending from both the demand and supply perspective was undertaken and was published in July. The review showed that demand had fallen sharply, with the value of new applications for credit down by 42% while refusal rates varied by size of company from 19% to 30%. Stock of credit remained static, indicating that new credits broadly matched repayments.</P>
        <P>A follow-on Review covering the period to end September 2009 is currently underway and is expected in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In the context of the recapitalisation, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland made explicit commitments to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. The measures taken to date by the recapitalised banks, including those relating to lending, are outlined in the supplementary booklet on NAMA and I would direct the Deputy to Section 4 of that booklet. The Financial Regulator has been monitoring implementation of this commitment.</P>
        <P>With regard to drafting regulations under the NAMA Bill 2009, I will be introducing a Report Stage amendment to the Bill to provide a power to issue guidelines to the participating institutions on lending practices and procedures to improve the flow of credit to SMEs and, if necessary, other sectors. The power will be a wide ranging one and will allow for a response adapted to the particular circumstances of different institutions and sectors. This approach recognises that this is a complex situation and allows for a flexible response to changing credit needs.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question primarily relates to drug smuggling in the context of smaller aerodromes. </P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service has primary responsibility for the detection and seizure of controlled drugs at importation but there is a high degree of cooperation among all of the enforcement agencies of the State in the fight against the importation of illicit drugs.  In particular, Revenue has good working relationships with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Naval Service; and a Joint Task Force arrangement is in place to enhance and support these relationships with regular contact and cooperation between the agencies.</P><Col N="110"/>
        <P>It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti-smuggling checks. The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
        <P>The Customs controls at the smaller aerodromes are risk-based and are carried out by mobile Customs enforcement staff, whose attendance is selective and targeted, based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Traffic with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating would attract particular interest.</P>
        <P>Some of the smaller aerodromes are licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority. However, there are also small private aerodromes where, because of the limited nature of the activity at the aerodrome, a licensing requirement does not arise. Irrespective of the licensing situation, both Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are conscious of the need to monitor activity at these smaller aerodromes.  Whereas both agencies would have distinct operational protocols and priorities, they adopt a collaborative and complementary approach to areas of common interest.  For example, during 2008 they held a series of joint regional meetings with the smaller airport operators aimed specifically at increasing the operators&rsquo; awareness that their facilities could be used by drug traffickers and offering advice on minimising risk .</P>

	<P>A clear distinction needs to be made between householders who are in a position to meet their mortgage repayments and those who presently are not, or who are most vulnerable to entering into arrears on their mortgage repayments.</P>
        <P>The ESRI in its recent report on Negative Equity in the Irish Housing Market has noted at the outset that, and I quote: <i>&ldquo;In many cases negative equity will not be an issue. Many of those in negative equity will be unaffected and will continue to pay their mortgage without <Col N="112"/>difficulty.&rdquo;</i>(ESRI Report 319, pp 2)   Indeed the ESRI, through its trawl of the international literature, did not conclude that there is a direct causality between negative equity and mortgage default rates. [Indeed, in its concluding commentary, the ESRI noted that <i>&ldquo;negative equity does not cause default or foreclosure but rather is a condition of default&rdquo;</i> (ESRI Report 319, pp 17).]</P>
        <P>In overall terms, policies directed towards the recovery of the economy will do most to help those who are in a position of negative equity, as this would generate the necessary stability and confidence in labour and property markets to improve the personal situations of such householders.</P>
        <P>However, I am acutely aware that there are many householders who require immediate assistance and in this regard there are numerous measures in place to alleviate the problems faced. It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has a Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears which applies to mortgage lending activities with consumers, in respect of their principal private residence in the State, and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator.  Under the Code, where a borrower is in difficulty the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.</P>
        <P>In addition as part of their recapitalisation scheme, the two banks concerned, A.I.B. and Bank of Ireland, will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.</P>
        <P>People in serious debt or in danger of getting into serious debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). This is a national, free, confidential and independent service. The Operational Protocol on Debt Management agreed between the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) and MABS, which was recently put into effect, is to be welcomed and provides further assurance that the lending institutions will approach all genuine personal debt cases sympathetically and, where possible and appropriate, with the required degree of flexibility.</P>
        <P>In terms of financial assistance for mortgage repayments, the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme, administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive, provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person&rsquo;s sole place of residence.</P>

	<P>I, as Minister for Finance, have no role in relation to the setting of mortgage interest rates, nor does the Financial Regulator. </P>
        <P>The pricing of fixed rate mortgages by lending institutions would normally be based on the prevailing swap rates for the fixed rate period in question plus a margin. The actual cost of funds for each institution cannot be assessed on a mortgage by mortgage basis as they manage <Col N="113"/>the risk on a portfolio basis using several types of wholesale funding and derivatives depending on the size of each institution and its mortgage book.</P>
        <P>Regarding the application of early redemption fees on fixed rate mortgages, when a borrower signs a fixed-rate mortgage contract with a mortgage provider, the lender in turn enters into an agreement where they borrow the money at an agreed rate. The mortgage lender must repay the money at this agreed rate, so there is a cost to the institution if the fixed rate agreement is terminated before the agreed term which gives rise to the redemption fee charged in these cases.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator carried out a review of this issue earlier this year and submitted a report to my Department and the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service. The review focused on the early redemption fees being applied by lenders on fixed rate mortgages and looked at specific information requested from the mortgage lenders.  This included the submission of actuarial reports based on the formulae applied by the different lenders.  This independent verification, provided by actuaries, was received and analysed by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>The principal findings indicate that:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the early redemption fee calculation in all cases appears to seek to cover the costs; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />lenders do not generally apply additional fees in the case of early redemption. Lenders do not therefore seem to be applying financial penalties in order to dissuade borrowers from early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Notwithstanding the findings of the review set out above, I am aware that the Financial Regulator would strongly advise that any borrower who believes that they have been charged an excessive early redemption charge should request their lending institution to provide a clear explanation of how the cost was calculated.  In the event that the borrower is not satisfied with the explanation, a formal complaint should be made to the lender and in the event of an unsatisfactory response, he or she should exercise his/her option to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman who will independently adjudicate on the matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 171 together. </P>
        <P>In October, both the Central Bank and the ESRI published updated forecasts for the Irish economy.  A number of private sector institutions have also recently updated their projections.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank is now projecting that GNP will fall by 10.6 per cent this year or that in GDP terms the economy will contract by 7.8 per cent. The downward revision from the Bank&rsquo;s <Col N="114"/>summer forecast stems from the publication of output data for the first half of this year which show, in particular, very weak GNP figures.</P>
        <P>The ESRI is projecting that GNP will fall by a cumulative 13.2 per cent over the 2008 &mdash; 2010 period or expressed in GDP terms by 11.3 per cent over this time.</P>
        <P>My Department will review its forecasts in the Pre-Budget Outlook later this month.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that regular forecasters of the Irish economy now concur with the view that the decline in activity has slowed and that positive annual growth will be recorded at some stage next year.</P>
        <P>In terms of the divergences in the GDP and GNP data published for the first half of this year, these data suggest that the difference between the two measures for the year as a whole will be somewhat larger than normal.  Given the large multinational sector here, the level of GDP typically exceeds that of GNP due to profit outflows.  However, the level of GNP this year has been further affected by weaker profit inflows and by higher debt service costs to non-residents. This latter factor is likely to persist given the trends in our national debt over the coming years.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>  if he has developed proposals for the reform of the political expenses regimes of office holders and of Members of the Oireachtas.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Firstly it must be stated that Members of these Houses and officeholders incur legitimate expenses as part of their parliamentary duties both in attending Leinster House and as part of their constituency duties. It is also appropriate that the amount of any such expense should be kept under review to ensure they are appropriate to reflect the cost of those duties, as well as the prevailing economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have already reduced the cost of Oireachtas expense allowances.  Expenses generally have been reduced by 10%; mileage rates have also been reduced by 25% in line with the general reduction in public service mileage rates.</P>
        <P>Members of the Oireachtas and officer holders are therefore making sacrifices in recognition of the current economic situation.</P>
        <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission brought forward proposals earlier this year to introduce a single composite parliamentary allowance in place of a number of separate allowances. This summer I introduced the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and other Parliamentary Officeholders Act 2009 which, among other things, provided an enabling provision for a single composite allowance for Deputies and Senators to be known as the Parliamentary Standard Allowance. This allowance could replace some or all of the many separate allowances payable at present. The legislation also allows for the proposed composite allowance to be linked to attendance.</P>
        <P>At the time I introduced the legislation, I stated clearly that I was of the view that there was a need for further consideration and discussion of the proposed composite allowance before I brought forward the necessary Regulations. Since then, I have had discussions with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, and there are contacts at official level also.</P>
        <P>At present I am in the process of considering the most appropriate revised arrangements which would give a transparent, verifiable and cost-effective system of parliamentary expenses. When I have completed my consideration of the matter, Regulations setting out the new arrangements will be laid before the Houses.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, on 16 September last I published an outline of the main elements of the proposed new guarantee scheme for longer term funding, called the draft Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme or ELG Scheme.  The ELG scheme must be approved in accordance with EU State aid rules and discussions are continuing in this regard with the European Commission. The Scheme is also subject to approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I plan to bring the necessary legislative proposals before the Dail and the Seanad shortly.</P>
        <P>The ELG Scheme is intended to facilitate the ability of credit institutions in Ireland to issue debt securities and take deposits with a maturity post-September 2010 of up to five years, on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.</P>
        <P>As is the case for the current CIFS guarantee, the participating institutions in the ELG Scheme will pay a fee for the State guarantee. This fee will be priced in accordance with ECB pricing recommendations and it will be higher than that charged for the CIFS guarantee.</P>

	<P>The area for which I have direct responsibility is the civil service.</P>
        <P>A Disciplinary Code for civil servants is set out in <b>Circular 14/2006</b>: Civil Service Disciplinary Code revised in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005.  The Code came into effect on 4 July 2006 and replaced the previous Code as set out in Circular 1/92. The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 allows certain provisions contained in the Public Service Management Act 1997 to take effect.  The 2005 Act gives each Secretary General/Head of Scheduled Office, as appropriate authority, responsibility for managing all matters relating to performance, conduct and discipline of civil servants below Principal Officer level. Ministers continue to be the appropriate authority for these matters in relation to civil servants at or above Principal level in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005. The code is available on the personnel code website: www.personnelcode.gov.ie.</P>
        <P>Specific arrangements apply to disciplinary matters affecting employees in other areas of the public service and these are the prime responsibility of the relevant Ministers. For instance, procedures for the suspension and dismissal of teachers have recently been agreed and these are available from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>Guidelines are available on the contracts, remuneration and other conditions of chief executives and senior management of commercial state bodies. The guidelines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; www.finance.gov.ie.</P><Col N="116"/>
        <P>Contracts for Chief Executives of individual non-commercial state bodies contain provisions relating to circumstances in which the employment of the chief executive may be terminated. The circumstances in which employment may be terminated normally include misconduct or gross default affecting the business of the Body concerned, bankruptcy, incapacitation and conviction of a criminal offence, other than an offence which in the opinion of the Body concerned does not affect the position as chief executive.</P>
        <P>As regards severance/early retirement arrangements for chief executive officers, the current guidelines are set out in a letter to all Heads of Departments on 26 May 1998.  A copy of the letter is set out below this reply.</P>

        <P Just="Center" el="10">Severance and Early Retirement for Chief Executives of State Sponsored Bodies</P>
        <P el="10"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>1. <?oasys _ix ?>I am directed by the Minister for Finance to say that he has considered the issue of severance/early retirement payments for Chief Executives of State Sponsored Bodies (SSBs). This consideration has had particular regard to the fact that it is becoming more common for Chief Executive Officers of State Sponsored Bodies to be employed on fixed term contracts, and that there may be times when the Board of a State Sponsored Body and the relevant Minister may conclude that it is in the best interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of the SSB concerned to terminate or not to renew the contract of an incumbent CEO. This need not necessarily arise as a result of any dissatisfaction with the performance of the individual concerned, but perhaps because a new and fresh approach needs to be introduced. In such circumstances, the Minister will not object to the application of special early retirement/severance provisions, subject to certain conditions and safeguards.</P>
     <P el="10"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>2. <?oasys _ix ?>The Minister has therefore decided that this Department will not object to the making of severance payments or grant of early retirement terms to Chief Executives of State Bodies within the following maximum limits and subject to the conditions specified, from a current date. Departments may deal with cases within the guidelines and limits without reference to this Department except where such reference is specifically required (drafts of any consequent changes in the relevant pension schemes would need to be cleared in the normal way).</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>Payment of pension and lump sum, based on actual reckonable pensionable service, increased as appropriate in accordance with paragraph (b) following, may be allowed at age 55 for a CEO who retires from that position, who has served at least 6 years in that capacity and who has at least 15 years actual service overall in the public sector only service with the body from which the CEO is retiring or service which has been transferred into the scheme of that body may reckon.</P><Col N="117"/>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>In determining the pension and lump sum to be paid, one added year of pensionable service may be granted for each year in excess of 15 years overall actual service in the public sector1 (i.e. including service in capacities other than as a CEO) subject to a maximum of 5 added years;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>Actuarially reduced benefits may be made available without age restriction &mdash; this means that a person might receive a pension benefit or lump sum before age 55, provided that the cost of providing these benefits at the earlier age are entirely offset by a reduction in the amount of benefits payable: the amount of such reduction would require to be determined by the relevant scheme&rsquo;s actuaries;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(d) <?oasys _ix ?>Where an immediate pension (other than on an actuarially reduced basis) is not payable, a severance payment of four weeks pay per year of continuous service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks pay, may be made. However, where pension becomes payable within 26 weeks of retirement, the amount of the severance should be reduced to the amount of salary which would have been payable between the date of retirement and commencement of pension.</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>3. <?oasys _ix ?>Application of the foregoing terms would be strictly conditional on completion of contract, unless the Board, in agreement with the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance, decides to terminate the CEO&rsquo;s employment before the termination of the contract. It is not therefore appropriate to make such payments where the initiative for the termination of a contract comes from the CEO concerned.</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>4. <?oasys _ix ?>Application of these terms would also be conditional on there being no re-employment, direct or indirect, of the individual concerned by the body from which s/he is retiring, or another public sector body in the same sector.</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>5. <?oasys _ix ?>Where subsequent employment is obtained in the public sector such that pension plus pay in the new job exceeds the equivalent of the retirement salary on the basis of which the pension is payable, then pension will be abated to bring the total down to the level of that salary. This abatement will not apply in relation to work after age 65. Where pension rights are acquired in respect of post-retirement work, the original pension (if based on actual service plus added years) would be reduced and based on actual service only. In such circumstances the uprated portion of the lump sum attributable to the added years would be required to be repaid. It should be explicitly stated that any grant of early retirement terms would be subject to these conditions.</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>6. <?oasys _ix ?>The terms set out above are intended to be maximum ones, and a Board would be free to apply lesser benefits or not to apply early retirement benefits at all. Early retirement benefits might be denied, for example, if the Board wanted the contract renewed for a further term. It is not, therefore, intended to interfere with the freedom of Boards in this area, but rather to indicate the maximum limits which the Minister would be prepared to approve.</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>7. <?oasys _ix ?>Adjustment to the terms set out above will be necessary where a retiring CEO has already availed of a severance or early retirement package from a public sector body, and in such cases this Department should be consulted.</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>8. <?oasys _ix ?>The arrangements set out in this letter should be allowed strictly on the basis, accepted in writing by the CEO, that they are in full and final settlement of any claim which the CEO may have in relation to the early retirement or termination or non-renewal of a contract.</P><Col N="118"/>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>9. <?oasys _ix ?>The Minister does not anticipate approving any improvement on the terms set out above, even in individual exceptional cases, other than on foot of a Government decision.</P>
        <P>10. <?oasys _ix ?>It is essential that Departments should convey to the Pensions Section of this Department details of each case dealt with under the terms of this letter. The contact point in this Department for telephone queries is Mr. Kevin Cardiff at (01) 604-5476.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 288 together. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s recent loss of competitiveness and the need to improve it is something that we have been aware of for some time. Until last year, prices grew faster than those in the euro area, while wages grew at a rate greater than productivity would justify in many sectors. The recent appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling has not helped either. The National Competitiveness Council has outlined a range of wider cost factors that have damaged our competitiveness as well. These developments have left Ireland vulnerable in our international markets in the midst of the collapse in global demand.</P>
        <P>We need to improve our competitiveness as quickly as possible and there are already a number of positive developments in this regard. Consumer prices in Ireland are now declining at the fastest rate in the euro area. In addition, we are also seeing the benefits of our labour market flexibility: much available evidence points to recent downward pressure on wages in the economy. As a small member of a currency union we have no control over the exchange rates we face so we must focus on improving competitiveness at home. While the falls in domestic prices, easing wage pressures and improvements in productivity are helpful we must not be complacent as further improvements in our competitiveness are essential if we are to position ourselves to benefit when EU and global growth resumes.</P>

	<P>In recent months I understand that underwriters of payment protection insurance have been increasing their premiums in response to the rapid growth in unemployment which is leading to increases in claims and an increased risk profile.</P>
        <P>I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in relation to the criteria for premiums being charged for payment protection insurance. However, I am informed that, while the Financial Regulator has no function in relation to the criteria being applied to premiums, this situation is being monitored to ensure that the Financial Regulators Consumer Protection Code is being complied with. The General Principles of the Code require that a regulated entity <i>&ldquo;acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interest of its customers and the integrity of the market&rdquo;.</i> In particular the Code requires a regulated entity must ensure that key items are brought to the attention of the consumer and that the method of presentation must not disguise, diminish or obscure important information. In addition information must be supplied on a timely basis, and where a regulated entity intends to amend or alter the range of services it provides, it must give at least one month&rsquo;s notice to affected consumers.</P>

	<P>It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be and generally is the last resort for the lender. The preferred method of dealing with cases of arrears should be early intervention and engagement.</P>
        <P>In the revised Programme for Government we have stated that we will be:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Examining ways of expanding the existing options available for dealing with debt situations;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Examining ways of expanding existing state sponsored mortgage-support measures;  There are already important arrangements in place to assist consumers who have fallen into arrears or are in danger of falling into arrears.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government provides support for payment of mortgages under the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme. This scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person&rsquo;s principal private residence. Furthermore, people in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). This is a national, free, confidential and independent service. The Irish Banking Federation (IBF) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service recently agreed an Operational Protocol on consumer debt.  The Operational Protocol will enable MABS and the IBF to continue to work together effectively when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors who approach the MABS Service for assistance.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code sets out requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator also has in place a Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. This Code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator. Under the code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender has to make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and the lender has to give consideration on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing the type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest. Obviously cases will arise where the arrears persist despite newly agreed changes in repayment schedules. The Code provides that where such situations persist, the lender may reserve the right to enforce the mortgage agreement. However, it must wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, as part of their recapitalisation scheme, A.I.B. and Bank of Ireland will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is not sustainable to continue to allow the gap between revenue and expenditure to grow and that it is essential to stabilise the General Government Deficit in that context. Stabilising the deficit in 2010 will facilitate confidence and the earlier return to growth in the economy than would occur if stabilisation is deferred and the national debt increases further as a result. </P>
        <P>In relation to the specifics of the question, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the economic impact in 2010 of any consolidation package. There are considerable uncertainties regarding the economic impact of any fiscal measures, given that it is unknown how economic agents will react to the various policy changes.  In addition, the composition of the fiscal package would be important, as different policy measures would have different economic impacts. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the economic impact of fiscal measures can be estimated in broad terms.</P>
        <P>A fiscal package designed to raise &euro;4 billion in 2010 would be the equivalent of about 2&frac12;% of GDP.  Taking account of a number of factors, such as the potential for significant &lsquo;leakages&rsquo; through imports and some impact on price rather than on the quantity of output it is estimated that GDP growth would be around 1 to 1&frac12;% lower than would otherwise be the case on foot of these measures.</P>
        <P>However, as stated above, there is potential for considerable variation on the macroeconomic impact depending on the exact nature of any fiscal package.  Furthermore, account of the potential for enhanced consumer and investor confidence and greater future certainty that such a package could have is also important and would have to be factored in. On balance, stabilising the deficit in 2010 is critical to restoring confidence and to positioning the economy for growth in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>It is intended to publish model-based estimates of the economic impact of actual fiscal consolidation alongside the budget documentation. </P>

	<P>The Independent Review of Credit Availability was published on 10 July. The review showed that demand had fallen sharply, with the value of new applications for credit down by 42% while refusal rates varied by size of company from 19% to 30%. Stock of credit remained static since June 2008, indicating that new credits broadly matched repayments. </P>
        <P>A follow-on Review covering the period to end September 2009 is currently underway and is expected in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In the context of the recapitalisation, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland made explicit commitments to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business <Col N="122"/>lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  The measures taken to date by the recapitalised banks, including those relating to lending, are outlined in the supplementary booklet on NAMA and I would direct the Deputy to Section 4 of that booklet. The Financial Regulator has been monitoring implementation of these commitments.</P>
        <P>With regard to drafting regulations under the NAMA Bill 2009, I will be introducing a Report Stage amendment to the Bill to provide a power to issue guidelines to the participating institutions on lending practices and procedures which will improve the flow of credit to SMEs and, if necessary, other sectors. The power will be a wide ranging one and will allow for a response adapted to the particular circumstances of different institutions and sectors. This approach recognises that this is a complex situation and allows for a flexible response to changing credit needs.</P>

	<P>As per the Government announcement of 29 May last, &euro;4 billion in capital has been provided to Anglo, in three tranches; &euro;3 billion on 29 June, &euro;827 million on 6 August following completion of the bank&rsquo;s debt buy back exercise, and the remainder, &euro;173 million, on 25 September. This capital was provided to Anglo to protect the economy from the wider losses that would occur in the event of the failure of the bank, to protect the deposits in the bank and to prevent the bank becoming a systemic threat to the financial system. </P>
        <P>As I stated in my speech on the Second Stage of the NAMA Bill in the D&aacute;il on 16 September last, it is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital. I made it clear that the Government would expect such an institution to explore all available options for raising such capital as it is the Government preference that private market solutions are found and implemented.</P>
        <P>However, to the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally, the Government remains committed to providing such banks with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements. This will be done in a manner consistent with EU State aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy. I have recently confirmed this position to the Financial Regulator in the case of Anglo to facilitate the FR in granting Anglo derogations from certain regulatory capital requirements.</P>
        <P>The Board of Anglo is currently finalising a restructuring plan, which will consider all options for the future of the bank and set out the future strategy for Anglo. The restructuring plan will address the issue of compensatory measures for the capital provision. The restructuring plan will be submitted to the European Commission for approval under State aid rules by the end of November.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, on 16 September last I published an outline of the main elements of the proposed new guarantee scheme for longer term funding, called the draft Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme or ELG Scheme.  The ELG scheme must be approved in accordance with EU State aid rules and discussions are continuing in this regard with the European Commission. The Scheme is also subject to approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I plan to bring the necessary legislative proposals before the Dail and the Seanad shortly. </P>
        <P>The ELG Scheme is intended to facilitate the ability of credit institutions in Ireland to issue debt securities and take deposits with a maturity post-September 2010 of up to five years, on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.</P>
        <P>As I have previously remarked, the new scheme will be somewhat more targeted, and in this regard dated subordinated debt (Lower Tier 2) or asset covered securities (including other forms of covered bonds) issued by a covered institution on or after the commencement date shall not be guaranteed either under this Scheme or the CIFS Scheme .</P>
        <P>However, dated subordinated debt  and asset covered securities (including other forms of covered bonds) issued by a covered institution before the commencement date and which are covered liabilities shall continue to be guaranteed under the CIFS Scheme.

	<P>In the Supplementary Budget last April, the Government set out a multi-annual plan to correct the public finances. This plan has been welcomed by the European Commission. The immediate need is the stabilisation of the deficit in 2010 and this is Government&rsquo;s proposed aim. This will require difficult decisions to be made for Budget 2010 which will presented to the D&aacute;il on 9 December. The bulk of the corrective action in Budget 2010 will have to come from the expenditure side as further significant increases in the tax burden would impact on enterprise and growth prospects. The measures that must be introduced will undoubtedly be difficult, but the imperative for action is clear and we must make the necessary adjustments now in order to stabilise the public finances. </P>
        <P>At the publication of the end-September Exchequer Returns, my Department announced that tax revenues could finish the year in the region of &euro;32 billion. Later today, my Department will publish the most recent Exchequer Returns for the period covering to end-October. While the poor performance of tax revenue has continued, it is not out of line with what had been anticipated. To put this in perspective, overall tax revenue in 2009 is back to 2003 levels while gross voted expenditure has increased by about 70 per cent since 2003. Consequently, we will have to borrow approximately &euro;26 billion this year to fund the forecast Exchequer deficit for 2009.</P>
        <P>Bridging the gap between income and expenditure through ongoing increased borrowing is not a viable solution in the medium to long-term. Taking the necessary action now will ensure that confidence is maintained in the Irish economy and that Ireland is favourably placed to benefit from global recovery as it takes hold. Delaying taking action is not an option and would <Col N="124"/>require harsher actions to be taken later as well as seeing ever increasing amounts of Government resources being used up in servicing the debt.</P>
        <P>In 2009, gross voted spending divides into three main areas &mdash; with 37 per cent on Social Welfare spending, 35 per cent on the public service pay and pensions bill and 28 per cent on other programmes. The priority must be the stabilisation of the deficit next year.  It is clear, therefore, that all areas of expenditure will have to be considered in the context of deciding on the adjustments.</P>
        <P>The Pre-Budget Outlook, which my Department plans to publish in mid-November, will provide an update on the macroeconomic outlook and set out a technical fiscal forecast. The House will have the chance to discuss these forecasts in a Pre-Budget Outlook debate. The Budget will be published on 9 December and will provide full details of the nature of the corrective measures being undertaken.</P>

	<P>The measures that are in place and the methodologies used to address the smuggling of illegal cigarettes into this jurisdiction have already been outlined in detail in a comprehensive reply that I issued to Deputy Flanagan on 13 October 2009 in response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 84 (35772/09), 128 (35770/09) and 129(35771/09).</P>
        <P>In summary, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the overall approach is to tackle the problem using a combination of detection, seizure and prosecution by means of an amalgamation of profiling, intelligence gathering, sharing of information with other Customs Services and where appropriate using x-ray scanning technology to detect contraband.</P>
        <P>Multi-agency operations involving Customs and An Garda Siochana and other Law Enforcement Agencies are mounted where appropriate. The strategy also involves working closely with the legitimate tobacco industry and the Office of Tobacco Control. In addition checks, both random and intelligence driven, are mounted at retail outlets and at markets and distribution centres to identify and seize illicit cigarettes that have evaded detection at the point of importation.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners engage with the work of the European Anti Fraud Office which co-ordinates both international operations and other countermeasures undertaken by the authorities of the Member States against cigarette smuggling.</P>
        <P>The above strategies, including the deployment of resources, are under continuous review.  This approach has resulted in the seizure of almost 200m cigarettes to-date in 2009. These include the estimated 120m cigarettes seized in the course of the well-publicised multi-agency Operation Samhna mounted on 27 October 2009, which is a good illustration of the successful execution of a multi-agency operation.</P>

	<P>In the April Supplementary Budget my Department published economic and fiscal forecasts for the 2009-2013 period: since then there has been a further decline in the fiscal position in 2009 due to a shortfall in expected tax receipts in the region of &euro;2 billion. It is now expected that the General Government Balance for 2009 will be approximately -12% of GDP, as opposed to -10&frac34;% of GDP forecast last April. The updated position was notified to Eurostat as part of the end-September Maastricht Returns. Details were also published on the Department&rsquo;s website. The deterioration in the 2009 position will obviously impact on the outlook for 2010.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the views of the ESRI, as recently stated in its Quarterly Economic Commentary, as I am of other forecasts. In broad terms, the views of most forecasters are within the range of the current workings of my Department. In the coming weeks my Department will publish a technical pre-Budget forecast GGB and GGD for 2010 as part of the Pre Budget Outlook. However, I have already indicated that the Government&rsquo;s aim in the December Budget is to stabilise the Deficit at the 2009 level. This will not be an easy task although the Government is endeavouring to do through a series of processes including our recent ongoing engagement with the Social Partners.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the Gross Debt position does not take account of the fact that the NTMA had cash balances at the end of September in the region of  &euro;25 billion, or of the &euro;20.9 billion assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which substantially reduces the country&rsquo;s Net Debt.</P>
        <P>The main reason for the increasing level of government debt is the need to borrow to bridge the gap between the high level of government spending and declining tax receipts. At present we have to borrow the equivalent of &euro;500 million per week to meet existing commitments. We cannot afford to continue to do this and so we will take corrective action in the forthcoming Budget to return the level of public spending to a more sustainable level.</P>
        <P>It is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital, although the Government would expect such an institution to explore all available options for raising such capital. It is the Government preference that private market solutions are found and implemented. The banks and building societies will be expected to increase the equity component of their capital base as the NAMA asset transfers are implemented.</P>
        <P>To the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally, the Government remains committed to providing such banks and building societies with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements. This will be done in a manner consistent with EU State aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy.</P>

	<P>The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes has made a wide range of recommendations for reform and <Col N="126"/>rationalisation within the public service.  All of the recommendations of the Special Group are being considered by the Government in the context of the 2010 Estimates and Budgetary process and Government decisions on the proposals will be taken in that context. </P>
        <P>As regards the specific issues highlighted, the Deputy will be aware of the range of measures in place to support the Government&rsquo;s overall numbers policy, including the incentivised scheme of early retirement, incentivised career breaks and the shorter working year scheme. My Department has also commenced discussions with the unions representing civil and public servants with a view to agreeing appropriate arrangements for the redeployment and placement of staff across the civil and public service.  To date, no redundancy arrangements have been discussed or agreed.</P>
        <P>In relation to shared services and outsourcing, the report of the Government&rsquo;s Task Force on the Public Service noted that experience in both the public and private sectors demonstrates that benefits can be realised by the adoption of shared services models under certain conditions.  It recalled the view of the OECD that an incremental approach should be taken to the development of shared services which should be a strategy that is only pursued where a clear ex-ante case can be made for achieving either financial benefits or service improvement.  It identified the most common areas of shared services as payroll, financial management, human resources management, means assessment, procurement and common ICT services.</P>
        <P>Of course, no consideration of shared services would be complete without an assessment of the potential for services to be delivered by external providers.  <i>Towards 2016</i> recognises that there will be co-operation with the introduction of shared services between Public Service and related organisations where this can give rise to efficiencies or cost savings.  Work on the development of shared services, which is taking place under the direction of the Cabinet Committee on Transforming Public Services, is ongoing.  At present a number of pilot projects are being developed which it is envisaged will inform developments throughout the Public Service.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, following European Commission approval, &euro;4bn in capital has now been provided to Anglo. This capital was provided to protect the economy from the wider losses that would occur in the event of the failure of the bank, to protect the substantial deposit base in the bank and to prevent the bank becoming a systemic threat to the financial system. </P>
        <P>As I stated in my speech on the Second Stage of the NAMA Bill in the Dail on 16 September last, it is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital. I made it clear that the Government would expect such an institution to explore all available options for raising such capital as it is the Government preference that private market solutions are found and implemented.</P>
        <P>However, to the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally, the Government remains committed to providing such banks with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements. This will be done in a manner consistent with EU State aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy. I have recently confirmed this position to the Financial Regulator in the case of Anglo to facilitate the FR in granting Anglo derogations from certain regulatory capital requirements.</P>
        <P>The Board of Anglo is currently finalising a restructuring plan which will consider all options for the future of the bank and set out the future strategy for Anglo. The preparation of the restructuring plan by the bank is at an advanced stage and it would not be appropriate to comment on the draft plan at this point. The restructuring plan will be submitted by the end of November to the European Commission for approval under State aid rules.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office published national accounts data for the second quarter of 2009 at the end of September.  These data show that GDP and GNP fell at an annual rate of 7.4 and 11.6 per cent, respectively, in the second quarter of this year. Combined with the first quarter data, the figures show that the annual rate of decline in the first half of the year was 8.4 per cent in GDP terms and 12.4 per cent in GNP terms.</P>
        <P>The sharp declines in housing output and in personal spending were the main reasons for the contraction in the second quarter. While these results are poor, one positive feature of <Col N="128"/>the data is that the rate of export decline was not as large as that in many other export-oriented economies.</P>
        <P>Data which have been published since then suggest that the rate of contraction has slowed in the intervening period.  As a result, the forecast for a GDP contraction of 7&frac34; per cent this year contained in the April Supplementary Budget remains broadly valid. My Department will publish in mid-November the Pre-Budget Outlook and that will set out a revised macroeconomic outlook. At this stage I envisage only a minor revision to the Department&rsquo;s estimate for GDP for this year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of possible refunds of tax to participating institutions as a result of the transfer of assets to NAMA does not yet arise since no such transfers have yet taken place. As the Deputy will appreciate, it will not be possible to quantify the losses until the transfers actually take place. </P>
        <P>The Irish tax system provides that where a company incurs losses in the course of its trade, those losses may be carried back and used against the profits, if any, of the immediately preceding accounting period of the same length (an accounting period cannot exceed one year).  For example, if, as a result of transfers of bank assets in the year to 31 December 2009, a participating institution makes an overall loss in that year then it would be entitled to set off that loss against profits, if any, arising to the institution in the year to 31 December 2008 only. Where there were no profits in 2008 against which to set the loss carried back, no refund would arise since no tax would have been chargeable. In such cases, the losses may be carried forward.</P>
        <P>For the future, I have included in the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 a provision to limit the amount of relief that can be claimed by participating institutions for losses <Col N="129"/>carried forward from earlier years. It will limit the set-off of carried-forward losses against trading income of a participating institution and all other participating institutions in the same group, to no more than 50 per cent of that income.  The net effect of the provision is that the income of a group of participating institutions cannot be reduced by more than 50% by set-off of losses carried forward. A minimum of 50% of trading income of any year will continue to be chargeable notwithstanding claims for relief for losses carried forward into that year.</P>

        <Quest> the guidelines that exist regarding the procedure applicable to the early retirement of a public servant or a chief executive or an employee of a State or semi-State body; the circumstances stated in such guidelines in which it is said to be appropriate to effect such early retirement; the financial arrangements applicable to same; if he will furnish a copy of the said guidelines; and if it is intended to make amendments to them. </Quest>

	<P>In the civil and public service, Cost Neutral Early Retirement (CNER) has been available since 1 April 2004 for individuals who wish to retire with immediate pension up to 10 years before normal retirement age.  More recently, the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) has been available.  The procedures and circumstances whereby these arrangements may be availed of are set out in Circulars 10 of 2005 (CNER) and 12 of 2009 (ISER).  Civil and public service superannuation schemes provide for early retirement on grounds of ill-health, which may include some additional years of notional service, depending on age and service.</P>
        <P>There are specific early retirement provisions in various areas of the Public service.  Gardai, prison officers and psychiatric nurses who are not new entrants as defined in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 may retire on reaching the age of 50 if they have 30 years of service.  This means that they have qualified for full pension entitlements because under their schemes each year of service in excess of 20 years reckons as 2 years of service for pension purposes.  Primary and secondary school teachers may retire on or after age 55 if they have 35 years of service.  In the Defence forces, officers who are not new entrants under the 2004 Act may retire with immediate pension after 12 years service regardless of age and similarly enlisted personnel may retire with immediate pension after 21 years service also regardless of age.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Superannuation Act 1909 and sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 set out rules governing early retirement of civil servants as a consequence of abolition of office or for the purposes of facilitating improvements in the organisation of the department in order to effect greater efficiency and economy.  Section 6 of the 1909 Act allows for the immediate payment of pension on retiring.  Section 6 of the 1963 Act allows for the addition of up to 10 years of notional service and section 7 of that Act allows for the grant of a special severance gratuity of up to one-half of annual salary.  These provisions apply to Secretaries General and similar provisions apply to County Managers under the Local Government Superannuation Scheme.  In the wider public service the provisions of the 1909 and 1963 Acts serve as guidelines in dealing with similar cases.  In operating these provisions, the practice in the main is not to grant additional years of notional service and a severance payment to any one individual.</P>
        <P>For full-time board members and equivalent positions in the Competition Authority, Labour Court, Environmental Protection Agency and Bord Plean&aacute;la retirement is normally between age 60 and 65; however, members who have their appointment terminated (other than for stated misconduct), or are not re-appointed on expiration of their period of office, are entitled <Col N="130"/>to immediate pension and lump sum where they have accrued more than two years&rsquo; service. Preservation of benefits applies only in case of voluntary resignation after two or more years&rsquo; service.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance letter of 26 May 1998 to all Heads of Departments sets out the enhanced retirement/severance terms for chief executive officers of non-commercial semi-State bodies whose contracts are not renewed or are terminated, and the conditions under which they may be made available.  Such non-renewal or termination might arise where the board and Minister conclude that there is a need for a fresh approach in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation.  It is envisaged that the terms set out in the 1998 letter will be reviewed as part of a wider examination of public service pensions which is being undertaken with a view to developing a new and comprehensive pensions framework.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to cover all the early retirement arrangements across the public service.  The Deputy might wish to consult respective Ministers about specific circumstances pertaining to agencies and bodies under their aegis.</P>

With reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions, the Government will also examine ways of expanding its own mortgage support measures.</P>

        <P>At the end of September, &euro;23.7 billion in tax revenue receipts had been collected. This was &euro;965 million below the profile target for the first nine months of the year that was outlined in April. The Supplementary Budget forecast that total tax revenue in 2009 would total &euro;34.4 billion. At the publication of the end-September Exchequer Returns, my Department stated that it now expects that tax revenue receipts in 2009 will be in the region of &euro;2 billion below forecast.</P>
        <P>The end-October Exchequer Returns will be published this afternoon. Tax revenue receipts have continued to show some weakness, but are broadly in line with what was anticipated.</P>
        <P>Trends in incoming tax receipts are continually analysed by my Department and the prospective end-year outturn kept under constant review. At the aggregate level, taxes in the region of &euro;32 billion &mdash; back to 2003 levels &mdash; are now thought likely for the year as a whole. Set out below are the original end-monthly totals for tax revenue for the months of October, November and December.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for the collection and recovery of a wide range of taxes and duties. They have a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount within the appropriate deadlines. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to organise their financial affairs so as to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. Apart from the critical importance of timely compliance to the Exchequer, unfair competitive advantage achieved through persistent late or non-payment of tax can undermine compliant businesses.  I fully support what Revenue is doing in that regard. </P>
        <P>I know that the Revenue Commissioners are very conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate in this country and of the challenges posed for some businesses in meeting with their tax obligations within the appropriate deadlines. Revenue has responded to the changing environment by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular tax payment difficulties to work proactively with them to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore timely compliance.</P>
        <P>Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such cases and it has published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties in a prominent position on the home page of its website www.revenue.ie.  I am aware that the feedback from trade representatives and tax practitioner bodies to the initiative Revenue has taken in this regard has been positive and it is regarded as an effective way of supporting businesses in meeting their tax payment obligations at this time. </P>

        <Quest> if individuals who purchased shares in Anglo Irish Bank with loans financed by Anglo Irish Bank itself on a non-recourse basis will be able to write off the loss incurred against future Capital Gains Tax liabilities; if this is the case, if he will introduce some mechanism to prevent this from happening; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that loss relief for capital gains tax purposes arises where there is a disposal of an asset for a consideration that is less than its acquisition cost or where an asset has been lost or destroyed or becomes of negligible value.  Subject to certain conditions (for example, relief cannot be given more than once in respect of a loss) a capital loss can be carried forward for set-off against future capital gains. </P>
        <P>Section 546 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that a loss is computed in the same way as a chargeable gain is computed in regard to Capital Gains Tax. Calculations of chargeable gains or allowable losses under this legislation take no account whatsoever of the financing arrangements (whether non-recourse or not) relating to the asset disposed of, or deemed to be of negligible value, or lost/destroyed, as the case may be.</P>
        <P>The question of changing the legislation to disallow or limit the carry forward of losses in circumstances where the asset was financed through non-recourse loans would represent a significant change to our capital gains tax legislation because it would effectively link the taxation of an asset to the loan arrangements for the acquisition of the asset in question.  Furthermore, the current symmetry of treatment between losses and gains would be affected. I have no plans at this stage to make a change in this area, but the matter will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>For a very open economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s exchange rate movements can have a large impact on living standards.  In this regard, the appreciation of the euro against both the dollar and sterling is clearly a concern as it undermines the competitiveness of the exporting sector.</P>
        <P>The traditional-type industries exporting to the UK appear to be especially vulnerable to appreciation of the euro. In addition, indigenous firms competing with UK-based firms on the domestic market are exposed to euro appreciation.  The retail sector is also exposed to euro-sterling developments given our land border with the UK. On the upside, the appreciation of the euro, particularly against sterling, brings some benefits in terms of reduced prices for domestic consumer goods as a large amount of these are imported by retailers from the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>As a member of a monetary union, it is not open to us to adjust our exchange rate, but also of course there are benefits to being a member of such a union during these very challenging times in which we live. What is vital, however, is that we concentrate on restoring our competitiveness through other mechanisms, such as adjusting pay and non-pay costs as well as increasing in productivity.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that Government initiatives such as the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund provide targeted support to indigenous companies, including those engaged in exporting to assist them in the exceptionally difficult business environment in which they are operating at present.</P>

I saw the draft Plan as a key element to informing the debate <Col N="135"/>on the NAMA legislation as it progressed through its various stages.

	<P>The decision on the interest rate to be charged by lending institutions for mortgages is a commercial decision for the financial institution concerned.  This decision will reflect a range of different factors including funding costs, market conditions, profitability and business strategy as well as the competitive environment overall.  The Deputy will appreciate it is a core function of the Board and senior management of each institution to assess where the appropriate balance lies between these competing objectives particularly in ensuring the financial health and commercial viability of the relevant institution.  It is not an appropriate role for the Minister for Finance to seek to determine this decision making by financial institutions operating under competitive market conditions. </P>
        <P>The Government took steps in October 2007 via an amendment to the Central Bank Act, 1997, to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and supervision of retail credit firms by the Financial Regulator engaged in specialist or so-called sub-prime lending. Such lenders were not previously subject to financial regulation in respect of lending activities. The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  This regulatory regime has been in place since 1 February 2008 and is being implemented by <Col N="136"/>the Financial Regulator. Consumer credit, including sub-prime lending, is also regulated in Ireland under the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The Act makes detailed provision for the form and content of loan agreements and for advertising of consumer credit.</P>
        <P>Some non deposit-taking mortgage lenders are required to notify charges under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) to the Financial Regulator for approval. However interest rates are excluded from this requirement. Also, legal fees tend to be imposed by 3rd parties and then passed on directly by the institution to the consumer. In general these do not require approval.</P>
        <P>When approving fees, the Financial Regulator takes the following criteria into consideration:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />promotion of fair competition;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />commercial justification;</P>

	<P>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) publishes monthly both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The latter is compiled on a common basis across the European Union. The main difference between the CPI and the HICP is that the latter excludes mortgage interest costs. The CPI fell by 6.5 per cent in the twelve months to September while the HICP fell by 3.0 per cent over the same period. Much of the difference can be explained by changes in mortgage interest rates.</P>
        <P>The CPI basket is based on average consumption patterns so price changes for particular individuals and households will invariably differ from the national average. The CSO does not publish indices by income decile or social group. Nevertheless, I would like to point out to the Deputy that prices of a wide range of goods and services have fallen on a year-on-year basis, not just mortgage interest. For instance, food prices have fallen sharply since the start of the <Col N="137"/>summer. This is supporting disposable incomes right across society and not just for mortgage holders.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed a range of reforms of the financial regulatory structures. A new single fully integrated institution, the Central Bank of Ireland, will be established, replacing the current two pillar structure under the existing Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. The new structure will be responsible for both the supervision of individual firms and the stability of the financial <Col N="138"/>system generally, combining micro-prudential and macro-prudential supervision in the one institution to achieve the highest performance standards for the new organisation. The new Central Bank will be chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.  These reforms will underpin a much more effective and efficient financial services regulatory system that is aligned with best international practice.</P>
        <P>Within the new regulatory structures, the consumer information and education role, currently carried out within the Consumer Directorate in the Financial Regulator will be re-assigned to the National Consumer Agency (NCA). Regulation for consumer protection, including the development and enforcement of codes of practice, remains within the new central bank structure as an integral part of conduct of business regulation.</P>
        <P>Two top-level posts will be established within the new Central Bank of Ireland as ex-officio members of its Board. A Head of Financial Regulation will report to the Board on the regulatory and supervisory functions.  A Head of Central Banking will report on the performance of central banking functions (other than those that relate to the independent role of the Governor under the EC Treaty and Eurosystem and ECB structure). The Deputy will be aware of the recent announcement that Mr Matthew Elderfield will take up the post of Head of Financial Regulation in the New Year.</P>
        <P>A key supporting element of the reforms agreed by Government involves a significant expansion of regulatory capacity with substantial additional staff and skills to meet the objectives of the new structure. In the legislation to underpin the new structure I will seek to enhance the accountability of the new regulatory structure to the Oireachtas and to strengthen evaluation and quality assurance of regulatory performance. These measures will ensure Ireland is regulated to the best international standards.</P>
        <P>A high level group, chaired by my Department and including representatives of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, has been established to expedite the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s decision and undertake appropriate consultations. It is a priority to have the new regulatory framework in place quickly and I expect draft legislation to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision will be published early next year. Once published, it will be open to anyone to comment on the draft legislation including of course Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I have decided that it is necessary to make some immediate progress on the integration of the existing institutions and, as the Deputy is aware, introduced provisions through Committee Stage amendments to the NAMA Bill to enable a common membership of the Central Bank Board and the Regulatory Authority in the transition phase before the dissolution of the Regulatory Authority and the establishment of the new Central Bank of Ireland.</P>

	<P>Specifically in relation to the NAMA Bill 2009, I will be introducing a Report Stage amendment to the Bill to provide a power to issue guidelines to the participating institutions on lending practices and procedures to improve the flow of credit to SMEs and, if necessary, other sectors. The power will be a wide ranging one and will allow for a response adapted to the particular circumstances of different institutions <Col N="139"/>and sectors. This approach recognises that this is a complex situation and allows for a flexible response to changing credit needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has agreed a range of reforms of the financial regulatory structures. A new single fully integrated institution, the Central Bank of Ireland, will be established, replacing the current two pillar structure under the existing Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. The new structure will be responsible for both the supervision of individual firms and the stability of the financial system generally, combining micro-prudential and macro-prudential supervision in the one institution to achieve the highest performance standards for the new organisation. The new Central Bank will be chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.  These reforms will underpin a much more effective and efficient financial services regulatory system that is aligned with best international practice. </P><Col N="140"/>
        <P>Within the new regulatory structures, the consumer information and education role, currently carried out within the Consumer Directorate in the Financial Regulator will be re-assigned to the National Consumer Agency (NCA). Regulation for consumer protection, including the development and enforcement of codes of practice, remains within the new central bank structure as an integral part of conduct of business regulation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the appointment to key positions, the Deputy will no doubt be aware that Professor Patrick Honohan was recently appointed as Governor of the Central Bank. Additionally, two top-level posts will be established within the new Central Bank of Ireland as ex-officio members of its Board. A Head of Financial Regulation will report to the Board on the regulatory and supervisory functions.  A Head of Central Banking will report on the performance of central banking functions (other than those that relate to the independent role of the Governor under the EC Treaty and Eurosystem and ECB structure). The Deputy will be aware of the recent announcement that Mr Matthew Elderfield will take up the post of Head of Financial Regulation in the New Year.</P>
        <P>A key supporting element of the reforms agreed by Government involves a significant expansion of regulatory capacity with substantial additional staff and skills to meet the objectives of the new structure. In the legislation to underpin the new structure I will seek to enhance the accountability of the new regulatory structure to the Oireachtas and to strengthen evaluation and quality assurance of regulatory performance. These measures will ensure Ireland is regulated to the best international standards.</P>
        <P>A high level group, chaired by my Department and including representatives of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, has been established to expedite the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s decision and undertake appropriate consultations. It is a priority to have the new regulatory framework in place quickly and I expect draft legislation to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision will be published early next year. Once published, it will be open to anyone to comment on the draft legislation including of course Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I have decided that it is necessary to make some immediate progress on the integration of the existing institutions and, as the Deputy is aware, introduced provisions through Committee Stage amendments to the NAMA Bill to enable a common membership of the Central Bank Board and the Regulatory Authority in the transition phase before the dissolution of the Regulatory Authority and the establishment of the new Central Bank of Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Quarterly National Household Survey contains data for the period up to end June 2009. That survey shows an annual decrease in employment of 8.2%. The largest annual falls in employment have been in construction (down 86,000), wholesale and retail trade (down 29,600) and industry (down 29,000) sectors. </P>
        <P>While the fall in employment is a cause for concern, it is nevertheless not unexpected &mdash; my Department forecast last April that employment would fall by 7.8% for the year as a whole. The latest seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 12.6% in September, however the unemployment trend has slowed considerably in recent months. This government is not complacent about the very significant increase in job losses. One of the key policies that we can pursue is to strive to enhance our competitiveness so that demand for labour improves so that we can <Col N="141"/>position ourselves to benefit when world and EU growth returns. It is also important that we bring stability and sustainability to the public finances, as that will facilitate confidence and growth in the economy. We are also investing in education, training, and up-skilling in order to ensure that workers have the means to move into expanding sectors. We have also doubled our support for job-search, training and activation places for the unemployed this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Appointments to the board of a State body, including those under the aegis of my Department, are generally made by the Minister with responsibility for the Body in question.  The arrangements for such appointments are normally set out in the legislation establishing the State Body.  In recent years the system of appointments to State boards has been refined and the overall calibre of appointees has improved. It has increasingly become the practice to specify in the governing legislation the attributes required of board members. </P>
        <P>The Government is anxious to innovate in this area and is keen to bring more accountability into the system of State board appointments.  The Renewed Programme for Government, which was agreed at the beginning of October, contains a commitment to a more global reform of the system of appointments to Public Bodies. The document provides that the Government will introduce on a legislative basis a more open and transparent system for appointments to public bodies. The legislation will outline a procedure for the publication of all vacancies likely to occur, invite applications from the general public and from the responses create a panel of suitable persons for consideration of appointment. The legislation will also specify numbers of persons to be appointed by a Minister and will facilitate the appropriate Oireachtas Committees to make nominations to the panel.</P>
        <P>The Deputy refers to appointments to a number of State bodies under the aegis of my Department.  With regard to appointments to the board of the National Assets Management Agency, as the Deputy is aware legislation on the establishment of NAMA is currently going through the D&aacute;il, however, I intend to consult with the Opposition parties about the chairmanship of the agency and I have written to the Opposition leaders in that regard.</P>
        <P>In the context of the reform of the institutional structure for financial regulation, it is a priority for the Government to ensure that the membership of the new Central Bank of Ireland <Col N="142"/>Commission will comprise persons with substantial experience and recognised expertise in relevant specialist areas such as financial regulation, international finance, risk management and economics.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to the National Treasury Management Agency Advisory Committee and the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is that appointments to both bodies are made by the Minister for Finance, there is no requirement for outside consultation.  However, the NPRF Act 2000 requires those appointed to the NPRF Commission to have acquired substantial expertise and experience at senior level in any of the following areas.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs controls at the location in question and at private airports in general are risk-based.  The controls are carried out by mobile Customs enforcement staff, whose attendance is selective and targeted, based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Traffic with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating would attract particular interest. </P>
        <P>It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti-smuggling checks.  This is particularly relevant in the case of small private airports where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community.  The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
        <P>I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied with the level of Customs controls at these locations.  In particular, they are satisfied that the risk-based <Col N="143"/>approach applied remains valid and that their operations are on par with, and may even exceed, those of many other EU Member States.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy is aware, I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax would come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of &euro;10 per passenger would apply, with a lower rate of &euro;2 for shorter journeys.</P>
        <P>The Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 confirmed the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009. However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of &euro;2 applies to departures from <i>any</i> Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow are subject to the &euro;2 rate.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand. The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.</P>
        <P>It should be recognised that tourists are only subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional &euro;10 or &euro;2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should have only a very limited effect on tourist numbers. The Government appreciates the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. Indeed the decline in the number of people travelling is also evident in those countries where there is no air travel tax in place.</P>
        <P>We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure. The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it&rsquo;s a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.</P>

The national equivalence scale assigns the first adult a value of 1, each subsequent adult a value of 0.66 and each child a value of 0.33. These values are then summed and an equivalised household size is established. Disposable household income is divided by the equivalised household size to calculate equivalised disposable income. This value is essentially an approximate measure of how much of the household income can be attributed to each member of the household.</P>

	<P>As part of the preparatory work for the 2011 census the CSO conducted a public consultation by inviting members of the public and various interest groups to make submissions on the topics to be covered, and on the outputs to be produced.  A notice to this effect was published in the national press in September 2008 seeking submissions, and all government departments were contacted for their input.  This phase of the process has now concluded.</P>
        <P>A Census Advisory Group was set up in autumn 2008 to consider the submissions received and advise on the questions to be tested in a pilot survey planned to be carried in April 2009.  The Census Advisory Group is representative of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data along with the relevant CSO personnel.</P>
        <P>Over 90 submissions covering 31 topics were received in total, among them submissions on the subject of disability, and in particular on the subject of autism.  A specific sub-group was convened to consider the disability questions on the census form.  This sub-group was composed of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  The proposal to list specific disabilities within the disability question, namely to make specific reference to autistic spectrum disorder, or downs syndrome, in the category &lsquo;A learning or intellectual disability&rsquo; was considered at the second meeting of the group.</P>
        <P>The group concluded that it would not be appropriate, nor would there be enough room on the census form, to list all individual disabilities.  However, in order to go some way towards accommodating this request the existing (2006) category &lsquo;<i>A learning or intellectual disability</i>&rsquo; <Col N="149"/>was split into two categories &lsquo;<i>An intellectual disability</i>&rsquo; and separately &lsquo;<i>A difficulty with learning, remembering or concentrating</i>&rsquo; for testing in the pilot survey.  The group felt that this approach narrowed the categories and thus helped address the issue of autism, while allowing the question to remain as inclusive as possible.</P>
        <P>The new wording of the disability questions which were tested in the Census Pilot Survey in April 2009 were as follows:</P>
<P LI="1" el="5">Census Pilot Survey 2009 &mdash; wording of Disability questions (Form B)</P>

	<P>In the current global economic climate, multinational companies are restructuring their global operations leading to global job cuts.  Ireland therefore will inevitably be affected.  On a daily basis, IDA Ireland is working with its client companies making every effort to keep their operations in Ireland and minimise job losses.</P>
        <P>Despite this, Ireland continues to be an attractive location for FDI.  To date this year IDA has already had a significant number of new investment projects approved and announced.  There have been 44 announcements with a combined investment of &euro;622.5 million and the potential to create 2,560 jobs.  These investments are spread right throughout the country.  It is encouraging that so many companies are prepared to undertake and announce these investments in Ireland given the current global economic environment.  With the global outlook for 2010 looking more optimistic Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness position should help IDA to make a significant contribution to economic recovery and continue to secure FDI for Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is the view of this Government that controlling pay costs, both in the public and private sector, is a key element in restoring competitiveness.  The Central Bank recently highlighted how our deterioration in international wage competitiveness threatens a quick return to economic growth.  Although it will be a painful adjustment, a reduction in unit labour costs will strengthen our longer-term competitiveness.  For most exporting firms, labour costs account for more than half their input costs.  Both the NCB Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Indices have shown a sustained and deep period of declining input costs for businesses in Ireland, driven, in part, by lower wage costs.  This is matched by a decline in Irish inflation that reached minus 6.5% in the year to September 2009 &mdash; the sharpest fall in Ireland since the 1920s.  This deflation also cushions against the effects of any nominal wage declines.  These indicators emphasise how we are meeting the challenge of restoring competitiveness through the primary means at our disposal &mdash; strict control over costs by all key players in Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  With the OECD predicting mild deflation in Ireland for the next two years, the prospects are good for maintaining the current downward pressure on wages and prices.  In addition, I should point out that the national minimum wage directly affects only about 5% of full time workers and has little direct impact on Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness as the number of persons on the national minimum wage in our internationally traded sectors in likely to be low.</P>

	<P>The National Minimum Wage Act applies to persons who have employee status.  Under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 an employee is defined as a person who works under a contract of employment.  A contract of employment (which can be written or implied) means a contract of service or apprenticeship or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</P>
        <P>The only employees who are excluded from the provisions of the Act are close relatives of the employer and statutory apprentices within the meaning of the Industrial Training Act, 1967 and the Labour Services Act 1987.  The Minimum Wage Act therefore would apply to those who are doing rehabilitative work if they have employee status.</P>

	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency, as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas, and it is not a matter in which the Minister of the day has any involvement.</P>
        <P>The use to which IDA property can be put is prescribed by legislation and the disposal of property for any alternative use requires the consent of the Minister of the day.

	<P>The proposed introduction of a carbon tax is a commitment in the renewed programme for Government and is in response to our international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  </P>
        <P>Work is under way to design a carbon tax that will reflect our commitment and obligation to address climate change challenges.  A crucial consideration in forming a carbon tax must be the minimisation of any negative impacts on the enterprise sector, including possible impacts on competitiveness and employment.  My Department is actively engaged in this assessment as part of the budgetary process.</P>
        <P>The potential implications for industry of the introduction of a carbon tax will depend on many complex and interconnected factors and not least the level of a carbon tax, whether the revenue from the tax is recycled and whether there will be exemption provisions for companies who are already engaged in other greenhouse gas reduction measures such as emissions trading and negotiated agreements.</P>
        <P>It is important that the level of tax be balanced between the objectives of achieving appropriate realistic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and realising these reductions at least cost to business, thereby maintaining competitiveness in the enterprise sector.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency and not one in which I have a function.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Meath has been to promote the county as part of a wider East Region comprising Meath, Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare.  This region has access to a population base of 1.5 million people, a diverse skills pool, educational infrastructure, international access connections, existing business activity across all sectors and extensive property solutions for future activity.  Within the county, IDA focuses on the town of Navan.  As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure, coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services.</P><Col N="152"/>
        <P>The availability of suitable property solutions is one of the important attractions in encouraging FDI to Ireland and IDA Ireland has 25.5 hectares of serviced industrial lands available at the IDA Business Park in Navan, which it is marketing to prospective clients.</P>
        <P>At present there are 15 IDA Ireland client companies in County Meath employing approximately 950 people.  Six of these companies are located on the Business Park in Navan</P>
        <P>IDA continues to work with its base of clients encouraging them to become involved in research and development and deepen their commitment to the local economy.  In addition the agency is also involved in many local committees and task forces and is a Board Member of Meath County Development Board and the Economic Forum who are charged with developing initiatives to market the county.</P>

	<P>The Technical Employment Support Grant is used by F&Aacute;S where it is identified that a jobseeker has a support need to enter/re-enter the labour market, and that this need cannot be met by F&Aacute;S directly or any other state provider, within a reasonable timeframe or at a location convenient to the jobseeker.  The grant has a limited budget, which is focused on short-term interventions.  It is not the intention of this fund to generally support full-time or part-time third level programmes.  In this context, however, the short-term diploma course in family law may be funded by F&Aacute;S on a case-by-case basis. </P>

        <Quest> the progress she has made to date on the 60 applications forwarded to her Department from persons who were made redundant from a company (details supplied) and who are seeking compensation from the insolvent fund; and when the outstanding wages, holiday moneys and so on will be awarded to them. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38102/09]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that my Department received on 8 October 2009 applications under the Insolvency Payments Scheme for Arrears of Wages, Holiday Pay and Minimum Notice on behalf of the former employees of Peter Casey and Sons Limited.  I should point out that the impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in a significant rise in the level of company receiverships and insolvencies.  Consequently, an increasing number of claims are being submitted to the Insolvency Payments Section, with 17,933 new claims recorded from January 1 to September 30 &mdash; an increase of over 144% against the corresponding figure for this period in 2008.  My officials endeavour to process all claims as quickly as possible and claims are dealt with in order of date of receipt.  At present applications received in June 2009 are being processed.</P>
        <P>I am advised also that a number of rebate and lump sum redundancy claims in respect of the former employees of the company have been submitted to the Redundancy Payment Section of my Department during October 2009 and that these are awaiting processing.  There are two types of redundancy claims &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is seven months while claims submitted by post are taking eight months.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed online from March 2009 and those submitted by post from February 2009.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in redundancy payment claims lodged with my Department in since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2009 at 60,785 an increase of 122% on the same period last year (27,373).  This figure of 60,785 exceeds the claims <Col N="156"/>lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include: the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the redundancy payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the redundancy payments section in terms of full time equivalents is 53.8; the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the redundancy payments section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and co-operation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments; the provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website; engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</P>

	<P>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey shows that 8,837 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies in 2008.  As part of the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey, the overall cost per job is calculated each year by reference to the cost of jobs created during and sustained to the end of a seven-year period.  All IDA expenditure on all firms in the period of calculation is included.  For the period 2002 to 2008, at constant 2008 prices, the cost per job sustained was &euro;13,202.  This figure has declined steadily over the past seven years. </P>
        <P>In 2008, Enterprise Ireland client companies created 10,522 new jobs.  The accepted accounting measure for cost per job is &lsquo;Cost per job Sustained&rsquo;.  This is calculated by taking into account all direct agency expenditure on all Enterprise Ireland client companies in a seven-year period.  As with IDA, only jobs created during, and sustained at the end of each seven-year period are represented in the calculations.  The cost per job calculation takes the total grants paid to companies to undertake development projects, at both start-up and expansion stages, and the new jobs that arise from these projects.  The cost per job sustained created with assistance from Enterprise Ireland in 2008 was &euro;8,235.</P>
        <P>Since their inception in 1993, the county and city enterprise boards (CEBs) have provided grant assistance in excess of &euro;201 million to 20,796 projects.  This in turn has assisted in the net creation of 33,811 jobs, a figure that does not include jobs which existed in businesses prior to CEB support being provided to those businesses, at a cost of &euro;5,944 per post.  Whilst 2008 has <Col N="157"/>seen a net decrease in job creation for the CEB Network, a number of CEBs reported an increase in job creation within their local area.  This is a clear indication of the positive effect of CEB intervention on our economy at both local and national levels in the micro-enterprise sector.</P>

The Labour Court also held discussions with these parties. </P>

During the course of that debate I have met with a variety of stakeholders in the grocery <Col N="159"/>goods sector including a considerable number of retailers, suppliers and their representatives to discuss the reality of the relationships in the sector.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will not be surprised by the fact that the various stakeholders have different analyses of the dynamics affecting the grocery goods sector and indeed that there are widely different views as to the nature of the practices occurring in the sector and, in particular, as to the fairness/unfairness of those practices.</P>
        <P>Whilst contractual and commercial relationships between businesses is essentially a matter for discussion and agreement by the contracting parties themselves, the Government is concerned that there should be a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector, which takes account of the interests of all the various parties, including the consumer&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>To that end, the programme for Government contains a specific commitment &ldquo;to implement a Code of Practice for doing business in the Grocery Goods sector, to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers and to review progress of the Code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that I launched a public consultation process seeking the views of all stakeholders in relation to the introduction of a Code of Practice for Grocery Goods Undertakings earlier this year.  A total of 29 responses were received to the consultation process.  These responses are currently being analysed by my Department.  It is intended that this analysis will inform how best to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s efforts in this area are intended to ensure that Ireland continues to have vibrant and successful food and retail sectors, given the role these sectors play in the national economy, whilst also respecting the importance of ensuring that there is a fair balance in the relationships between the various players in the grocery goods sector, which takes account of the interests of all the various stakeholders, including the consumer&rsquo;s interests.</P>

	<P>The Labour Relations Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Code of Practice Detailing Procedures for Addressing Bullying in the Workplace&rdquo; was introduced on foot of a recommendation in the Report of the Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, presented to my predecessor in March 2001.  The Code, prepared by the Labour Relations Commission, was subsequently designated as a statutory code of practice for the purposes of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  In addition, the Labour Relations Commission&rsquo;s involvement in workplace bullying is cited in the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s revised &ldquo;Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work&rdquo;, made under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which came into effect on 1 May 2007.  In the case of both Codes, the emphasis is on the resolution of incidents of bullying using an informal or formal process inside organisations and professional mediation services.</P>
        <P>Where a case of workplace bullying arises and internal processes fail, the Codes provide that an appeal may be referred to the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations <Col N="160"/>Commission under the Industrial Relations Acts. If the recommendation of the Rights Commissioner is not acceptable, an appeal may be made to the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>Although these respective Codes do not have the force of law, they can be taken into account in the course of proceedings before the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal where they are germane to the proceedings.  The development of these Codes has been welcomed by industrial relations and HR professionals as a practical contribution to improving internal employment relations practices and procedures.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to alter the status of these Codes, which have been developed following intensive consultation with the Social Partners and expert bodies, or to change the legislative provisions from which they derive.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation. </P>
        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum application on behalf of the claimant concerned on 4 September, 2009.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the onus is on the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim.  In this case, further information has been requested from the employer to allow a decision to be reached and the claim to be processed.  If the former employer does not forward <Col N="161"/>the required information it may be necessary for the employee to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements and where all of the required supporting documentation has been submitted, the section is, in general, processing lump sum claims dating from June 2009.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in redundancy payment claims lodged with my Department in since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2009 at 60,785 an increase of 122% on the same period last year (27,373).  This figure of 60,785 exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include: the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the redundancy payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the redundancy payments section in terms of full time equivalents is 53.8; the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the redundancy payments section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments; the provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website; engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</P>

	<P>In 2008, Enterprise Ireland supported the establishment of 71 new high potential start&ndash;up companies in sectors as diverse as life sciences, medical devices, software, services and food.<b></b>The Government through Enterprise Ireland is investing &euro;21.5 million in developing the businesses of these high potential start&ndash;up companies, which in turn will leverage a total investment of over &euro;169 million.  The investment is towards expenditures such as R&amp;D, production and operations, key skilled employees and management development, all part of the essential mix to drive sustained growth and development in competitive international markets. </P>
        <P>These highly innovative companies are forecast to create 1,000 new jobs over the next three years with total sales over the same period to reach &euro;615 million, and exports will account for almost 75% of this.  This is the result of ongoing initiatives by the agency and over the past four years, the agency supported almost 300 start-up companies.  In 2009, Enterprise Ireland aims to support a further 66 start-up companies and despite difficult economic conditions, the pipeline for achieving this is healthy.</P>
        <P>Between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2009, Enterprise Ireland made financial payments of &euro;164,705,000 direct to its client companies.  This direct support to businesses does not include payments made by Enterprise Ireland to businesses under supports such as venture capital funding and infrastructural payments.  The wide range of Enterprise Ireland financial supports are aimed at holistically developing companies across the business function. The intended outcome of this support is to develop the company with a view to maximising economic return to Ireland, which is typically in the form of exports and job creation.</P>
        <P>The details of grant aid to Enterprise Ireland client companies that are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive is available in the annual reports of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are clients of the industrial development agencies.  Information is collected on an annualised basis and is aggregated at county level.  Figures for 2009 will not be available until early 2010.</P><Col N="163"/>
        <P>I have been informed by IDA Ireland that in the period between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2009 grant payments were made by the Agency to 18 &ldquo;new-name&rdquo; client companies.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to give the actual number of jobs created as a result of these payments for the following of reasons:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Some grant support e.g. Training Grants and Research and Development grants are not directly linked to the creation specific numbers of new jobs;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Depending on the type of grant, there can be a considerable time lag between the payment of the grant and the actual generation of jobs; and</P>

	<P>The objective of the Innovation Voucher Initiative is to facilitate and encourage enterprises, in particular small enterprise, to avail of the support available from research institutions. </P>
        <P>Under the Initiative vouchers worth &euro;5,000 are allocated to small businesses whose proposals, to work with public knowledge providers on specific innovation questions, meet basic criteria.  Companies can apply for more than one voucher and up to ten companies may pool their vouchers for a single project.</P>
        <P>All small companies, in every sector of the Irish economy are eligible to apply for an innovation voucher.  The only exclusions, in line with State Aid guidelines, are small enterprises in the transportation and agricultural sectors.  Applications are restricted to registered limited companies only.</P>
        <P>The Innovation Voucher Initiative is therefore available to all eligible sectors and is available to indigenous SME&rsquo;s that are not export orientated.  The initiative has already played a role in drive on-going innovation by promoting and encouraging a transfer of knowledge between Ireland&rsquo;s third level educational institutions or research providers and the small business community and creating greater synergies between the two.</P>
        <P>Innovation vouchers can be used for any kind of innovation such as:</P><Col N="165"/>

        <P>Northern Ireland also launched an innovation voucher initiative in May 2008.  This move by Invest Northern Ireland, means that innovation vouchers are now acceptable in third level institutions or &lsquo;knowledge providers&rsquo; on both sides of the border.  This means that companies North and South have the same level of choice when it comes to selecting the most suitable research team and to date 14 southern Irish companies have completed projects with Northern Irish knowledge providers and eight Northern Irish companies have completed projects with knowledge providers in the South to deliver solutions to their knowledge questions.</P>

In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in redundancy payment claims lodged with my Department in since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2009 at 60,785 an increase of 122% on the same period last year (27,373).  This figure of 60,785 exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include: the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the redundancy payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the redundancy payments section in terms of full time equivalents is 53.8; the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the redundancy payments section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments; the provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website; engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</P>

	<P>The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to &ldquo;implement a Code of Practice for doing business in the Grocery Goods sector, to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers and to review progress of the Code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code&rdquo;.</P><Col N="167"/>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that I launched a public consultation process seeking the views of all stakeholders in relation to the introduction of a Code of Practice for Grocery Goods Undertakings earlier this year.  A total of 29 responses, including a response from the association concerned, were received to the consultation process.  These responses are currently being analysed by my Department.  It is intended that this analysis will inform how best to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s efforts in this area are essentially based on the need to ensure that Ireland continues to have vibrant and successful food and retail sectors, given the important role these sectors play in the national economy.  In this regard, the Government fully recognises the importance of achieving a balance in the relationships between the various players in the grocery goods sector, which takes account of the interests of all the various parties, including the consumer&rsquo;s interests and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the Employment Subsidy Scheme is to support the maintenance of vulnerable jobs, help the economy retain its productive capacity and employers retain the labour, knowledge and skills of the workforce thereby supporting a faster return to sustainable growth. </P>
        <P>The Scheme provides a subsidy of &euro;9,100 per employee over fifteen months to qualifying enterprises. During this period the firm would continue to pay the employee their normal wages.</P>
        <P>The Scheme was announced on the 6th August 2009 and Enterprise Ireland who are managing the scheme, received 561 eligible applications seeking employment subsidies for 9,130 jobs. Enterprise Ireland are currently assessing these applications.</P>
        <P>Applications will be assessed on a competitive basis and the ratio provision contained in the Scheme provides a way of ensuring that the number of jobs retained by employers is maximised, thereby increasing the value for money return to the Exchequer for the funds provided.</P>

        <P>In relation to the claim for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment, this was submitted to the Redundancy Payments Section on 13 July, 2009.  I understand that the processing of this claim is at an advanced stage and, subject to the documentation received being in order, the claim may be processed for payment within the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>As regards the application for the individual under the Insolvency Payments Scheme for arrears of holiday pay and minimum notice, I can confirm that my Department received this application on 13 June, 2009.  It was necessary to seek further information from the Receiver and this was received on 15 July 2009.  Given current processing constraints, it is expected to complete processing of this claim and to make payment within the next four to five weeks.</P>
        <P>The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in a significant rise in the level of company receiverships and insolvencies.  Consequently, an increasing number of claims are being submitted to the Insolvency Payments Section, with 17,933 new claims recorded from January 1 to September 30 &mdash; an increase of over 144% against the corresponding figure for this period in 2008.  My officials endeavour to process all claims as quickly as possible and claims are dealt with in order of date of receipt.  At present applications received in June are being processed.</P>

	<P>Employment/unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the CSO.  It does not provide data on particular counties but only on Regions.  Employment in the Midlands Region, which includes County Westmeath, has dropped by 19,600 and unemployment has increased by 12,700 in the last 10 years from Quarter 2 (April-June) 2000 to Quarter 2 2009.</P>
        <P>Live register figures for Mullingar have increased by 3,531 from September 2000 to September 2009. There was 4,840 signing on the Live Register in Mullingar in September 2009. The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
        <P>In relation to the numbers of jobs lost, there is no exact measure, however, the Department records the number of redundancies notified to them on a monthly basis.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 to 223, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Employment and unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the CSO. It does not provide data on particular counties but only on Regions.</P><Col N="171"/>
        <P>Employment in the Midlands Region, which includes County Longford, has dropped by 19,600 and unemployment has increased by 12,700 in the last 10 years from Quarter 2 (April-June) 2000 to Quarter 2 2009.</P>
        <P>The Live Register collects data by social welfare office. There is only one social welfare office in Longford in which the CSO record data for which is Longford Town, which covers the whole of the county. Live register figures for Longford have increased by 3,689 from September 2000 to September 2009. There was 5,530 signing on the Live Register in Longford in September 2009. The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
        <P>In relation to the numbers of jobs lost, there is no exact measure, however, the Department records the number of redundancies notified to them on a monthly basis. The table below sets out the number of redundancy notifications received for County Longford from 2000 to 2009.</P>

        <P>My Department has adopted a broad range of measures to upskill and in many cases reskill the unemployed and to keep as many people as possible close to the labour market, thereby facilitating their re-entry into employment as soon as possible.

	<P>I can confirm that my Department received two statutory redundancy rebate applications in April and June 2009 from the former employer of the two individuals concerned.</P>
        <P>There are two types of redundancy claims &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed online from March &rsquo;09 and those submitted by post from February &rsquo;09.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June &rsquo;09.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department in since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2009 at 60,785 an increase of 122% on the same period last year (27,373). This figure of 60,785 exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 53.8;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The T&aacute;naiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is the lead government agency responsible for the development of indigenous enterprise.  The Agency assesses applications for financial assistance according to a number of criteria, including cost benefit modelling, commercial evaluation and technical assessment in order to ensure value for money to the exchequer.  At any given time, Enterprise Ireland has approximately 3,300 client companies which it actively supports.</P>
        <P>The following tabular statement illustrates the direct financial support to companies over the period 2004-2008, under the relevant category. This direct support to businesses does not include payments made by Enterprise Ireland under supports such as Venture Capital Funding; Infrastructural Payments, for example, Community Enterprise Centres, Incubation Centres, Webworks; Funding to Third Level Institutions and other third parties such as City &amp; County Enterprise Boards, and Crafts Council of Ireland.  The value of such direct support to companies increased year on year to almost &euro;140m in 2008, driven by increases in support for R&amp;D, management development, and latterly the Government&rsquo;s investment in the Dairy Investment Initiative.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has provided enterprise support for indigenous industries of &euro;1,044,618 in 2004, &euro; 474,555 in 2005 and &euro;2,684,080 in 2006.  From 1 January 2007, responsi<Col N="175"/>bility for providing support to indigenous industry in the mid-west region transferred to Enterprise Ireland and these grants are now paid directly by Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of programmes to underpin this role.  The costs associated with the operations of the CEBs are incurred in the delivery of a wide range of both financial and non-financial supports to the micro-enterprise sector across the Country.  The CEBs expenditure details requested by the Deputy are provided in the following tabular statement.</P>

	<P>In line with the requirements of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Department of Finance F&Aacute;S discontinued funding for the Carrick-on-Suir Jobs Club on 21st November 2008 because it was unable to achieve the nationally agreed targets set up for these programmes. </P>
        <P>The two staff members were consequently entitled to a redundancy payment.  This payment comprised a statutory amount of &euro;10,860 and an enhanced amount of &euro;23,307.57, giving a total of &euro;35,167.57.  The amount for both staff members was calculated and available to them.</P>

	<P>As at the end of September 2009, the number of redundancy claims on hands awaiting processing stood at 43,250. </P>
        <P>Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed online from March &rsquo;09 and those submitted by post from February &rsquo;09.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June &rsquo;09.</P>
        <P>In the period January to mid-October 2009, payments relating to redundancy claims made out of the Social Insurance Fund amounted to &euro;238.7m in respect of 35,301 claims.  This represents an average weekly payout of c. &euro;6.28m on claims issued by my Department and is a measure of the level of activity involved.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2009 at 60,785 an increase of 122% on the same period last year (27,373). This figure of 60,785 exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received an application for a statutory redundancy rebate in respect of the person concerned on 14 September, 2009 from their former employer.</P>
        <P>Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed online from March &rsquo;09 and those submitted by post from February &rsquo;09.

	<P>F&Aacute;S have almost doubled the number of activation training and work experience places available to the unemployed to over 130,000. This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places, which were available at the end of last year. For an unemployed graduate, I would recommend that they contact F&Aacute;S to avail of the job search and guidance services to advise them of their training and work experience options that they may be interested in pursuing.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S currently offer the Work Placement Programme (WPP). The programme is designed to offer unemployed people, including unemployed graduates, the opportunity to obtain 6 months experience in a work situation. Under the programme there are 2,000 places available consisting of two streams of 1,000 places.</P>
        <P>The first stream is for unemployed graduates who have attained a full award at level 7 or above on the National Framework of Qualifications and who have been receiving Job Seeker&rsquo;s Allowance for the last six months.</P>
        <P>The second stream is for unemployed individuals who have been receiving Job Seeker&rsquo;s Allowance for the last six months. Under this stream 250 places have been ring fenced for under 25&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>Participants on both streams of the Work Placement Programme will continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements for their duration on the programme. To register an interest in the Work Placement Programme individuals are advised to contact their local F&Aacute;S Employment Services Office.</P>

	<P>I am informed by IDA that, consequent upon the meeting last December, IDA officials engaged with interested parties on proposals which had been put forward at that meeting to enhance Monaghan&rsquo;s attractiveness as a place to invest. </P>
        <P>Unfortunately, in the current economic climate, there is little scope to create employment opportunities from the existing base of foreign owned companies in County Monaghan, but I am glad to say that some discussions are underway with at least one company that may have potential to grow.  We must not lose sight of the fact that, at the end of 2008, there were already 6 IDA supported companies in Monaghan employing 351 people.</P>
        <P>In addition, IDA is in the process of appointing a contractor to carry out improvement works to its site at Knockaconny, Monaghan, which will greatly enhance its appearance and marketability.  Work on the site should begin in the first quarter of 2010.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, through its network of overseas offices, IDA continues to market Monaghan, for new and expanded investment as part of a wider region, which also includes the counties of Louth and Cavan and has a total population of 231,267.  The nature of Foreign Direct Investment has changed and Ireland now competes for premium mobile investments against the most advanced countries in the world.  As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure and the availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to continue to make progress in attracting FDI, we must think regionally not locally.  In the final analysis it is the investor who decides where to locate.</P>

	<P>I understand that this dispute arose following a decision by the company to dismiss a number of workers following an investigation into improper use of the company&rsquo;s IT system.  A number of workers affected by the company&rsquo;s decision were employed by a subcontractor at the company.  The union representing the affected workers has disputed the company&rsquo;s stated reason for the dismissals and believes that the dismissals were a result of an earlier dispute over several workers sharing a confidential e-mail about redundancies, which had been sent to a union member in error.  </P>
        <P>I understand that the company does not recognise the trade union for collective bargaining purposes, nor is it obliged to do so.</P>
        <P>I also understand that the union has referred the matter to the Labour Court.  In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offer an appropriate avenue for resolving these issues.  In this context, I would encourage both parties to engage fully with the Court in their efforts to resolve their differences.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery free of charge to assist this process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing an extensive set of legislative conditions on the parties to an industrial dispute.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation. </P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received an application for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on 23 September, 2009 in respect of the person concerned which is awaiting processing.</P>
        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed online from March &rsquo;09 and those submitted by post from February 2009 but expects shortly to be processing online claims submitted from April &rsquo;09 and manual claims from March &rsquo;09.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements as in this case, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department in since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first ten months of 2009 at 67,346.  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an <Col N="182"/>exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.

	<P>The Mid-West Task Force, which I established under the Chairmanship of Mr Denis Brosnan, completed an interim Report and presented it to me on the 2nd of July. </P>
        <P>The wide range of recommendations in the report cover both local and national issues.  In that respect, the Government has been responding to the economic downturn generally and has taken numerous initiatives, for example in relation to competitiveness and cost competitiveness, industrial employment stabilization, and employment activation measures. All of these measures have benefited regions affected by or threatened with job losses, including the Mid West region. Workers in the Mid West are the subject of a substantial package assembled by the Government in response to the redundancies arising from developments at Dell in Limerick <Col N="183"/>and knock-on effects in other companies in the region. The package addresses many of the issues raised in the interim Task Force recommendations and it is expected to be co-funded by the European Union under an application I have made to the EU Globalisation Fund which is currently being decided on at EU level, with a decision expected soon.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures mentioned above, the state agencies IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the County Enterprise Boards have redoubled their efforts to stimulate industrial employment in the Mid West region. For example, IDA is supporting eight industrial projects with a job potential of 1,073 which were announced by multinational companies in the Mid West in 2008 and 2009 and are now being brought into operation.</P>
        <P>The measures mentioned above are outlined more fully in an initial response to its recommendations which I sent to the Task Force in late September. Given the wide range of recommendations in the report, I have also brought the report to the attention of my colleagues in Cabinet and it is currently being further considered in a number of other Government Departments as well as in my own Department. Ministers will, in the context of finalising their spending proposals for 2010, consider what further measures can be taken in response to the Task Force recommendations. I had asked the Task Force to feed into this process by indicating items in their recommendations which they see as having particular potential for the Mid West region. I am now examining its response, which has just been received, and I will also bring it immediately to the attention of the other Ministers who are examining the Task Force&rsquo;s interim recommendations.</P>
        <P>I am very grateful for the work Mr Brosnan and the other members of the Task Force have undertaken to date. I shall continue to keep the Task Force informed on the Government&rsquo;s work on matters covered in the interim recommendations. The Task Force has identified a number of issues for further study in its Final Report which I look forward to receiving early in 2010.</P>

	<P>Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme, all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy payment on being made redundant.  Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer.  If, however an employer is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement to the employee, my Department will, upon submission by the employer of satisfactory documentary evidence proving inability to pay, make payment directly to the employee from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).</P>
        <P>Before payment can be made from the SIF, my Department must be assured that there is insufficient monies in a company&rsquo;s account to enable it to satisfy its statutory obligations.</P>
        <P>In this case the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department has received an application from the individual concerned and requested documentation from the company confirming its inability to pay. An unaudited statement of affairs and a letter from the accountant was provided but confirmation of inability to pay was not. The employee was advised that in the absence of this confirmation (i.e. confirmation from the company&rsquo;s Accountant based on his own professional view of the company finances rather than a view based on information provided by the employer), he would need to seek a determination of redundancy from the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>If the Redundancy Payments Section receive the required information and if it is in order the claim will be processed for payment.</P>

	<P>In general, statutory instruments made on or after 1 January 1948 are allocated statutory instrument numbers under the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 (the Act). However, under section 2 of the Act, the Attorney General has the power, where certain criteria are met, to exempt certain statutory instruments from the operation of section 3(1) of the Act. Statutory instruments so exempted do not require to be issued with a statutory instrument number.</P>
        <P>As the relevant criteria (namely the proposed Scheme&rsquo;s limited application) set out in section 2(3) of the Act were met by An Foras &Aacute;iseanna Saothair Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme 2000, that Scheme was exempted from the operation of section 3(1) of the Act by direction of the then Attorney General on 31 July 2000. </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the Business Payment Support Service being operated by HM Revenue and Customs that was introduced in November 2008. I am aware of that service, which is designed to meet the needs of viable businesses affected by the current economic conditions. I think it is important to clarify that it is not a scheme for deferring tax payments per se but rather involves a phased payment approach that includes interest for the late payment of the tax involved. </P>
        <P>I know that the Revenue Commissioners are also very conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate in this country and of the challenges posed for some businesses in being timely compliant with their tax obligations. Revenue has responded to the changing environment by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular tax payment difficulties to work proactively with them to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore timely compliance.</P>
        <P>Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such cases which is, in fact, broadly similar to the UK scheme. They have published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties in a prominent position on the home page of their website www.revenue.ie.  I am aware that the feedback from trade representatives and tax practitioner bodies to <Col N="189"/>the initiative Revenue has taken in this regard has been positive and is regarded as an effective way of supporting businesses in meeting their tax payment obligations at this time.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for collection and recovery of a wide range of taxes and duties. They have had and continue to have a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to organise their financial affairs so as to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. Apart from the critical importance of timely compliance to the Exchequer, unfair competitive advantage achieved through persistent late or non-payment of tax can undermines compliant businesses.  I fully support what Revenue are doing in that regard.</P>

	<P>As outlined in my reply of 20 October 2009 to Deputy Brian Hayes on this matter, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has primary responsibility for matters relating to the state body mentioned, including its pension schemes.  With regard to pension arrangements, the relevant legislation requires that they be approved by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department are involved in ongoing consultation with officials in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regarding the pension scheme referred to.  Certain aspects must be clarified in order to ensure that the Scheme is in accordance with public service pension policy and with public expenditure policy.  It is hoped that, with cooperation from all parties involved, the scheme will be in order for the Ministers to approve in the near future.  I can assure you that we are making every effort in this regard.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department and I, and also the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, are concerned at the current level of cigarette smuggling. In this regard it is generally accepted that the high level of taxation levied on cigarettes in Ireland makes it a target for smugglers despite the comparatively small size of the market. This problem is exacerbated by the downturn in the economy which undoubtedly puts greater pressure on tax collection.   </P>
        <P>There is no internationally recognised method for determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes. I am aware of various media reports based on tobacco industry statements that indicate that the level of cigarette smuggling is on the increase. However these are largely based on empty cigarette pack surveys that are at best an indicator of the presence of untaxed cigarettes on the market but are unreliable as a method of determining estimates of smuggling levels as they do not distinguish between illegal (smuggled) cigarettes and legal cross-border purchases imported for personal consumption.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have previously given a tentative estimate that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2008 were untaxed in Ireland. It is important however, to emphasise that this estimate includes both illicit cigarettes and legal cross-border purchases brought into the State for personal consumption.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that current strategies to deal with the problem are under continuous review. This includes monitoring importations, reviewing profiling techniques and container scanning operations, exchanges of information with Customs Services in other Member States and the European Anti- fraud Office (OLAF), joint operations with the Gardai, co-operation with the legitimate tobacco industry and with the Office of Tobacco Control. I might add that a second mobile container scanner has been purchased and is due to arrive in Ireland before the end of this month. This scanner is expected to increase the overall level of detection at our major ports. Already this year almost 200m cigarettes have been seized. These include cigarettes seized in maritime freight and from passengers arriving by air.  They also include the recent seizure on 27 October 2009 of an estimated 120m cigarettes concealed in animal feed that were seized at Greenore Port from the vessel MV Anne Scan following a multi-agency operation. This investigation is ongoing with follow-up investigations in the Philippines being co-ordinated by OLAF. The seizure statistics also include 8.6m cigarettes seized in the course of 190 seizures made inland at retail outlets, markets and distribution centres.</P>
        <P>In addition, there have been 101 convictions for cigarette smuggling or dealing in smuggled cigarettes during the first nine months of 2009. A significant number of other cases are already before the Courts awaiting hearing or are being processed for prosecution.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P>As regards the loss of jobs in the retail sector, while legitimate retailers undoubtedly suffer some drop in business due to competition from the illicit trade in contraband or counterfeit cigarettes, it is difficult to attribute job losses in supermarkets, retail shops and shops in filling stations where cigarettes are normally purchased, solely to cigarette smuggling.</P>

	<P>There is no scheme of grants or assistance towards the cost of the installation of house alarms for the elderly available from my Department.  Tax relief was available for expenditure incurred in the period from 23 January 1996 to 5 April 1998 for the cost of purchase and/or installation of alarm systems in the sole or main residence of individuals aged 65 years or over and who lived alone for the greater part of the tax year in which the expenditure was incurred.  A relative of the individual was entitled to claim the relief provided the claimant incurred the expenditure on the purchase and/or installation of the alarm system.  Tax relief was granted on expenditure of up to &pound;800 at the standard of rate of tax in force at the time. </P>
        <P>As to the success or otherwise of that scheme, in the period 23 January 1996 to 5 April 1998 (spanning the tax years 1995/96, 1996/97 and 1997/98), tax relief was claimed by or on behalf of 1,200 elderly individuals at a total cost of &euro;200,000.  The Deputy may also wish to note that under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981, it may be possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a panic alarm system by or on behalf of a disabled person, as it may be considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. However, any VAT paid in respect of monitoring and maintenance fees is not recoverable.</P>

        <P>The Cross Border INTERREG IVA Programme (Northern Ireland/Ireland/Scotland) aims to support strategic cross-border co-operation and economic development.  The Programme (2007-2013) is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).  The Cross Border Local Authority Groups were established as a network of councillors from the Ireland/Northern Ireland border and offer the opportunity for a co-ordinated and strategic cross border response to local issues.  The Groups, based on their experience of managing EU funding on a cross border basis in the previous round of funding, have been identified as a key implementation partner for the INTERREG IVA programme.</P>
        <P>The Monitoring Committee which oversees the implementation of the programme met on 28th October 2009.  It was reported at the meeting that 94 applications had been received by the INTERREG IVA Programme by September 2009 and 34 of these had been recommended for approval at a total value of &euro;152.6m.  It should be noted that proposed projects are subject to approved selection and assessment criteria under an agreed process and therefore individual projects must complete the process before spending can commence.  The Monitoring Committee was informed that for some projects this is expected to be completed very shortly.</P>
        <P>The SEUPB also advised at the meeting that the key 2009 N+2 EU expenditure target will be achieved.  My Department, as co-sponsor of the SEUPB with the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, continues to monitor the performance of the programme and is working with its counterparts to ensure full implementation of the programme and full drawdown of the EU funds available.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the imposition of a cap of &euro;50,000 as mentioned in the question would have the effect of withdrawing the tax exemption from all qualifying income in excess of &euro;50,000.  On this basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to the claims for the exemption made in income tax returns for the tax year 2007, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available, could be of the order of &euro;20 million. </P>
        <P>However, it must be stressed that this estimate assumes no significant behavioural change on the part of the affected taxpayers and therefore may not be an accurate measure of the yield that would actually be obtained.  Moreover, the application of income tax to this income <Col N="194"/>source could also lead to deductions for allowable expenses, personal allowances and other relevant costs, thereby reducing the level of income that would actually be subject to tax.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the exemption of certain earnings of writers, composers and artists is already affected by the measures to restrict the use of tax reliefs and exemptions by higher income earners, which was provided for in section 17 of the Finance Act 2006 and which took effect from 1 January 2007.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the threshold for the proposed new tax band mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples. </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2010 incomes, of the introduction of a new 48% rate would be of the order of &euro;355 million.  Given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</P>
        <P>This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2007, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2010.  It is therefore provisional and likely to be revised.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent year for which the necessary detailed information is available regarding tax relief for trade union subscriptions is the income tax year 2006, in which the cost to the Exchequer is estimated at approximately &euro;19 million.  On this basis, the full year yield to the Exchequer of abolishing tax relief for trade union subscriptions would be of the same order, although it should be noted that the value of the relief was increased from &euro;300 to &euro;350 in Budget 2008.  At that time, it was estimated that the increase in the relief would cost approximately &euro;3 million in a full year. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 and 272 together. </P>
        <P>It is estimated that if a cap was imposed on public sector salaries at &euro;200,000 it would yield savings in the region of &euro;30m on a full year basis, while it is estimated that a similar cap on salaries at &euro;175,000 would produce savings of the order of &euro;85M on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>By far the most significant group encompassed by the suggested salary caps is the hospital consultants.  A new contract for this group was agreed in 2008 and has been implemented during the current year.  Salary rates under the new contract arrangements are determined by the options taken by the consultants in their assimilation to the new contractual arrangements.  The savings indicated reflect the options exercised in 2009 by the consultants under the new contractual arrangements and are estimated on base salary only.  If the caps were to be applied to all earnings and not just salary, the savings would be higher.  Any savings accruing on the public sector paybill would be offset to an extent by consequential tax revenue forgone.</P>

If the additional 1% were to be applied only to that element of salary in excess of &euro;150,000 and up to &euro;200,000 the annual yield would be less than &euro;400,000. </P>

	<P>Charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  In this regard, where a hospital or a charity purchases a good or engages a service, any VAT liable in the charge for that good or service must be borne by the hospital or charity. </P>
        <P>However, there is provision for the refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of a new medical instrument or appliance by a person who donates such equipment to a hospital.  The main conditions relating to this refund scheme are that: the appliance or instrument is new and is donated to a hospital; the appliance costs &euro;25,390 or more in value (exclusive of VAT); the appliance is designed and manufactured for use solely in medical research or in diagnosis, prevention or treatment of illness; the appliance is purchased through voluntary donations, such that no part of the funds used in the purchase is provided directly or indirectly by the State, a State body or any public or local authority; and, the appliance is subject to a recommendation by the Minister for Health and Children that, having regard to the requirements of the health services in the State, a refund of tax would be appropriate.</P>
        <P>The VAT refund Order was introduced to help defray the cost of more expensive items purchased by voluntary donations.  Items costing less than the threshold of &euro;25,390 are excluded from the relief in order to limit the relief to more expensive medical equipment.</P>
        <P>The current threshold level has not changed since the refund was introduced in 1987 at &pound;20,000, which was translated to &euro;25,390 to coincide with the introduction of the euro in 2002.  Given inflation since the introduction of the current threshold, in real terms the value of threshold has reduced significantly.  Taking inflation into account the 1987 threshold would equate to around &euro;46,500 in 2009 values.  In this context a greater level of lower priced medical appliances now qualify under the Order than when the relief was originally introduced.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances there are no plans to change the current threshold.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the person in question filed his return for the 2006 tax year on 19 March 2009, which was 505 days after the due date.  Prior to filing his return, the Revenue Commissioners had written to him on three occasions to inform him of his obligations to file a return.  The person in question has a pattern of delays in submitting his returns, with his last 4 returns being substantially late. </P>
        <P>The Taxes Consolidation Act provides for the imposition of surcharges for the late filing of returns.  In addition to a surcharge of &euro;36.28 for the delay in filing of his 2006 return, a fine of &euro;750 was imposed at a District Court Hearing on 24 March 2009.  The person in question was afforded 6 months to pay this fine or face a custodial sentence.  He contacted the Collector Generals office by telephone on 11 September 2009 where his options for payment of the District Court fine were explained.</P>

        <P>I am assured, however, that the Revenue Commissioners took account of all the facts and circumstances involved (including the basis under which entitlement to payments from this fund arose) in coming to the conclusion as to whether any payments made out of the fund are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with Section 112 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  It should be noted that lump sum payments are not automatically exempt from taxation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Taking into account the estimated end-year Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for 2009, which is forecast to be in the region of &euro;26 billion, the anticipated level of national debt by end-2009 is some &euro;76 billion.  In respect of 2010, in the absence of any corrective action, an Exchequer deficit of the order of &euro;25 billion would be in prospect and this would increase the level of national debt to approximately &euro;100 billion by end-2010. As you know the Government plans to seek adjustments which would reduce the amount required to be borrowed next year by about &euro;4 billion.</P>
        <P>Continuing to borrow at a high level to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure is not a sustainable solution in the medium to long-term.  Therefore we must make the necessary adjustments in Budget 2010 to stabilise the deficit.  Taking this action now will ensure that confidence is maintained in the Irish economy and that Ireland is favourably placed to benefit from global recovery as it takes hold. As part of the budgetary process, and taking account of the Budget day decisions, I will publish revised debt forecasts on Budget day.</P>
        <P>It is intended that my Department will publish in mid-November the Pre-Budget Outlook (PBO).  This will set out an updated macroeconomic assessment, based on the latest available data, and the emerging technical budgetary position.</P>

This is comprised of the costs of site/property acquisitions, fit out works and rent of approximately &euro;315m expended by the OPW up to the end of July 2009, together with some &euro;6m incurred directly in respect of property costs by other organisations. </P>
        <P>The property costs have been offset by the sales/reallocation of some &euro;556m.  Of this, &euro;356m has been received from property sales while transfers to the Affordable Homes Partnership <Col N="202"/>account for a further &euro;75m.  In addition, the OPW has agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with an approximate value of &euro;125m, subject to current market fluctuations.</P>
        <P>The total expenditure on non-property costs to the end of June 2009 for all decentralising organisations is approximately &euro;14.5m.  In addition the OPW has recently advised that its spend to date on staffing costs on the property aspects of the Programme up to June 2009 is &euro;12.6m.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 289 to 294, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Covered Institutions Financial Support Scheme which guarantees the liabilities of the covered institutions was put in place in September 2008 to maintain the stability of the financial system in Ireland.  Without it the covered institutions would not have been in a position to lend to the real economy.  Both AIB and Bank of Ireland have made explicit commitments on lending in the context of the recapitalisation package which was announced on 11 February this year.</P>
        <P>Specifically, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide <Col N="203"/>an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.</P>
        <P>Building on the banks&rsquo; commitment to the indigenous venture capital sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland have further committed in excess of &euro;15m each to new or existing seed capital funds, in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed and Venture Capital Programme, to further create and develop indigenous enterprise.  The banks&rsquo; funding will be matched as appropriate by funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed and Venture Capital Programme and/or by funding from other national or international investors.  The supplementary documentation on NAMA issued in September, gives details of SME lending by AIB and Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Prompt payment is important to underpin cash flow, particularly for small businesses.  The recapitalised banks have committed to prompt payment arrangements in future customer contracts which will involve payment within thirty days and a late payment interest charge on any payments made after thirty days.</P>
        <P>I would direct the Deputy to Section 4 of the supplementary booklet on NAMA for further detail on the above. The Financial Regulator has been monitoring compliance with the above commitments and no issues have arisen requiring attention.  The Government has introduced arrangements to reduce the payment period by Government Departments to business from 30 to 15 days.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the Deputy might like to be aware that my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has set up a Clearing Group including representatives from the main banks, business interests and state agencies, which is chaired by her Department.  The purpose of the group is to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  Businesses have been invited to send details of such credit refusals to a dedicated e-mail contact point at the Department.</P>
        <P>Although the Group cannot act as an appeal mechanism for individual cases of credit refusal, it is charged with seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to any patterns identified. Information provided by businesses will inform and assist this work.  A comprehensive independent review of SME lending from both the demand and supply perspective was undertaken and was published in July.  The review showed that demand had fallen sharply, with the value of new applications for credit down by 42%. Stock of credit remained static, indicating that new credits broadly matched repayments.  I understand that in a normal year, 15% to 20% of outstanding credit might be repaid, so that significant lending must take place even to keep the figure constant.</P>
        <P>The Review, conducted by Mazars, found that refusal rates vary markedly by sector from 6% to 48% according to the SMEs surveyed.  This finding clearly contradicts the allegation of a blanket refusal to lend. Mazars also examined a sample of files where credit was refused and found that, in general, &ldquo;refusal seemed reasonable in the context of normal commercial and business criteria&rdquo;.  A follow up review covering the period to September is currently underway.</P>
        <P>In addition, I announced during the Committee Stage debate on the NAMA Bill last week that I will be introducing a Report Stage amendment to the Bill to provide a power to issue guidelines to the participating institutions on lending practices and procedures to improve the flow of credit to SMEs and, if necessary, other sectors.  The power will be a wide ranging one and will allow for a response adapted to the particular circumstances of different institutions <Col N="204"/>and sectors.  This approach recognises that this is a complex situation and allows for a flexible response to changing credit needs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 287 together. </P>
        <P>Based on bi-monthly reports made to the Department of Finance by the Departments with responsibility for the individual tribunals, up to end-August 2009 the cumulative cost of completed and sitting Tribunals as listed below was &euro;290.51 million, of which &euro;67.64 million comprised administration and &euro;222.87 million derived from legal costs.  The legal costs figures include &euro;113.51 million for third-party legal costs that are already paid.  Further third party legal costs have yet to be presented and taxed.</P>
        <P>The table below sets out the costs of the various tribunals. While the cost figures include some element of accommodation and witnesses expenses, the breakdown of the costs of witnesses expenses, accommodation and other associated costs would have to be obtained from the relevant line Departments as this Department does not hold such information.</P>
        <P>An estimate of the ultimate costs of three major tribunals, Mahon, Morris and Moriarty Tribunals is provided in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in December 2008 on the timescale, cost and efficiency of these tribunals.  The report is available at www.audgen.gov.ie.  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimated, subject to caveats and contingencies, that these three tribunals could cost something in the order of  &euro;336 million to &euro;366 million based on the costs being experienced to date by the tribunals themselves or alternatively, &euro;418 million to &euro;434 million if the pattern of third party costs experienced in the Beef <Col N="205"/>Processing Industry Tribunal were to emerge in these cases also.  The Report makes clear that these figures take no account of revenue that has or may in future accrue to the State arising from the Tribunals&rsquo; work.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a correctly completed form P45 is required, under PAYE regulations, to be given by an employer to an employee on cessation of employment.  The form P45 is a notification to Revenue that an employee has ceased employment with that employer.  The form also contains details of the employee&rsquo;s pay, tax and PRSI contributions from the start of the year to the date of cessation of employment. The P45 will show the date of commencement of that employment if the period of employment commenced since 1st January in the current tax year. </P>
        <P>If an employee does not get a form P45 when leaving he or she should ask the employer for a P45 and repeat the request if necessary.  If the employer still fails to provide a P45, the employee should notify their local Revenue District, in this case the Revenue Kildare District, by telephone, email or in writing, that they have failed, after several attempts, to get a P45 and stating what the problem is. The matter will then be followed up quickly by Revenue with the employer.</P>

	<P>The Valuation Act, 2001, which came into effect on 2nd May 2002 provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property.  I have been informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that the revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal will be completed later this year and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown will be completed in 2010. It is intended to roll out the programme to a further local authority area in the coming months and the necessary process of consultation is underway. </P><Col N="207"/>
        <P>Once a local authority has been revalued, the Valuation Act provides for a subsequent revaluation not sooner than 5 but not later than 10 years.  I should point out that under the 2001 Valuation Act, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act and I, as Minister for Finance, have no functions in this regard.</P>
        <P>The basis of rateable valuation for all commercial property is net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property. In a revaluation properties are assessed, in accordance with statute, by reference to rental values at a specific valuation date and a new list of valuations is produced.  This new list is then used by the rating authority to levy rates on individual ratepayers.  The old valuation lists date from the Griffith Valuation carried out in the 19th century. Maintaining these lists requires the Valuation Office to determine valuations by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.  The result is a list of valuations that bear no resemblance to modern valuation levels and contain many anomalies.</P>
        <P>The Act provides for the rates income to be capped in the year following a revaluation so that the total amount of rates income of a local authority in the year following a revaluation shall not exceed the total amount of rates income of the preceding year, adjusted to take account of changes to the Consumer Price Index.  Revaluation is essentially about the redistribution of the commercial rates burden between ratepayers depending on the relative shift in the rental values of the properties they occupy.  It is the relative value of properties to each other rather than the absolute value of an individual property, which will determine whether  the rates liability of any given property decreases or increases, following a revaluation.</P>
        <P>The revaluation in the South Dublin County Council area resulted in 39% of ratepayers having an increased rates liability and 49% of ratepayers a reduced rates liability.  The two major shopping centres in South Dublin had contrasting outcomes; one had a reduced rates liability overall of 6% while the other had an increased rates liability of 55%.  The Fingal revaluation is not finalised yet and definitive figures will not be available until December 2009.</P>
        <P>Any individual ratepayer who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the revaluation of their property may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal as provided for in the Valuation Act, 2001.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and following completion of the initial national revaluation programme, I am satisfied that there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and that this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of the recurring revaluations provided for in the Act. In essence the exercise is aimed at ensuring a fair sharing of the rates burden across all categories of ratepayers.</P>

	<P>No direction has been given by the EU Commission in relation to further injections of capital to Anglo Irish Bank by the Government.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, following EU approval to the provision of &euro;4 billion in capital to Anglo, a restructuring plan for the bank is required. The Board of Anglo is currently finalising the restructuring plan which will consider all options for the future of the bank and set out the future strategy for Anglo. The restructuring plan will be submitted to the European Commission for approval under EU State aid rules by the end of November.</P>
        <P>Any possible future capital provision to Anglo would also need to have the approval of the European Commission under EU State aid rules.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer of all income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available, are set out in the following tables for 2005 and 2006, the most recent year for which the necessary historical information is available in the required detail. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.</P>

        <P el="10">(a) <i>Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2005 and 2006</i></P>
        <P el="0">The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system.  A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.</P><Col N="210"/>
        <P>An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</P>
        <P>The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity.  The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</P>
        <P>In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &ldquo;costs&rdquo; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &ldquo;loss of tax revenue&rdquo; on profits. To compute such &ldquo;loss&rdquo;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</P>
        <P>The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</P>
        <P>The figures of cost are for 2005 and 2006 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</P>
        <P>The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</P>
        <P>The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</P>
        <P>In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged.  It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totaling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs.  Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits.  For instance, a person with &euro;1,000 gross trading profits, &euro;1,000 capital allowances and &euro;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &euro;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn.  In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &euro;1,000.  Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</P>
        <P>The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</P>
        <P>Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information. Some of the cost figures included in the table for 2005 reflect revisions to figures previously published in the 2007 Report.</P><Col N="211"/>

       <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?><sup>(9)</sup> <?oasys _ix ?>The cost of exempting the income of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax includes the sums repaid in respect of tax credits, income tax deducted at source (certain dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant), and also includes tax on (see Note 10) (a) donations made by the PAYE and self-employed sectors to approved bodies (b) income tax repayments on foot of PAYE donations. It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.</P>

      <P><sup>(13)</sup> <?oasys _ix ?>The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with &ldquo;unused capital allowances&rdquo;, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company&rsquo;s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated <Col N="214"/>that &euro;3,340 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2006 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.</P>

       <P><sup>(15)</sup> <?oasys _ix ?>The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</P>
       <P><sup>(16)</sup> <?oasys _ix ?>The costs shown for R&amp;D is for claims for R&amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2005 and 2006. However, the cost includes the cost associated with claims where the company was entitled to the credit but was unable to absorb it in that accounting year.</P>

         <P>As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The review drew on newly available 2007 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2007 are included in the table below.</P>

        <P><i>Notes:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The figures shown relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2006 form 11 and CT1.   </P>
        <P>There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in  the future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax  returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.</P>
        <P>The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 41% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the <i>maximum</i> Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.</P>
        <P>Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6. For example, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.</P>

	<P>The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) is being set up to remove land and development loans and associated loans from the balance sheets of participating institutions. These loan assets will be purchased at prices significantly below book value following a detailed loan by loan assessment and application of the valuation methodology contained in the NAMA Bill. </P>
        <P>The NAMA interim management team have indicated that the loans of the largest borrowers will be managed directly by NAMA but that it intends to outsource management of the loans of smaller borrowers. Part 8 of the NAMA Bill anticipates this and provides for the payment to participating institutions for servicing loans. The draft NAMA business plan sets out how such arrangements will work and be ring fenced.</P>
        <P>The retention of participating institutions to conduct loan administration work will help ensure that NAMA can operate on a streamlined basis, keep costs to a minimum and help <Col N="218"/>ensure a return to the State on its investment in NAMA. Banks will be incentivised to manage loans efficiently under contractual agreements.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the reason, regarding the National Asset Management Agency legislation, he considers Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank as systemic to the financial system given that the majority of their loans are to the development and property sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38224/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were specified as covered institutions under the bank guarantee Scheme, established pursuant to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008. The systemic importance of each institution covered by the Scheme, including Anglo and Irish Nationwide, was confirmed by the Governor of the Central Bank, and the Scheme was approved by the European Commission under EU State aid rules. The European Commission also specifically acknowledged the systemic importance of Anglo Irish Bank, in its approval of the Government&rsquo;s provision of &euro;4 billion in capital to Anglo.</P>
        <P>As with our other major financial institutions, the systemic importance of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide derives from their scale and their integration with our economy. As per each institution&rsquo;s latest published accounts, Irish Nationwide has a balance sheet of some &euro;14 billion, while Anglo&rsquo;s balance sheet exceeds &euro;88 billion. Each institution has a substantial deposit base, sourced through thousands of customers, companies and through other financial institutions, in Ireland and internationally. While a significant portion of the loan book of each institution relates to lending for land and development or associated exposures, these institutions also have significant levels of lending for commercial, investment, and residential property and to other sectors, which is not eligible for transfer to NAMA.</P>
        <P>A key principle of the Government&rsquo;s action in addressing the financial crisis has been to maintain the viability of such systemic institutions, to prevent wider implications and costs for our economy, and eligibility for coverage by the bank guarantee Scheme and transfer of assets to the National Asset Management Agency is therefore structured on the basis of systemic importance.</P>
        <P>NAMA is being established to restore confidence in the Irish banking sector and facilitate the flow of credit into the real economy. Section 2 of the NAMA Bill also provides that NAMA is being established, inter alia, to protect the taxpayers and the State&rsquo;s interest relating to the guarantees issued by the State in September 2008 and to facilitate the restructuring of credit institutions of systemic importance.</P>
        <P>As regards NAMA, each institution wishing to participate must apply and will be assessed in line with the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 65(2) of the NAMA Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the collection of tobacco taxes and for tackling the illicit trade in tobacco products that they have not received any adverse reports from their enforcement officers that the display ban referred to is affecting checks carried out at retail outlets for the presence of counterfeit or contraband cigarettes on such premises. However, as this ban, which was introduced by the Department of Health and Children, has only been operative since 1 July 2009, it is too soon to evaluate its overall impact, if any, on enforcement operations. I might add that the Revenue Commissioners continue to liaise and share information with the Office of Tobacco Control which is centrally involved in the operation of the display ban.</P>
        <P>On a general note, Revenue Enforcement Officers have found that prior to the ban, counterfeit and contraband cigarettes were rarely on open display at retail outlets and in any event, checks on suspect premises usually required a thorough search of the premises concerned.</P>
        <P>Enforcement Officers have been conducting checks at retail outlets, markets, and distribution centres in an ongoing operation entitled Operation Downstream since 2008. This operation focuses on seizing illicit cigarettes that evaded detection at the point of importation. During the first nine months of 2009, 190 seizures totalling 8.6m cigarettes have been made in the course of this operation. </P>

        <P>Following clarification from the Deputy and for the purposes of reply, I will take the basic entry wage in the private sector to be the current national minimum wage, set at &euro;18,054 per annum based on a 40 hour week. This results in a suggested cap figure of approx. &euro;100,000 per annum in the public service, with an estimated saving to the Exchequer, if such a cap were applied of around &euro;450m per annum.</P>
        <P>The entry rate of a clerical officer grade in the Civil Service of &euro;24,397 per annum results in a suggested cap figure of approx. &euro;122,000 per annum in the public service, with an estimated saving to the Exchequer, if such a cap were applied of around &euro;250m per annum.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons who go into arrears on their credit cards can be charged interest rates which can be set at will by the credit lender and some companies can charge punitive interest rates which can be as high as 26% APR; if his proposals to strengthen the Financial Regulator will ensure credit card customers are made aware of the risks of such punitive interest rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38354/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about the problems of credit card arrears raised by the Deputy.  Individual institutions set rates based on their cost of funds, market conditions and commercial considerations which in turn determine the interest rates charged to customers on various products.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities.  However, the Financial Regulator provides a cost comparison of credit cards with up-to-date information on the providers APR, fees etc, on the website <i>www.itsyourmoney.ie</i>.  On this same website there is a downloadable publication entitled &ldquo;Credit Cards &mdash; What you should know&rdquo; which includes details on how to keep credit card costs down.  Also, the Financial Regulator has produced all its information booklets in hard copy.  These booklets can be sent out on request or are available from its information centre in Dame Street.  While the regularly updated cost comparisons are only available on-line, its website is accessible for free from all libraries in the country, in its information centre and from its lo-call helpline.</P>
        <P>In relation to requirements on credit card companies, the consumer protection code applies to all regulated entities which would include credit card providers. The Code has some specific provisions in relation to loans (Chapter 4, rule 1 and 2) that apply to credit facilities.  These are that: a regulated entity must not offer unsolicited pre-approved credit facilities; and a regulated entity may only increase a consumer&rsquo;s credit card limit following a request from the consumer.  In addition the Consumer Protection Code requires that a regulated entity must: act honestly, <Col N="223"/>fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market; and act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its customers.</P>
        <P>The Code has specific requirements in relation to charges stating that consumers must be provided with details of all charges, prior to a service being provided and where such charges cannot be ascertained the entity must advise the consumer that such charges will be levied as part of the transaction.</P>
        <P>The Code also has specific suitability requirements which require that a regulated entity ensures that any product or service offered to a consumer is suitable for that consumer.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that they have already raised more than &euro;34 billion in long-term funding in 2009.  Of the total funding, &euro;32.8 billion refers to sales of Irish Government Bonds &mdash; &euro;23 billion by way of syndicated bond issues and &euro;9.8 billion through a series of bond auctions.  Irish Government Bonds are bought by a broad range of investors, both domestic and international, but mainly financial institutions including fund managers, banks, Central Banks and insurance companies.  The NTMA advise that international investors took up approximately 75 per cent of the bonds issued by syndication in 2009.  </P>
        <P>The balance of the long-term funding raised in 2009, currently &euro;1.26 billion, was raised under the government savings schemes &mdash; these are domestic retail products operated on behalf of the NTMA by the Prize Bond Company and An Post.</P>
        <P>In addition, the NTMA borrows in the short-term markets, mainly in order to manage liquidity risks and to assist in the timing of borrowings.  These cash balances stood at around &euro;25 billion at end-September.  In 2009, the NTMA launched two new short-term programmes &mdash; Treasury Bills and a US Commercial Paper Programme &mdash; to diversify further the sources of borrowing available to it.  The NTMA advise that both programmes have been highly successful and have seen strong demand from international banks and corporate treasuries.</P>
        <P>While the nature of the international markets makes it difficult to quantify, the NTMA have advised that it is estimated that almost 80 per cent of Ireland&rsquo;s gross debt is currently held by international investors.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The value of the Fund at 30 September 2009, the most recent value published by the NPRF Commission, was &euro;20.9 billion.</P>
        <P>In relation to the end-September figure, it should be noted that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 was amended by the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009.  The amendments in the 2009 Act allow the Minister for Finance to give a direction to the NPRF Commission to invest in a listed credit institution and to make payments into the Fund for the purposes of such an investment, such additional contributions to be offset against the contribution liability in future years.  These amendments reflected the Government decision, announced on 11 February 2009, that the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland through the purchase of preference shares by the NPRF would be funded by &euro;4 billion of the Fund&rsquo;s own resources and &euro;3 billion from the Exchequer through the frontloading of the 2009 and 2010 Exchequer contributions to the Fund.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it should be noted that the figure of &euro;20.9 billion given as the value of the Fund at end-September includes the full Exchequer contribution of 1% of GNP for 2009, &euro;1.584 billion, plus an additional sum of &euro;1.416 billion to give the total of &euro;3 billion referred to in the Government decision.  As a result of these payments, no contribution to the Fund is expected to be required in 2010.</P>
        <P>The NPRF Commission publishes annual reports as a statutory obligation and quarterly reports providing an update on the Fund&rsquo;s performance.  Both the annual reports and the quarterly reports are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website <i>www.nprf.ie</i></P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the cost to the Exchequer of the tax relief for pension investment scheme for each of the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and to date in 2009; the projected cost to the Exchequer for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011; the number of taxpayers who availed of the tax relief for pension investment scheme in each of these time periods; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The following tables provide a breakdown of the estimated cost of tax and PRSI reliefs for private pension provision for 2006 and 2007, the latest year for which the most up-to-date data is available.  The 2007 figures represent an update of the 2006 cost estimates set out in table 7.2 of the Green Paper on Pensions published in the autumn of 2007. Figures have been rounded where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Corresponding estimates are also provided for 2005 to the extent that it has been possible to provide them on a consistent and comparable basis.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that sufficient data to enable estimates to be provided for the tax year 2008 is not yet available as the early tax returns due for that year are only now being processed and the Revenue On-line Service  (ROS)- based returns, the majority, are not yet due.</P>
        <P>As regards projections for 2009-2011, projections for income tax receipts are based on assumed movements in macro-economic parameters and not by reference to the costs of individual tax reliefs.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the projected cost data requested by the Deputy for the years 2009 to 2011 in relation to the above-mentioned reliefs. </P><Col N="232"/>

        <Quest> the savings that would be made to the Exchequer if Ministers&rsquo; pay were reduced to &euro;100,000; and the pay of Ministers of State reduced to &euro;85,000. </Quest>

	<P>The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and Ministers of State have all accepted a voluntary pay cut of 10% in their salaries.  Their salaries are also subject to the public service pension levy.  If the salaries of all Ministers, including the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, were reduced further to &euro;100,000, and those of Ministers of State to &euro;85,000, the savings arising would be &euro;2.43m in a full year.</P>

        <Quest> the savings that would be made to the Exchequer if the expenses of Ministers and Ministers of State were cut by half. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to domestic motor travel and subsistence arrangements for Ministers and Ministers of State.  Ministers of State are reimbursed for official travel up to a limit of 96,540 km (60,000 miles) per annum.  Their mileage rates were reduced by 25% from 5 March 2009.  Ministers are provided with a State car and Garda drivers and have no expense allowance in this regard.</P>
        <P>Subsistence is payable where a Minister is absent from their headquarters and home on official business in Ireland and abroad.  In Ireland Ministers may claim the vouched cost of a hotel room, including tax and up to 15% for service charges and a subsistence allowance of &euro;72.66 per night.  The latter amount reflects a reduction of 25% from 5 March 2009 and is designed to provide for meals and a small amount for incidentals.  I am responsible for the policy for the travel and subsistence regime of Ministers excluding State cars which is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>As regards the savings that would arise from a further reduction in travel and subsistence arrangements, this would depend on the expenses arising in each case.  Individual Departments and offices are responsible for the day to day allocation and management of expenditure on travel and subsistence for Ministers.</P>

	<P>I have approved schemes for the CEOs of some 35 Non Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, with 6 of the larger bodies also having schemes for 2nd level grades.  A list of the bodies is set out in the following tables for the information of the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Once such schemes have been approved all decisions on the making of any such awards for chief executives, and any other senior staff if appropriate, are a matter for the Boards concerned.  In this context, my Department does not hold details of the level of awards that have been made in this sector.  However, in April of this year my Department asked Secretaries General of Government Departments to inform such bodies and agencies under the remit of their Departments that, in view of the current economic and budgetary difficulties, it was appropriate that consideration of any bonus payments should be suspended.</P>

	<P>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax is available for tuition fees for certain full-time and part-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration and postgraduate courses of at least one but not more than four years duration.  The full definition for approved courses is set out in Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.  In order to qualify for the tax relief, the course must be an approved course, which is undertaken in an approved college.</P>
        <P>On the information provided, the course in question would appear to of twelve months duration.  However it is not clear if it is an undergraduate or postgraduate course.  Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners cannot make a determination as to the whether the fees paid in respect of this course would qualify for tax relief.  The individual concerned is advised to contact their Revenue District Office regarding the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this question on the basis that the Deputy is referring to the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) of which the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is currently manager.</P>
        <P>In March and May 2009, under the terms of the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission invested, at my direction, a total of &euro;7 billion in preference shares issued by Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks (AIB) plc (&euro;3.5 billion in each institution).  The investments followed intensive discussions between the Government and Bank of Ireland and AIB with a view to securing the position of these two banks.  As a result of these discussions, the Government decided on a comprehensive recapitalisation package to reinforce the stability of the Irish financial system, increase confidence in the banking system in Ireland and facilitate the banks involved in lending to the economy.</P>
        <P>The preference share investments pay an annual non-cumulative fixed dividend of 8% payable in cash or, in the case of non-payment by either bank of the cash dividend, ordinary shares in lieu.  These preference shares can be repurchased at par up to the fifth anniversary of the issue and at 125% of face value thereafter.  The preference share investments are held by the Fund at cost.  Warrants issued with, but detachable from, the preference shares give an option to purchase up to 25% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of each bank following exercise of the warrants.  The strike price of the warrants exercisable by the Fund for the first 15% of the ordinary share capital is &euro;0.975 for AIB and &euro;0.52 for Bank of Ireland.  The strike price of the balance of the warrants is &euro;0.375 for AIB and &euro;0.20 for Bank of Ireland.  The warrants are exercisable at any time from the fifth to tenth anniversary of issue of the preference shares or immediately prior to any takeover or merger of the bank concerned, whichever is earlier.  If either bank redeems up to &euro;1.5 billion of the Fund&rsquo;s investment in preference shares from privately-sourced core Tier 1 capital prior to 31 December 2009, then the warrants will be reduced pro rata to that redemption to an amount representing not less than 15% of the ordinary shares of the bank concerned.</P>
        <P>The Commission has also made a number of private placement investments in credit securities issued by Irish financial institutions. At end-2008 &mdash; the date of the latest published annual accounts of the Fund &mdash; the value of these investments was &euro;662 million.  Finally, the Fund&rsquo;s third-party investment managers had investments on behalf of the NPRF Commission in quoted equities and debt securities issued by Irish financial institutions to the value of &euro;13.4 million at end-2008.</P>

Responsibility for the section of the river referred to lies with the Barrow Drainage Board, that is, the Local Authorities in Counties Carlow, Kildare and Laois.  Waterways Ireland carries out a certain amount of maintenance of the Barrow in relation to its navigational aspect.</P>

	<P>The Commissioners of Public Works wrote to Local Authorities in July 2009 requesting them to identify significant coastal erosion issues in their areas, their proposals for dealing with them and the order of priority in which they consider they should be addressed.  Waterford County Council did not submit an application for funding at that time.  It is intended to invite proposals from Local Authorities towards the end of 2009 for consideration in respect of 2010 funding.  Waterford County Council will have a further opportunity to submit a proposal at that time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 374 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of reducing excise duty on alcohol products by 10%, 20% and 30% for a period of  two months as suggested, would be in the region of &euro;18m, &euro;37m and &euro;57m respectively.  These estimates include excise and VAT on the excise reduction.</P>

	<P>With regard to the VAT differential between Ireland and the UK, given the current Exchequer deficit position, the policy decision of increasing the standard VAT rate in Budget 2009 continues to be necessary in order to support the public finances.  We are borrowing to fund day to day public services which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct our public finances.</P>
        <P>Although the UK cut its standard rate of VAT from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis from 1 December 2008 to the end of 2009, at the same time they increased excise duty on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel in order to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items.  Consequently there was no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT.</P>
        <P>The VAT rate is not the only factor in the price differential between North and South of the border.  The weakening of sterling has had a far more significant impact on relative prices than any VAT changes.  Furthermore, as a small open economy, many of our goods and services are imported, especially in the case of those at the standard rate.  Cutting the VAT rates could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own.  In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.</P>
        <P>It is argued that reducing VAT rates would create some buoyancy and encourage additional consumer spending.  However, it should be noted that with the notable exception of the UK, EU Member States have generally not opted for VAT rate cuts as a way to boost consumer spending.  In contrast some Member States have increased VAT rates, curtailed the scope of exemptions and of reduced rates, to help cover the budgetary shortfall generated by the slump.  Indeed it is understood that some Member States are now considering increasing their VAT rate as a part of the ongoing response to the general fiscal crisis.</P>
        <P>There are other means of stimulating the economy, outside of the VAT system.  The Government is funding capital investment of &euro;7.3bn or 5% of GNP in 2009, a significant sum in times <Col N="240"/>of constrained resources.  This funding will be targeted at economically valuable infrastructure which will enhance our long term productive capacity and support employment.</P>

	<P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code contains requirements which must be followed by both lenders and intermediaries at point of sale.  The mortgage provider must demonstrate that it has gathered sufficient information from the consumer to allow it to provide a recommendation to that consumer.  It is therefore incumbent upon mortgage providers to satisfy themselves as to the financial situation of prospective customers, how they do this is a matter for the institutions themselves, subject to their processes being acceptable to the Regulator.</P>

	<P>Mortgage Intermediaries are authorised in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  This sets out the necessary conditions which must be met prior to authorisation and also sets out a number of grounds where an authorisation may be refused, some of which relate to the holding of other types of licences (section 116 (9)).  These restrictions do not include the holding of a licence to operate as an estate agency.</P>
        <P>However, the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code applies to mortgage intermediaries.  Among the provisions included in this Code is the requirement to seek to avoid conflict of interest.  The Code states that <i>&ldquo;where conflicts of interest arise and cannot be reasonably avoided, a regulated entity may undertake business with or on behalf of a consumer with whom it has directly or indirectly a conflicting interest, only where that consumer has acknowledged, in writing, that he/she is aware of the conflict of interest and that he/she still wants to proceed.&rdquo;</i></P>
        <P>In addition, Section 127 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 prohibits mortgage lenders from making the granting of a loan subject to a requirement that the borrower uses the services of a particular individual or firm.  Section 127 reads as follows&mdash;</P>
<P el="5">(1) <?oasys _ix ?><i>A mortgage agent shall not make or offer to make to any person, or arrange or offer to arrange for any person, a housing loan which would be subject to a condition that any financial services, conveyancing services, auctioneering services or other services relating to land which that person may require, whether or not in connection with the loan, shall be provided by the agent or through a subsidiary or other associated body of such agent.</i></P>
<P el="5">(2) <?oasys _ix ?><i>Where, in connection with the making or arranging of a housing loan, more than one service is made available by a mortgage agent or one or more of his subsidiaries, the agent shall not, and shall ensure that each of his subsidiaries does not, make the services available on terms other than terms which distinguish the consideration payable for each service so made available; nor shall any of the subsidiaries make the services available on terms other than terms which make that distinction.</i></P><Col N="241"/>
<P el="5">(3) <?oasys _ix ?><i>Where a person is providing auctioneering services, or constructing houses for sale, and is also a mortgage intermediary, he, or a subsidiary or other associated body, shall not sell, offer to sell or arrange to sell a house which is to be purchased with the aid of a housing loan, on terms which differentiate as between a person who purchases the house with the aid of a housing loan arranged by or on behalf of such intermediary and a person who purchases the house with the aid of a housing loan otherwise arranged.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Financial Regulator conducted a themed inspection in 2008 to examine how mortgage intermediaries handle potential conflicts of interest when also providing property services to consumers.  The inspection found that it was the policy of most intermediaries to avoid potential conflicts of interest or where a potential conflict of interest could arise that the intermediary would write to the customer advising them of the position before proceeding with the business.</P>
        <P>It is my view that the existing legislation in this area sufficiently empowers the Financial Regulator to regulate effectively situations where conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest arise.  </P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest published figures for outstanding taxes are available for the year ended 31 March 2009.  Due to the varying nature of the different taxes, it is the practice to publish data in relation to tax debts on an annual basis.  This facilitates meaningful comparative analysis.  An analysis of this debt is set out in table 1.  As at 31 March 2009, outstanding taxes and PRSI amounted to &euro;1,861 million which represented some 3.10% of gross taxes collected (&euro;60,061 million) for 2009.</P>
        <P>In regard to 31 March 2008, outstanding taxes amounted to &euro;1.286 million or 1.94% of the gross level of taxes (&euro;66,148 million) collected for 2008.  Of this figure of &euro;1,861 million, &euro;628 million was under appeal and therefore not available for collection.  Of the total of &euro;1,233m available for collection, &euro;794m was under active collection while &euro;326m was at enforcement and &euro;113m was being managed through agreed instalment arrangement, where additional time to pay is given by Revenue.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for collection and recovery of a wide range of taxes and duties.  Inevitably, however, cases do arise where, because of the particular circumstances, collection of the tax is not possible or the tax cannot be collected without disproportionate cost to Revenue.  In these circumstances arrangements are made to pass the tax as irrecoverable.  This is commonly referred to as writing-off the tax concerned.</P>
        <P>The attached Table details the amount of unpaid taxes and duties written off by the Revenue Commissioners in the years 2004-2009 (to end September).  It is not possible to provide details of write off in relation to Schedule E as distinct from other schedules.  There have been no instances of write off of Excise Duties or Capital Acquisitions Taxes in the period 2004-2009.</P>

	<P>The recruitment and promotion moratorium announced on Friday 27th March 2009 applies to the civil service, local authorities, non-com<Col N="246"/>mercial state bodies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Permanent Defence Forces.  It is not an embargo.  An embargo would imply that no filling of vacancies whatsoever could take place.  The Minister for Finance has the authority to allow for the filling of some vacancies in very exceptional circumstances.  The Government decision also provides that vacancies may be filled by redeployment of staff from other Departments or public bodies with the sanction of the Department of Finance.  In addition, arrangements for the health and education sectors have been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible.</P>
        <P>The position regarding persons on panels arising from Civil Service competitions is that panels from open competitions generally stay in place until the next competition is held.  Interdepartmental promotion panels have a definite life span and this is agreed centrally with the relevant Civil Service union.  In the context of the Moratorium, a decision has been taken that interdepartmental promotion panels will be allowed to lapse as the closure dates are reached.  Decisions in respect of Departmental promotion panels are taken at Departmental level.  In respect of the wider public service, decisions on the continuation or otherwise of recruitment panels is a matter for the relevant Minister and organisation, in the context of the Moratorium.  Decisions in respect of future recruitment campaigns will be taken in the context of the business needs of the relevant organisation, the Moratorium on recruitment and promotion and any redeployment arrangements agreed for the civil and public service.</P>
        <P>I presume that, on the question of Trades Officers, Deputy Neville is referring to positions in the Irish Prison Service.  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that separate recruitment competitions are held for Trades Officer and Recruit Prison Officer.  Panels of successful candidates are drawn up in respect of each competition.  It is not possible to transfer a candidate from a Trades Officer panel to a Recruit Prison Officer panel.  A candidate must be successful in the competition for Recruit Prison Officer in order to be placed on a panel for recruitment at that grade.  There is currently no date set for the holding of a competition for future recruitment at Recruit Prison Officer Grade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to assure the Deputy that both my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, are concerned at the current level of cigarette smuggling.  It is generally accepted that the high level of taxation levied on cigarettes in Ireland makes it a target for smugglers despite the comparatively small size of the market.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their strategy in relation to tobacco smuggling involves a combination of cargo and passenger profiling, intelligence gathering and <Col N="247"/>mutual assistance co-operation with other Customs services.  Where appropriate, x-ray scanning technology is used to detect and seize contraband in maritime and air transport.  In this regard a second mobile container scanner has been purchased and is due to arrive in Ireland later this month.  This scanner is expected to increase the overall level of detection at our major ports.</P>
        <P>Revenue and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also carry out multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to controlled deliveries.  Where relevant, these operations also involve international law enforcement agencies.  The service continuously reviews its strategy which includes analysis of resource requirements and its optimum staff deployment.  Revenue policy also entails close liaison with the legitimate tobacco industry and the Office of Tobacco Control.  In addition, intelligence driven and random checks are mounted at retail outlets and markets and other distribution centres in order to detect and seize illicit tobacco products which have evaded detection at the point of importation.</P>
        <P>This combined approach has resulted in the seizure of almost 200m cigarettes to-date in 2009.  Included in this amount is the seizure of an estimated 120 million cigarettes at Greenore on 27 October 2009 in the course of the multi-agency Operation Samhna.  This is a prime example of the fruits of multi-agency cooperation in the fight against this organised crime.  The intelligence and operational strategy is backed up by a robust prosecution policy which has resulted in 101 convictions for cigarette smuggling or dealing in smuggled cigarettes during the first nine months of 2009.  A significant number of other cases are already before the Courts awaiting hearing or are being processed for prosecution.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for the collection and recovery of a wide range of taxes and duties.  I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount within the appropriate deadlines.  Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due.  Apart from the importance of timely compliance to the Exchequer, unfair competitive advantage achieved through persistent late or non-payment of tax can undermine compliant businesses.  I fully support what Revenue is doing in that regard.</P>
        <P>I know also that Revenue is very conscious of, and appreciates that, the difficult economic and financial climate in this country poses challenges for business in meeting with their tax obligations within the appropriate deadlines.  Revenue responded to the changing environment by encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise so that an agreed way can be identified to work through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.  Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such cases, and has published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website www.revenue.ie.  I am aware that the feedback from trade representative and tax practitioner bodies to the initiatives Revenue has taken has been positive and is regarded as an effective way of supporting businesses who are disposed to addressing payment difficulties in a positive, realistic and proactive way at this time.</P><Col N="248"/>
        <P>It is only where a business refuses to deal with a tax debt in a realistic way or continues to be non-compliant that a debt is referred by Revenue to the Sheriff for collection and recovery.  I should emphasise that Revenue Sheriffs are officers of the courts holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officer Act, 1945.  The Revenue Sheriffs&rsquo; debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are governed principally by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended.  Sheriffs are answerable before the Courts for any breach of the civil debt collection code and are not directly accountable to the Revenue Commissioners.  Nevertheless, I am advised by Revenue that the Sheriffs will have due regard to the circumstances of the businesses in trying to effect collection</P>

	<P>In my reply to the previous question referred to by the Deputy, I explained the circumstances in which a qualifying individual could exercise the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) option on retirement, including the rationale for and the circumstances in which investment into an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) could arise.  In particular, I provided the requested explanation of section 784C(4)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act which states, in effect, that the requirement to invest in an AMRF does not arise where an individual is in receipt of specified (pension) income for life of &euro;12,700 at the time the ARF option is exercised.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to remove the requirement to invest in an AMRF if the relevant conditions are not met.  If, however, the Deputy&rsquo;s concern is that a person who may not satisfy the specified income requirement at the point of retirement may subsequently be in a position to satisfy that requirement but under the existing provisions would not be able to transfer from AMRF to ARF status until age 75, then I will examine that issue in the context of the next Budget and Finance Bill and will bear his views in mind in that regard.</P>

	<P>There is provision in Irish legislation for the refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of a new medical instrument or appliance by a person who donates such equipment to a hospital.  The main conditions relating to this refund scheme are that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance or instrument is new and is donated to a hospital;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance costs &euro;25,390 or more in value (exclusive of VAT);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance is designed and manufactured for use solely in medical research or in diagnosis, prevention or treatment of illness;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance is purchased through voluntary donations, such that no part of the funds used in the purchase is provided directly or indirectly by the State, a State body or any public or local authority, and,</P><Col N="249"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appliance is subject to a recommendation by the Minister for Health and Children that, having regard to the requirements of the health services in the State, a refund of tax would be appropriate.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The VAT refund Order was introduced to help defray the cost of more expensive items purchased by voluntary donations.  Items costing less than the threshold of &euro;25,390 are excluded from the relief in order to limit the relief to more expensive medical equipment.  The current threshold level has not changed since the refund was introduced in 1987 at &pound;20,000, which was translated to &euro;25,390 to coincide with the introduction of the euro in 2002.  Given inflation since the introduction of the current threshold, in real terms the value of threshold has reduced significantly.  Taking inflation into account the 1987 threshold would equate to around &euro;46,500 in 2009 values.  In this context a greater level of lower priced medical appliances now qualify under the Order than when the relief was originally introduced.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances there are no plans to change the current threshold.</P>

A list of bodies which have been granted charitable tax exemption under section 207 is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy has charitable tax exemption and is on that list.</P>
        <P>While, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, the Revenue Commissioners cannot comment upon the tax affairs of individual bodies, they have advised me that to qualify for charitable tax exemption, a body must be established for charitable purposes and must apply all of its income for charitable purposes only.  The provision of undergraduate and postgraduate education, training, and research is considered a charitable purpose.  A charity can also make investments and derive income from such investments provided they do not put the assets of the charity at undue risk.  The underlying principle is that the interest of the charity must be paramount and investment of the resources of the charity must be made purely for the benefit of the charity.</P>
        <P>Appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that all applications for charitable tax exemption are assessed to ensure that the necessary criteria for the exemption are met before granting such exemption.  Furthermore, bodies that are granted charitable tax exemption are subject to periodic risk-focused reviews towards ensuring that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled.  All relevant matters are taken into consideration in the context of such reviews.</P>

	<P>Further guidelines were issued in June 1998 clarifying that a person may not receive a greater number of years than the additional service he or she would have if the person served to maximum retirement age.  They also clarified that the grant of additional service may not lead to a person having more than the maximum pensionable service allowed under the relevant pension scheme (i.e. 40 years in most cases).</P>

        <Quest> if, with regard to the superannuation and pension package granted to a person (details supplied) which he approved, his views on the fact that subsection 3 of section 6 of the Labour Services Act 1987 gave him <i>carte blanche</i> to approve a package without limitations; if not, the legislation, scheme or guidelines that were used to grant their retirement package; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Services Act 1987 provides that terms and conditions, including those in relation to remuneration and superannuation, of the office of the Director General, may be determined by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, in the case in question, it was under section 6(3) of the Labour Services Act that the superannuation arrangements were approved.  The approved superannuation terms were broadly in line with the guidelines in the letter of 26 May 1998 from the Department of Finance to the Heads of Departments/Offices.  In addition to the superannuation terms above, an additional 3 months severance was agreed as part of the final package which was on top of the 3 months salary in lieu of notice that was provided for in the individual&rsquo;s contract.</P>

	<P>There were no prior or subsequent discussions with the Public Interest Directors of the mentioned Bank on the issue raised by the Deputy.  I would point out that the award arose from an agreed interim Labour Relations Commission recommendation on remuneration matters before it involving non-senior staff and does not, as has been reported, cover the payment of National Wage Agreement increases. </P>

        <Quest> the number of people who have <Col N="252"/>availed of the early retirement scheme as announced by him in budget 2009 in tabular form; the sections of the public service they are from; and the level of position they held. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in tabular form below.  In summary, the information reported to my Department by the end of September indicates that some 995 civil servants had applied for the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (ISER) and that 815 of these had been approved.  These Civil Service numbers are based on returns from all Departments and Offices.  The Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism provided an overall number.</P>
        <P>In the wider public service, some 352 public servants had applied and 138 of these have been approved.  However, it should be noted that information from the Education Sector is currently being examined by officials from my Department and information is not expected from the Local Authorities until November.  Also, processing of applications under the ISER has been suspended in the Health Sector as a result of a direction by IMPACT and some other health unions to their members not to cooperate with redeployment.  As the closing date for the Scheme was extended to 23rd October, and the monitoring process is continuing, additional information is expected to become available in due course.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the number of people who have availed of the career break scheme as announced by him in budget 2009 in tabular form; the sections of the public service they are from; and the level of position they held. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in tabular form below.  In summary, the information reported to my Department by the end of September indicates that some 608 civil servants had applied for the Special Incentive Career Break Scheme and that 526 of these had been approved.  These Civil Service numbers are based on returns from all Departments and Offices.</P>
        <P>In the wider public service, some 425 public servants had applied and 109 of these had been approved.  However, it should be noted that information from the Local Authorities will not be available until November.  Processing of applications under the Special Incentive Career Break Scheme has been suspended in the health sector as a result of a direction by IMPACT and some other health unions to their members not to cooperate with redeployment.  As information is still being updated in respect of some areas of the public service, the above figures may be revised in due course.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 298 of 6 October 2009, the amount of tax revenue which would be raised on a 2010 and full year basis by introducing a minimum effective tax rate for persons availing of all tax reliefs at earnings thresholds of &euro;500,000, &euro;250,000, &euro;200,000, &euro;150,000, &euro;125,000, &euro;100,000, &euro;90,000 to &euro;80,000 and &euro;75,000; and his estimate of the amount of tax revenue which would be raised on a 2010 and full year basis at each of these thresholds if the minimum effective tax rate was set at 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34% and 35%. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the restriction of reliefs measure relating to higher income earners announced in Budget 2006, which took effect on 1 January 2007.  It is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that reducing the existing threshold of &euro;250,000 by the stated amounts, assuming double the stated amounts as the appropriate marginal relief limit and applying the stated tax rates to both the existing and altered thresholds, would result in the following full year yields to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>These estimates are based on personal income tax data for 2007, the latest year for which the relevant information is available.</P>
        <P>The calculations requested by the Deputy on the basis of restricting all tax reliefs could only be provided by a significant development of the costing model, which would be prohibitive in terms of the resources required.</P>

        <Quest> if he will revise the 21.5% VAT rate on a basket of goods likely to be Christmas gifts (details supplied) in view of the fact that the Northern Ireland VAT rate on these goods is 15%, and that Ireland lost &euro;700 million to Northern Ireland in cross-Border shopping in 2008. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39031/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The VAT treatment of goods and services is determined by EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that VAT rates are determined by the nature of the particular good or service being supplied.  The changes made to the EU VAT Directive in May of this year related to Annex III of the VAT Directive, which lists those goods and services to which Member States may apply a reduced rate of VAT.  This list was expanded to include locally supplied labour intensive services, which had already been subject to the reduced rate in Ireland because <Col N="277"/>such services were reduce rated here on 1 January 1991.  To this end, the option is not available to apply a reduced rate to goods such as CDs, cosmetics, furnishings, jewellery, toys and furniture.</P>
        <P>With regard to the VAT differential between Ireland and the UK, given the current Exchequer deficit position, the policy decision of increasing the standard VAT rate in Budget 2009 continues to be necessary in order to support the public finances.  We are borrowing to fund day to day public services which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct our public finances.</P>
        <P>Although the UK cut its standard rate of VAT from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis from 1 December 2008 to the end of 2009, at the same time they increased excise duty on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel in order to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items.  Consequently there was no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT.</P>
        <P>The VAT rate is not the only factor in the price differential between North and South of the border. The weakening of sterling has had a far more significant impact on relative prices than any VAT changes.  Furthermore, as a small open economy, many of our goods and services are imported, especially in the case of those at the standard rate.  Cutting the VAT rates could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own. In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own<?oasys _jy ?>economy.</P>
        <P>There are other means of stimulating the economy, outside of the VAT system.  The government is funding capital investment of &euro;7.3bn or 5% of GNP in 2009, a significant sum in times of constrained resources.  This funding will be targeted at economically valuable infrastructure which will enhance our long term productive capacity and support employment.</P>
        <P>With regard to incentivising environmentally friendly goods, there is no provision in European VAT law that would allow the application of a reduced VAT rate, or an exemption from VAT, on supplies of goods or services based on their environmental impact per se.</P>
        <P>The supply of certain environmental products, such as insulation materials, wind turbine equipment, wood pellet boilers and solar panels, are chargeable at the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21.5%.  However, the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% may be applied to such products where they are provided under a single supply and install contract where the VAT exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT exclusive charge to the customer.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the current VAT classifications with a view to reducing the rate of VAT applied to certain environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5%.  While the scope for reduced rates is limited, the Finance Act 2008 provided for the VAT rate applicable on the supply of miscanthus rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and similar goods used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels being reduced from the standard VAT rate to the reduced rate of 13.5%.  This and other measures under the Programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the environmental challenges which we face.</P>
        <P>I would draw to your attention that the EU Commission recently undertook a study of the possibility of using reduced VAT rates as a tool to support the climate change agenda. Ireland expressed support for such a study.  However, at a Council of Finance Ministers meeting earlier <Col N="278"/>this year the Ministers noted that reduced VAT rates as a tool for achieving environmental policy objectives are relevant only to a certain extent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax would come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of &euro;10 per passenger would apply, with a lower rate of &euro;2 for shorter journeys.</P>
        <P>The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 confirmed the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009. However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of &euro;2 applies to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow are subject to the &euro;2 rate.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand. The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.</P>
        <P>It should be recognised that tourists are only subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional &euro;10 or &euro;2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should have only a very limited effect on tourist numbers. The Government appreciates the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. Indeed the decline in the number of people travelling is also evident in those countries where there is no air travel tax in place.</P>
        <P>We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure. The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it&rsquo;s a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment. In the circumstances it is not proposed to exempt airlines using Shannon airport from the air travel tax.</P>

	<P>The Supplementary Budget in April set out a multi-annual consolidation plan to restore stability to the public finances. The table below sets out the 2008 outturn for debt servicing costs and the projections for 2009-2013 as contained in the Supplementary Budget. On the basis of the Supplementary Budget estimates, it is forecast that about one-fifth of our tax revenue would be required to service the national debt by 2013. It is important to note that servicing of the debt has a first call on the State&rsquo;s resources and as it rises the amount available for other aspects of public services is reduced.</P><Col N="280"/>

        <P FLI="0">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) have advised that, as is usual, the above estimates for debt servicing costs were prepared on the basis of the prevailing market conditions for Irish Government bonds at the time of the Supplementary Budget. As with other budgetary estimates, these forecasts will be reviewed as part of the preparatory process in respect of Budget 2010, taking account of budgetary decisions.</P>
        <P>The overall national debt level will be increasing over the forecast period. At end-2008 the national debt was some &euro;50 billion and, by end-2009 the national debt is projected to rise to approximately &euro;76 billion.  If no action was taken to stabilise the public finances it is forecast that this would result in Exchequer deficits of approximately &euro;25 billion a year. On this basis it is forecast that the national debt level would rise to about &euro;175 billion in 2013. Delaying correction beyond 2013 means that the annual deficit would continue to rise, and could result in a national debt level of &euro;275 billion by end-2017.</P>
        <P>In considering the implications of rising national debt levels we must also take account of the costs that are associated with servicing this debt. Debt servicing costs have a first call on resources; therefore an increase in these costs would have a significant impact on the level of resources that would be available to meet other needs. Delaying adjustment would also impact on medium and long-term growth and much harder decisions would be required in the future to stabilise the public finances. In this regard, it is estimated that in the absence of corrective adjustments, and based on technical estimates taking into account current debt dynamics it is considered likely that debt servicing costs could be in the region of between a third and two-fifths of tax revenue by 2017.</P>
        <P>What is clear is that allowing the deficit to rise and adding further to our growing debt levels is not a sensible option. Therefore we must take action now to stabilise the deficit and Budget 2010 will be framed in this context.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I have no direct role in the provision of translation services in respect of Acts of the Oireachtas.  Section 3(2) of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Act 2006 sets out clearly that this is a function of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.    </P>
        <P>With regard to the cost of translation of Acts, I understand that Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in has other areas of responsibility that take up a significant proportion of staff time.  These include the daily Order Papers for both Houses, a simultaneous translation service for both Houses and an Oireachtas Committee, translation of material for Imeachta&iacute; (Proceedings) for both Houses, managing An Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il (the Official Grammar), oversight of the Irish text of EU Treaties and managing miscellaneous translation requirements of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it is not possible in the time available to provide an accurate costing for the translation of new legislation from 2006 to date as requested.  I will forward the information to the Deputy shortly.</P>

	<P>The recruitment and promotion moratorium announced on Friday 27th March 2009 applies to the civil service, local authorities, non-commercial state bodies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Permanent Defence Forces. It is not an embargo.</P>
        <P>An embargo would imply that no filling of vacancies whatsoever could take place. The Minister for Finance has the authority to allow for the filling of some vacancies in very exceptional circumstances. The Government decision also provides that vacancies may be filled by redeployment of staff from other Departments or public bodies with the sanction of the Depart<Col N="283"/>ment of Finance. In addition, arrangements for the health and education sectors have been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible.</P>
        <P>The position regarding persons on panels arising from Civil Service competitions is that panels from open competitions generally stay in place until the next competition is held. Interdepartmental promotion panels have a definite life span and this is agreed centrally with the relevant Civil Service union. In the context of the Moratorium, a decision has been taken that interdepartmental promotion panels will be allowed to lapse as the closure dates are reached. Decisions in respect of Departmental promotion panels are taken at Departmental level.</P>
        <P>In respect of the wider public service, decisions on the continuation or otherwise of recruitment panels is a matter for the relevant Minister and organisation, in the context of the Moratorium.</P>
        <P>Decisions in respect of future recruitment campaigns will be taken in the context of the business needs of the relevant organisation, the Moratorium on recruitment and promotion and any redeployment arrangements agreed for the civil and public service.</P>

	<P>At present EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, transposed in 2002, with several amendments since. These regulations apply to prepackaged foods whether produced in Ireland or elsewhere. These regulations include a provision which requires that prepackaged foods carry a date of minimum durability on the label. The date of minimum durability is defined as the date until which a foodstuff retains its specific properties when properly stored. The current rules on date of minimum durability, as set out in Article 9 of 2000/13/EC, require one of two options. Foodstuffs, which from a microbiological point of view <Col N="284"/>are highly perishable and are, therefore, likely after a short period to constitute an immediate danger to human health, must indicate a &ldquo;use by date&rdquo;. However, other foodstuffs  which  can reasonably be  expected to retain the specific properties that are normally associated with that foodstuff carry a &ldquo;best before date&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>EU food labelling requirements look to provide consumers with the information needed to make informed choices and to make safe use of food. A key principle underlying the labelling of food is that the purchaser must not be misled. The information on the label must be clear and unambiguous and must not be such as could mislead the consumer to a material degree.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 402 and 403 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the ECCE scheme, participating services will be paid a standard annual capitation fee of &euro;2,450 in return for the provision of the free preschool year.  The payment will be made, in advance, at the beginning of each term.   I am satisfied that the capitation fee as provided for is sufficient to accommodate the majority of services as borne out by the fact that 90% of preschool services operating in the State have applied for entry to the scheme.</P>
        <P>Participating services may charge parents for additional services, provided these are clearly optional and children not availing of such services continue to receive appropriate programme based provision.  Mandatory charges are not permitted under the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sanction was given recently by the Government for the introduction of a higher rate of capitation of &euro;75 a week (&euro;2,850 per annum), for sessional services with highly qualified staff.  To qualify for the higher capitation fee all preschool leaders must hold a Level 7 or 8 qualification relating to childcare and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and all assistants must hold a relevant level 5 qualification.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 404 and 442 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006 &mdash; 2010 under which capital grant funding was made available to community and commercial childcare providers for the development of childcare facilities.</P>
        <P>Prior to the NCIP, capital grant funding was also available under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP).  I understand from Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the programmes on behalf of my Office, that the company in question applied for capital grant funding under the EOCP in April 2004 but its application did not proceed as it was unsuccessful in securing a site for the project.</P>
        <P>With the introduction of the NCIP in 2006, I understand that the company made a further application for capital grant in June 2008.  However, with the economic downturn in September 2008 it was necessary to review public expenditure, particularly in the area of new capital commitments.  As a result, with the exception of a limited number of projects, all NCIP capital grant applicants including the company in question were advised in April of this year that the capital grant programme was closed to new applications.</P>

        <P>The HSE has advised my Department that an initial Tender and Procurement Process had been completed and a second Tender and Procurement Process was entered into to create a more competitive market environment, guided by the principle of obtaining value for money for the taxpayer. The result of this second Tender and Procurement Process achieved this objective. The scheme has been audited by the HSE internal audit team, the Comptroller and Auditor General and by an external auditing firm. It is at the discretion of the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct specific Value For Money audits and this applies to the Repayments Scheme also.</P>
        <P>KPMG and McCann FitzGerald have been employed by the HSE since August 2006. Their work is almost complete with less than 1% of claims outstanding and these will be concluded over the next number of weeks. However it is expected that there will be ongoing involvement of the Scheme Administrator until all of the Appeals have been determined.</P>

	<P>CervicalCheck commenced on 1 September 2008.  Under the Programme women aged 25-44 will be screened every 3 years and women aged 45-60 will be screened every 5 years.  For the first year CervicalCheck operated on an open access system of screening.  However, from September 2009, in line with best international practice, CervicalCheck changed from that open access entry system to an organised call, re-call system of invitation.  This change will ensure that an effective and efficient population approach to screening that maximises target population coverage is maintained. </P>
        <P>CervicalCheck has a national register of women aged 25 to 60.  Over each screening round, all eligible women aged 25 to 60 will be invited for screening and invitation letters will be issued to women evenly across all age ranges.</P>
        <P>The criteria for eligibility under the Programme are clearly set out on the CervicalCheck website.  Any woman who has not had a smear test in the last three years can opt into the Programme simply by registering online, by completing and returning a form by Freepost, or by calling CervicalCheck on Freephone1800 45 45 55 to request an invitation.  Certain women are eligible for a free smear test without a CervicalCheck invitation letter.  These include women aged over 60 who have never had a smear test and women of any age post colposcopy.</P>

	<P>My Department has not spent any money on advertising for CervicalCheck.  As uptake levels have remained high under the Programme, my Department advised the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) in May this year that advertising should cease in order to focus scarce resources on service delivery.  The NCSS is confident that it will reach its annual target of screening 240,000 women per year under CervicalCheck through the operation of a call-recall system which was put in place with effect from 1 September 2009.</P>
        <P>Neither the NCSS Budget, nor its Service Plan for 2010 have been agreed.</P>

	<P>One of the guiding principles of the report by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al&rsquo;s Committee on Dermatology Services is that services should be equitable and patient-centred, with a strong emphasis on regional self-sufficiency and collaboration between primary and secondary care.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>This is in line with the Government commitment to ensuring quality health services, delivered efficiently and effectively.   Patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.</P>
        <P>The HSE recognises that dermatology services in the HSE South East require further development.  At present there is one consultant dermatologist working in the South East region. The dermatology service includes in-patient care where required; day cases and out-patient consultations. Outreach clinics are provided in Wexford, Kilkenny and Clonmel. In Waterford Regional Hospital, the dermatology services include a range of facilities including out-patient clinics, cryotherapy, minor surgery and nurse-led phototherapy services.</P>
        <P>The HSE has identified the provision of a second consultant dermatology post among its priorities for development. This year I allocated funding to the HSE for demographic service pressures, and the HSE decided to prioritise posts in vascular surgery and orthopaedics in the South East. I am pleased to say that these posts were approved and are now being progressed.</P>
        <P>The HSE is faced with difficult choices in delivering its services within the resources available. It will continue to keep the scope for further developments in dermatology services under consideration bearing in mind the funds it has available.</P>
        <P>In line with the National Service Plan 2009 and its Transformation Programme, the HSE is at present undertaking a review which will inform the development of proposals for the future configuration of acute hospital services in the South. The arrangements for the delivery of dermatology services in the region must also be viewed in this context.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 421, 509, 537, 593 and 594 together.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad and is scheduled to be debated in Dail Eireann in the current D&aacute;il session.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption  Bill  2009 when enacted.</P>
        <P>The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement or have been effected prior to the commencement of the new law.</P>
        <P>There are transitional provisions contained in the Bill.  However, the issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, have been raised with me by representative groups.  I am currently examining this and other related matters.</P>
        <P>My officials, in consultation with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, have been doing preparatory work on a possible bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. Consideration of this is at an early stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are significant differences in the contractual arrangements under which general practitioners, on the one hand, and dentists in private practice, on the other hand, provide services to eligible patients on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE). These differences stem from agreements reached with the respective representative organisations over many years.</P>
        <P>Dentists in private practice participate in two State-funded dental schemes &mdash; the Dental Treatment Services Scheme for medical card holders, operated by the HSE, and the Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme, operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>Approximately 1400 dentists participate in the two schemes. They are reimbursed on a fee per item of service basis and will receive approximately &euro;150 million this year for services provided. The Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on dental services in 2007 identified a number <Col N="293"/>of factors which contribute to the high cost of dental services in the State. The report, did not, however, cite the lack of State supports as a contributory factor.</P>

	<P>There are no civil servants employed in my Department to work solely in the area of Public Relations. However, I do have a Special Advisor in my Department who acts as a media advisor.</P>
        <P>There are six Civil Servants (5.6 WTE) assigned to my Department&rsquo;s Communications Unit, which incorporates a Press Office, as well as an internal communications function. The Unit is headed by an Assistant Principal Officer and also includes two Higher Executive Officers and three Executive Officers (2.6 WTE). One Higher Executive Officer and two Executive Officers work in the Press Office.</P>
        <P>The Press Office is responsible for liaising with the media on my behalf, as well as on behalf of the Ministers of State and my Department. Among its functions are the timely processing of, and responding to, a large volume of media queries and requests for information on health issues from a wide range of media outlets. These include broadcast and print media at both local and national level and specialist medical publications.</P>
        <P>The Press Office also makes the necessary media and communications arrangements for health announcements and works with sections in my Department to plan for upcoming launches, events and emerging issues. Liaison also occurs with Departmental sections to issue press releases and to provide timely responses to queries. An information sharing service is also provided whereby media alerts, transcripts, and notification of press announcements are provided to my Office, Ministers of State, Ministerial Advisors, senior managers and sections, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Press Office also liaises with international organisations including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as well as providing representation on the National Public Health Emergency Team. In addition, liasion also occurs with the Government Information Services, other Departments and the HSE Press Office on issues regarding a coordinated response and more generally in relation to emerging issues. The Office also shares information with other stakeholders, such as the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.</P>
        <P>In addition there are four staff (3.6 WTE) working in the Communications and Participation Team of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. However, these staff have other functions in addition to communications work. There is one person on contract working in the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office who is involved in public relations work.While the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office is an independent body, it is part of the Department of Health and Children with regard to overall numbers reporting etc.</P>

	<P>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Items available for sale in so-called &lsquo;head shops&rsquo; such as &ldquo;Snow&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spice&rdquo; are currently not scheduled under Misuse of Drugs legislation. The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review. For example, in 2006 psychotropic (&lsquo;magic&rsquo;) mushrooms, which were on sale in such outlets, were banned and their possession and sale is now illegal. On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.</P>
        <P>My colleague Minister John Curran, Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops. Officials of my Department are in contact with their counterparts in the Office of the Minister for Drugs in this matter.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has the operational responsibility for the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the 32 local health areas. However, under the HSE&rsquo;s 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the Executive&rsquo;s Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin. The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over. The PCRS is committed to responding to all queries from Oireachtas members and the wider public.  Its phone number is 01-8647100. I have conveyed the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion regarding a dedicated line for Oireachtas Members&rsquo; queries relating to medical card entitlements for persons aged 70 and over to the HSE for consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 443, 466, 536, 554, 561, 596 and 628 together.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad and I am actively seeking time for its progression in the current D&aacute;il session. As I have stated on many previous occasions, under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have also ratified the Hague Convention and from countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement that meets Hague standards.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was effected in the best interests of the child. This applies in the case of countries who have not, as yet, ratified the Hague Convention, and would seem unlikely to do so in the immediate future. Only adoptions effected before the commencement of the Act can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</P>
        <P>There are transitional provisions contained in the Bill. However, the issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, have been raised with me by representative groups. I am currently examining this and other related matters.</P>
        <P>I am familiar with the provisions of the Guide to Good Practice. It should be noted that these provisions refer to situations where countries are moving from bilateral arrangements to Hague Convention arrangements. Bilateral agreement adoptions are provided for in the Bill. Difficulties now being raised relate to countries with which Ireland has no bilateral agreement. While that matter is under consideration, I must emphasise that I must be guided at all times by the best interests of the individual child as well as the need to uphold standards which are for the protection of all children being considered for inter country adoption in specific sending countries.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 to 448, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children regarding the <i>&rsquo;High Level of Suicide in Irish Society&rsquo; </i>published in 2006 and the Committee&rsquo;s recent updated Report are consistent with the actions identified in <i>&rsquo;Reach Out&rsquo; the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005 -2014.</i> The strategy provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland and calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees the implementation of the strategy and publishes an annual report which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P><i>Reach Out </i>identifies four levels of action aimed at the general population, target groups who may be particularly vulnerable, responding to those affected by suicide and information and research requirements. Twenty-six action areas were identified with specific points of action to be implemented in three phases over the period 2005-2014. All actions in phase 1 have been progressed or completed including developing and implementing national training programmes; developing a media monitoring mechanism, progressing the availability of self-harm services through Hospital Emergency departments; developing a standardised approach to deliberate self harm presentations at Hospital Emergency departments; implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services; supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention and developing mental health awareness campaigns. Implementation of Phase 2 actions is ongoing. In addition to the &euro;8m available for suicide prevention initiatives, once-off funding of &euro;1 million was provided in 2009 to further develop services for <Col N="300"/>those bereaved by suicide and to develop an information and awareness campaign aimed at young people, which was launched recently.</P>
        <P>A target to achieve a 10% reduction in suicide by 2010 has been agreed with the National Office for Suicide Prevention. Targets to reduce deliberate self-harm (DSH) have also been agreed. The aim is to reduce the incidence of repeated deliberate self-harm by 5% by 2010 and a further 5% by 2016.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the youth work sector has received considerable financial support over the past number of years. Funding for youth services by the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department has expanded from &euro;35.5 million in 2004 to &euro;52.6 million in 2008. While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidation of existing services. It is my intention that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget of over &euro;48m will continue to focus on supporting existing youth programmes and services for young people including those with fewer opportunities. I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort will continue to be made to minimise the impact of any reduction in funding available to the youth sector and to preserve and maintain existing provision in so far as is possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 450, 455, 474, 540 and 548 to 550, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Adoptions entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions by the Adoption Board are considered to be safe and secure. In August, I was made aware of two significant reports regarding child welfare, protection and adoption in Vietnam, namely the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) Report and the International Social Services (ISS) Report. My Office has received the MoLISA Report and the finalised version of the ISS Report is expected to be received in November. I will be considering these two reports jointly and will not be taking further decisions until I have done so.</P>
        <P>It was a matter of particular concern that 20 cases had applications completed and lodged with the Vietnamese side but had not received referrals by the 1 May deadline and could not therefore proceed. During my subsequent private visit to Vietnam, I  requested the Vietnamese Government to give consideration to processing these 20 applications which were on hand in the Department of International Adoptions in Hanoi. In light of our continuing positive dialogue regarding a future adoption agreement between the two countries, the Vietnamese side acceded to this request.</P>
        <P>I met the Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister, Hoang Trung Hai, on 23 October to discuss adoption matters in general. The Deputy Prime Minister was leading a trade mission to Europe. The meeting was most amicable and allowed both Governments to outline their current positions in relation to the bilateral agreement and legislative developments in each jurisdiction, including Hague Convention ratification. Both Governments restated their desire to achieve the highest standards in inter-country adoption and they committed to ongoing dialogue to advance these goals.</P>
        <P>I have sought at all times to ensure that prospective adoptive parents are kept fully informed of the position with regard to adoptions from Vietnam. This has been done through meetings with relevant support groups, updates on the website of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and through the issuing of statements as and when developments have arisen. I will continue to ensure that this level of communication is maintained.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 467 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004 the Health Service Executive is required to prepare and submit an annual Service Plan to the Minister for approval. The Service Plan must, <i>inter alia</i>, reflect the policies and objectives of the Minister and the Government.</P>
        <P>Significant progress was made in the HSE Service Plan 2009 in terms of incorporating more explicit links between funding, staffing and services and the development of an improved set of activity measures, performance indicators and deliverables in key service areas, including in the mental health area, which are matched with timescales. These improvements form a framework for achieving greater clarity at an individual service unit level within the HSE on performance expectations regarding service delivery, staffing levels and funding.<b> </b>My Department has an agreed monitoring framework with the HSE and receives detailed comprehensive monthly reports on all aspects of progression of the National Service Plan, including information on activity measures and performance indicators. These Performance Reports are published on the HSE&rsquo;s website each month following approval by the HSE Board.</P>
        <P>My Department is working on an ongoing collaborative basis with the HSE to further develop and refine performance measures across all service areas, including mental health, to ensure that they are as robust and meaningful as possible and reflect key priorities and international best practice as well as being comparable both within the EU and further afield.</P>
        <P>The modernisation of mental health services in line with <i>&lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;</i>is the responsibility of the HSE. It can be achieved to a significant extent through the remodelling of existing resources which will result in the creation of a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service, where need for hospital admission is greatly reduced, whilst still providing in-patient care when appropriate. In January 2008, the Office for Disability and Mental Health was established and one of its priorities is to drive implementation of &lsquo;<i>A Vision for Change&rsquo;</i>. In April 2009,  the HSE adopted an implementation plan for the five year period 2009-2013 and it has also recently appointed a national lead for mental health who will bring a new impetus to the implementation of &lsquo;<i>A Vision for Change&rsquo;.</i></P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which will be introduced in January 2010. The objective of the ECCE scheme, is to provide all qualifying children with a full year of preschool early education in the year before they commence primary school.  A regular pattern of preschool attendance, for periods up to 15 hours each week, is in line with international practice in this area, and is currently the norm for the majority of sessional playschool services operating in the State and availed of by parents who can afford to pay.</P>
        <P>The scheme recognises that some sessional playschool services accommodate a greater number of children than they have daily places for.  To accommodate these services and the children attending them during the introductory period in January to August 2010, transitional arrangements will be allowed.  Services in this category will receive a capitation grant set by reference to the number of children attending each day rather than the total number of children in a week. However, as I have stated, the objective of the scheme is to provide all qualifying children with a full year of preschool early education and the transitional arrangements will not extend beyond September 2010 when the first full year of the scheme comes into effect.</P>

	<P>In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.</P>
        <P>The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care.  It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.  The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained in so far as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts certain front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium and it allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services.  In addition, special provisions apply in relation to certain specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided.  The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> the cost to the Health Information and Quality Authority to carry out nursing home inspections; if this cost is levied on the nursing homes and ultimately the nursing home residents; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Information and Quality Authority has been allocated &euro;13.571million from my Department&rsquo;s vote in 2009 and the costs of operating the nursing home registration and inspection regime were taken into account when this allocation was decided.</P>
        <P>The estimated fee income which will arise from the nursing home registration and inspection regime in a full year is &euro;4.6 million and it was intended that this income would  provide the Authority with sufficient funds overall to enable commencement of the nursing home inspectorate function on 1 July 2009.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that it was decided that the new registration and inspection regime would mainly be self-financing.  In this regard the 2007 Act provides for the following fees: Applications for registration or renewal of registration under Section 48, this section states that the applicant shall include with the application the prescribed application fee; an annual fee payable by the registered provider under Section 99; a fee for variation or removal of any conditions of the registration under Section 52; a registered provider making an application under this section must include the fee with their application.</P>
        <P>Following analysis of the types of centres, numbers of places, etc. it was decided to set a registration fee of &euro;500, payable every 3 years by each nursing home together with an annual fee of &euro;190 per place in each registered centre.   It is estimated that the fee will represent an average weekly cost of &euro;3.73 per registered place.  The fees are payable by the registered provider (or in the case of applications for registration by the applicant, who for existing designated centres would normally be the registered provider). These fees are not due or payable by the resident or their family.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that article 28 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 states that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(1) The registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of the admission of that resident to the designated centre.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(2) Such contract shall deal with the care and welfare of the resident in the designated centre and shall include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Therefore, only those fees, including any agreed increases, set out in the contract should be charged by the registered provider to the resident.</P>
        <P>HIQA commenced the new system of registration and inspection on July 1st, 2009.  The Authority&rsquo;s inspection process comprises three parts: pre-assessment, the inspection visit and report completion including a process of fact-checking and verification. Since July 1, the Authority has commenced 106 inspections. Of these, 59 were announced and 47 were unannounced visits. The average duration of inspection visits to date has been two days.  Of the inspection processes commenced, 9 have reached conclusion with the publication of reports along with the publication of one additional inspection report. The remaining reports will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 477 and 609 together.</P>
        <P>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) was established in May 2007 to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new National Paediatric Hospital.  This will <Col N="308"/>involve the transfer of services from the three existing Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals currently based at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght.</P>
        <P>The details of the High Level Framework Brief for the new National Paediatric Hospital were announced by the HSE in late 2007. The Brief was prepared by RKW, an established UK-based health care planning company. The content of the report was informed by the views of a range of international experts, including architectural, clinical and nursing. The detailed assessment of the capacity of the Mater site indicates that all the space requirements of the new hospital, and a maternity hospital, can be accommodated on the site and still allow expansion capacity beyond the year 2021.</P>
        <P>A pre-qualification selection process for an Integrated Design Team was completed by Q1 2009, with 6 candidates qualifying to compete to tender for the design of the new children&rsquo;s hospital. Invitations to tenders were issued to these 6 candidates and assessments were completed in September 2009.  The successful Integrated Design Team for the project was announced on 15th October 2009.</P>
        <P>The HSE have indicated that the capital development cost of the hospital will be approximately &euro;750m. It is intended that &euro;400m of this funding will be provided from the Exchequer. The remainder will be raised from other sources, including philanthropic contributions. The current timetable for the completion of the project is Q4 2014 when the hospital is expected to be operational.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, my Office has responsibility for the Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) which is administered on its behalf by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The ECS was introduced in April 2006 as an additional payment to assist parents with the additional costs of caring for children in their preschool years.  Due to the need to reduce public expenditure, over the course of this year a number of reductions have been made to the ECS including halving the amount of the payment from 1 May 2009.  From 1 January 2010, the ECS will be replaced by the new free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which will be implemented by my Office and which is intended to give all preschool children the opportunity to avail of a preschool education in the year before they commence primary school.</P>
        <P>As a direct payment to parents of children aged less than 6 years, now 5 years, my Office does not have details in regard to the number of families which benefited, or their size.  The following is the position in regard to annual expenditure on the ECS during 2006-2009 which includes the numbers of children in respect of whom the payment was made.     </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 496 to 500, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The co-location programme is aimed at freeing up public acute hospital capacity for use for public patients and to enhance overall acute capacity at public hospital sites.  It envisages that the private sector will finance and operate private bed capacity and, also, that there will be a substantial degree of co-operation and innovation by public and private managements working together at each site.</P>
        <P>The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the current co-location programme. The procurement process which is underway will continue.  Projects will be operated within the terms of those project agreements in place that are signed or may be signed.  Value for public money criteria remain in place and are to be met by each project.</P>
        <P>Progress has been made in advancing individual co-location projects.  The Board of the HSE  has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at Beaumont, Cork University, the Mid-Western Regional Limerick,  St. James&rsquo;s, Sligo General, and Waterford Regional Hospitals, and project agreements for the ventures at Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St. James&rsquo;s have already been signed. Each co-location project is subject to a 65-year lease.</P>
        <P>Planning permission has been granted for the Beaumont, Cork University and Mid-Western Regional Limerick Hospitals projects.  A planning application in respect of St James&rsquo;s Hospital has been lodged with the local authority. The necessary preparatory work for the project agree<Col N="313"/>ments in respect of Waterford Regional and Sligo General Hospitals is proceeding.  When completed, the planned capacity of these facilities will be as follows:</P>

        <P>In addition to the hospitals to which I have already referred, two further projects at Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals are at earlier stages of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act 2009 provides that the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities will be terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development,  including the requirement that planning permission must be applied for by the end of 2009.   This applies to all private hospital developments.  Provided that a private hospital project &mdash; and this includes co-located hospitals &mdash; conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.

        <P FLI="0">The replies provided to previous questions referred to payments made to companies working on the administration of the scheme as at the relevant dates.  PQs 16923/08 and 23910/08 referred to payments made to various companies whereas the reply to PQ 37120/09 referred only to payments made to the Scheme Administrator.  When responding to PQ 37120/09, the HSE inadvertently provided information on payments made to the scheme administrator excluding VAT, which explains the lower expenditure amounts made to the Scheme Administrator when compared to amounts previously reported. In respect of the decreased figure for <Col N="315"/>Client Solutions, credits were issued to the HSE by Client Solutions against invoices charged in error to the Repayment Scheme.</P>
        <P>I wish to confirm now that the total payments made to date in respect of all companies working on the administration of the scheme since 2006 amounts to &euro;18.654m.</P>

The issues raised by Duchenne Ireland are under active deliberation and are receiving detailed consideration at the highest levels in the Department of Health and Children.  While the Department is working through the issues raised by Duchenne Ireland, it may not be possible to present a full resolution of all the issues.  The Health Research Board is the statutory agency for funding projects in all areas of health research.  The board, through the medical research charities group, recently approved a number of awards for research projects in the area of muscular dystrophy.

	<P>In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to the end of 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.  The HSE will focus on the scope that exists in <Col N="322"/>the health services for reorganising and restructuring work to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care.  It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.  The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.  In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts certain front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium and allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 whole-time equivalents) for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services.  In addition, special provisions apply in relation to certain specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The focus on key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided.  The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.  Correspondence from the HSE requesting derogations from the moratorium on recruitment, for three dental surgeon posts in HSE Dublin North East, was received in my Department on 21 October last.  This request is being examined in conjunction with the HSE.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s objective in regard to adoption is to provide a regime in which the child is at the centre of the adoption process, whether it is an inter-country adoption or a domestic adoption, and that adoptions are effected in manner that is legal, safe and secure.  The most important development in achieving that objective is the development of an appropriate legislative regime that recognises the changed and changing global situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> adoption over the last 20 years.  The Adoption Bill that was published on 23 January 2009 and which includes the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families and the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.  The Hague Convention, which is given the force of law in the Adoption Bill, effectively puts in place an agreement between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.  It will put in place safeguards that acceptable standards are applied in other countries over which we have no jurisdiction.  It is hoped to bring the Bill into the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks and that we will be in a position to ratify the Hague Convention early in 2010.  The Adoption Bill, which is a consolidated Bill, is complex, and for this reason has taken quite some time to bring to fruition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 552 and 553 together.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that people applying for inter-country adoption are experiencing delays in waiting times for assessment.  Requests for assessment for inter-country adoption are continuously increasing.  Ireland has one of the highest rates for inter-country adoption in Europe.  When an inquiry is received by the Health Service Executive regarding an application for inter-country adoption, the prospective applicants are invited to attend an information meeting within four weeks.  Applicants wait an average of 20 months before their application is activated.  Section 8(1) of the Adoption Act 1991 provides that a health board shall carry out an assessment, whenever so requested and as soon as practicable, of a person or persons intending to adopt from abroad.  Assessment involves a number of stages and generally includes an initial assessment; a considerable level of education and preparation work, including an exploration with prospective adoptive parents of the challenges and issues that are likely to arise when undertaking adoption; and a home study assessment.  The length of the assessment process can vary between applicants depending on the particular circumstances of each case, bearing in mind at all times the best interests of the child.  Applicants deemed suitable to be adoptive parents are granted a declaration of eligibility and suitability by the Adoption Board and may then pursue the adoption of a child abroad with the selected sending country.</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P>Steps are being taken to improve the process.  Monthly information meetings are assisting prospective applicants in self-selecting whether they are suitable adoptive parents and have resulted in reduced waiting lists.  More significantly, they are ensuring that those applicants who are eligible and suitable are being given a more expedient service.  In 2006, 2,450 prospective applicants who made inquiries were invited to these information meetings and 300 new applications were made.  In 2007, 1,974 prospective applicants were invited and 275 new applications were made.  In 2008, 1,083 prospective applicants were invited and 234 new applications were made.  The Health Service Executive has also introduced a nationwide system of application to reduce the waiting lists by over 35% in the coming 12 months.  Under this new system, which was introduced in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow in September 2008, prospective applicants are invited to provide their complete pack of documentation at the point of application and these are then screened by the administration and social work teams with a view to highlighting any areas of concern as quickly as possible.  This affords suitably motivated prospective applicants the opportunity to progress their application while others who are considered less suitable are fully informed before proceeding.</P>
        <P>My office is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks to ensure a well regulated regime of adoption.  The aim is to support children for whom adoption services are devised and provided and to protect prospective adoptive parents.  Further, the Adoption Bill 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad and is scheduled to be debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the current D&aacute;il session.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the assessments of applicants for adoption.  This service is provided by the social work service of the executive.  As the social work service also has responsibility for child welfare and protection services in Ireland, urgent crisis work and adoption assessments have to be balanced out in terms of prioritisation.  I have asked the Health Service Executive to do everything possible to reduce waiting times and assessment times for prospective adopters which are excessively long at present.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 555 and 564 together.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The Bill has <Col N="325"/>passed through the Seanad and is scheduled to be debated in Dail Eireann during the current session. The new legislation is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child. This applies in the case of adoptions from Russia and other countries who have not, as yet, ratified the Hague Convention and would seem unlikely to do so in the immediate future. Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</P>
        <P>Neither the Adoption Board nor the HSE have a statutory function in relation to the provision of post placement reports, though they have, and continue to, facilitate the preparation of same. The key commitment given is the legal affidavit, required of all applicants, to cooperate with the provision of such reports. Recent discussions have focussed on the completion and submission to the Russian authorities of a number of outstanding post-placement reports from adoptive parents in respect of children already adopted from Russia. This issue is being followed up by the Adoption Board and the HSE with the parents involved. I understand that the greater number of the outstanding reports have been competed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation &mdash; that is, the social workers have already conducted the home visit and the report. In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their social worker. Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the Health Service Executive Adoption Services to ensure that parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian embassy in Dublin.  Preliminary work has been undertaken on the development of a bilateral agreement with the Russian authorities on intercountry adoption and discussions in this regard take account of the provisions of the Adoption Bill 2009.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010.</P>
        <P>To qualify for the standard capitation fee of &euro;2,450 per eligible child per annum, all Pre-School Leaders should hold a Major Award (qualification) in childcare/early education, at a minimum of Level 5 or its equivalent<b> </b>on the National Framework of Qualifications.  A higher capitation rate of &euro;2,850 per eligible child per annum, will be available to sessional playschool services in which all Pre-School Leaders hold a relevant qualification at a minimum of Level 7 (degree level) and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and in which all Pre-School Assistants hold a relevant qualification at a minimum of Level 5.</P>
        <P>A Major Award at Level 5 is made up of a number (usually 8) of component awards or certificates, known as Minor Awards.  Learners can build up to a Major Award over a period of time if they have the required number of component certificates which includes the mandatory modules.  Education and training providers will be able to provide individuals with information on the required modules to obtain a Major Award.</P>
        <P>During the first two full years of the scheme the minimum qualification requirement for the standard capitation fee, will be considered to be met where a person demonstrates that he or she has achieved certification for a recognised award in ECCE that includes significant content covering the core knowledge areas i.e. child development, early learning, health and welfare, and has at least 2 years experience of working in a position of responsibility with children in the 0-6 age range.</P>
        <P>Many Montessori teachers already meet the full educational requirements of the scheme, whether these pertain to the standard or higher capitation fee rate.  Others meet the interim requirements in place until September 2012 while some hold qualifications which were designed as introductory courses and did not cover significant content in the core areas of child development, early learning and health and welfare.  In these cases, the modules required to obtain a Major Award can be studied through a number of different means and persons in this position should contact their local City or County Childcare Committee for information on course modules available locally.</P>
        <P>Persons wishing to obtain qualifications to meet the requirements of the ECCE scheme are strongly advised to ensure that both the awarding body and the particular course they are considering are recognised through the National Framework of Qualifications.  As I have indicated, the City and County Childcare Committees can provide information on all locally available courses while a list of nationally available courses is available from the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland at www.qualifax.ie.http://www.qualifax.ie/</P>

        <P>The Valuation Office, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Finance, is responsible for interpreting and implementing the Valuation Act 2001.  In July of this year the Valuation Office clarified that the ECCE scheme will result in certain services participating in the scheme being considered exempt from commercial rates.</P>
        <P>Services covered by the exemption must be solely and exclusively used for the provision of educational services which are available to the general public and the expenses incurred in providing these services must be defrayed wholly or mainly by the State.  I understand that the Valuation Act also allows for community childcare services which are operated exclusively for charitable purposes to be exempt from the payment of commercial rates.  This is decided by the Valuation Office on a case by case basis.  Childcare services which do not satisfy the conditions of the exemption, as outlined above, will continue to be liable to commercial rates.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 563 and 627 together.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the importance of providing high quality services across all three children&rsquo;s hospitals in Dublin &mdash; Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght.  All three hospitals prioritise their services in accordance with clinical need.</P>
        <P>Careful planning of critical care services, including those for cardiac patients, is vital.  To this end, the HSE commissioned the DNV Consortium management consultancy to review current paediatric critical care facilities and services in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the <Col N="328"/>Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street with a view to developing paediatric intensive care services in the period leading up to the opening of the new national paediatric hospital.</P>
        <P>The Irish Paediatric Critical Care network has been established by the HSE with an independent chair to progress the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  Additional revenue funding has been allocated to the hospitals this year to commence the implementation of these recommendations. Three new posts of consultant paediatric intensivists have been approved recently.</P>
        <P>The HSE has committed to progressing a capital development at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin to secure additional high quality critical care beds at the hospital as quickly as possible.  It must also be stressed that the provision of additional ICU beds is an interim measure pending the completion of the new National Paediatric Hospital, which will combine the services provided by the three paediatric hospitals in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The HSE has committed to replacing 13 of Crumlin Hospital&rsquo;s existing ICU beds and to introduce 4 new ICU beds, within 18 months.  This will bring the total number of ICU beds at the hospital to 25.  The design allows for the provision of an additional 5 ICU beds, subject to approval.  A tender for design consultancy services relating to this project has recently been approved.  The project team has already met the design team to advance the project in as short a time frame as possible.</P>
        <P>The HSE and Crumlin Hospital are examining options to address the current cardiac waiting list service need in advance of the new ICU project being completed.  Correspondence has been received in my Department in relation to the specific case mentioned by the Deputies and the HSE has been asked to respond directly to the Deputies in this matter.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010.  All services participating in the ECCE scheme will be required to make reasonable accommodation for children with special needs, as required under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004.  Where additional assistance is sought for children enrolled in participating services, the Health Service Executive (HSE) will assess the level of assistance required.  The level of assistance provided will vary depending on the level of need assessed and the availability of resources.</P>
        <P>The ECCE scheme includes a number of provisions to address issues which may arise in relation to children with special needs.  These include extending the upper age limit for qualification under the scheme to allow children who have been assessed by the HSE as being developmentally delayed or having a physical or sensory disability which prevents them from availing of age-appropriate education.  In such cases, the pre-school year relevant to such children will be taken as their qualifying year.</P>
        <P>To apply for an exemption to be made on either of these grounds, a letter should be forwarded to the Childcare Directorate in my Office stating the reasons for the exception sought.  The letter should be accompanied by a copy of the child&rsquo;s birth certificate, details of his or her Personal Public Service (PPS) number and the name and address of the pre-school service in which s/he will be enrolled.  In addition, the letter should be accompanied either by a supporting assessment report from the HSE or, where relevant, by a letter from the Principal of the local primary school confirming the age admissions policy applied.  Given the timeframe available before the introduction of the first period of free pre-school provision in January next, it is accepted that not all parents will have had time to apply for and receive an assessment report in advance of this date.  To accommodate parents in this position, a professional assessment other than from the HSE may be accepted.  This would not include assessments provided, for example, by a General Practitioner.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the general requirement that a child would be expected to attend 4 or 5 days each week will not apply to children with special needs where a shorter week would be more appropriate to their needs.  Many specialist pre-school services arrange for children attending their services to also attend a mainstream service for 1, 2, or 3 days a week and this will continue to be facilitated under the ECCE.</P>

	<P>Traveller health status is a cause of concern with Travellers experiencing higher levels of mortality and morbidity than the population in general leading to a lower life expectancy.  The provision of targeted health services for travellers has long been a priority for my Department and for the HSE.   Additional development funding of over &euro;12 million has been allocated for traveller health services since 1997. There are a number of specific initiatives as follows.</P>
<P el="10"><b>Traveller Health Units:</b> There are eight such units, operating in each HSE area, in partnership with local Traveller organisations with equal representation of members of the Travelling community and representatives of the HSE and other agencies.</P>
<P el="10"><b>Traveller Health Advisory Committee: </b>This committee was set up in 1998 with the primary function of advising the Minister on policy in relation to Traveller health.  It comprises representatives from the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and from Traveller organisations, including members of the Travelling community.  The committee&rsquo;s main functions are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />drawing up a national policy for a health strategy to improve the health status of the Traveller community;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring that Traveller health is a priority area within the Department of Health and Children and setting targets against which performance can be measured;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring co-ordination and liaison in the implementation of national strategies of relevance to the health status of Travellers;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring the co-ordination, collection and collation of data on Traveller health;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />supporting health boards in developing strategies to improve Traveller access to health services;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />providing a forum for the discussion of health initiatives for Travellers and for on-going consultation with Travellers and Traveller organisations on health service delivery to Travellers;</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />liaising with Traveller Health Units and the formulation of national policy.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P el="10"><b>&ldquo;Traveller Health &mdash; A National Strategy 2002-2005&rdquo;: </b>This document aimed to improve the health status of Travellers.  Although the period covered by the Strategy has expired, its actions continue to be implemented.  The Traveller Health Advisory Committee plays a key role in its implementation.</P>
        <P el="10"><b>Primary Healthcare Projects: </b>These projects play a key role in the delivery of health services to Travellers.  The projects were initiated in 1994 as a joint partnership initiative with the former Eastern Health Board and Pavee Point.  There are currently over 40 such projects established around the country with over 450 participants.  In particular, the projects:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide a model for Traveller participation in the development of health services;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />train and employ Traveller women as community health workers;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />enable primary health care to be developed based on Traveller values so that positive, long-term outcomes are achieved.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Primary healthcare training has recently been accredited by F&Aacute;S at FETAC level 3.</P>
        <P el="10"><b>Inter-Departmental Co-operation: </b>My Department is represented on the High Level Group on Traveller Issues and on the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee: both these bodies operate under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P el="10"><b>All-Ireland Traveller Health Study:</b> My Department, together with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland, commissioned the All-Ireland Traveller Health Study, which commenced in 2007.  This is a comprehensive study of the health and social status of the Traveller community in Ireland. The study will be completed in 2010 and the findings will be used to evaluate progress to date with regard to Traveller health and to plan future policy in the area.  The Study, which is costing in the order of &euro;1.7 million, is being conducted by UCD.  The elements of the study include:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a census of the Traveller population;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an examination of the health status of Travellers;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a quantitative study on the factors influencing the health status of Travellers and their access to health services;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a quantitative study on the perceptions and attitudes of service providers towards Travellers and their health;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a review of services with a view to ascertaining best practice;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a qualitative exploration of health status, uptake of health and social services, health needs and health determinants as perceived by Travellers;</P>

	<P>My Department and the Health Service Executive have been preparing for some years for the probability of an influenza pandemic. As part of these extensive preparations, a National Pandemic Preparedness Plan was published in January 2007. This plan was accompanied by an Expert Guidance document which has been updated in 2009. Upon receipt of the WHO declaration in April, this Plan was immediately put into operation.</P>
        <P>Vaccination is a key strategy that is being used to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Every person in the country will be offered the vaccine. However, initially the vaccine is arriving in small quantities due to the demand for the vaccine worldwide. Ireland is not unique in the difficulties which we have been experiencing in sourcing the vaccine in the quantities which we would require. Obviously, therefore, vaccination will be prioritised to ensure those who require it most will be first to receive it. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee and the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group have advised that the vaccine should be given to the population in the following order of priority:</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />People with long term medical conditions aged between 6 months and 65 years and all pregnant women of more than 14 weeks gestation and for women six weeks post partum, i.e. the &ldquo;clinically at risk&rdquo; groups;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Health Care Workers;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Children between 6 months and 18 years of age;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Adults over 65 years of age;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The rest of the population.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is generally agreed that the preferred option for the administration of the pandemic vaccine to people under 65 in the &lsquo;clinically at risk&rsquo; groups is through general practice. GPs hold their medical records and are in a position to identify patients with underlying medical conditions for vaccination. It is estimated that there are approximately 410,000 people in this category.  GPs have been receiving vaccine over the last two weeks and many patients have already been vaccinated. However, not all GPs are in a position to participate in the vaccination programme and the HSE has set up special vaccination clinics  in order to vaccinate the &ldquo;clinically at risk&rdquo; patients of such GPs.  A typical HSE vaccination clinic will comprise at least 1 doctor, 6 nurses <Col N="335"/>and appropriate support staff.  It will have the capacity to vaccinate up to 500 people a day but the numbers actually vaccinated at these clinics will clearly depend on the demand from the public for this service. The intention is to start vaccinating other priority groups, like health care workers and children, as soon as possible.  However, depending on uptake, vaccine supplies and other factors, it could take 6 to 8 months to vaccinate the entire population.</P>
        <P>The HSE has had consultations with the Irish Medical Organisation on the vaccination programme.</P>

	<P>The HSE proposed to Government last year that it put in place a number of changes to drive operational performance and accountability at local level, to provide clinical leadership to improve quality and standards and to deliver hospital and community services in a fully integrated way. These changes included:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appointment of a new Director of Clinical Care and Quality;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of an Integrated Services Directorate to replace the National Hospitals Office and the Primary, Community and Continuing Care Directorates;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of four regional management teams, headed by Regional Directors of Operations who would be  accountable and responsible for all local health and social care services in the four geographical areas; HSE South, HSE Dublin North East, HSE Dublin Mid Leinster and HSE West;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the appointment of  four Care Group leads (Children and Families, Disability, Mental Health and Older People) at national level to ensure that the delivery of services for these groups is planned and provided in an integrated way across the country.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The HSE has worked closely with my Department to implement these changes. The National Director of Clinical Care and Quality has been appointed along with the National Director for Integration (Performance and Financial Management) and the National Director for Integration (Reconfiguration). A recruitment process has been underway for the four Regional Operations Director posts and the four Care Group leads. The HSE announced last month that three of the four Regional Operations Posts (HSE South, HSE Dublin North East, HSE Dublin Mid Leinster) had now been filled, and the process continues for the remaining posts.</P>
        <P>The next step is to put in place the regional level structures for all services. Until this work is complete, existing hospital networks and local health offices will remain unchanged and will continue to be responsible for meeting their 2009 responsibilities and accountabilities for service delivery and budgets. They will now report at regional level to their Regional Director.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 603 and 607 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Revised Programme for Government states the following in relation to Financing &ldquo;......also taking account of the report of the Expert Group on Resource Allocation in the Health Sector, we will examine the most appropriate future mix of sources of finance to support this vision of the health services, from among general taxation, social insurance/health levy, private health insurance and individual co-payments.&rdquo;  I established the Expert Group on Resource Allocation and Financing in the Health Sector under the chairmanship of Professor Frances Ruane, Director, ESRI in April this year to examine how the existing <Col N="339"/>system of resource allocation within the Irish public health service can be improved to support better the aims of the health reform programme.  I have asked this Group to recommend the best ways to achieve this within the level of resources available to health and to report to me and the Minister for Finance in April 2010.</P>
        <P>Specifically, I have asked the Group:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the current resource allocation arrangements for health and personal social services;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to recommend appropriate changes in these arrangements, which would support and incentivise the achievement of the core objectives of the health reform programme;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in the light of its work, to take a view on the most appropriate financing mechanism for the Irish health service, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to base its examination and recommendations on the existing quantum of public funding for health.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The membership of the group comprises representatives from the Department of Health and Children, Department of Finance, HSE, economists, voluntary hospitals, medical consultants, non-acute sector/primary care, non-statutory disability sector, public sector and private sector.  The Expert Group has met five times while sub-groups established by the plenary group have been meeting on a regular basis since the first meeting of the Group on 28 April.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that there are a range of services that are provided on a universal or whole population basis such as public hospital in-patient and out-patient services including consultant services,while also available to the whole population are maternity and infant care and child health services.  In regard to high quality care the Deputy will be aware that the Revised Programme for Government also refers to the commitment to organise hospital services on the basis of clear patient safety and quality care standards, drawn from best international practice, and progressively move towards mandatory licensing of services based on explicit standards.  In that connection the continuing work of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) together with the work being done by the Implementation Steering Group for the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in the area of licensing for example, is relevant.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that with regard to equity of access the Revised Programme for Government states &ldquo;Equity of Access; implement key features of the new consultants&rsquo; contract to ensure that public and private patients are treated equally for access to key outpatient and diagnostic services, for example in cancer care and colonoscopies.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government  contains a commitment by Government to lead a major re-orientation of health care delivery to primary and community-based care as the location where most healthcare is provided and to create more primary care teams by re-deploying existing staff so that they can deliver more planned and integrated care to patients, particularly those with chronic diseases.  In line with the objectives of the Primary Care Strategy, the Health Service Executive has identified 530 Primary Care Teams and  134 Primary Care and Social  Networks to be developed <Col N="340"/>by 2011.  Almost 130 Teams are already in place and the HSE aims to have 210 Teams in place by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>The HSE is reassigning staff working in primary, community and continuing care services to work in Primary Care Teams.  The HSE also intends to redeploy into community services a significant number of staff from acute hospitals and corporate functions.  As operational responsibility for the establishment of primary care teams and redeployment of staff rests with the Health Service Executive, the part of the  question which relates to numbers being redeployed and timing of the redeployment has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the current legislation for health and personal social services has been in place for many years and there is a need now to have a clear set of statutory provisions that ensure equity and transparency and to bring the system up to date with developments in service delivery and technology that have occurred since the Health Act 1970. Accordingly, work is underway in the Department on a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlement for health and personal social services.</P>
        <P>The legislation will define specific health and personal social services more clearly; set out who should be eligible for what services, as well as criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework. As the Deputy will appreciate, this is a very complex undertaking as the current legislation has been in place since 1970, and there have been significant developments in services since then, with a growing emphasis on delivery of care in a community rather than institutional setting. As a consequence, eligibility for primary care services will be considered as part of the proposed new legislation framework underpinning eligibility for health and personal social services.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government affirms the implementation of key features of the new consultants&rsquo; contract to ensure that public and private patients are treated equally for access to key outpatient and diagnostic services.  Specifically, Consultant Contract 2008 provides that a common waiting list operated by the public hospital will apply to both public and private patients undergoing diagnostic investigations, tests and procedures (including radiology and laboratory procedures) on an out-patient basis in public hospitals (including referrals from General Practitioners).  Status on the common waiting list is to be determined by clinical need only.  The list is subject to clinical validation by the relevant Clinical Director.</P>
        <P>One of the key features of Consultant Contract 2008 is the introduction of new private practice provisions ranging from a total prohibition (Type A contract) to an upper limit of 20% of overall clinical throughput for new consultants.  To date the HSE has appointed 49 Clinical <Col N="341"/>Directors who will monitor compliance by individual consultants with the agreed ratio of public to private practice, taking corrective action where the private practice limit is being exceeded.  I regard equity of access for public and private patients to public hospital services as being of fundamental importance in the delivery of our health services.  In this regard Consultant Contract 2008 specifies that the implementation of the 80:20 ratio of public to private practice shall be the subject of audit including audit by my Department.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the detailed implementation of Consultant Contract 2008.  I have therefore forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Executive and asked it to reply to him directly on the operational details sought.</P>

	<P>The Revised Programme for Government together with other Government documents such Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy, highlight the value of health research and the contribution it can make not just to health related goals but to broader social and economic ones.  The Government is fully committed to health research. The Renewed Programme for Government contains a commitment to increasing and supporting research and development in the health sector as there is no doubt that without a dynamic and innovative health research system, our ability to develop health services and secure social progress and economic gain will be compromised.</P>
        <P>As a further initial step in increasing and developing  health research, I will tomorrow launch an Action Plan for Health Research.  The Action Plan was developed by the cross-Departmental Health Research Group which is chaired by my Department.  I am satisfied that the implementation of the Plan will meet the commitments set out in the Renewed Programme for Government and chart the way forward for health research in the coming years.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that a number of Departments and funding agencies support health research activity across the third level sector, hospitals and other health care settings and in industry. The Action Plan for Health Research will provide a coherent set of actions designed to develop and coordinate research activities so as to fully exploit the health and economic benefits.</P>

	<P>Government policy is to develop and improve health services in all regions of the country and to ensure quality and patient safety.  An important function of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the setting of standards on safety and quality and to monitor compliance on the part of the HSE and service providers with these standards in an open and transparent way.   The Health Information and Quality Authority is currently developing National Standards for Quality and Safety, linked to their work on safety, quality and excellence in service provision. They will continue to work with service providers to ensure the provision of the highest standard of service possible including Hospice and Palliative Care.  The implementation of the Revised Programme for Government commitment in relation to reforms to hospice and palliative care, is ongoing.  The Health Service Executive has advised my Department that at present no waiting lists are kept in respect of hospice services.  Most patients are seen within 7 days depending on urgency of service required.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the collection of national data on waiting lists for Hospice services the Health Service Executive has recently commissioned a subgroup to begin implementation of  the Minimum Data Set for Palliative Care. Currently this group is arranging to collect data in relation to Specialist In-patient Units and Home Care services. The HSE has stated that this data should be available towards the end of the year. During 2010, they intend to roll out the Minimum Data Set in relation to Palliative Care Services available in Acute Hospitals and Day Care.  When this process is complete the HSE should be in a position to extrapolate detailed data in relation to waiting times where they exist for palliative care services. The HSE are continuing to collect monthly activity data for palliative care services.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;Medium Term Strategy for the Development of Palliative Care Services&rsquo; to which the Deputy refers was published by the Health Service Executive in June and is available on the Health Service Executive Website.  This framework sets national priorities which have been agreed by all stakeholders based on solid needs analysis to ensure that services do not develop in an ad-hoc fashion and that any developments proposed in future reflect areas of greatest need. This methodology ensures an equitable approach to service provision as well as consistency in inputs such as pay and non-pay costs as well as levels of staff. The national priorities reflect the gaps that currently exist in particular areas and services and the prioritisation reflects the largest gaps.  When this work was initiated its purpose was to provide a sound planning framework for resource utilisation. It was anticipated that funding for the agreed priorities might be achieved through a combination of reorientation and reconfiguration of existing resources and the identification of additional resource requirements when further funding might come on-stream.</P>
        <P>At a meeting following the completion of the report, chaired by the Department of Health and Children and at which  the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Association of Palliative Care as well as the Health Service Executive were represented, it was agreed that the priorities identified in the Framework should be carried out in the context of  reconfiguration and re-allocation of existing resources/services;  increasing and developing capacity within existing resources,  developing skills in community care and care of the elderly settings specifically in relation to palliative care services and  taking the opportunity afforded by integration to identify ways of enabling the delivery of these agreed national priorities. However all developments are subject to current budget and economic considerations.</P>

	<P>The provisions in the Revised Programme for Government in relation to mental health are consistent with  &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy (2006), which has been adopted as Government policy.  That Report provides a framework for action to develop a modern high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.   The aim is to migrate from traditional institutional based model to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service, where need for hospital admission is greatly reduced, whilst still providing in-patient care when appropriate.</P>
        <P>In April 2009, the HSE adopted an implementation plan for &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; for the five year period 2009-2013.   The HSE recently appointed a national lead for mental health who will drive the implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  The Department of Health and Children will be engaging with the HSE, in the context of progressing its Service Plan for 2010, to set targets for reductions in admission rates.</P>

	<P>One of the key priorities for mental health in the Revised Programme for Government is to reduce waiting times for child and adolescent services.  On 9th October last, the HSE launched the first annual report on the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) which provides a comprehensive picture of the stage of development of CAMHS services.  The HSE now has comprehensive information from which to monitor the mental health of children and adolescents and this will inform the development of services which respond to their needs.</P>
        <P>The Report indicates that the waiting list for child and adolescent services has declined by 13.6% (492 cases) to 3,117 since 2007.  Almost 46% of new cases referred to the service were seen within four weeks of being referred and 67.4% were seen within 13 weeks, which is the widely accepted norm for waiting times.  The Department of Health and Children will be engaging with the HSE to further reduce waiting times and targets will be agreed in the context of the preparation of the Service Plan for 2010. Additional CAMHS teams have been established following the appointment of 7 additional Consultant Child Psychiatrists and a further 36 multidisciplinary team members will be appointed to these new teams in the coming months.  Funding was also provided in Budget 2009 for the provision of 35 additional therapy posts for the CAMHS, and these posts are currently at the recruitment stage.</P>

	<P>In May 2006 the Government confirmed the decision to develop a new Central Mental Hospital (CMH) at Thornton Hall, County Dublin.  Since then, a draft project brief has been prepared and a Cost Benefit Analysis has been completed but none of the work undertaken to date has been site specific.  A number of difficulties have now emerged with the Thornton Hall site; the HSE has identified a need for an Intellectual Disability Forensic Mental Health Unit and a Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Unit but the twenty acre site at Thornton Hall is not large enough to allow for these additional developments.  Neither of the units would be viable as a stand alone facility and they should be co-located with the CMH.  Moreover, the construction of these additional units at a location separate to the CMH would incur increased capital and revenue costs.  In these circumstances and in the context of the commitment in the Revised Programme for Government, the question of the relocation of the CMH to an alternative site is currently under consideration.</P>

        <P>The HSE has disposed of a small number of psychiatric properties in recent years and the proceeds of these sales, which amount to just over &euro;42m, have been surrendered to the Exchequer.  A submission detailing the priority projects to be funded from these historic disposals has been received from the HSE.  Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Finance with a view to the re-voting of these funds for approved projects and for the use of funds generated by future sales for investment in mental health infrastructure, in line with &lsquo;A Vision for Change.&rsquo;</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which will be introduced in January 2010.  At present, some preschool services accommodate a greater number of children than they have daily places for.  During the introductory period of the scheme, in January to August 2010, transitional arrangements will apply to facilitate services in this position, and the children currently attending them.  The services in question will receive a capitation grant set by reference to the number of children attending each day rather than the total number of children in a week.  As the objective of the scheme is to provide all qualifying children with a full year of preschool early education, the transitional arrangements will not extend beyond September 2010 when the first full year of the scheme comes into effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A range of options are available to child care providers to ensure the flexible delivery of the free preschool year.  Sessional playschool services participating in the scheme will, normally, be required to provide the preschool year for 3 hours a day, five days a week over 38 weeks in a year.  Where for good reason a sessional playschool year is unable to operate over 5 days a week, consideration will be given to allowing it provide the preschool year over 4 days a week in which case the daily provision will be 3 hours 30 minutes and the number of weeks will increase to 41.  Sessional playschool services may also choose to provide the preschool year for 2 hours 15 minutes a day, five days a week over 50 weeks in a year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Full or part-time daycare services participating in the scheme will, normally, be required to provide the preschool year for 2 hours 15 minutes a day, five days a week over 50 weeks in a year.  Full or part-time services may also choose to provide the preschool year for 3 hours 45 minutes a day, 3 days a week over 50 weeks in a year.  They may also provide the preschool year as a sessional playschool service by providing the preschool year for 3 hours a day, five days a week over 38 weeks in a year.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) administers a patient private property account system to manage the private money of patients in long stay care.  When clients die while in the residential care of the HSE their estate is dealt with as per law.  In cases where a client has not made a will, all funds or other property <Col N="347"/>of that client being administered by the HSE will be passed to the person most entitled to act as Legal Personal Representative, for the client&rsquo;s estate to be distributed as per law.</P>
        <P>In situations where a client dies intestate and where there are no blood relatives to inherit, any proceeds of an individual&rsquo;s estate held on their behalf by the HSE are forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, who acts on behalf of the Minister for Finance, as required by law.  In no circumstance does the HSE transfer any funds of a deceased client to its own funds.</P>

        <Quest>   if she will review the maintenance charges of nursing homes in accordance with the charges of inpatient services under the health regulations 2005 and 2008.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is currently reviewing the level of charges for publicly funded long stay care.  The purpose of the review is to ensure an effective and equitable charging regime is put in place for the provision of long stay care.  With regard to the particular issue of long-term nursing home care the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, commenced on the 27th October 2009.  The scheme will replace the current regime of public in-patient charges and the private nursing home subvention scheme for all new entrants to nursing home care from the 27th October 2009 onwards.  However, anyone who entered public nursing home care prior to the 27th October 2009 can continue with their existing arrangements and does not have to apply for the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</P>
        <P>Under A Fair Deal, a person will make the same contribution towards their care regardless of whether they enter public or private long-term nursing home care.  Each person&rsquo;s contribution will be calculated based on a national standardised financial assessment and will be based on a maximum of 80% of their assessable income and 5% of their assets, subject to the following important safeguards:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Applicants will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The first &euro;36,000 of the applicant&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, will not be counted at all in the financial assessment.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Where a person&rsquo;s assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and can be collected from their estate.  This is an optional element of the scheme called the &ldquo;Ancillary State support&rdquo; or the Nursing Home Loan.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A person&rsquo;s principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first 3 years of their time in care.  This is known as the 15% or &lsquo;three year&rsquo; cap.  It means that individuals will pay a 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The &lsquo;three year&rsquo; cap will also extend to farms and business in certain circumstances.</P><Col N="348"/>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />If there is a partner or certain dependants living in the principal residence, the repayment of contributions may be further deferred for their lifetime.</P>

	<P>The national social partnership agreement<i> Towards 2016</i> outlines a framework on the needs of children and young people and the establishment of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy Implementation Group (NCSIG).  This high-level group is chaired by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA).</P>
        <P>The vision of the NCSIG is that children, young people and their families will receive the support and services they need to create better futures for children, through all local agencies and organisations working together.  The aim is to avoid duplication of effort, support sensible collaboration in service delivery and also provides an opportunity for agencies to assess the gaps sometimes caused by agency or service boundaries.</P>
        <P>The model for integrated service delivery is being developed through the establishment of Children&rsquo;s Services Committees (CSCs) on a phased basis. Four initial multi-agency Children&rsquo;s Services Committees have been established in Dublin City, South Dublin, Limerick City and Donegal.  They are not an additional layer to services but the coming together of local service providers in an effort to ensure that the needs of children and families are being met by service providers.</P>
        <P>All organisations and agencies working locally on behalf of children and young people are represented on the Children&rsquo;s Services Committees.  These Committees will be responsible for improving the lives of children and families at local and community level through integrated planning, working and service delivery.  They will also ensure that professionals and agencies work together in order that children and families receive better and more accessible services.</P>
        <P>The learning from the set-up and early operation of these four committees will help to inform the most effective way of establishing the other 30 Children&rsquo;s Services Committees in the remaining City and/or County Development Boards.  The OMCYA is currently liaising with new sites in the pre-development phase and working on their establishment based on learning from the first four CSCs.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The problems being experienced by the Health Service Executive and the unions with regard to the introduction of the incentivised scheme for early retirement have not yet been resolved.  As you may be aware, members of all eligible grades who meet the criteria set down in Circular 8/2009 had access to the ISER provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of the ISER while still protecting services.  Because staff who retire under the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard is essential.</P>
        <P>My Department understands that the directive issued by the health service trade unions instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from <Col N="350"/>management is still in place.  This instruction severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  Therefore, HSE suspended the schemes including ISER from 18th June and this suspension continues.  However, applications continued to be accepted by the relevant employer up to the closing date (23rd October) in anticipation of a resolution of the industrial relations issues.  I have been informed that the HSE has had discussions with the health service unions regarding its policy on redeployment/reassignment and these discussions are ongoing.</P>

        <P>Items available for sale in so-called &lsquo;head shops&rsquo; such as &ldquo;Snow&rdquo; (the substance referred to by the Deputy) are currently not scheduled under Misuse of Drugs legislation.

        <P>My colleague Minister John Curran, Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 643, 646, 648, 655 and 674 together.</P>
        <P>There are commitments to the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) in the National Development Plan, Towards 2016 and the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005.  The renewed Government Programme also contains a commitment to explore the provision of a full-scale transport system in rural areas using the network expertise of Bus Eireann and the resources of the school and health transport systems.</P>
        <P>The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommended the abolition of the RTP. The Government will consider the Group&rsquo;s recommendations as part of its preparations for Budget 2010.  The Government has also referred the Group&rsquo;s report to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and General Affairs for consideration prior to the Budget.</P><Col N="354"/>
        <P>Separate to and before the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, my Department had decided that a Value for Money Review would be undertaken on the RTP in 2010.  Subject to the outcome of the deliberations and decisions referred to earlier, it is the intention to proceed with the review next year and all relevant matters relating to the operation of the Programme will be examined.</P>
        <P>On rural transport generally, it is important that existing resources in this area are utilised as cost-effectively as possible and in that context a number of initiatives are currently underway exploring the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers (namely, the Health Service Executive for health transport, Department of Education and Science for school transport, Bus &Eacute;ireann for rural transport, and Pobal for RTP services).  These initiatives involve pilot transport projects in the North East and North West, an exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British/Irish Council.  The outcome of these initiatives will feed into the process for developing rural transport policy.</P>
        <P>The number of passenger journeys recorded on RTP services in the years 2004 to 2008 together with an estimate for 2009 are as follows:</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to security at airports is to ensure the application of European and international aviation security standards to prevent civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference that jeopardise the security of civil aviation.  My Department has no role in relation to the prevention of the illegal importation of goods or substances which is clearly what is at issue in this case.  This is a matter for the Customs Division of the Revenue Commissioners which falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Finance, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> the dates of all audits of the Irish Aviation Authority conducted since its inception under section 32(3) of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993; the name of the firms and persons who conducted all of these audits; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993 (Section 32(3)(a)) requires me, as Minister for Transport, to appoint a person to carry out an examination of the performance by the company of its functions in so far as they relate to the application and enforcement of technical and safety standards in relation to aircraft and air navigation every three years.  </P>
        <P>Since the establishment of the IAA three Section 32 audits have been conducted.  The first audit was conducted in 1996 and was carried out by PARC Aviation Limited, the second audit was conducted in 2000 and was carried out by Schleiss Trading &amp; Consulting Denmark, and the third of the Section 32 audits was conducted in 2004 and was carried out by Booz Allen Hamilton.</P>
        <P>The IAA is also subject to frequent independent auditing of the same activities by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), Eurocontrol and more recently by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) which was established in 2003.  ICAO will conduct a comprehensive audit of Ireland&rsquo;s system for safety oversight of civil aviation early in 2010. Prior to the audit a very significant amount of information must be submitted to ICAO.  Both my Department and the IAA are intensively engaged in those preparations at present.</P>
        <P>Recently I announced my intention to amalgamate the safety regulation functions of the IAA and the Commission for Aviation Regulation with the planned new National Transport Authority.  Detailed proposals will be developed to implement this decision in the coming months.</P>
        <P>In light of the above, and of the need to ensure efficiency and value for money in the current economic climate, I do not propose to proceed with a further independent examination of the IAA at this time.  The requirements under Section 32 of the 1993 Act will be considered in the context of the legislation I will bring forward to provide for the amalgamation of the IAA&rsquo;s safety regulatory functions into the National Transport Authority.</P>

	<P>The State retained a 25% ownership in Aer Lingus to protect strategic interests. The primary interest the State wanted to protect was the key aims of our Aviation policy</P><Col N="358"/>
<P el="5">(1) to maximise connectivity for Ireland</P>
<P el="5">(2) <?oasys _ix ?>to encourage competition and competitiveness The 25% stake has already ensured that competitiveness is maintained in the Irish aviation market by ensuring at least two major airlines continue to operate in the sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition to providing a basis to oppose takeovers, a stake of over 25% also allows a shareholder to block special resolutions.  One notable example of where such a resolution is required is for the purpose of making changes in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company.  This provides a protection for two specific interests of the State. It means that the relevant provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Associations that (a) ensure that the State will have the right to appoint three directors and (b) provide for a safeguard against any disposal of Heathrow slots, cannot be changed without the approval of the State.</P>

In the period 2000-2008 over &euro;2.5 billion has been invested in the upgrading of the mainline and suburban rail network.  This has resulted in a 36% increase in passenger numbers.</P>

        <P>In the Renewed Programme for Government, we have committed ourselves to &lsquo;the provision of a safe and efficient network of rail services&rsquo;.  We have restated our commitment to the completion of the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor and have also made clear that work will continue on the subsequent phases of the Corridor for earliest possible delivery.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing on Phase 1 of the Navan Rail link, and services are expected to commence towards the end of 2010.  As we have stated in the Renewed Programme for Government, we will progress work on Phase 2 of the Navan link for the earliest possible completion.</P>
        <P>My Department will in due course working on the development of a successor to Transport 21.  In this context my Department has recently asked Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to undertake a strategic review of the national rail network in anticipation of the development of a successor to Transport 21. Of course, decisions on investment in the rail network in future years will be taken in light of the overall exchequer allocation available to my Department, which will be contingent on the prevailing economic circumstances.</P>

	<P>The visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, New Delhi on the 30 June 2009.  Further documentation was received on the 18 August 2009.  It was refused by the Visa Officer on the 18 August 2009 for the following reasons:  The evidence of finances shown was deemed insufficient; There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application, specifically the previous passports of the applicant&rsquo;s father were not provided; It was the opinion of the Visa Officer that the granting of a visa may result in a cost to public funds and\or public resources.</P>
        <P>The applicant submitted an appeal on the 15 October 2009 and this is under consideration.  Once a decision has been made it will be published on the website of the Irish Embassy, New Delhi (www.embassyofireland.in).</P>

        <P>I am further informed that Garda&iacute; from Raheny and Clontarf Garda stations police the area concerned and maintain regular contact with the management of the premises referred to in order to address public order issues which may arise.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management is aware of anti-social behaviour in the vicinity of the premises and has designated it a public order hot-spot.  Additional Garda&iacute;, including a dedicated public order unit, are deployed in this area, particularly during weekends and when events are being held, to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour and other public order offences.  Inspections are carried out of all licensed premises in the area to ensure that the provisions of the liquor licensing and other relevant legislation are being complied with.</P><Col N="364"/>
        <P>A policing strategy has been put in place in the Garda District concerned generally to target, in a proportionate manner, public order and other anti-social type behaviour offences.  The numbers of patrons attending licensed premises and other venues within the District, trends in public order offences and concerns and issues raised by local residents&rsquo; associations, community groups, local representatives and the local authorities with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are taken into consideration in implementing the strategy.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management closely monitors patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and the policing needs of the communities in these areas, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The situation will continue to be kept under review, with primary consideration being given to the needs of residents.</P>
        <P>Current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of anti-social behaviour and public disorder, the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents.  This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2009.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that the address provided by the Deputy does not correspond to the address that my Department holds on file, please note that it is the responsibility of the applicant to keep the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service informed of any change of address promptly and in writing.</P>

	<P>The Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at their point of importation.  The service has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and other relevant national and international agencies co-operate closely in taking action against smuggling and drug trafficking on an ongoing basis.  General policy on the regulation of the operation of aerodromes is a matter for the Minister for Transport; such aerodromes are licensed by the IAA.  There are provisions in place under the Air Navigation and Transports Acts, relating to the power of entry by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which may be used for the purpose of monitoring aerodromes.</P>
        <P>The registration of prepaid mobile &rsquo;phones would present a number of challenges, not least the costs of such a system given the volume of prepaid SIM cards in use and the wide range of retail outlets where they are available.  It could raise issues of telecommunications regulation policy, which are of course a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It could also raise significant privacy and data protection issues.  EU Justice Ministers have asked the European Commission, in the context of reporting under the 2006 Directive on Data Retention, to consider whether there are technical solutions that might help improve identification of the users of, for example, mobile &rsquo;phones with prepaid SIM cards. The matter is, of course, kept under constant review.</P>

	<P>Valid applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in February 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the persons concerned are refugees. In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of both applications has commenced and the files will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.</P>
        <P>There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 19 March 2009.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 31 August 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  This refoulement consideration will include a detailed assessment of the prevailing political and human rights conditions in the country of origin of the person concerned. Additionally, all representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that following the initial refusal of the asylum application of the person concerned, he applied to be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1999 (as amended). This application was approved which gave rise to the fresh, and ultimately unsuccessful, consideration of his asylum claim.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 2 October 2001.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 15 October 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a <Col N="371"/>Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received from the person concerned.</P>
        <P>On 2 November 2006 the person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 18 September 2009.</P>
        <P>His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 23 September 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was notified by letter dated 6 October 2009 of the requirement that he present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 27 October 2009 in order to make arrangements for his removal from the State. He failed to present and was classified as evading his deportation. Should he come to the notice of the Garda&iacute;, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the GNIB without any further delay.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>The first named person concerned applied for asylum on 21 May 2002.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the first named person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was notified, by letter dated 24 May 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made in respect of him.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Consideration was given to all representations submitted on his behalf.  On 21 July 2005 a Deportation Order was signed in respect of him.  This Order was served by registered post requiring the first named person concerned to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday, 4 August, 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.  He &lsquo;presented&rsquo; as required and was given further presentation dates which he kept.</P>
        <P>By letter dated 23 July 2008, the legal representatives of the first named person concerned applied for the revocation of his Deportation Order.  Following consideration of this application, a decision was made to refuse the application with the consequence that, on 9 October 2008, the Deportation Order was affirmed.  Notice of the affirmation of the Deportation Order was served by registered post requiring the first named person concerned to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday, 6 November, 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.  The first named person concerned failed to keep that appointment but cited medical reasons for his failure to do so.  He is not currently subject to any presentation requirements with the GNIB.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>On 14 November 2008, the legal representative of the first named person concerned again applied for the revocation of the Deportation Order.  This application, under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), is currently being considered.</P>
        <P>The second named person concerned, the wife of the first named person concerned, applied for asylum on 20 December 2004.  Separate applications for asylum were lodged on 28 October 2008 on behalf of the third and fourth named persons concerned, infant children of the first and second named persons concerned, born in the State in 2005 and 2007.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the second, third and fourth named persons concerned were notified, by letters dated 24 March 2006, 11 June 2009 and 15 June 2009 respectively, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them.  In addition, the third and fourth named persons were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The case files of the second, third and fourth named persons concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the files are passed to me for decision.  Once decisions have been made, these decisions and the consequences of the decisions will be conveyed in writing to the second, third and fourth named persons concerned.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deportation Order made in respect of the first named person, a request was made by my officials to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on 14 November 2008, to not enforce this Order until such time as the asylum applications of his two children had been considered.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The conditions are that the applicant must be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State</P>
        <P>In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State; periods granted for the purposes of study; periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in March 2006, January 2008 and January 2009.  On examination of the applications submitted it was determined on each occasion that the person concerned did not meet that statutory residency criteria as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended.  The applicant&rsquo;s initial reckonable permission had not been granted for at least 5 years at the date of each application, therefore it is not possible for him to comply with the statutory residency requirement.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of my Department if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements.</P>

	<P>Under the Coroners Act, 1962, a Coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions in relation to which he/she is independent and neither I nor my Department has any role in individual cases.  However, to be of assistance to the family in question, inquiries have been made.  Based on the information provided, it is understood that this case is with the Dublin City Coroner.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that many factors influence the time it takes to establish the cause of someone&rsquo;s death.  Post mortem reports can take some time to complete.  I understand from the Dublin City Coroner&rsquo;s Office that in their experience it generally takes between 3 and 6 months for a post-mortem report to be received from a pathologist but that this may take longer where further specialist tests are required (e.g. toxicology, histology and microbiology tests).</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with enforcing criminal legislation in collaboration with other relevant agencies within and outside the State.  The Anti-Racketeering Unit, within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, provides expert guidance and support to Divisional and District Garda personnel tasked with the investigation of the importation and sale of illicit and counterfeit goods, including cigarettes. </P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that records on PULSE indicate that, in 2008, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seized 430,000 cigarettes with almost 12,500,000 cigarettes seized up to recently in 2009.  In addition to this, a multi-agency law enforcement operation, which included An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners, resulted in the seizure of a very significant quantity of cigarettes and the arrest of nine (9) persons last week in Louth.</P>
        <P>Records on PULSE do not differentiate between counterfeit and contraband products, as they are recorded as &lsquo;cigarettes seized&rsquo;.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na along with the Revenue Commis<Col N="378"/>sioners continue to adopt a proactive approach on an interagency basis to combating the sale and supply of illicit cigarettes in this country.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs &amp; Excise) and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs have been involved in a number of operations targeting the large scale importation of cigarettes by organised crime gangs.  These investigations have resulted in a number of actions by the Criminal Assets Bureau against individuals involved in this activity.  As part of its statutory remit the Criminal Assets Bureau will continue to target the proceeds of this criminal activity.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2004 the personnel strength of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 12,209 and the current strength, on the latest date for which figures are readily available, is 14,716 which shows an increase of over 2,500 in that time frame.  Responsibility for the allocation of personnel within the force, including to the National Criminal Bureau of Investigation, rests with the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team.  Resource levels are constantly monitored, in conjunction with crime trends and other demands made on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the situation will be kept under review.</P>

        <P>In so far as my Department is concerned with jurisdiction of the courts in relation to repossessions, policy is reflected in the recently-enacted Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 which gives the Circuit Court exclusive jurisdiction in proceedings in relation to housing loan mortgages.

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 30 September, 2009, the latest date for which figures are available, the personnel strength of Galway Garda Division was 601.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner, with his senior managers and Divisional Officers, arranges for the allocation of Garda personnel throughout the State.  Garda management is aided in this by a distribution model known as the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (GERM).</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Commissioner that this model indicates the most effective means to distribute Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account many different policing variables, including crime trends, socio-economic factors, census information and the minimum establishment required for each District.  The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by these factors and also takes account of the policing requirements of each individual Division.</P>

	<P>The General Scheme of the Mental Capacity Bill was published in September 2008. The scheme implements recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its 2006 <i>Report on Vulnerable Adults and the Law</i>. The Commission&rsquo;s Report followed extensive research and consultation since 2002 with representative organisations, service providers, medical experts and frontline carers.</P>
        <P>On publication of the General Scheme, written submissions from interested parties were invited. A conference was held in Dublin Castle in February 2009, co-hosted by my Department and the National Disability Authority. Attendees at the conference came from a broad range of groups and organisations including those representing brain injured persons, the elderly and the intellectually disabled. Submissions received and views expressed at the conference have been examined for consideration during drafting of the detailed provisions of the Bill, which is now underway.</P>
        <P>I have no function in relation to the matter of the investment of court funds. Under the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions. Court funds which are held for the benefit of wards of court are private funds under the control of the Courts Service. The General Scheme of the Mental Capacity Bill provides for the appointment by the court of a person as personal guardian with a range of functions including the control and management of the personal finances of an incapacitated person. A function of the Office of Public Guardian under the Scheme will be to supervise personal guardians appointed by the court.</P>

        <P>The procedure for making appointments to the Board of the Equality Authority is set out in Part V of the Employment Equality Act 1998 as amended. Section 44 of the Act provides that two persons (one male and one female) shall be appointed on the nomination by organisations representative of employees and two persons (one male and one female) shall be appointed on the nomination by organisations representative of employers. The section provides that the remaining number of ordinary members of the Authority shall be such persons as appear to the Minister to be persons who have knowledge of, or experience in&mdash;</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p4- ?>(i) <?oasys _ix ?>consumer, social affairs or equality issues, including issues relating to the experience and circumstances of groups who are disadvantaged by reference to gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin or membership of the Traveller community,</P>
        <P><?oasys _is0p2- ?>(ii) <?oasys _ix ?>issues related to the provision of goods and services, or</P>
        <P>(iii) <?oasys _ix ?>such other subject-matter (including law, finance, management or administration) as appears to the Minister to be relevant to the issues to which the functions of the Authority relate.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Apart from the provision relating to nominations from employee or employer organisations, the Act does not list organisations or sectors to be consulted prior to the making of appointments.</P><Col N="386"/>
        <P>Section 44 provides that where a casual vacancy occurs among any members of the Authority nominated by employee or employer organisations the Minister shall forthwith invite the organisation which made the nomination concerned to nominate a person for appointment to fill the vacancy and the Minister shall appoint to fill the vacancy the person so nominated.</P>
        <P>When the members of the Authority appointed on the nomination of  ICTU and IBEC resigned, I immediately wrote to ICTU and IBEC requesting them to nominate persons for appointment.  IBEC made such nominations but ICTU have not done so to date.</P>
        <P>The Act provides that the Authority shall consist of not less than 12 and not more than 16 members.  There are 13 members at present.</P>

	<P>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) informs me that the person in question was refused Refugee Status in 2005 and is therefore not entitled to be issued with an Irish Travel Document. The person concerned was granted leave to remain in 2007 until 12 November 2010. </P>
        <P>In exceptional cases an application for an Irish temporary travel document may be considered.  In all such cases INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.</P>
        <P>An application for an Irish temporary travel document will only be considered by the Immigration Services Section in INIS on receipt of a fully completed application form.  Supporting documentation accompanying any such application should include original correspondence from the relevant consular authority outlining the steps necessary to be followed by the person to facilitate the procurement of a national passport if their presence is required outside the State.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Immigration Services Section of INIS that the person concerned has been facilitated with a temporary travel document on several occasions over the last few years primarily to allow her to obtain her national passport. An application for a temporary travel document was refused on 17 September 2009 in respect of the person in question as the application received was not accompanied by the requisite original correspondence from her own consular authorities.</P>
        <P>It remains open to the person in question to submit a new application for a temporary travel document accompanied by the relevant supporting documentation to the Travel Document Unit of INIS which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in February 2007.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division of my Department inform me that further processing of application has commenced and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland and the United Kingdom operate a Common Travel Area (CTA), a result of which is that citizens of both jurisdictions may travel between the two jurisdictions without possessing a passport. However, in Dublin Airport passengers arriving from airports in the UK are not segregated from passengers arriving from other destinations. It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation. Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person.</P>
        <P>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who engage in immigration control related duties at Dublin airport, and other approved airports in the State, have been appointed as immigration officers in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of Immigration Act, 2004.  All such persons are appropriately acquainted with the provisions of immigration related legislation and procedures. In particular, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are Immigration Officers and perform immigration related duties at Dublin Airport, are aware of the provisions of section 11 of Immigration Act, 2004. Section 11(4) of the Immigration Act, 2004, excludes persons other than non-nationals, from the requirement made at Section 11(1) that every person (other than a person under the age of 16 years) landing in the State be in possession of a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, only when they have come from or are embarking for a place in the State, Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>A person who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area (CTA) is not required to be in possession of a passport, or other equivalent document, when arriving at an aerodrome in the State, having travelled from within the CTA.  However, in so far as Dublin Airport is concerned, Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) does not segregate passengers based on the location from where they have travelled. Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at Dublin airport do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that a significant number of nationals of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area do carry passports, even when travelling within the CTA, because of requirements placed on them by the airline companies. When such passengers produce their passports to Immigration Officers, the need for them to establish that they have, in fact, travelled from within the CTA does not arise.</P><Col N="391"/>
        <P>In circumstances where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA.</P>
        <P>In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau and in the UK Border Agency have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area including movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse. The co-operation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality.</P>
        <P>In fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions. In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation &amp; Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, require any person on an aerodrome to&mdash;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>(i) <?oasys _ix ?>give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his/her identity;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p2- ?>(ii) <?oasys _ix ?>state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome;</P>
<P el="5">(iii) <?oasys _ix ?>account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As outlined above, where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, but produces a travel pass issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, an Immigration Officer is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA. However, as such documents as referred to, do not include the nationality of the holder, the Immigration Officers will ask additional questions with a view to establishing that the person is, in fact, a national of one of the jurisdictions that form the CTA.</P>

	<P>The drafting of new legislation on begging is at an advanced stage. I hope to be in a position to bring the Bill to Government shortly, for its approval to publish.</P>
        <P>The new legislation will take account of the High Court judgement in the <i>Dillon</i> case.  The Court held in that case that the current law, i.e. Section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847, was unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>In addition to defining the offence, the Bill is likely to provide the Garda&iacute; with new powers under which they may direct a person who is begging to desist and to move away from the area.  I believe that will provide an effective means of addressing the issue in most instances.</P>

        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 764 and 773 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has played an important role internationally on the issue of alleviation of the debt burden on developing countries. The Government&rsquo;s policy strategy, which was prepared jointly by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance, was published in 2002. It supports the total cancellation of the debts of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. A review of the strategy is now being undertaken by the two Departments and I expect it will be completed within the coming months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance to the developing world is strongly focused on the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and has always been exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans. The Government has also provided significant resources for initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden on developing countries. The two main international instruments which have been established to address the issue are the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The MDRI came into effect on 1 July 2006, and provides for cancellation of eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the world&rsquo;s poorest and most indebted countries. To date, 25 countries have benefited from debt relief under the MDRI. Ireland&rsquo;s share of the total cost of debt relief provided by the World Bank under the initiative is &euro;58.64 million. The Government contributed this amount in full in 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also contributed over &euro;20 million to the HIPC initiative, which is implemented by the World Bank and the IMF, with the objective of reducing the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels. Overall, some $70 billion in debt service relief has been approved under the HIPC initiative for 33 countries, 27 of which are in Africa.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is working closely with the Department of Finance on the details of an updated debt policy strategy, taking account of developments since 2002, and of the views of interested parties. These include the organisation referred to by the Deputy, which has made a detailed submission to both Departments.</P>
        <P>The issue of the debt burden is considered regularly at EU level. The most recent meeting of EU Development Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 18 May, focused on EU support for developing countries in coping with the international economic crisis. The Council underlined that heavily indebted countries eligible for debt relief will not be able to experience the full benefits unless all creditors contribute their fair share and become involved in the international debt resolution mechanisms. The EU is strongly committed to finding solutions to unsustainable debt burdens. Working with our partners, Ireland will ensure that the EU continues to address the issue of debt effectively in its development policies and programmes.</P>

	<P>The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban men, known as the Miami Five, who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. On 4 June 2008, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, issued its judgement on appeals lodged on behalf of the five.  </P>
        <P>The Circuit Court concluded that the appellants&rsquo; arguments, which centred on the suppression of evidence, sovereign immunity, discovery, jury selection, and the trial itself, were without merit and that there was sufficient evidence to support each conviction. The sentences of two of the defendants were affirmed, while the remaining three men were sent for re-sentencing. The re-sentencing hearing for two of these men was recently postponed while the third was sentenced on 13 October.</P>
        <P>While I am aware of the campaign backed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as I have previously stated, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities. I did, however, have an exchange on such matters with Minister P&eacute;rez Roque during my visit to Cuba in February, during which he stressed to me the importance which the Cuban government attaches to the release of the so-called Miami Five.</P>

	<P>I remain extremely concerned for the welfare of Fr. Michael Sinnott, who is now in his third week of captivity. I can assure you that the Government is making every possible effort to secure Fr. Sinnott&rsquo;s release.</P>
        <P>On hearing of his abduction, I immediately asked our Ambassador to the Philippines, Mr. Richard O&rsquo;Brien, who is based in Singapore, to travel to Manila to impress upon the Government there our concerns for the safety and health of Fr. Sinnott and to work with the authorities to help secure his early release. He was joined in Manila on 25 October by an official from Ireland&rsquo;s Mission in Timor-Leste.</P>
        <P>Ambassador O&rsquo;Brien has been engaged in talks with the Government of the Philippines, representatives of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), local officials in Mindanao, members of the Columban Order in the Philippines and several international NGOs.   We are working closely with our EU partners, and Ambassador O&rsquo;Brien has had helpful discussions with senior officials of EU embassies and the European Commission Delegation. He has also met with the Papal Nuncio and with Philippine Church leaders. In addition, the US Embassy has been supportive.</P>
        <P>Our Ambassador to the Holy See, Mr. Noel Fahy, has also been in contact with the Columban Order in Rome.  On 21 October, Ambassador O&rsquo;Brien travelled to Mindanao as part of a <Col N="395"/>high-level delegation of EU ambassadors, and while there he made a strong plea for Fr. Sinnott&rsquo;s release. In the course of the visit the Ambassador was also briefed by UN officials.</P>
        <P>I myself have been in direct contact with my Philippine counterpart, Foreign Secretary Romulo, on two occasions, to convey the great concerns held both by the Government and by the Irish public. He assured me that the Government of the Philippines will do all in its power to secure Fr. Sinnott&rsquo;s immediate release.</P>
        <P>The Philippine authorities are briefing the Ambassador on an ongoing basis on the progress of their efforts. They have established a Crisis Management Committee (CMC) as well as a dedicated Police Task Force to identify the whereabouts of Fr. Sinnott and secure his safe release. The CMC last week offered a reward of Php200, 000 (&euro;3,000) for information leading to his safe return. A joint police/military operation is underway to secure suspected locations. We have received assurances that the pressing issue of Fr. Sinnott&rsquo;s medication is being addressed at a local level.</P>
        <P>Significantly, on Saturday 31 October, the kidnappers released a video clip, dated 24 October, which showed Fr. Sinnott in apparently reasonable health. Immediately following the release of the video, the Philippine authorities held a series of meetings aimed at deciding on a strategy for the way forward, and the Ambassador will shortly receive a comprehensive briefing from the Secretary of the Interior.</P>
        <P>The video contained a ransom demand. The Government, in common with the Philippine Government and the Columban Order, have made clear that no ransom will be paid.  I have been in direct contact with the head of the Columban Order both here and in the Philippines, and with the Sinnott family. The Consular Division of my Department remains in constant contact with the family and with the Columbans. In conclusion, I would like to once again appeal to the kidnappers to release Fr. Sinnott, a selfless man who has made such an enormous contribution to the welfare of the ordinary people of the Philippines.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Cuba is undergoing a major transformation, and its relations with the EU have entered a new phase. Given this new context, I visited Cuba in February of this year and discussed a wide range of political, economic and social issues, including human rights. Following that visit, we are now examining how we might strengthen our bilateral relationship with Cuba and work is being taken forward with the Cuban authorities on that basis. In addition, following the Universal Periodic Review of Cuba at the fourth Universal Periodic Review Session, we have engaged bilaterally and in the EU framework in a human rights dialogue with Cuba.</P>
        <P>The June General Affairs and External Relations Council assessed the EU&rsquo;s relations with Cuba, in the context of the annual review of its 1996 Common Position on Cuba. The Council welcomed the resumption of political dialogue with Cuba, which allows both sides to discuss openly issues of mutual interest. However, a high level political dialogue meeting between the EU and Cuba, due to take place en marge of the UN General Assembly in New York in September, was postponed. It is hoped that it can be rescheduled to take place before the end of the Swedish Presidency.</P>

	<P>The kidnapping, and eventual release, of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki and the continuing ordeal of Fr. Michael Sinnott have highlighted the strength of the commitment demonstrated by aid workers and missionaries working with poor and vulnerable communities across the developing world. The security of aid workers is a priority for the Government, and for aid donors internationally. We maintain regular contact with our partners at EU level and at the UN on the complex issues involved.</P>
        <P>A recent independent report on the provision of aid in insecure environments found that attacks against humanitarian aid workers have increased sharply in recent years, with 122 aid workers killed, 76 injured and 62 kidnapped in 2008. Some 60% of these incidents occurred in three areas: Darfur, Afghanistan and Somalia.</P>
        <P>It is clear that there are no simple security solutions for humanitarian aid workers operating in difficult and unstable situations, often during or in the aftermath of serious conflict. There is no comprehensive, universally applicable international convention on the protection of personnel engaged in humanitarian assistance. During armed conflict, or military occupation, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other relief organisations benefit from the protections provided by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. The 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel and its 2007 Optional Protocol prohibit attacks on UN or associated personnel, including those deployed by a humanitarian Non-governmental Organisation under an agreement with the UN. They require States to take all appropriate measures to ensure their safety and security. Some NGOs and their personnel are also protected by the terms of specific bilateral agreements between a donor country and the State in which they operate as part of a programme of official development aid.</P>
        <P>The role of the United Nations is particularly important in relation to the security of aid workers in humanitarian emergencies and other volatile situations. The UN Department of Safety and Security plays a pivotal role, overseeing security management, and often making available resources for the wider humanitarian community, including information, security officers, and dedicated security radio channels. Many NGOs cooperate with the UN on security matters, exchanging information, agreeing security standards and coordinating emergency planning.</P>
        <P>Ireland is at present co-chairing the international Good Humanitarian Donorship group of 35 donor countries and the European Commission, which works to promote best practice in humanitarian aid and adherence to an agreed set of humanitarian donorship principles. In this role, we are planning to encourage consideration over the coming months of the complex range of issues involved in assisting the security and effective operation of humanitarian aid workers.</P>
        <P>Through Irish Aid, the Government will also continue to work closely with the development NGOs on the issues of access and security for aid workers. In the past year, the Irish Aid Rapid Response Initiative has sponsored the attendance of representatives of a number of NGOs, including Concern, Christian Aid, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire at field security training courses for <Col N="397"/>humanitarian aid workers run by the Defence Forces. The Department of Foreign Affairs also supports the work of C&oacute;mhl&aacute;mh, the Irish Association for Development Workers, in protecting the interests of development workers and volunteers. In particular, Irish Aid funded the development of the C&oacute;mhl&aacute;mh Code of Practice for organisations sending volunteers to developing countries, which commits organisations to ensuring the protection, safety and well being of the volunteers. The Code also highlights the need to ensure that volunteers are fully informed about health, safety and security issues relating to their assignment. More than 30 Irish volunteering organisations are involved in this important initiative. Irish Aid also provides funding for a counselling service organised by C&oacute;mhlamh for aid workers when they return to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to work closely with our partners internationally and with the development NGOs in order to ensure that the security of Irish aid workers is safeguarded to the maximum degree possible.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the arrest of seven Saharawi human rights activists in Casablanca, Morocco, on 8 October this year. I understand that Moroccan police arrested the group at Casablanca Airport, on their return from a visit to the Saharawi refugee camps in South Western Algeria. While the Moroccan police authorities have confirmed the arrest, there are no further official details on the group&rsquo;s whereabouts or their current situation. However, unofficially, we understand that they continue to be held and that they may face serious charges, including treason. Unfortunately, prior to their return, the group&rsquo;s visit to the camps had been highlighted and strongly condemned in the Moroccan press, which has accused the group of treason.</P>
        <P>Through our embassy in Lisbon, which is accredited to Morocco, we have been in contact with our EU partners on the ground in Rabat, who have been in discussions with the Moroccan authorities about the case. The embassy will continue to monitor the situation of the group and remain in contact with our EU partners on the ground. I understand that the President of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), has expressed his concerns for the safety of these seven Saharawi detainees directly to the President of the United Nations Security Council and that he has also written to the President of the European Council.</P>
        <P>The plight of the people of Western Sahara remains an issue of great concern to the Irish government and to the international community. I spoke on this issue and about the grave humanitarian aspects of frozen conflicts at the Ethical Development Action Conference in Cork in April. We would wish to see that human rights activists in Western Sahara and in Morocco enjoy freedom of movement and expression and that they are able to carry out their legitimate human rights activities without fear of reprisals, in accordance with international law. We will continue to follow this matter and to raise the importance of human rights protection with the Moroccan authorities at every available opportunity.</P>

	<P>I visited Washington and New York from 14-18 October 2009. During my visit, I met with American politicians, members of the Irish community and the wider business community, including with clients of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. Every effort was made to promote Irish-American political, economic and cultural relations during the visit. </P>
        <P>I addressed the European Institute in Washington on the theme of &ldquo;Equipping the EU for global challenges: an Irish view&rdquo;. This was an invaluable opportunity to explain Irish attitudes to the EU and the Lisbon Treaty and to set out how the EU and US are working together to address global challenges. I then travelled to Capitol Hill, where I met senior members of Congress, including Senators John McCain, Chris Dodd, Paul Kirk, Lindsey Graham, Bob Casey, Jeanne Shaheen and Pat Leahy. I also met with 16 members of the House of Representatives, including Congressman Richie Neal, who is Chairman of the Friends of Ireland group in the US Congress, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and Congressman Patrick Kennedy. Our discussions covered a wide range of subjects, including the outcome of the Lisbon referendum in Ireland, the current economic climate, the situation in Northern Ireland, the Global Irish Economic Forum held at Farmleigh in September and, of course, the issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States.</P>
        <P>In New York, I chaired the inaugural meeting of the new Ireland-US Leadership Council. The formation of the Council was a key proposal of the Ireland-US Strategic Review, which was launched by the Taoiseach in March. The grouping brings together leaders of the main Irish-American organisations in the business, community and cultural fields.</P>
        <P>In New York, I also met with a broad range of Irish community representatives including those from the main Irish advice and support centres across the US and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR). I also had an opportunity to see how we are providing practical support to Irish communities in the US when I visited a project in Rockland County, where the Irish Government and the GAA have jointly supported the development of local sports grounds for around 700 boys and girls who are actively involved in Gaelic games.</P>
        <P>I addressed a business breakfast for 60-70 guests at Ireland House in New York and briefed them on the outcome of the Lisbon referendum and on the steps we are taking to address the economic challenges we face. The guests included key clients of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and I also met with business media.</P>
        <P>Other engagements included attending an interfaith service on Staten Island, in memory of Irish famine emigrants who died while quarantined on arrival in New York.</P>
        <P>The Irish-US relationship is of enormous importance and benefit to Ireland and my visit was an opportunity to maintain and further develop key relationships in Washington and New York.</P>

	<P>On 20 October, some two months after the first round of voting in the Afghanistan Presidential and provincial elections on 20 August, official results for the Presidential election were announced by the Independent Election Commission. Results are still awaited in the provincial elections. </P>
        <P>On the basis of preliminary results released in mid-September, President Karzai had declared himself the outright winner in the Presidential election, on the grounds that these results <Col N="399"/>appeared to show that he had won more than the 50%+ of the vote required to avoid a second round run-off. However, the official results released on 20 October, which took on board the substantial number of votes invalidated by the Electoral Complaints Commission, showed that neither President Karzai nor his closest rival, former Foreign Minister, Dr Abdullah Abdullah, had secured more than the 50% necessary to avoid a run-off. On this basis, a second round of voting was scheduled to take place on 7 November. This vote was, however, cancelled on 2 November, following Dr Abdullah&rsquo;s withdrawal from the contest on 31 October, and President Karzai has been declared the winner of the election.</P>
        <P>I am deeply dismayed by the extent of the irregularities and fraud which surrounded the August Presidential election. The EU Election Observation Mission was among the first of those monitoring the elections to report concerns in this respect. That irregularities and fraud occurred on a very large scale was subsequently confirmed by the Electoral Complaints Commission, which invalidated roughly one quarter of the votes investigated and one third of President Karzai&rsquo;s previously estimated total. Some reassurance, however, may be found in the fact that Afghan institutions &mdash; the Electoral Complaints Commission in particular &mdash; were prepared to expose the fraud, to ensure that a fraudulent outcome did not result in the unchallenged victory of one of the candidates, and to insist on a second round of voting, in accordance with the Afghan Constitution.</P>
        <P>The situation in Afghanistan remains a very difficult one, with many challenges to be faced. The country needs a credible, effective and accountable Government. It will be important that President Karzai loses no time in demonstrating effective leadership to provide the people of Afghanistan with security, stability, justice, basic services and security of livelihood. The international community has pledged to support Afghanistan in this task and, despite the very grave difficulties, it remains important for this international support to continue, both for the Afghan people and for the security of our own societies.</P>

	<P>I have not been contacted by any charitable group in connection with this convoy. However, I have had enquiries made with the Egyptian authorities in relation to it. </P>
        <P>I understand that the convoy in question is a very large shipment of aid organised by Palestinian groups in a number of European countries, primarily the UK. It was organised in proper consultation with the Egyptian authorities, and permissions issued. Unfortunately, however, the shipment was sent to Port Said, whereas all shipments for Gaza are now to be routed through the port of Arish, closest to Gaza. I understand Egyptian officials and the Egyptian Red Crescent are arranging its transfer to Arish.</P>
        <P>A separate difficulty is that a very large number of persons have travelled with the convoy intending to enter Gaza, and the Egyptian authorities had not been notified of this. They are now processing these individuals and will in due course decide if some or all of them can be admitted to Gaza.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The widespread food shortages which continue to affect millions of the most vulnerable people in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) are a matter of serious concern. It is estimated that over one third of the population of the country is in need of food assistance. The situation is compounded by lack of access to safe drinking water, serious constraints in agricultural production and inadequate healthcare facilities. Urban households, particularly in the northeast of the country are among the worst affected.</P>
        <P>In view of the gravity of the situation, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland is the seventh largest donor, recently announced a second funding contribution to the DPRK for 2009. It brings the CERF response so far this year to more than &euro;12 million. This includes support for immediate food assistance, and for crop production and healthcare interventions. During 2008, two members of the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps were deployed to support the operations of the World Food Programme in the DPRK.</P>
        <P>Discussions are taking place at EU level on the situation in DPRK. It is clear that a solution to the food shortages over the longer term is dependent not just on food aid from the international community, but also on addressing the underlying structural issues.</P>

	<P>Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001. </P>
        <P>In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from &euro;254m to &euro;550m to continue the Fund for a further four years to 2008. By the end of 2008 a total of &euro;545.8m was paid out of the Fund. The remaining balance in the Fund at the start of 2009 was &euro;4.2m. &euro;68.1m has been allocated to the Fund for 2009 and a regulation which increased the level of the fund by &euro;63.907m has been made.</P>
        <P>Of the &euro;545.8m paid out of the Fund to end 2008, Horse Racing Ireland received &euro;436.6m.  Horse Racing Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the Fund in 2009 is &euro;54.5m.</P>

While the Department has previously produced related documents viz the Arts and Culture programme in 2008 it was considered that added value would be obtained by having an independent view on the impact of the cultural sector and it was in that context that DKM was commissioned to take on this assignment at a vat inclusive cost of &euro;11,846. It is my intention to publish the report shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is below in Tabular format.</P>
        <P>Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department, grant aid to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million is provided to Local Authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.  Proposals must comply with the standards set out in the Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Procedures for the Planning, Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Under the Guidelines there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.  These, in order of progress, are: Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation.  The Department and its technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from the Department of Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism.</P><Col N="402"/>
        <P>The policy since 2000 has been to give priority to the completion of the 57 projects within the current round.  Of these 57 projects, 45 have been completed and open to the public, 2 are under construction or about to start construction and ten other projects are at various other stages.</P>
        <P>Cumulative grant expenditure by the Department under the programme from 2000 to date this year is &euro;139.15m and this grant aid has leveraged total investment of almost &euro;400m in public swimming pool facilities.  Grant aid of &euro;12.4m has being provided in the Revised Estimates for 2009.</P>

	<P>Operational responsibility for both tourism marketing and the development of specific products, such as golf tourism, rests with the tourism agencies.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt but that the period to date in 2009 has been very difficult for tourism globally with all major international tourism destinations showing decreased numbers of visitors. In that context, the golf tourism market is, like other product areas, exposed to the challenges of negative consumer sentiment and adverse currency movements in key markets.</P>
        <P>In terms of reviewing the golf market, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has established a Golf Industry Development Forum drawing on representation from all sectors of the golf tourism industry and some external business practitioners, with a view to developing a new and holistic business development plan for the sector.  I understand the Forum has consulted widely with industry players, conducted significant consumer research and agreed a prioritised set of actions that all in the industry are aligned behind.</P>
        <P>Three industry working groups have been established to deliver:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A new Golf Holidays brand for Ireland</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A new online business development strategy (including a new website with real-time booking facilities for tee times)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A new Tourist-Friendly quality standard, covering both the conditioning of the course and the associated customer services available to visitors.  The system is currently being piloted in 19 courses.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">All three working groups are making good progress and it is expected that the new Business Development Plan will be fully operational in Quarter 1, 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has recently appointed a specialist sales development agency to sell the Irish golf product in the UK marketplace, targeting individuals, societies and corporate incentive business.  This specialist agency has relations with all of the key golf marketing groups in Ireland and is working to very specific sales targets which are being regularly reviewed by the F&aacute;ilte Ireland executive.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland, as the agency responsible for the promotion overseas of the island of Ireland as a tourist destination, also continues to promote Ireland overseas as a premier golfing destination and is at present placing strong emphasis on tactical offers and value for money, including excellent value golf deals.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I am confident that the television exposure of the 3 Irish Open Golf Tournament in Killarney from 29th July to August 1st 2010 will also help to market Ireland as an attractive golfing destination.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, a national audit of sports facilities is underway.  This is being carried out in two phases.  Phase one of the audit is complete and focused on national and regional sports facilities.  Phase two is the compilation of a list of facilities at local level and commenced in 2008 with the assistance of local authorities.  The opportunity was taken to gather information on publicly funded arts <Col N="408"/>facilities in local authority areas.  Guidelines were issued to the local authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.  To date 32 of the 34 Local Authorities have submitted their returns which contain over 6,000 records of sports and arts facilities.  In tandem with this, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is undertaking an audit of community facilities. </P>
        <P>The Department will collate the information on arts facilities provided by the local authorities when it is complete as well as relevant records from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  At that point the Department will assess the merits of as well as the costs involved in undertaking the necessary actions to complete a national audit of arts and cultural facilities.</P>

	<P>The Per Cent for Art scheme, when launched, was accompanied by a set of guidelines to assist with its implementation.  The Guidelines included a commitment to review the scheme and this process is currently underway.</P>
        <P>The review of the working and implementation of the Per Cent for Art Guidelines has been undertaken through an Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  This Group, which is representative of a wide range of Government Departments, Agencies, the Arts Council and Local Authority Arts Officer Association, has been working to revise and achieve an agreed and constructive set of guidelines and  significant progress has been made.</P>
        <P>The Public Art Advisory Panel, convened by the Arts Council, is currently liaising with the Interdepartmental Group so that the revised guidelines can be agreed, finalised and published.</P>
        <P>The group also examined ways in which information on public art could be made more easily accessible to the public.  A working version of the public art website called publicart.ie, was launched in early summer.  When complete, the website will be an important resource for all those interested and working in the area of public art.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the provisions of section 8(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003, it is a day-to-day matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to establish and maintain registers of hotels, guesthouses, holiday camps, holiday hostels, caravan sites, camping sites, approved holiday cottages, holiday apartments, motor hotels and youth hostels.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has no legislative authority to maintain a register of bed and breakfast establishments.</P>
        <P>At the outset I think it worthwhile to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to a number of documents which are the framework for the promotion and development of our tourism policy generally.  That policy is set out in the Agreed Programme for Government, and the strategic drivers are set out in the 2003 Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group, &ldquo;New Horizons for Irish <Col N="410"/>Tourism &mdash; An Agenda for Action&rdquo;, as well as the subsequent reports of the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group and more recently the Tourism Renewal group.  These documents are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.dast.gov.ie, and that of the Department of the Taoiseach, www.taoiseach.gov.ie.  It is worth noting that none of these documents recommend or propose a mandatory registration system for B&amp;Bs.  More recently the Irish Bed and Breakfast Working Group established by F&aacute;ilte Ireland recommended a local authority licensing system for Bed and Breakfast establishments and I understand that this proposal and other options are under review by the B&amp;B implementation group with support from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</P>
        <P>B&amp;Bs operate primarily as family homes, with many open only for short periods during the high season, or where there is peak demand, such as during festivals. While a compulsory approval system for all B&amp;B accommodation would have some advantages from a tourism promotion policy viewpoint, it is considered that there may be difficulty in gaining acceptance for such a system in respect of what are, in many cases, primarily, non-commercial enterprises.  It is considered also that such a system would likely require substantial administration and policing to be effective and the value of putting this in place is questionable where there is no evidence to show that the unlisted sector is causing a major concern for visitors.</P>
        <P>I believe that the best approach to develop this sector is to ensure that listed B&amp;Bs have certain advantages over those who choose not to carry F&aacute;ilte Ireland accreditation.  In this regard unapproved operators are obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with requirements in the area of taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene.  On the other hand, they do not have access to official marketing through F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Tourist Information Offices, nor do they have access to the various training and business skills initiatives that are available to the approved sector.</P>
        <P>In keeping with that policy F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working with the Irish Homes Bed and Breakfast Implementation Group in the development of a licensing, voluntary classification and categorisation system, supported by a new brand that will be readily identifiable to domestic and international tourists allowing them to choose an establishment that meets their individual expectations in terms of facilities and standards.</P>

	<P>Special funding of &euro;2.5 million was allocated from the dormant accounts fund for the appointment of 20 Sports Inclusion Development Officers (SIDOs) in Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) in 2008.  The SIDOs were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.  </P>
        <P>A network of 33 LSPs have been set up throughout the country by the Irish Sports Council (ISC) to coordinate and promote sport at local level especially amongst specific target groups such as older people, girls and women, people with disabilities, unemployed people and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.  The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the LSPs by the ISC for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.  The ISC has allocated &euro;6 million to the LSPs in 2009.</P>

	<P>The Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs operates a Walks Scheme for the development, enhancement and maintenance of waymarked ways and other priority walks.  This Scheme has been developed within my Department in consultation with Comhairle na Tuaithe.  It was introduced in 2008 and currently operates on 18 trails.  There are currently 1,091 participant landowners on the scheme.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;1.12 million was provided for the scheme in 2008 and expenditure to date in 2009 amounts to &euro;1.288 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The evidence is that the Scheme is working well and in this context, there is a significantly higher standard of maintenance on trails where the Scheme is in operation.  Whilst the farmers and landowners who participate in the Walks Scheme are responsible for routine maintenance work, it is generally participants on the Rural Social Scheme that undertake maintenance work such as the installation of stiles and bridges.</P>
        <P>The number of walks available is constantly increasing and details are available on the Coillteoutdoors and the DiscoverIreland websites.  Figures provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland are very encouraging with over 500,000 walkers visiting Ireland in 2008.  These figures also indicate that the numbers of walkers visiting the country are increasing year-on-year, despite the difficulties in some areas of tourism.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 798, 802, 803, 806, 809 and 814 together.</P>
        <P>I have previously indicated that my strong view is that a single focussed programme with a single integrated delivery structure is appropriate in order to maximise the impact of the Local Development Social Inclusion and Community Development Programmes, which serve disadvantaged communities.  My overall aim is to ensure that, from 2010, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focussed programme with clear objectives and simplified and streamlined delivery structures.</P>
        <P>The practicalities of the new arrangements will be addressed over the coming period and I am not contemplating fresh legislation in connection with this initiative.</P>
        <P>The Centre for Effective Services is currently preparing proposals in this regard, which will draw on good international practice and independent advice. I hope to receive this in the near future with a view to rolling out a new programme early next year.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the redesign work, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the Community Development Programme (CDP) and will shortly have a full report on the findings and recommendations that arise from that review. I am personally committed to protecting funding for 2010 to the greatest extent possible for CDP projects endorsed by the review.  In the event of projects not recommended for continued funding, an appropriate appeals mechanism will be provided. Also the review will not intrude on alternative, non core sources of CDP funding.</P>
        <P>My overall aim is to ensure that, from 2010 onwards, notwithstanding the difficult budgetary position, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme and better integrated actions.  As previously indicated to the House, my primary concern, in this most difficult economic climate, is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department &mdash; especially those focused on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities &mdash; are protected and to minimise overheads and ancillary costs.</P>
        <P>In advance of decisions in the context of the of the 2010 Budget it is not feasible to anticipate levels of funding available for the integrated programme for next year.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible for a range of schemes, which provide assistance, including financial assistance, to the youth services sector.  However, while not having direct responsibility for the area, my Department implements and funds some measures that have a positive impact on the provision of services and facilities for youth.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that across Government as a whole, we are taking a number of difficult decisions, but our approach is to do this in as balanced a way as possible. We will do what we can regarding youth services funding within the broader public policy and forthcoming 2010 budgetary context.</P>

	<P>I am advised that a community facilitator is employed by MFG one day a week in the Na D&eacute;ise area. This position is currently funded through the Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007-2013. The continuation or otherwise of this post is purely a matter for MFG within their existing resources.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>The language facilitator post referred to by the Deputy was established as part of a pilot scheme in a number of Gaeltacht areas to support the language planning process. This pilot scheme &mdash; including the Na D&eacute;ise project &mdash; will conclude at the end of 2009 as intended. As the Deputy will be aware, the preparation of a 20 year strategy for the Irish language is in hands at present and plans for the further development of language planning supports in the Gaeltacht will be addressed in that context.</P>

Total assistance approved in respect of these projects amounts to &euro;2.86 million, of which &euro;150,569 has been paid to date.

	<P>My Department has been conducting a comprehensive review of the arrangements underpinning the operation of the Scheme of Community Support for Older People.  In line with previous commitments, the review has been completed and a draft report is being prepared and will be circulated in due course.</P>
        <P>The revised scheme will not be launched until early 2010 therefore no funding has been issued to any group under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>Pending consideration of the review and the putting in place of revised arrangements for 2010, I agreed to lift the suspension of the old scheme.  Applications are currently being processed and hereunder is information concerning community groups successful in County Cork to date. I expect to announce further successful applications in the coming weeks.</P>

        <P>The Deputy should note that, with regard to 2009, the original current funding sum allocated to the LDTFs following the April 2009 Budget was &euro;22.3m. When carryover from 2008 is taken into account, the net amount required in 2009 is estimated to be &euro;21.8m.</P>
        <P>In terms of staffing levels, the Deputy should note that each Task Force has a staffing compliment of three &mdash; a co-ordinator, a development worker and an administrative assistant.</P>
        <P>In terms of staffing in the various projects supported through the Task Forces, the details are outlined in the following table. Incremental funding over recent years has facilitated increased staffing &mdash; full and part time &mdash; for (i) the strengthening of existing Task Force and Emerging Needs Fund projects in the LDTF areas and (ii) new initiatives and responses to address cocaine misuse and measures to support rehabilitation. These measures are recognised by Government as supporting communities to help address the harm caused by problem drug use.</P>

        <Quest> the basis on which it is estimated that &euro;21,000 is the average cost in welfare payments and lost taxes for every person who loses his or her job and signs on the live register; the secondary benefits that are included in reaching this estimate; and if the cost of redundancy payments has been factored into this estimate. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Earlier this year, my Department estimated that the additional cost in social welfare payments of each 1,000 on the live register (LR) amounted to approximately &euro;12.95 million in respect of jobseekers payments and secondary benefits. The Department of Finance estimated that lost tax revenue amounted to around &euro;8 million in a full year for each 1,000 losing employment. Combined these estimates amounted to &euro;20.95 million giving the basis for the figure of &euro;21,000 per person mentioned in the question.</P>
        <P>The cost of increased jobseekers payments was based on the estimated average cost of each 1,000 additional claimants of jobseekers benefit (JB) and jobseekers allowance (JA) in 2008. As part of this exercise, the predicted average live register figure for the year was adjusted to include those eligible for JA or JB but who are not recorded on the LR such as systematic short-term workers, those over 65 years of age and the formerly self employed. People signing on the live register for social insurance credits only were deducted and some provision was also made for the estimated average number of claims which are not likely to be in payment during the year because they are pending a decision.</P>
        <P>The secondary benefits which were included in the estimate were Supplementary Welfare Allowance Basic Payments, Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplements, Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments and Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance. Where the data were not available, the cost was based on the percentage of recipients receiving these secondary benefits who were in receipt of a jobseekers payment. Insolvency and redundancy payments were not included in the estimate.</P>
        <P>The cost of rising unemployment on social welfare expenditure is influenced by the composition of the live register. The actual impact at any one time depends on the particular circumstances of the individuals concerned such as whether the claimant is married or single, has children or not, is fully unemployed or on reduced working hours, their social insurance contribution history or any other income or means that they may have. Over time the average cost will change reflecting the changing dynamic of unemployment.</P>
        <P>The situation in relation to tax revenues is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>Since its introduction, the underlying objective of the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme has been to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market. It is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for participation, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department&rsquo;s facilitator programme. People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>If a person exhausts their entitlement to jobseekers benefit and if they do not qualify for jobseekers allowance which is means tested, they may be entitled to sign for credited contributions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person signing on for credits is eligible to participate in the BTEA scheme provided the relevant qualifying conditions are fulfilled. The qualifying conditions relate to the primary scheme for which an entitlement to credits is established. Persons signing on for credits do not receive a weekly payment but they can avail of the cost of education allowance. This is a once off payment of &euro;500 at the start of each academic year.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that the back to education scheme has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers. The conditions of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Community Welfare Service (CWS) administers the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA), which includes rent supplement on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. In February 2006 the Government decided that the (CWS) would transfer to this Department. Provision has been made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Acts 2007 and 2008 for the transfer of the administration of the SWA scheme from the HSE to the Department. These provisions are subject to a Commencement Order.</P>
        <P>A considerable amount of preparatory work, to allow for the transfer, has been completed but progress has been stalled due to industrial relations issues. Following consultation between the Department and the Health Sector Management the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) <Col N="422"/>was asked to intervene. A meeting of the parties took place on 22 September in the LRC and further meetings have taken place in October. The management side&rsquo;s intention is to reach a collective agreement with the unions as soon as is practical so that the transfer can be implemented as early as possible in 2010. Discussions have also taken place with the unions representing the staff in the Department in relation to the transfer proposal.</P>
        <P>There are no plans for a specific review of the rent supplement scheme, when the administration of the SWA scheme transfers to the Department. However, the operation of the rent supplement scheme will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>With regard to anti-social behaviour, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant and tenant behaviour in private rented accommodation is a matter for the landlord in the first instance. There is a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the Courts in relation to enforcement of the law in relation to anti-social behaviour. If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if effected, would result in the termination of rent supplement. There are no plans to make changes to the social welfare legislation in this regard.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the assessment of means for the purposes of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  In assessing means for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property (except a person&rsquo;s family home). Cash income may be derived from a wide variety of sources including earnings from employment, income from self-employment including farming, income from foreign social security pensions and income from occupational pensions. Means are assessed according to different formulae, depending on their source.  Legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to give a definitive answer in relation to payments received by amateur soccer referees without knowing the specific details of such payments.  However, normal out of pocket expenses in respect of travelling and/or meal allowances would not be assessable as means.</P>

	<P>The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72. The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  This is achieved primarily by setting out rules as to which State&rsquo;s social security system a person will pay contributions to when, for example, they move from one Member State to another to take up work, or where they live in one State and work in another. In addition, the Regulations also set out rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, e.g. sickness, unemployment, old-age etc.</P>
        <P>The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which they work. Equally, the State of employment has, in general, responsibility for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes incapacitated.  Accordingly, a person who last worked in Ireland and who meets the qualifying conditions for Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit may continue to receive that benefit in accordance with Irish legislation regardless of which Member State the person is residing or staying in.  Invalidity Pension may also be payable to foreign nationals resident outside the State, provided that they meet the relevant qualifying conditions, in line with the terms of bilateral social security agreements in place between Ireland and a number of other non-EU countries. </P>

	<P>The position remains, as advised in question number 253, which I answered for the Deputy on 14 October 2009. A community welfare officer issued a letter to the person concerned on 17 September 2009, seeking documentary evidence in relation to a number of matters, including details of the lease on her rented property and her financial position.  The Executive has advised that it has not received any additional supporting documentation from the person concerned since the date of issue of the letter. </P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the number of instances in which applications for domiciliary care allowance have been refused on medical grounds in respect of children with dyspraxia, autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months. </P>
        <P>Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.</P>
        <P>In the period 1st April 2009 to 9th October 2009 a total of 2430 applications have been received in the required format of which 1688 cases have been fully processed by the Department. Of these applications, 633 were awarded while 1055 were deemed not to be eligible for <Col N="427"/>Domiciliary Care Allowance. 742 applications are currently pending.  Of the processed applications, at the beginning of September, 62 have a medical condition of Dyspraxia, 7 of which have been deemed eligible; 115 applications have a medical condition of Autism/Autism Spectrum Disorder, 58 of which have been deemed eligible; and 74 have a medical condition of Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome, 18 of which have been deemed eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance.</P>
        <P>Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may seek to have the decision reviewed or they may appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The length of time it takes to process claims varies depending on the complexity of the claim, the availability of the necessary documentation from the applicant and or his/her employer. In the case of jobseekers allowance, the need to carry out additional inquiries include the assessment of means and whether the claimant satisfies the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>
        <P>In the case of the Drogheda office and Ardee Branch Office it is acknowledged that processing times are too long and steps are being taken to bring them back to acceptable levels.  In this regard, a range of process improvement initiatives have been put in place to deal with the increased volume of claims and processing times including:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="3">An appointments and fast track service decisions service has been introduced.

        <P LI="1" el="3">Additional Social Welfare Investigative resources have been assigned for the South Louth area &mdash; to address the backlog of claims awaiting investigation and consequently improve processing times.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="3">The Regional Local Support Office Unit (LOSU) is providing dedicated staff resources for the processing of Jobseeker Benefit and Allowance claims for Drogheda Local Office and Ardee Branch Office to address the issue of claims pending decisions and processing times.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="3">A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to Jobseekers Allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires has been introduced.</P>

In this context, the decision was made that the Christmas Bonus would not be paid in 2009. The decision was announced in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget. The payment of a 100% Christmas bonus in 2009 would cost an estimated &euro;223 million while the overall number of recipients affected is estimated to be 986,000.</P>

	<P>Illness Benefit (previously known as Disability Benefit) is a payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness and who satisfy certain Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) conditions. As of 23 October 2009 the number of persons in receipt of Illness Benefit was 77,552.  Illness Benefit claims are based on a first social welfare medical certificate and an application form (both included on an MC1 form).  On receipt of a second and further  medical certificates payment issues to the person.  In general, certificates are submitted on a weekly basis until the person&rsquo;s doctor declares them fit for work and they submit a final medical certificate.  People who remain ill over a long period may only be required to submit certificates at longer intervals.</P>
        <P>From time to time cases are referred for review by Medical Assessors who are medical practitioners employed by the Department. The Medical Assessor expresses an opinion regarding the claimant&rsquo;s capacity for work.  A Deciding Officer may, having reviewed all the facts of the case, decide whether to allow or disallow the claim.  If a claimant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Deciding Officer she/he may appeal it to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The Department carries out a number of other control activities including possible cases of concurrent working and claiming of Illness Benefit.  These cases can come to light in a number of ways, including notification from Revenue of commencement of employment, overlaps of employment contributions and credits, discovery of employment by Social Welfare Inspectors and reports from members of the public.  Cases of concurrent working and claiming, give rise to an overpayment and, if appropriate, are referred for prosecution.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that, following receipt of the relevant Departmental papers including comments on the grounds of appeal, the appeal from the person concerned has been referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.  As regards waiting times, I am advised that the average time taken in 2008 to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks.  However, if allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Those average processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008. </P>
        <P>There has been an increase of 32% in the number of appeals received so far this year compared to last year and, having regard to the current volume of appeals awaiting determination, <Col N="432"/>two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office earlier this year.  Furthermore, I am advised that the Chief Appeals Officer is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals having regard to due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 844, 850 and 851 together.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The Department provides details of all current rent supplement recipients and landlords to the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a quarterly basis, with a view to assisting local authorities with a range of housing issues, including the transfer of rent supplement recipients to the Rental Accommodation Scheme and inspections of standards for private rented houses.</P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). The Department is working closely with the PRTB to ensure that all tenancies where rent supplement is in payment are registered with the PRTB.  To that end, the Department provides details of new rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary. The most recent data file was transferred by the Department to the PRTB on 14 October 2009 and included new rent supplement claims up to end September 2009. The next data file is due for transfer in January 2010.</P>
        <P>Landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) within one month from the start date of the tenancy or at a later date on payment of an increased fee.  For this reason, it is not practicable for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered with the PRTB before payment of rent supplement can be made.  There are also instances where a rent supplemented tenancy need not be registered with the <Col N="433"/>PRTB, for example, in the case of renting a room in a house or where a premises is owner occupied.</P>
        <P>Rent supplemented tenancies which are liable for registration with the PRTB, should be so registered. In that regard, the close working arrangements which the Department has with the PRTB should ensure that, over time, all tenancies that come with the area of rent supplementation comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.</P>

	<P>An Post provide an agency service for the Department for the delivery of payments to customers.  The transaction fees paid to An Post are based on a four point matrix.  In March 2007 the Department of Finance sanctioned an increase based on the Consumer Price Index in respect of the period 2003 to 2006.  The current scale of fees is as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />First 35 million transactions &euro;1.46</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Next 5 million &euro;1.03</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Next 5 million &euro;0.66</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Each additional transaction &euro;0.49.</P>
        <P>In 2008 An Post were paid &euro;53.5 million based on transaction volumes of some 37,300,000.  In 2009 An Post will receive approximately &euro;52m based on transaction volumes of some 35,800,000.  The agency fee payable to An Post in any given year is calculated on the basis of transaction numbers incurred two years previously.  In 2009 An Post received an arrears payment of &euro;3.9m in respect of 2007.  An Post also provide postal services for the Department which includes a delivery and collection service at all the Department&rsquo;s headquarter and local offices on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>In 2008 some &euro;10.5 million was paid to An Post in respect of postal services and postage costs.   It is anticipated that postal service costs in 2009 will be in the order of &euro;10.8 million.   The breakdown of postage expenditure to end September 2009 is as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Bulk Mail (Cead&uacute;nas mail only) 5.226m</P>

	<P>The application for a refund of PRSI was received from the person concerned on 1 September 2009 as he continued to pay PRSI at the full rate after reaching 66 years of age in 2006.  The volume of applications for refunds of PRSI has increased dramatically in recent years.  For example in the first ten months of 2009 some 17,600 applications have been received.  This compares with 14,000 in 2008 and 9,000 in 2007.  The increased volume of applications has inevitably given rise to a backlog in processing refund applications which currently stands at about eight months.</P>
        <P>The Department endeavours to process applications for refunds of PRSI as efficiently as possible.  To address the current volume of applications received a review of the processes and procedures is underway in the area.  The technical supports currently provided are also being reviewed with a view to making better use of modern technology e.g. payment of refunds by electronic fund transfer, online applications, enhancement of the current calculation functionality etc.  When the reviews are completed and the recommendations implemented I am confident that significant improvements will be made in the processing of applications for refunds.</P>

        <Quest> the procedures and checks carried out by her Department to ensure that a person who is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is not working at the same time; and the conditions whereby jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is awarded to a person who voluntarily leaves paid employment. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>When a person makes a claim for jobseekers&rsquo; payment they sign a declaration stating among other things that they are <Col N="435"/>unemployed, available for work and unable to find suitable work.  On an on-going basis throughout their claim they will sign a similar declaration to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes. The majority of claimants do this on a monthly basis.</P>
        <P>During the life of the claim a number of checks and reviews are carried out to ensure compliance with scheme conditions.  This year over 100,000 jobseeker claims have been reviewed up to the end of September.</P>
        <P>When a person commences or recommences employment the Department receives data from Revenue which is compared with the jobseekers&rsquo; files to determine whether any claimant has continued to claim a jobseekers&rsquo; payment beyond the date of employment.  Where such cases are identified, the customer will be contacted and any overpayment will be assessed.</P>
        <P>Within the Department there is a Special Investigation Unit (SIU) comprising some 88 inspectors who are engaged on a full-time basis on work related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  After a period of 3 months on the Live Register, all claimants are referred for interview with a F&Aacute;S Placement Officer under the Employment Action Plan (EAP) process. Those referred will be offered any appropriate training or work opportunities. Those who do not engage with the process are subject to interview in the local office at which time their entitlement to continued payment is reviewed.</P>
        <P>There are over 82,000 claimants on a reduced working week who are entitled to receive a jobseekers&rsquo; payment for the days that they are not working.  Furthermore where a person is self-employed and claiming a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment, they can get a payment for a full week, provided any income from their self-employment has been assessed as means.  A person who voluntarily leaves work may be disqualified for receiving jobseekers&rsquo; allowance, for up to 9 weeks from date of leaving employment, if they have left the employment without good cause.</P>
        <P>Factors that may be taken into account by a deciding officer in deciding whether to impose a disqualification include the circumstances surrounding any changes in working conditions; the financial situation of the firm; whether leaving the employment may have amounted to constructive dismissal (i.e. the person left the employment following harassment/abuse from the employer). The claimant would also have to show that they were making genuine efforts to find alternative employment.</P>

The detail requested is not available for the Dublin city area. Information in relation to the number of rent supplement recipients who are also on the local government or voluntary housing lists is available from the local authorities.</P><Col N="437"/>
        <P>The 2009 Supplementary Budget introduced new arrangements for applications for rent supplement. In order to qualify for rent supplement, from the 27th July 2009, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</P>
        <P>In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside). Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.</P>
        <P>The aim of this restriction on entitlement to rent supplement and the new working arrangements is to ensure that housing authorities remain the principal agents both for assessing housing need and for meeting the long-term housing needs of people.</P>
        <P>Details of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more are notified regularly by the Department to local authorities who operate the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support. </P>

	<P>Rent supplement is intended as a short-term income support to eligible tenants whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs. There are currently 91,600 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 23% since the end of December 2008.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions. Maximum rent limits are prescribed in regulations and are time limited so that they can be adjusted in the light of rent levels generally.</P>
        <P>Rent limits were reviewed earlier this year. In testing the level at which basic accommodation can be secured, the Department was informed by analysis of a number of data sources including data published by the CSO on trends in the private rental market. Rent limits and payments <Col N="438"/>to existing rent supplement recipients were reduced to reflect the downward trends in the private rental market. The minimum weekly contribution that individuals make towards their rent under the rent supplement scheme was also increased to align more closely with the rents that local authority tenants have to pay.</P>
        <P>The fact that there are 91,600 people receiving rent supplement indicates that the scheme is effective in meeting the needs of those who require support towards the cost of private rented accommodation. The operation of the rent supplement scheme is monitored on an ongoing basis and rent limits are reviewed in the light of trends in the private rental market. A review of rent limits includes an assessment of the impact of recent changes made to the rent supplement scheme and take account of the views of interested parties, including voluntary agencies working in the housing area. It is essential to ensure that state support for rent supplemented tenants, who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices with particular negative impact on those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low paid employment.</P>
        <P>The Department will also continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 857 to 860, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Illness Benefit is a payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness and who satisfy certain Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) conditions. Customers who have been in receipt of Illness Benefit for at least six months may apply for permission to work part-time (not more than 20 hours per week) or to participate in a Community Employment (C.E.) or F&Aacute;S training course. This permission is known as an &ldquo;exemption&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The aim of allowing people in receipt of Illness Benefit to return to part-time work or training and retain their Illness Benefit payment is for rehabilitative and occupational therapy <Col N="439"/>purposes. The objective is that this will enable them, subsequently, to return to the workplace on a full-time basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A customer applies for an exemption by completing an application form and providing a report from their doctor. In general, these are sent to one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors for consideration. In examining exemption applications the Medical Assessor considers the nature of the particular illness/injury, treatment to date and prognosis. They assess the nature of the proposed employment or training and consider both whether the work or training is appropriate in light of the person&rsquo;s incapacity and how, in light of rehabilitation/occupational therapy, it would progress a return to full-time work. In some cases the customer may be required to attend a medical assessment by a Medical Assessor.</P>
        <P>Approval for an exemption is provided for a given period which, in cases of part-time employment can be six or twelve months and in cases of CE schemes or F&Aacute;S courses is the duration of the course. If the employment or training is to continue beyond the period of the initial approval the person&rsquo;s continuing suitability for an exemption is reviewed. At each review of a person&rsquo;s exemption, the progress of the rehabilitation and occupational therapy is considered by a Medical Assessor of the Department. This process takes into account the customer&rsquo;s observations on how the exemption is facilitating their return to full-time work at some point in the future.  A determination is then made as to whether an extension is appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Illness Benefit exemptions process is administrative in nature which means that decisions on new applications or further extensions of the exemption cannot be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. However, if a customer is dissatisfied with a decision on their application or their request for an extension they can request a review which involves referring the case to the Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Adviser for his consideration. The person has the opportunity at that stage to provide any additional medical evidence or other documents in support of their case.</P>
        <P>Exemptions are approved to help improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to full-time employment. When a point is reached at which it is considered that the rehabilitative and occupational therapy benefits of the work or training have been exhausted their entitlement to an exemption ceases.</P>

	<P>The programme for government contains a commitment to continue to support low-income farmers through the Farm Assist Scheme and adapt it in consultation with the relevant farming organisations.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, REPS 4, was closed to new entrants in July of this year.  However, under the Rural Development Programme, a new agri-environment measure will be introduced and individuals who have been affected by the closure of REPS 4 can apply for this new scheme.</P>
        <P>It would be prudent to examine the effects of these new arrangements prior to consideration of any substantive changes to the Farm Assist Scheme. In due course, consideration of any changes to the scheme would take place in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE). The Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest is defined in Section 187 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended). In accordance with this provision, a mortgage interest supplement may be paid on the full amount of interest payable, where the loan has been taken out for the purchase, repair or essential improvement of the sole or main residence of a person or to pay off another loan used for that purpose. Where a loan, or a portion of the loan, has been used for expenditure not associated with the purchase or repair of the sole or main residence of the person, a proportion or all of the interest on the loan is not reckonable for the purpose of mortgage interest supplement scheme.</P>
        <P>Under Article 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Allowance ) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 412 of 2007), a supplement towards mortgage interest may be payable where the Executive is satisfied that the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as it considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs and where the Executive considers it is reasonable to award a supplement having regard to the amount of any arrears outstanding on the loan.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>The Executive has advised that mortgage interest supplement has been refused to the people concerned as the qualifying conditions, as outlined above, are not satisfied. Notification of this decision issued on 7 October 2009.</P>
        <P>This parliamentary question has been accepted as an appeal against the decision to refuse mortgage interest supplement to the person concerned and notification of the appeal has been forwarded to a designated Appeals Officer of the HSE. The person concerned will be contacted by the Appeals Officer and requested to outline in writing the specific grounds of his appeal.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> her views on introducing a requirement on parents to collect their monthly child benefit payment in person each month instead of by electronic transfer; and if she will conduct a cost benefit analysis to ascertain if a significant saving could be achieved in fraud prevention over and above the extra costs associated with administering such a system. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38618/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is to provide the widest possible range of payment options to customers. Of circa 600,000 Child Benefit customers, 60% are currently being paid by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) and 40% by card-based Electronic Information Transfer (EIT).  EFT is highly cost effective in terms of encashment costs, and over 80% of new claimants currently opt for this payment method.</P>
        <P>The control policy for the Child Benefit scheme is continually reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.  These include the issue, on a quarterly basis, of certificates to sub-sets of customers for completion and return to the Department to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of Child Benefit.</P>
        <P>In the case of non-Irish national recipients who are resident in Ireland with their children, certification is requested that the children continue to reside here &mdash; the proof of such residence can be provided via details of the school or college their child attends or, if the child is not of school-going age,  details of the doctor or cr&egrave;che they attend.  In the case of EU nationals who are working in Ireland but who have qualified children living in another EU state, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.</P>
        <P>Certificates are issued on a quarterly basis to all customers who qualify for Child Benefit on the basis of employment or residency.  Some 80,000 certificates were issued in 2008 and it is <Col N="442"/>estimated that a total of 315,000 will have issued by the end of 2009.  Savings in 2008 arising from this exercise were just under &euro;27m.  In 2009 to date, savings total &euro;58m and are expected to be in the region of &euro;80m by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>It is evident from mailshots issued down the years that EFT does not pose a significant risk in respect of the generality of claimants.  The most recent of these was a mailshot issued to 80,000 mainly Irish-national customers regarding the Early Childcare Supplement scheme.  A further mailshot issued to 1,500 Irish customers who had not cashed their child benefit payment within the six month period allowed.  The level of non-compliance with these mailshots has to date been extremely low &mdash; and confirms the findings of a previous Fraud and Error survey.  Both of these mailshot projects will conclude in November &mdash; when the outcome will inform the nature of further control initiatives.</P>
        <P>At this time, I am satisfied that a requirement on parents to collect their monthly Child Benefit payment in person each month &mdash; instead of by electronic transfer &mdash; is not warranted.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned has been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in the case.  The person concerned will be notified when the necessary arrangements have been made.</P>
        <P>As regards waiting times, I am advised that the average time taken in 2008 to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks.  However, if allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Those average processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008.</P>
        <P>There has been an increase of 41% in the number of appeals received so far this year compared to last year and, having regard to the current volume of appeals awaiting determination, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office earlier this year.  Furthermore, I am advised that the Chief Appeals Officer is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals having regard to due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

	<P>Payment of illness benefit to the person concerned was discontinued following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  An appeal was opened and in the context of that appeal, his case was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  A claim for disability allowance was also disallowed following two medical assessments.</P>
        <P>Both of these decisions are now under appeal and I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that following receipt of the grounds of appeal the relevant Departmental papers and comments of the Department have been sought.  On receipt of its response both cases will be referred to an Appeals Officer for early consideration.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, which is payable for a maximum of 312 days.  As this payment is due to exhaust shortly a form was issued on 4 August 2009 advising him regarding Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  This form has not been returned to date.  If the person concerned wishes to apply for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance he should return the completed form to the Social Welfare Local Office, Hanover Street, Cork.</P>

        <P>Under the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004, where the parents are not married to each other at the time of the birth, the father&rsquo;s particulars can be registered if the parents make a joint application to do so, or if either makes an application, accompanied by a statutory declaration from the other parent, naming the father, or if either parent makes an application accompanied by a court order naming the father.</P>
        <P>Where a father&rsquo;s details are not registered initially, the parents may re-register the birth to add his details.  The procedures for such re-registrations are similar to those for registrations.  Also, if the parents marry each other following the birth, they are legally obliged to re-register the birth, under the provisions of section 24 of the Act.</P>
        <P>I believe that, in his question, the Deputy is referring to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 9.3).  The status of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in Irish law is that Ireland ratified the UNCRC without reservation on 21 September 1992.  The Convention entered into force for Ireland on 21 October 1992.  Ireland signed the European Convention on the Exercise of Children&rsquo;s Rights in 1996 and proposes to ratify the European Convention as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Similar to other common law countries, Ireland has a &lsquo;dualist&rsquo; system under which international agreements, to which Ireland becomes a party, are not automatically incorporated into domestic law, under the following Constitutional provisions:</P>
        <P el="5"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Article 29.3 of the Constitution of Ireland states: &lsquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.&rsquo;</i></P>
      <P el="5"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Article 29.6 of the Constitution of Ireland provides: &lsquo;No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.&rsquo;</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These Constitutional provisions have been interpreted as precluding the Irish courts from giving effect to an international agreement if it is contrary to domestic law or grants rights or imposes obligations additional to those of domestic law.  Consequently, whereas Ireland has ratified the UNCRC, the Convention did not thereby automatically become part of Irish law.</P>
        <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs has strongly recommended that it should be made compulsory for the father&rsquo;s name to be registered on a child&rsquo;s birth certificate (First Report &mdash; October 2009).</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission (LRC) recently issued a discussion document on Legal Aspects of Family Relationships, which included the issue of the registration of the father&rsquo;s particulars.  They have invited submissions from interested parties and will, in due course, issue recommendations in a further report.  Any recommendation in relation to the compulsory registration of the father&rsquo;s details on a birth record will be of considerable significance and will be seriously considered, especially in light of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance on 31 March 2009.  One of the conditions for receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is that the person must satisfy the means test.  The person concerned refused to disclose his means and provide sufficient proof of his residence.  Accordingly, his application was disallowed.  He was notified of this decision on 23 September 2009 and of his right of Appeal.   To date no notice of appeal has been received by the Department.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 is responsible, inter alia, for ensuring that employers and self employed people comply with the Act in relation to Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.  Employer compliance, in this regard, is monitored through inspections which include detailed examinations of employers&rsquo; records to ensure that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all employees. These officers carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations as well as investigating cases where fraud or abuses of the schemes are suspected.  In addition to the general inspectorate, the Department has a Special Investigation Unit (SIU), comprising some 88 Inspectors working full-time to combat fraud and abuse, they also undertake employer inspections to ensure compliance with their PRSI obligations.  In 1986 a Joint Inspection Unit (JIU), drawn from inspectors from both the SIU and the Revenue Commissioners was established.  This co-ordinated approach, combining the powers of both agencies, monitors compliance with both the PRSI and taxation systems.</P>

Of these terminated claims, 85% &mdash; some 4,370 &mdash; remain stopped. The 15% (c 770 claims) which were ultimately restored would mainly have been as a result of the customer advising the Department of a new address and satisfactorily verifying the family&rsquo;s residency in Ireland.

	<P>Social Welfare Local and Branch Offices have dealt with very significant increases in the number of persons registering as unemployed. As of 23 October 2009 the number of persons signing on the Live Register for <Col N="449"/>Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth is 7,018, 6,035 and 16,399 respectively.  Details of each centre that persons sign on for Jobseeker payments are set out in the tabular format.  </P>
        <P>Having regard to the offices concerned, Cavan, Drogheda and Dundalk are Social Welfare Local Offices where accommodation and facilities are a matter for the Department and the Office of Public Works. In the case of Dundalk local office this is a relatively new office with adequate facilities to deal with all service delivery requirements. In the case of Cavan Local Office the office has with effect from 27 October moved to enhanced facilities in Cavan town that meet all service requirements. Renovations are scheduled to take place and be completed in Drogheda Local Office before the end of 2009 which again will lead to enhanced facilities and meet service requirements. In the case of Monagahan, Carrickmacross, Clones, Castleblaney, Ballyconnell and Ardee these are Branch Offices of the Department and are operated on a contract basis. Within the terms of these contracts is the specific requirement to provide adequate staffing and suitable accommodation to enable the transaction of social welfare services including certification for Jobseeker payments. Under the terms and conditions of these contracts the Department regularly reviews the arrangements for delivering services in the area served by Branch Offices.  The Department will continue to actively review its service arrangements with these Branch offices and makes changes it considers necessary in that regard.</P>
        <P>Under the existing arrangements persons are only required to sign once a month to certify themselves as unemployed at Branch Offices.</P>

	<P>The state pension (contributory) is one of a number of social welfare schemes based upon social insurance. Payments based on social insurance contributions are funded through pay-related contributions to the social insurance fund by employers, employees and the self-employed with subvention, where necessary, by the State. In the case of contributory pensions, payment is made on reaching pension age provided the qualifying conditions, which include having paid a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate, have been met. The state pension (non-contributory) is a means-tested payment funded entirely by taxation.   There are no plans to means test the state pension (contributory). </P>

	<P>Domiciliary Care Allowance is payable in respect of children under 16 years of age who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months. </P>
        <P>Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. Each application is considered by a Departmental Medical Assessor on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.</P>
        <P>In addition to the medical criteria for the scheme there are a number of other qualifying conditions relating to, the provision of care, the residency of the child and the residency of the person making the claim.</P>
        <P>Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may seek to have the decision reviewed or they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are, currently, just over 14,000 appeals awaiting processing by that office and that, during 2008, the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Those processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact that there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008.  I am advised that there has been a further increase of 41% in the number of appeals received to date this year over the corresponding period in 2008 and, while average processing times for 2009 are not yet available, I am concerned they will have deteriorated when compared to the 2008 position.</P>
        <P>The number of staff employed in the Social Welfare Appeals Office is, as outlined in the Annual Report of the Chief Appeals Officer, 59.  These comprise the Chief Appeals Officer, the Deputy Chief Appeals Officer, 17 Appeals Officers and 40 administrative staff.</P><Col N="454"/>
        <P>Two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office earlier this year in recognition of the increased workload in the office.</P>
        <P>The number of appeals processed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office during the last five years is as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">2004 &mdash;  14,089</P>
       <P el="5">2005  &mdash; 13,419</P>

       <P el="5">2007 &mdash; 13,845</P>
         <P el="5">2008  &mdash; 15,724</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Improving processing times and introducing efficiencies remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, however, it is necessary at all times, given the quasi-judicial nature of the appeals process, to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

        <Quest> if it is the case that between 1999 and 2009 the number of persons on disability allowance has increased from 45,000 to 110,000; the reason that in just ten years there has been such an increase; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The numbers in receipt of Disability Allowance have increased from 50,431 at the end of 1999 to some 98,898 at the end of September 2009.  A review of the Disability Allowance scheme, currently underway, has sought to identify the causes for this increase. While that review has not been finalised, the evidence suggests that the increase in the numbers claiming Disability Allowance is attributable to a range of factors.  These factors include demographic changes; progressive amendments to the means-testing arrangements for the scheme; the extension of entitlement to Disability Allowance to persons resident full-time in institutions; and migration from other welfare schemes. It is likely also that changes in the medical sphere such as, for instance, improved diagnoses will have played a role in the increase in numbers availing of the scheme.</P>
        <P>While any increase in the numbers having recourse to welfare supports is a matter for concern, it is important to recognise that the Disability Allowance scheme is designed to meet the income maintenance needs of people who are ill and people with disabilities and their dependents in ways that recognise their diverse needs, by way both of providing income supports and encouraging and enabling the take-up of employment, training, education and other self development opportunities, where appropriate.</P>

	<P>The publication of the booklet SW124 &mdash; &ldquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rdquo; &mdash; clarified existing procedures in relation to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes. It did not involve a change in existing policy or administration and applicants for the state pension (contributory) still have to satisfy the eligibility conditions as contained in legislation.  There are 37 cases with decisions pending at present and the Department will notify customers of their pension entitlements as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I have not received any correspondence or representations in relation to the colour of wind turbines.  On the particular issue of Wind Farm development, my Department issued Wind Energy Development Guidelines in June 2006. A copy of the Guidelines is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie. The Guidelines offer advice to planning authorities, developers and the wider public on planning for wind energy through the development plan process and in determining applications for planning permission, including the colour of wind turbines. The Guidelines do not preclude the use of a colour other than white for a wind turbine.  It is a matter for each planning authority to assess an application for a wind turbine on its own merits in accordance with the Development Plan and according to site specific conditions.</P>

	<P>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed by regulations made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. In the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016, the Government committed to updating and more effectively enforcing the minimum standards regulations and delivered on this commitment by approving a package of measures last year.</P><Col N="461"/>
        <P>Those elements of the package not requiring primary legislation were introduced through new regulations to update the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993. The new regulations, entitled the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, were made by me on 10 December 2008 and notice of the making of these Regulations was published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 16 December 2008.  Copies of the Regulations are available in the Oireachtas library and on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>Copies of the Regulations were also provided to various sectoral interests, including landlord and tenant representative bodies.  In addition, the coming into effect of the Regulations was advertised in the print media on Monday 26 January 2009.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000, or a term of 6 months in prison or both, and &euro;250 for each day of a continuing offence. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</P>
        <P>The remaining elements of the above-mentioned package of measures required amendments of primary legislation and these are addressed in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  These include increased penalties for non-compliance and the introduction of a more robust sanctions regime. The relevant provisions will be commenced as soon as possible and notice of their coming into effect will be advertised in the print media and on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>There is no provision under the current affordable housing schemes for upgrading to a larger affordable home.  However, as is the case with all forms of private housing, an owner of an affordable home wishing to trade up may sell their existing house and purchase a larger dwelling in the market, subject of course to the repayment of the appropriate clawback.</P>
        <P>While first-time buyers are a particular target group for affordable housing, current legislation provides that previous ownership of a house does not render an applicant ineligible for an affordable house and, therefore, a person may apply again for affordable housing.  It will, of course, be a matter for the local authority concerned to consider the priority to be given to that individual&rsquo;s application for further affordable housing having regard to their needs and the needs of those currently on the authority&rsquo;s affordable housing list awaiting their first homes.</P>

        <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 158, 265 and 290 of 14 October 2009.</P>
        <P>The Nitrates Directive and Ireland&rsquo;s National Nitrates Action Programme are given legal effect by the consolidated European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2009. The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.</P>
        <P>Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of organic fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters. In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast.</P>
        <P>In view of the prolonged period of favourable weather that prevailed prior to the deadlines, the risk to water quality posed by an extension to the periods for land spreading and the major investment on the part of the State and farmers in the provision of adequate waste storage facilities in recent years, the question of an extension to the periods for spreading organic fertilisers does not arise.</P>

	<P>Construction and demolition (C&amp;D) material would be regarded as a waste if the holder discards or intends or is required to discard it, e.g. in the context of construction or development activity. However, there are circumstances where the material might not be considered a waste, having regard to this concept of discard. The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste, i.e. the natural or legal person in possession of the waste, or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Acts 1996 &mdash; 2008 impose a general duty of care on holders of waste.  A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. A person transferring control of the waste should ensure that the person taking the waste is authorised under the waste management legislation to undertake the collection, recovery or disposal of the waste in question.  If a person wishes to recover or dispose of waste from a construction site on private land they will require either a waste licence from the EPA or a waste permit or certificate of registration from the local authority in whose functional area the proposed recovery/disposal is to take place.  The nature of the proposed activity (recovery or disposal), the type of waste and the quantity of waste will determine the type of authorisation, which will apply.</P>
        <P>The Office of Environmental Enforcement issued guidance &mdash; Aspects of Construction and Demolition Waste Regulation &mdash; in December 2008, which provides guidance on the legal framework covering the recovery or disposal of construction and demolition wastes in Ireland. It is directed at regulators and persons undertaking site activities such as site owners, developers and C&amp;D companies. It provides guidance on determining whether a material arising from a C&amp;D activity is waste or not, the type of authorisation that applies and the classification of this material.</P>
        <P>Under planning legislation, planning permission is required for any development unless it is specifically exempted under the legislation.  While the interpretation of planning legislation is a matter for the planning authorities in the first instance, it is considered that the dumping of any significant amount of construction waste on land would comprise development under planning law and would therefore require planning permission.</P>
        <P>When granting permission for a development planning authorities may attach conditions requiring C&amp;D waste to be recovered or disposed of in such a manner and to such an extent as may be specified by the planning authority.  My Department&rsquo;s Development Management Guidelines for Planning Authorities advise that in dealing with the planning issues in relation to C&amp;D waste planning authorities should have regard to my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter WPR 7-06 and Best Practice Guidelines on the Preparation of Waste Management Plans for Construction and Demolition Projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As provided for in the Programme for Government, my Department initiated the major review of waste management policy foreseen in the Programme and designed to support the necessary legal, institutional and policy framework to achieve international best practice in the management of waste. This involved a comprehensive examination of a broad range of waste management issues, including in respect of regional waste management planning, regulation issues and infrastructure provision.</P>
        <P>As a first step in initiating the review a steering group was established comprising of representatives of the Department and of the other public bodies with statutory responsibility in the area of waste management and three experts who were nominees of the Minister and acting in a personal and non-representative capacity. The purpose of the steering group was to guide the progress of the review.</P>
        <P>Also, to ensure maximum stakeholder involvement a broader consultative group was established to receive periodic briefings from the consultants and were also invited to make submissions to the consultants. Stakeholders invited to nominate up to three representatives to this group included:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Environmental Protection Agency,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Competition Authority,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Irish Waste Management Association,</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />relevant academics.</P>
        <P>In order to keep costs to a minimum my Department facilitated some of the larger consultations undertaken by the consultants by providing the venue and equipment while a large number of further consultations with different stakeholders were also undertaken at other venues by the consultants.  My Department for reasons of impartiality and to insure the independence of the process had no other role in the consultation process undertaken as part of the International Review of Waste Management Policy.  I understand that the consultants sought at all times to facilitate stakeholder views and inputs to the extent possible up until the final report was delivered on 29 September 2009.  I am currently examining the report and its recommendations and I will be publishing it shortly.</P>
        <P>My Department and I hold regular consultations with a broad range of stakeholders in the context of the ongoing implementation of Government policy on waste management. Consulting widely, with a range of stakeholders, is designed to ensure that my Department and I have as full as possible an understanding of the issues and concerns of stakeholders and are therefore in a position to address them, where it is possible and appropriate to do so.  Such consultations are also useful to assist me and my Department in keeping up to date on the development of new waste management technologies.</P>

	<P>The Little Island Sewerage Scheme is included for funding in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.  The Department approved Cork County Council&rsquo;s design proposals for this scheme in May 2007 which, under devolved procedures, allowed the Council to advance the scheme to construction.  The Council has now submitted revised design proposals for this scheme to my Department and these are currently being examined.</P>
        <P>Local authorities were asked in July to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October last; these assessments will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme.  In conducting their assessments, authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over <Col N="468"/>the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  It is anticipated that the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 will be published in early 2010.</P>

        <Quest> the powers available to him under the Planning and Development Act 2000 and other Acts to investigate and remedy the failure of local authorities to carry out their duties in respect of planning matters including enforcement issues; the action he has taken or will take regarding matters brought to his attention pertaining to a lack of enforcement by Kerry County Council with regard to planning issues (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Under planning legislation, enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where terms of permission have not been met.</P>
        <P>Planning authorities have substantial powers and duties in relation to enforcement under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority&rsquo;s decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be informed.</P>
        <P>Limited powers of investigation are available under section 255 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and Section 224 of the Local Government Act.  These powers would have to be exercised in a manner consistent with the general prohibition in section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 on the Minister using any power or control in relation to any particular <Col N="469"/>case, including an enforcement matter, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</P>
        <P>It is also open to any person who considers that there is any breach of statutory duty by a planning authority to make a complaint to the Ombudsman.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>A person occupying a house under the shared ownership scheme can sell their house at any time provided he or she has bought out the local authority&rsquo;s share and has acquired full ownership of the dwelling.  Full ownership may be achieved either by purchasing, from time to time, additional shares of the authority&rsquo;s equity or a single outright purchase of its remaining equity.  The cost of purchasing an additional share or the redemption value of the outstanding share, for transactions commenced from 1 January 2003, is based on its initial cost adjusted annually to compensate for differences between the rent paid on the local authority&rsquo;s share and the interest calculated by reference to the prevailing interest rates.</P>
        <P>The scheme is structured so that, on redemption, the price of the outstanding share is not determined on the basis of a percentage of current market value, but is, rather, a function primarily of its initial capital cost.  Accordingly, the issue of an authority accepting a loss due to the current economic climate may not arise and is, in any event, not relevant to any decision to allow the sale to proceed.</P>

        <Quest> if, to provide an integrated and coordinated long-term housing strategy, he will make each local authority solely responsible for all social housing allocations, payments and supplements in their area and transfer all housing related funds currently being distributed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive to the housing department of each local authority for administration; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">Rent supplement, as provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and administered by the Health Service Executive, is an income support payment made to people living in private rented accommodation who cannot provide for the cost of their accommodation.</P>
        <P>Housing authorities are responsible for meeting housing need, in particular long term housing need, through the provision of social housing.  Housing authorities use a variety of delivery mechanisms, including the Rental Accommodation Scheme and long term leasing to meet these needs. Authorities do not make direct payments to tenants.</P>
        <P>One of the primary objectives of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was initiated in 2004, is to ensure that local authorities take responsibility for accommodating rent supplement recipients, where it is deemed that they now have a long-term housing need.  Since the scheme was initiated local authorities have transferred over 22,000 households from rent supplement to RAS or other forms of social housing.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some councils have taken persons off the housing list and will not consider them for a housing offer if they have entered into a rent accommodation scheme arrangement either with their own council or with another council, however other council are willing to house persons even if they have entered into a rent accommodation scheme arrangement; if he will review this inconsistency of policy in order that persons who enter into rent accommodation scheme arrangements will have confidence that they would still be considered for a suitable local authority tenancy that arose; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the current operation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), households who are accommodated under the scheme are entitled to remain on the housing waiting list and my Department has issued guidance on this matter to local authorities.  However, it is matter for each authority, under its Scheme of Letting Priorities, to determine a household&rsquo;s priority for housing and an authority under their scheme may re-assess a household&rsquo;s priority where their circumstances have changed.</P><Col N="473"/>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that the new Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for a broadening of the definition of social housing support to encompass not only local authority accommodation, but also voluntary/co-operative accommodation and accommodation in the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  Accordingly, once this section is commenced, households accommodated under RAS will be regarded as having had their housing need met.  In tandem with this, new procedures for the allocation of social housing support, which will also be introduced on foot of the Act, will make it easier for social housing tenants (including tenants of the Rental Accommodation Scheme) to transfer between different types of social housing.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>At its scheduled meeting on 21 October 2009 in Luxembourg, the EU Council of Environment Ministers adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions as a contribution to development of a final EU policy position for the climate change conference which will be held in Copenhagen in December.  This contribution from Environment Ministers is reflected in the conclusions subsequently adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 29 and 30 October.</P>
        <P>One of the most important outcomes from an environmental perspective is the EU agreement to an objective, in the context of the scientific advice on the level of reductions required from developed countries as a group, to reduce emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels.  This level of ambition is consistent with EU leadership on climate change and I hope it will influence other countries to embrace the objective of limiting the increase in average global temperature to no more that 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that, in the conclusions adopted by the Council, the EU has reinforced its commitment, determination and leadership in pursuit of a positive outcome at the Copenhagen conference.</P>

	<P>A breakdown of the nature conservation designations of special area of conservation, special protection area and natural heritage area on a county by county basis is provided in the table.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that, for the purpose of this exercise, designations were reconciled to an Ordnance Survey Ireland county dataset. Marine areas were excluded and area figures were rounded to the nearest whole number.  In many cases the areas of designation overlap and, <Col N="474"/>accordingly, the overall percentage of a county&rsquo;s area that is subject to designation cannot be deduced by adding the percentage figures for each designation type.</P>

	<P>The Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 were made in September 2007 to provide for an authorisation regime for local authority wastewater discharges, which is being administered by the EPA. The Regulations are intended to prevent and reduce the pollution of waters as required under the European Union Water Framework Directive.  Furthermore, the regulations are part of a range of measures to address an adverse judgement of the European Court of Justice, concerning Ireland&rsquo;s transposition and implementation of the Dangerous Substances Directive (76/464/EEC). </P>
        <P>The European Communities (Drinking Water) (No.2) Regulations 2007, which were made in June 2007, conferred new supervisory powers on the EPA and local authorities in relation to drinking water supplies in order to improve the quality of drinking water. Under these Regulations, the EPA can issue a direction to a local authority to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of public drinking water supplies.  The strengthening of the regulatory regime in 2007 was one of the key measures agreed with the European Commission in order to address <Col N="475"/>the 2002 judgement of the European Court of Justice, concerning Ireland&rsquo;s transposition and implementation of the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC).</P>
        <P>Capital funding for infrastructural works, that are required to meet the regulatory requirements of the EPA, is available from my Department under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes, as appropriate. In addition, specifically ear-marked funding from the Local Government Fund was allocated to local authorities in 2008 and 2009 to assist in meeting costs associated with monitoring of drinking water supplies and wastewater treatment, and for effluent discharge licensing.</P>

	<P>The long-term health of Ireland&rsquo;s bogs may be affected by changes in temperature and precipitation patterns brought about by climate change. While research published by the EPA in 2008: Climate Change &mdash; Refining the Impacts  for Ireland (NUIM) &mdash; and available on the EPA&rsquo;s website outlines a range of potential climate change impacts on Irish ecosystems including bogs, projected impacts on bog habitat has not been specifically modelled to date.  The above-mentioned report acknowledges the need for further research to inform policy-making.  Bogs also have a role in mitigating climate change through the sequestration and storage of carbon, and they act as a defence to predicted adverse impacts of climate change such as floods and droughts. </P>

	<P>The National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 sets out the measures on foot of which Ireland will meet its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol.  Since the publication of the Strategy, work has continued across Government Departments on the development of measures to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions.  </P>
        <P>Progress in implementing such measures, and the coordination of work across Government with respect to the climate change agenda is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  That Committee has established two inter-departmental groups to support its work.   The Senior Officials Group is tasked with addressing the challenges posed <Col N="479"/>to Ireland in achieving its greenhouse gas emission targets and informing and implementing policy in this regard, while the Technical Advisory Steering Group, which includes representatives from relevant agencies, provides the modelling expertise which underpins the analysis.  An informal Expert Advisory Panel has also been established by the Cabinet Committee to assist in the analysis of possible policy measures.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security is also important in developing cross-party consensus both on targets and on the measures required to achieve them.</P>
        <P>In the period 2008-2012, Ireland is required to meet a challenging greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol; this target is binding in international law.  In addition, by 2020, Ireland is committed under the EU climate and energy package agreed in December 2008 to achieve a 20% reduction on 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme.  This 20% target is binding in EU law, as will any adjustment to it in the light of the outcome to the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December 2009.</P>
        <P>The most recent analysis of carbon emission projections by the EPA indicates a distance to target for the Kyoto period 2008-2012 in the range of 1.3-1.8 million tonnes per annum, a reduction of around 3 million tonnes from the projections of autumn 2008.</P>
        <P>Tackling climate change is a core national priority, one which I believe needs to be underpinned by framework legislation. To this end the Government, in July, 2009, endorsed my proposal to begin drafting a Climate Change Bill.  This framework legislation will enshrine the policies and principles to reflect the core national objective of combating climate change and will also act as a driver towards achieving that objective across all sectors of society in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fire Services Act 1981 provides that it is the duty of every person having control over premises to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on the premises and to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.</P>
        <P>The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, with effect from 1 February 2009, prescribe minimum standards for rented accommodation. Article 11 sets out the requirements in respect of fire safety and requires that where the house is located in a multi-unit building, it must have a mains-wired smoke alarm. All common areas within a multi-unit building must be provided with emergency lighting linked to the fire alarm system.  Rented houses that do not form part of a multi-unit building must have either a mains-wired smoke alarm or at least two 10 year self-contained battery operated smoke alarms.</P>
        <P>The Technical Guidance Document relating to Part B of the Building Regulations on fire safety covers fire safety in buildings including fire detection and alarm systems. It requires newly constructed houses to have mains operated smoke alarms and a recent revision of Part B introduced the requirement that a heat detector be installed in the kitchen and a smoke alarm in the living room. My Department will be reviewing the Technical Guidance Document B in 2010.</P>
        <P>My Department organises an annual National Fire Safety Week in October each year, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service.  This year&rsquo;s theme was &ldquo;Working Smoke Alarms Save Lives&rdquo; and a media campaign, which includes television and radio, press, online and outdoor advertising, is in progress and will run until February 2010. The Department&rsquo;s fire safety awareness campaigns emphasise the importance of working smoke alarms, including the battery life in alarms.</P>
        <P>The Fire Services Change Programme 2005 to 2007 addressed key priority areas of change in the fire service including the development of community fire safety programmes.  The programmes include the &ldquo;Safety Team&rdquo; pack primary schools programme, which is delivered by local firefighters around the country and educates third class primary school pupils about fire safety. The Community Smoke Alarm Scheme 2007/2008 was a two year Community Fire Safety initiative, aiming to target the 20% of households in Ireland that do not have smoke alarms fitted. Local authorities, with the assistance of the voluntary sector, identified households where there were no smoke alarms and arranged for the supply and installation of two ten-year self-contained smoke alarms. The cost of these alarms was recouped to the local authorities by the Department.  A Pilot Scheme was extended to 10 local authority areas in 2006.  Up to 3,000 homes benefited under the Pilot Scheme and sufficient alarms to benefit 17,800 households were purchased by local authorities under the two year scheme.  The Scheme has been very successful and it has continued this year.</P>

	<P>The position regarding transient halting sites in the greater Dublin area is outlined in the Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs) of the relevant local authorities, which are available from those authorities. </P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual TAPs rests with individual housing authorities. My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.</P>

In August 2008, my Department issued a memorandum to all local authorities on the preparation, adoption and implementation of their TAPs for the period 2009-2013, requesting them to have regard to the need for transient sites in the preparation of their TAPs.</P>

	<P>I understand that this relates to a query raised at a meeting with Cobh Town Councillors, Passage West Town Councillors and Cork County Councillors held in Cobh Town Hall and asking whether the concrete foundations for a crematorium at Rocky Island were poured over hazardous dust waste stored on that island.  </P>
        <P>Rocky Island did not form part of the former Ispat site that transferred back to State hands from the liquidator in June 2003 and did not feature in any works undertaken by the State at Haulbowline since it reverted to State hands. My Department understands that Rocky Island was used as a secure temporary storage facility during the period in which the steel plant was in operation and also during a short period when still in the hands of the liquidator.</P>
        <P>The following material, which was properly removed and disposed of, was known to have previously been stored temporarily on Rocky Island and my Department is unaware of Rocky Island being used for the storage of any other waste materials.</P>
        <P>In 1990 the plant inadvertently melted a caesium-137 source that had been included in a consignment of scrap metal from Scotland. Residual radioactive dust in the fume extraction system was removed and bagged for disposal. For a time these bags were stored on the East Tip, prior to being removed to Rocky Island for safe storage under the auspices of the RPII. Eventually, disposal of this dust to the UK was carried out by Rolls-Royce Nuclear Engineering Services Ltd. The RPII then surveyed the Rocky Island caverns and confirmed that no external radiation levels above natural background levels were detected.</P>
        <P>Following this incident, radiation detectors were installed to monitor in-coming scrap. Over the years these detected a small number of low-level radioactive items which, if the supplier could not be identified, were also consigned to Rocky Island, from where they were finally removed in 2004 and sent to the USA for decontamination/recycling. The RPII again surveyed the caverns and found only background levels of radiation.</P>
        <P>Caster level gauges were used to control the level of liquid steel in the continuous casting moulds. At the time the plant closed in 2001 there were six of these gauges on site. These were initially dismantled and consigned to a secure area on Rocky Island. There was a requirement on the liquidator to dispose of them and they were finally removed early in 2004. Four old sources were returned to the original manufacturer in the USA and two newer sources were disposed of via the manufacturer&rsquo;s agent.</P>

	<P>The Government continues to demonstrate strong commitment to the Ballymun Regeneration Project with almost &euro;630m in Exchequer funding devoted to the project to date. While an allocation of &euro;45m was provided in 2009, it has been possible, on foot of significant progress made on the project and the reallocation of funds between programmes, to recoup some &euro;52.4m in respect of Ballymun Regeneration Limited (BRL) projects to date this year.  It is anticipated that further recoupments will be made over the remainder of the year.  In addition, further specific funding of &euro;20m was identified in Dublin City Council&rsquo;s main Social Housing allocation for 2009 to fund de-tenanting associated with its various regeneration projects including Ballymun.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising its consideration of BRL&rsquo;s recently submitted Housing Strategy, and associated documentation, with a view to ensuring the successful delivery of the programme in terms of prioritisation, scheduling, protection of public investment so far and maximising value for money from proposed public and private investments in its component parts.  This will provide a clear and robust framework for bringing the regeneration of Ballymun to completion.</P>
        <P>The development, encouragement and protection of communities is paramount in my Department&rsquo;s social housing policy.  A crucial element of this approach is our commitment to supporting the development of sustainable communities in existing local authority estates through various improvement and regeneration initiatives.  The Ballymun Regeneration Project, in particular, is focused on addressing the issues of social, educational and economic disadvantage.</P>
        <P>This holistic approach goes beyond the physical infrastructure and considers all aspects of life in the Ballymun area.  In addition to improving the fabric of Ballymun, the project has <Col N="485"/>taken a strategic approach to addressing the underlying causes of deprivation in the area, including physical decay, a lack of educational supports, community facilities, and issues of security and anti-social behaviour for which there are specific initiatives in place.</P>
        <P>Safer Ballymun is a partnership involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council, Ballymun Regeneration Ltd and local residents. This working group meets on a monthly basis, and has an action based, problem solving focus.  The group assesses, monitors and aims to control the level of anti-social activity in the area.  The Safer Ballymun Community Safety Strategy which was launched in June 2007 and is the first of its kind in Dublin, sets out a series of goals, objectives and actions to be undertaken by the agencies working in Ballymun in collaboration with local people to make Ballymun a cleaner, safer, greener place in which to live, work and visit, and addresses issues including:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Improving estate management</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reducing crime and disorder</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tackling the adverse impact of alcohol and drug abuse</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enhancing local policing</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Involving residents in decision making Safer Ballymun&rsquo;s main aim is to ensure that Ballymun becomes a safer, more pleasant place in which to live.</P>
        <P FLI="0">More generally, the matter of anti-social behaviour is the subject of new statutory provisions under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Of particular importance are the new provisions relating to anti-social behaviour in the social housing stock.  There is a new requirement, coming into operation shortly, that the elected members of each authority must adopt a strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing estates and complexes.  The strategy must set out measures to promote good estate management and co-operation with other bodies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that have a role to play in combating anti-social behaviour.  The new strategies, combined with statutory initiatives to promote consultation between the Garda&iacute; and local authorities, will help secure a multi-faceted approach to dealing with instances of anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates.</P>
        <P>The new Act also extends the definition of &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 to cover graffiti and damage to property, and to bring it more into line with the approach in recent legislation relating to behaviour orders that may be sought by the Garda&iacute;.  Furthermore, the 2009 Act applies the existing anti-social behaviour powers of housing authorities, including the power to exchange information about housing applicants or beneficiaries engaged in anti-social behaviour, to a broader range of social accommodation, including accommodation provided through rental arrangements.</P>
        <P>Criminality associated with anti-social behaviour is addressed under the Criminal Justice Acts, responsibility for which rests with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in my reply to previous questions referred to by the Deputy, the primary motivation in aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and the introduction of the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of the wild salmon stocks.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to relax the conservation measures other than where river stocks recover and it is established from the results of the scientific analysis that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted.  It should be possible, in those circumstances, to exploit the identified surplus in rivers, bays and estuaries by all methods, within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>As regards the fishery on the River Suir, if, in the future, stocks recover to the extent that there is a harvestable surplus of salmon, it should be possible to allow commercial fishing to resume, subject to quota restrictions as necessary.</P>
        <P>The allocation of licences will be provided for in the normal way under the provisions of the relevant Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, amended to provide for the inclusion of the appropriate fishing methods.  The Order would also provide that those fishermen who did not avail of the Salmon Hardship Scheme will retain priority status since they last had an opportunity to fish.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the progress and savings that have been made on reducing the energy bills of Departments and buildings through energy efficiency methods; the targets that have been set on this as a cost saving mechanism; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39202/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has set a target of achieving 20% energy efficiency savings across the economy in 2020.  Recognising the opportunity for the public sector to fulfil an exemplary role in this context, the Government has set a higher target of achieving 33% savings on energy use across this sector, in 2020.</P>
        <P>On 8 May this year I published the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) which sets out  90 actions that Government are either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets.  Importantly, the NEEAP contains a list of specific actions designed to improve the energy efficiency of the public sector, including all Government Departments.</P>
        <P>I have provided some &euro;6 million to Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) in 2009 for two new energy efficiency programmes which will assist the Public Sector, in achieving its targets, whilst demonstrating to the wider community the benefits of energy efficiency.  &euro;1 million of these funds is available for a new Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme and &euro;5 million for a new Scheme of Supports for Exemplar Energy Efficiency Projects.</P>
        <P>The Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme is designed as the main delivery mechanism for coordinating and encouraging energy efficiency actions by our public sector bodies.  It is providing free energy assessments of up to 400 public buildings in 2009.  It is providing professional advice on energy management and energy efficiency improvement measures and aims to train 150 public sector building managers this year.  SEI is also developing best practice guidance materials and facilitating specialist workshops on matters such as public street lighting, water services, and ICT.</P><Col N="487"/>
        <P Just="Left">The new Scheme of Supports for Exemplar Energy Efficiency Projects provides grants to public bodies for specific retrofit energy efficiency projects.  A similar parallel programme of the same name is available to the private sector.  To be eligible for support, projects have had to demonstrate that they are innovative, lead to significant energy savings and have high value in terms of the showcasing of savings opportunities to the wider public sector.  The scheme closed at the end of September and attracted some 49 applications from right across the public sector, including schools, Government offices, local authorities and hospitals.  For the Exchequer&rsquo;s investment of &euro;5 million in this scheme, SEI estimates that the supported projects will deliver annual energy savings of &euro;2.5 million.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the ambitious target of 33% energy savings, the Office of Public Works (OPW) piloted an energy efficiency programme in 2007 and subsequently targeted all large buildings (&lt;1000m2) throughout the State with an intensive staff energy awareness campaign (Optimising Power @ Work).  Phase 1 of the campaign is now complete and savings of approximately 12% in CO2 emissions have been achieved.  In my own Department, we have reduced our energy use and CO2 emissions in Adelaide Road by 19.9% and 16% respectively.</P>
        <P>Phase 2 of this programme will be rolled out next year to maintain these savings into the future, improving participation and ensuring further gains.  A similar programme is envisaged for smaller buildings in 2010.</P>
        <P>Lighting is a major energy consuming process in office buildings.  For this reason, the OPW has had a policy for many years of utilising energy efficient lighting solutions, wherever practicable, for all new buildings and in refits of existing buildings.  In conjunction with this, the OPW also uses either intelligent lighting controls or lighting management systems, whenever possible.  Incandescent lighting is only used in exceptional circumstances, and solely for technical reasons, where there are unavoidable circumstances.</P>
        <P>With regard to new buildings, the OPW utilises the latest design techniques including computer simulation, to ensure the most passive energy-efficient solutions possible for heating, cooling, and ventilation.  The importance of air-tightness in buildings has also been recognised, and the specification for new buildings sets out minimum performance standards, to which they must be tested.  This, combined with high standards of insulation and the energy-efficient heating systems, ensures that energy efficiency is a key element in the design of all new buildings.</P>
        <P>Regulations are currently being finalised in my Department that will include new energy efficient public procurement rules and these will be in place in the coming months.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEI&rsquo;s database of highly energy efficient products.  This database was developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme for energy efficient technologies.  It covers 29 different classes of technology, including lighting, boilers and information technology.</P>
        <P>SEI is also tasked in these regulations with producing general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the new OPW National Public Procurement Office.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the primary motivation in aligning the future management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and the introduction of the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of wild salmon stocks.  The harvest of salmon by commercial and recreational means is only permitted in those rivers that are meeting their conservation limits and which have an identified surplus.</P>
        <P>The Salmon and Trout Conservation (Prohibition on Use of Drift Nets and Other Engines) Bye-Law No. 857, 2009, prohibits drift net and other engine fishing for salmon and trout in all fishery districts including the Lismore Fishery District.  These arrangements were put in place because of the status of stocks in rivers including the Blackwater and its tributaries.</P>
        <P>I await the scientific advice on the performance of the fishery in 2009 and the status of the stocks, together with the management advice for the 2010 season.  Informed by this advice, the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations for 2010 will provide for, among other things, the quota of salmon that can be harvested by commercial and recreational fishermen, on a river by river basis, during the 2010 season.</P>
        <P>These regulations will shortly be published for public consultation in accordance with the statute.  These regulations and associated conservation bye-laws will be introduced before the commencement of the 2010 season.</P>

	<P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has launched a Micro-generation Pilot Programme, involving research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis, of micro-scale projects.  The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.  Full details of the field trials, the criteria for applications, the involvement of the different technologies and customer groups and the exact level of support can be reviewed in the grants section of the SEI website.  Forty applications have been approved to date including 22 relating to wind.</P>
        <P>In February 2009 I launched the Micro Generation programme, which is being operated by ESB Customer Supply and supported by ESB Networks.  The programme will provide up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in micro-scale projects with a financial payment for electricity exported back to the grid.</P>
        <P>The scheme will also enable two-way metering, to be installed without additional charge to the customer.  The electricity producer will be paid a price of 19 cent per kilowatt-hour, which will help to offset the start up costs.  The micro technologies in question include wind, solar and hydro as well as combined heat and power.  ESB has indicated that 92 customers had signed up for the scheme by September 2009.</P>

        <P>New terms, which apply to all exploration licences awarded after the beginning of 2007, were put into effect in the 2008 Finance Act and provide for a tax rate of up to 40% on more profitable oil or gas discoveries.  This compares to the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Approval of any RT&Eacute; superannuation pension scheme is required under Section 81 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  A scheme submitted to me under this section shall, if approved of by me with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, be carried out by RTE in accordance with its terms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">RTE submitted the 50-50 risk sharing pension scheme to me for approval at the end of Quarter 1 of this year.  As the situation stands, there are specific aspects of the scheme as currently drafted that are at variance with public sector pension policy and norms and, in light of this, my Department and the Department of Finance are not in a position to recommend final approval for the draft scheme at this time.  I can confirm however, that my Department is continuing to engage, as a matter of priority, with the Department of Finance and RTE in respect of those aspects of the scheme and every effort is being made by the three parties to ensure an early resolution of the issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The matter of reckonable service in respect of this scheme is a matter for RTE, in the first place, to consider.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Seafood Strategy Report, which outlines the challenges facing the industry, states it is clear that with an ageing population and growing concerns about health and well-being, fish will become more valued as a healthy meal option.  To that end, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) developed a range of information material outlining the health benefits of fish consumption, particularly by health professionals under the auspices of a health information programme, which have been well received.  Within the past two years alone in excess of two million information leaflets targeting consumers at every stage of life have been distributed to doctor surgeries, hospitals, health centres, dieticians and retail outlets.  In tandem with this programme, the Seafood Circle <Col N="496"/>initiative has also provided an umbrella for the home market development programme by promoting hospitality and retail businesses with high standards of seafood and service.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;879,000 was spent in 2008 to promote sales of Irish seafood.  As well as promoting Irish products at European and national trade fairs, BIM facilitated visits from European trade journalists to production regions and undertook market research to detect European consumer trends, optimal distribution channels and pricing strategies.  In order to overcome strong and increasing global competition and strengthen customer loyalty, the visibility of Irish seafood in key European markets was enhanced through a number of measures designed to build business relationships between exporters and buyers and to raise awareness of the quality commitment of Irish producers at both consumer and trade levels across Europe.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s recent initiative in transferring the seafood marketing and promotion functions from BIM to Bord Bia has helped to ensure the strengthening of seafood marketing as part of a more cohesive overall food marketing effort, while allowing BIM to focus all its energies in developing the seafood industry through its new Business Development and Innovation Division.  The combined spend on promotional and trade development of Irish seafood in 2009 from both agencies is projected at &euro;888,000.  This includes additional funding achieved through the synergy with Bord Bia to support the trade development of Irish seafood in Europe and a two year promotion plan for the Irish market.  Seafood companies have been included at all relevant trade events including Marketplace Scandinavia and ANUGA.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 draft was advertised for public consultation in October 2008 as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment.  During the consultation both the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on behalf of the Central Fisheries Board raised concerns regarding the granting of aid to projects where environmental issues arise relating to compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and sea lice control on salmon farms.  Pending resolution of these issues, the National Seafood Development Operational Programme has not yet been adopted.</P>
        <P>The delay in the launch of the National Seafood Development OP has not prevented grant aid from being provided to aquaculture developments in 2009.  The European Commission agreed to the continuation of grant aid under the previous Operational Programme 2000 to 2006 until 30 June 2009.</P>
        <P>A provision of &euro;5m was made available for aquaculture development in the Agriculture Vote for 2009 and I approved the spending of &euro;4.5m of this for aquaculture projects in both  the Border, Midlands and Western and the Southern and Eastern regions.  This support has assisted the continued development of aquaculture projects in these areas and the employment that those projects support.</P><Col N="497"/>
        <P Just="Left">DG Environment has indicated at this time that it is generally supportive of the Department&rsquo;s proposals for wild fisheries compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  However, it has recently advised that it remains concerned about the planned approach to delivering compliance for aquaculture licensing.  The most recent views of DG Environment are being examined.  My Department is maintaining close liaison with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the issues arising with a view to it being in a position to withdraw its objection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the concerns of the Central Fisheries Board, a meeting at ministerial level was held in June between my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I personally advised on the significant progress made in relation to managing sea lice levels on salmon farms and the concerns of the fishery boards were also set down.  My Department is currently preparing a report on the experience in 2009 of the implementation of the new Strategy for Improved Pest Control on Irish Salmon Farms which was put in place by Minister Coughlan in May 2008.  Following the preparation and consideration of this report, I intend to engage with Minister of State Lenihan, who has responsibility for inland fisheries, with a view to agreeing an approach that will give the necessary assurances to that Department so that it can withdraw its objection to the Operational Programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Cawley report, Steering A New Course, is the national strategic  plan for the Irish fishing industry and the wider seafood sector.  The strategy sees a much bigger role for aquaculture in meeting the increasing demand for seafood and sets down a number of recommendations for the support and development of the sector.  I am committed to addressing the current issues which are limiting the development of the sector, including addressing the backlog in the renewal of licences and also providing investment support for the sector.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Traditionally the agrifood sector was taken to encompass the primary agriculture and food processing sectors.

	<P Just="Left">In examining the output of the wider agrifood sector I would refer the Deputy in the first instance to the CSO and its website at www.cso.ie.  The CSO produces statistics across a number of sectors and from various sources that provide estimates of output from the wider agrifood sector.  I would also refer the Deputy to the publications outlined below including the methodological notes and definitions for the variables summarised below.</P>
        <P>The value of output in the primary agriculture sector is measured using the CSO estimates of Output, Input and Income in Agriculture. In 2008 the value of Goods Output at Producer Prices was &euro;5.8bn.  This was comprised as follows; Livestock, &euro;2.5bn; Livestock Products, &euro;1.7bn and Crops (including Forage), &euro;1.6bn.</P>
        <P>The value of output for the Food and Beverage and Wood Processing sectors can be sourced from the CSO Census of Industrial Production (CIP).  For 2007 (most recent data available) the value of turnover in these sectors is reported as follows in the CIP (for Industrial Enterprises): Manufacture of Food Products and Beverages; &euro;24.2bn; Manufacture of Wood and Wood Products; &euro;1.4bn.  Also for 2007 the value of gross output in these sectors is reported as follows in the CIP (for Industrial Local Units): Manufacture of Food Products and Beverages; &euro;19.9bn; Manufacture of Wood and Wood Products; &euro;1.4bn.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Food Labelling Group was established in July 2002 to examine issues surrounding food labelling following concerns raised by my Department&rsquo;s Consumer Liaison Panel.   The Group which was widely representative of the major stakeholders in the food chain, consumer interests, industry, Government Departments and Agencies presented its report to the Department in December 2002. The report is available on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>At that time the amount of consumer research in relation to the importance of origin of foodstuffs was limited and the Group recommended that specific research should be conducted to ascertain consumers&rsquo; wishes in this area.</P>

	<P>Under Article 19 (1)(a)(ii) of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order 1989, an animal cannot be moved out of a restricted herd into a slaughter premises unless at the time of its entry it is accompanied by a movement permit. Movement permits are issued at the discretion of a Veterinary Inspector or an Authorised Officer. The current arrangements are such that these permits cannot be authorised electronically.  I should point out, however, that the permits can be posted out to herd-owners, thereby obviating the need for herd-owners, to travel to the DVO.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1021 and 1028 together.</P>
        <P>At the Agriculture Council on 19 October Commissioner Fischer Boel announced that she would propose to make available an additional &euro;280 million from the 2010 budget to help the dairy sector, as an exceptional measure.  This would be possible under the new Article 186 powers which are expected to be agreed at the Agriculture Council on 19 November.  The proposed additional funding of &euro;280 million must first be agreed at the Council of Finance Ministers, also on 19 November.  When those two items are agreed the Commission will then be in a position to make proposals for implementing the funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While there are no detailed proposals yet, the Commission has indicated that the funds might be allocated as a national envelope calculated through a distribution key based on national milk production, subject to quota limits.  Based on member states&rsquo; declared dairy production in the year 2008-09, Ireland&rsquo;s share of the &euro;280 million would be approximately &euro;10.7 million.  There will be discretion for member states in the allocation of the funds but the Commission has suggested that they should be distributed on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria.</P><Col N="502"/>

	<P>Following a comprehensive review of the Forestry Act, 1946, the Heads of the new Forestry Bill were approved by Government.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has commenced drafting the new Bill.  It is intended to take a more flexible approach regarding the question of replanting after clear-felling by giving the Minister the power to waive the replanting obligation in certain limited circumstances.  However, the general principle of replanting will remain in order to ensure that the national forest estate is not progressively eliminated.  There are no plans to specifically exempt pensioners from the replanting obligation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Quota buying-up schemes are provided for under Article 75 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2007, which states that member states may, in the interests of restructuring or of improving the environment, buy back quota from producers who wish to permanently exit milk production, and either leave such quota in the national reserve or sell it on to other producers at the same price.</P>
        <P>The Commission has proposed that such bought-back quota would not be used to reduce super levy liability at a national level as would generally be the case with &ldquo;spare&rdquo; national reserve quota, but rather that it would be ring-fenced, and in the event of super levy being <Col N="504"/>payable, the amount of the levy corresponding to the bought-back quota could be diverted into restructuring measures, i.e. used domestically instead of being paid to the Commission.</P>
        <P>From an Irish perspective, quota buy-back schemes have not been a feature of the quota regime, and because this proposal retains the voluntary character of such schemes, it presents no difficulty for Ireland.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 draft was advertised for public consultation in October 2008 as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment.    During the consultation both the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on behalf of the Central Fisheries Board raised concerns regarding the granting of aid to projects where environmental issues arise relating to compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and sea lice control on salmon farms.  Pending resolution of these issues, the National Seafood Development Operational Programme has not yet been adopted.</P>
        <P>The delay in the launch of the National Seafood Development OP has not prevented grant aid from being provided to aquaculture developments in 2009.  The European Commission agreed to the continuation of grant aid under the previous Operational Programme 2000 to 2006 until 30 June 2009.</P>
        <P>A provision of &euro;5m was made available for aquaculture development in the Agriculture Vote for 2009 and I approved the spending of &euro;4.5m of this for aquaculture projects in both  the Border, Midlands and Western and the Southern and Eastern regions.  This support has assisted the continued development of aquaculture projects in these areas and the employment that those projects support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">DG Environment has indicated at this time that it is generally supportive of the Department&rsquo;s proposals for wild fisheries compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  However, it has recently advised that it remains concerned about the planned approach to delivering compliance for aquaculture licensing.   The most recent views of DG Environment are being examined.  My Department is maintaining close liaison with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the issues arising with a view to it being in a position to withdraw its objection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the concerns of the Central Fisheries Board, a meeting at ministerial level was held in June between my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I personally advised on the significant progress made in relation to managing sea lice levels on salmon farms and the concerns of the fishery boards were also set down. My Department is currently preparing a report on the experience in 2009 of the implementation of the new Strategy for Improved Pest Control on Irish Salmon Farms which was put in place by Minister Coughlan in May 2008. Following the preparation and consideration of this report, I intend to engage with Minister of State Lenihan, who has responsibility for inland fisheries, with a view to agreeing an approach that will give the necessary assurances to that Department so that it can withdraw its objection to the Operational Programme.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Although, there have been significant reductions in the number of growers in certain sectors, the volume and value of output in most sectors has remained relatively stable and in cases has increased significantly.  This reflects the consolidation and development of these sectors and the horticultural industry in general.</P>
        <P>The value of field vegetable and protected food crop output is significantly higher today than in 1999.  However, the significant decline in the number of outdoor soft fruit producers reflects a shift to production under protection to allow production of higher quality and higher value crops in line with consumer demand.  In the case of mushrooms, despite the significant reduction in grower numbers, the value of output has not been affected to the same extent and held up well over recent years as remaining growers have increased scale and adopted new growing technologies.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Date of Minimum Durability or use by date is defined under the labelling Directive No. 2000/13/EC and would be relevant to the Department of Health and Children and controls carried out by the HSE. It is required for foods, which from a microbiological point of view, are highly perishable and are therefore likely after a short period to constitute a danger to consumer health.</P>
        <P>Food Business Operators (FBO) are required, according to HACCP principles, to apply microbiological controls to the products they process (Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005) and place on to the market. These provisions enable the FBO to determine shelf life and set a use-by date appropriate to the product. These requirements apply to both imported and domestic products. Random sampling of products and processes is undertaken as part of EU&rsquo;s food hygiene controls by the competent authorities.</P>
        <P>Equivalence in operational standards for animal health and food safety are the guarantees required of third countries and their establishments for approval to export food to the EU. The purpose of import control undertaken at EU approved Border Inspection Posts (BIP) is to satisfy that the conditions for import have been complied with.

In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.

There are no proposals to introduce air mile labelling as unilateral application of such labelling by Ireland would not be supported at EU level.</P>

	<P>The Central Statistics Office report that the value of Irish exports of fruit and vegetables (excluding bananas, preserves, jams and fruit juices) fell by just 3% from &euro;205m in 2007 to &euro;199m in 2008. It is worth noting that exports of mushrooms the single most important export crop in Irish horticulture increased by almost 9% from &euro;111m in 2007 to &euro;121m in 2008.</P>
        <P>My Department and its Agencies consistently support the development of the export potential of the Horticulture sector through its grant aid schemes and other supports to this sector.  Aid is available under the NDP scheme of investment aid for the commercial horticulture sector and the scheme for capital investments in marketing and processing in the horticulture sector to assist in the upgrading or development of facilities with the aim of maximizing the potential of the sector.</P>
        <P>The EU Producer Organisation (PO) scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to become part of a larger supply base, to concentrate marketing and improve quality.  The reform of the EU&rsquo;s common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables which came into effect on 1 January 2009 identified a strengthening role for POs as the core part of the strategy for improving the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetable sector in the future.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia can provide information on international market trends and support producers in their efforts to develop new markets. It can help in the area of product innovation and also provide support for horticultural producers in the application of marketing skills, including merchandising, product presentation and public relations.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The prohibited period for the spreading of slurry commenced on 15 October 2009 in all parts of the country as required by the Nitrates Regulations (SI No. 101 of 2009). The deadline for spreading slurry has therefore passed and the question of an extension does not now arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 12 October, I announced that the green cover requirement for tillage farmers would be relaxed this winter so as to allow farmers to plough for spring cereals from 1 December next, rather than 15 January, as provided for in the Nitrates Regulations. This relaxation of the green cover requirement is for this winter only.</P>
        <P>The planned review of the Nitrates Action Programme will provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to put forward their views on these issues.  Any adjustment to Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme will require the agreement of the EU Commission.</P>

	<P>REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007&ndash;13 and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including plan checks, to be completed before the first 2009 payments issue.</P>
        <P>The same rule applies both to new applications received in 2009 and to applications for second-year payments from those who joined in 2008.  This means that all administrative checks on both have to be completed before any payments can be made to either group.  At this stage I envisage that the 75% payments will start to be made in late November or early December.  There are 12,145 applications for a second-year payment but it is not possible in the time available to provide a breakdown by county of those who have been checked and cleared for payment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1066 and 1067 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rules governing the marketing and use of food and animal feed consisting of or containing genetically modified organisms within the Community are set down in EU legislation that has been jointly adopted by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers. This legislation is binding on all member states. In Ireland responsibility for the rules governing food rests with <Col N="517"/>my colleagues in the Department of Health and Children while my Department has responsibility for the rules governing animal feed.</P>
        <P>A very significant proportion of the protein diet for Irish livestock and poultry is derived from maize and soya crops and given that the availability of these crops to Irish importers is largely from genetically modified varieties it is inevitable that such crops would form part of animal feed diets. I am satisfied with the inclusion of such crops in animal feed diets once the varieties have been authorised in accordance with the aforementioned EU legislation. A central part of that legislation is the confirmation by the European Food Safety Authority that such genetically modified products are unlikely to have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of its intended use and that the GM products  from which they are derived are as safe as their conventional counterparts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present there are no GM food-feed soya proposals awaiting Council of Ministers consideration for authorisation but three GM maize proposals were considered at the last Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting on 19 October.  Since there was neither a qualified majority vote for or against the proposals, the proposals will now revert back to the EU Commission for a decision. Based on past experience the EU Commission is likely to authorise these events.  Ireland abstained on the three votes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">An export refund is a subsidy paid to exporters of products from the EU to certain third countries. Export refunds vary in time by product sector and by the individual product.  In the case of meat, export refunds at present apply to certain beef and poultry products. They do not apply for sheepmeat, while pigmeat refunds only apply for processed products. I have called for their extension to fresh and frozen pigmeat. I have been supported by a number of like-minded member states but to date the European Commission has not responded positively. I will continue to pursue the issue to help alleviate the current problems in the pigmeat market.</P>

	<P Just="Left">An application in respect of the 2009 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 20 April 2009. Processing of the application revealed that one of the land parcels declared by the person named had also been claimed by another scheme applicant. In keeping with standard processing procedures, both parties were written to and asked to clarify the position regarding their entitlement to claim the parcel in question. However, the matter has not been resolved to date. It is understood that the parcel in question is jointly owned by a number of members of the same family. In the circumstances, pending the outcome of the decision as to which applicant is entitled to declare the parcel in question, the area involved has been excluded from the application of the person named to allow payment issue under both the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and Single Payment Scheme on the remainder of the land claimed on the application.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the agreement reached in November 2008 on the Health Check of the CAP, together with support from several of my counterparts in other member states, I secured approval to use previously inaccessible unspent Single Payment System funds to address, among other things, specific disadvantages affecting certain sectors in economically vulnerable or environmentally sensitive areas.</P>
        <P>Resulting from this agreement, Ireland gained access to in the region of &euro;25 million in additional funding for each of the next three years 2010, 2011 and 2012 for these targeted measures. Mindful of the particular difficulties in the sheep sector, I decided to allocate &euro;18 of the available funds each year, for the next three years, on a Grassland Scheme to support incomes in the sheep sector.  In addition to this agreement, I successfully negotiated for the use of the national reserve element of these funds from 2009. In this regard, I have already announced that approximately &euro;7 million will be paid to hill sheep farmers as a once off payment in 2009, in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment, benefiting approximately 13,000 hill sheep farmers.</P>

        <P>This Code of Practice, which was published as a statutory planning guideline, sets out the fundamental principles or agreed actions that will foster greater partnership between the planning authorities and my Department.  These principles include:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="3">1. Forecasting Future Education Demand,</P>

	<P>Firstly, the position generally in relation to rental of prefabricated accommodation in schools is that my Department provides grant-aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation (not limited to prefabs) to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists. Such grant-aid is paid at a rate of 95% for schools with permanent recognition and 75% for schools with provisional recognition. Schools are expected to pay a local contribution of the balance, with an annual threshold on the local contribution of &euro;3,175. </P><Col N="522"/>
        <P>Generally, where schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of  Management is responsible for acquiring temporary accommodation and the rental contract is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor.</P>
        <P>According to my Department&rsquo;s records, the school has received an amount of approximately &euro;280,000 rental grant-aid for temporary accommodation and site rental from June 1997 to date.</P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, expels, suspends for a period greater than 20 days, or refuses to enrol a student. In these circumstances, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision.  Where the school is established or maintained by a VEC an appeal shall lie in the first instance to the VEC and thereafter to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol or re-instate a pupil. </P>
        <P>In answer to Parliamentary Question No. 1192 of 6 October 2009, I set out the total number of appeals taken in each of the last five years.

I have set out the total number of appeals against suspension and expulsion admitted by the Department for each of the last five full years, the total number that proceeded to full hearing and the determination.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.  In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support through curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short term support for teaching in specific curricular areas affected by skills shortfalls or by staff allocation reductions which it has not yet been possible for the school management to meet within allocation and which it has not yet been possible to resolve through the normal planning and management processes. </P>
        <P>The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The Board of Management of a school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. This Board operates independently of my Department.</P><Col N="524"/>

        <P>These posts will be allocated to the schools that are most seriously affected by the recent increase in the PTR, using objective criteria which will be agreed in advance in consultation with the education partners.</P>

While my Department operates a payroll service for teachers employed in schools it does not maintain records on the level of turnover or transfer of those teachers between schools. </P>

	<P Just="Left">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. While education was protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, it could not be entirely spared. I have always accepted and acknowledged that the decision in the Budget last October to increase the pupil-teacher ratio across all second-level schools will have an impact on teacher numbers, class sizes and subject choices in our post-primary schools from the commencement of the 2009/10 school year.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and approaches to class grouping are matters for local decision by school management. Where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Revised Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. Under the revised programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years. My Department will be consulting with the education partners in relation to the allocation of these additional posts.</P>
        <P>Given the current financial situation the country faces, it is imperative that we deploy staff and other resources in the most effective way across the education sector.</P>
        <P>In the OECD Pisa (Programme of International Student Assessment) 2006 study of 15 year olds across 57 countries, Ireland performs at the OECD average in Maths and significantly above average in science. A major programme of reform in Maths in second level schools is being rolled out under Project Maths.  Professional development programmes are currently happening throughout the country for teachers as a preface to a major programme of reform in the teaching of Maths which will begin in 2010/11 in junior and senior cycle. This will change how mathematics is taught in our schools on a phased basis in the years ahead. Project Maths is designed to teach Mathematics in a way which promotes real understanding, where students can appreciate the relevance of what they are learning and its application to everyday life, and how mathematics can be used to solve problems. Some &euro;3m in professional development for teachers is being invested in this area in 2009, and the investment will continue to at least 2013. The Government attaches key importance to improving standards in Mathematics. We are <Col N="526"/>addressing this through investment in the critical area which impacts on learning, that is, the quality of teaching.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to science, a revised syllabus in Junior Certificate science was introduced in 2003 placing a key emphasis on hands on investigative processes and the completion of some 30 mandatory experiments over the three year cycle 35% of the marks in the Junior Certificate are available for assessment of practical coursework. A major target in the Science Technology and Innovation Strategy is to continue this emphasis into senior cycle as part of a strategy to increase participation in the physical sciences to 20%.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed revised draft syllabuses in LC Physics, Chemistry and Biology and is currently trialling various assessment approaches. I look forward to receiving the Council&rsquo;s advice on science at an early date.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National  Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are currently 156 psychologists employed in my Department&rsquo;s NEPS service and the recruitment of a further 13 psychologist is at an advanced stage.  The Deputy will be aware that the Renewed Programme for Government commits to the continued expansion in the number of psychologists employed directly by NEPS. This will allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to every primary and post-primary school in the country and for the deepening of support therein with particular emphasis on special needs units, classes and special schools.</P>
        <P>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs can get access to extra support without having to undergo an individual assessment .</P>
        <P>Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard to any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the relevant local NEPS Regional Director, for whom contact details are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <Quest> if he will reverse the decision regarding pupil-teacher ratios in fee paying schools, which is discriminating against minority religion schools, many of which will be forced to close, depriving pupils and parents of the right to choose education in a Protestant or other minority religion school; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The October Budget set out the changes in how all fee-charging schools are treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated. With effect from 1 September 2009, teachers in all fee-charging schools are allocated at a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1, which is a point higher than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools.</P><Col N="528"/>
        <P>In view of the challenging economic circumstances that we are facing, I am not in a position to reverse this decision.  This decision is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees as an income source are in a better position to maintain services at a time when the public finances are under such severe pressure. Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that I and my officials have met representatives from the Protestant education sector to discuss future funding arrangements for Protestant schools. In this context, I have expressed my willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to my Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the schools that they wish to attend, particularly those in rural areas. I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.</P>

	<P>Expenditure on a number of areas of my Department&rsquo;s Vote is part-financed from National Lottery funding. </P>
        <P>In the years 2004 to 2008 the vast majority of such funding, disbursed by my Department, arose from the payment of grants to support Youth Services. With effect from 1 January 2009 functions in relation to Youth Affairs Section, including funding, were transferred from my Department to the Department of Health and Children. National Lottery funds were also disbursed by my Department to support Local Drugs Task Forces, Cultural Activities, the Irish Language and Adult Education Organisations during those years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Details of expenditure under the above areas is contained in the annual  Appropriation Accounts of my Department which are published by the Comptroller and Auditor General, relevant extracts from which are provided in tabular form in the following spreadsheet. This information covers the period 2004 to 2008 inclusive. Details of expenditure for 2009 are not yet available. The Revised Estimates Volume published by the Department of Finance contains summary details of programmes part-financed by the National Lottery and disbursed by relevant Government Departments and Offices. The Revised Estimates Volume provides these expenditure details solely at subhead level and identifies the aggregate amount of National Lottery funding towards the programmes in question and the amount of Exchequer funding. For example, the Revised Estimates Volume for 2009 identifies that a total of approximately &euro;472 million was allocated in 2008 to programmes which are part-financed by National Lottery funding, some &euro;265 million from the National Lottery and the remaining &euro;207 million from the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>My Department has commenced the process of preparing budgets for 2010 and the funding from National Lottery sources will be considered in that context.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy has a particular interest in an organisation/project funded by  National Lottery funds I would be happy to have my officials obtain the relevant details and communicate them to him.</P><Col N="529"/>

        <asker>Deputy Brendan Howlin</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if financial support will be made available by his Department to a person, who, having lost their job recently, has enrolled in a third level course in order to obtain higher qualifications but does not meet the general criteria for maintenance funding; if an easement of maintenance grant criteria is made in respect of recently unemployed candidates; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38176/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s student grant and free fees schemes, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants and free tuition fees where they satisfy the prescribed conditions of the individual schemes including those relating to progression.  In general students who previously pursued a course of study are not eligible for grant assistance or free tuition fees in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant or tuition fees were paid previously.  Subject to various conditions of the individual <Col N="543"/>schemes, in certain circumstances free tuition and grants are available where students are progressing e.g. to a course at a higher level.  I have no proposals to depart from the above.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority &mdash; i.e. the Local authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of the year the Government has launched a number of new initiatives to support unemployed people return to education and engage in upskilling.  In the further education sector, the Government has provided an additional 1,500 PLC places, bringing the total number of PLC places to 31,688 nationwide.  In the higher education sector 2,500 places have been provided on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses for people who are unemployed.  This scheme is open to people who have been on the Live Register for at least six months or who have been awarded Statutory redundancy and participants are entitled to retain their social welfare payments.  Other initiatives in the higher education sector include 280 places on a range of newly developed accelerated Level 6 Certificate programmes and over 900 places on a range of newly developed part-time transition programmes.  The accelerated and transition courses were targeted specifically at unemployed people and the institutes of technology that were running the programmes worked closely with local F&Aacute;S and Department of Social and Family Affairs offices both in terms of marketing the courses and advising participants of their entitlements in relation to social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force.  Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> further to parliamentary Question No. 476 of 13 October 2009, when discussions between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, institutes of technology and the Higher Education Authority will reach a conclusion on the third level trainee maintenance grant. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38182/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is engaged in discussions with Institutes of Technology Ireland and the Higher Education Authority in relation to the future management and administration of the programmes in question and the levels of award to be made to participants.  However, responsibility for the management of these programmes and related discussions is a matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I have no role in the matter.  My Department&rsquo;s student grant schemes, including the maintenance grant scheme for third level trainees, are fully means tested and therefore cannot replace F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s scheme of attendance-based monthly allowances which are not means tested.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the further financial assistance that is available to a third level student (details supplied) in County Waterford <Col N="544"/>either from his Department or from any other source; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.  No appeal has been received by my Department to date from the candidate referred to by the Deputy.  The NDP funded &lsquo;Third Level Access Measure&rsquo; is also supporting the participation of students in higher education, in particular those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  The Student Assistance Fund is available in all recurrently funded higher education institutions.  The Millennium Partnership Fund provides financial assistance for further and higher education students who are experiencing financial difficulties whilst participating in their studies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states.  Further details on claiming this relief are available from the candidate&rsquo;s local tax offices or on  Revenue&rsquo;s website at http://www.revenue.ie.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> when he brought in a rule that special needs assistants need to have passed Irish at junior certificate level; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The criteria for appointment of Special Needs Assistants are set out in Department Circulars 05/2001 and SNA 03/03.  These Circulars specify that the minimum requirement necessary for appointment is an award of Grade D (or pass) in Irish, English and Mathematics in the Intermediate Certificate/Junior Certificate or Day Vocational Certificate Examination or in an examination of equivalent standard.  In this context, a qualification of equivalent standard is any qualification at Level 3 or higher of National Framework Qualifications (NFQ) established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), provided that the qualification, or a combination of such qualifications, certifies to the achievement of a minimum of a pass in the subjects Irish, English and Mathematics.

        <P>State funding of any SNA position is granted on the basis of agreed recruitment policies and guidelines being adhered to by Boards of Management and these being applied in a fair and consistent manner in all cases.

	<P Just="Left">It is a matter for each Local Authority to provide a library service for primary schools in its area.  The choice of text-books and library books is entirely up to school management in both primary and post-primary schools.  The Department of Education and Science does not generally approve, commission, sponsor or endorse educational text-books.  Books are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers.  The book to which the Deputy refers is a diary written from the perspective of a cat.  While a cat&rsquo;s natural instincts are to hunt, the story is essentially a diary of its owner family&rsquo;s reactions to a particular incident.  It is very popular with children aged seven upwards and the author was named Children&rsquo;s Laureate in 2001.  There are a number of books in the same series.</P>
        <P>Schools can play an important role in suicide prevention.  Prevention needs to be addressed at whole school level through provision of relevant curricula for all children, through effective implementation of the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, and through the provision of care afforded by a good pastoral system, including the capacity to respond appropriately to  early signs of difficulty.  The development of self-esteem, general coping skills and personal effectiveness is the most appropriate way to help the general population of young people to deal with life pressures and stress.</P>
        <P>Since September 2003 Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is taught to all pupils in primary schools, and its introduction was supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers.  Its aim is to foster personal development, health and well being of children, to help them create and maintain supportive relationships, and develop the skills and attitudes for responsible citizenship.  From the beginning of their primary schooling children learn, in an age-appropriate way, how to identify, explore and express feelings and emotions, how to communicate with others, to resolve conflict and to respect difference, the importance of caring for one&rsquo;s body, treating oneself and others with dignity and respect, and how to identify people, places and  situations that may threaten personal safety.</P><Col N="546"/>
        <P>SPHE has also been compulsory in the junior cycle of post-primary schools since September 2003.  SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach which is supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.  At both primary and second level, the importance of  healthy lifestyles, nutrition and exercise is also emphasised.  Pastoral care teams in schools provide important assistance in promoting students&rsquo; well being and in ensuring that potential difficulties can be identified early. In addition, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) operating within my Department provides a range of services both direct and indirect which support the personal, social and educational development of all children in primary and post-primary schools.  NEPS provides access to psychological assessment either directly from the National Educational Psychological Service of my Department or through the Scheme for Commissioning of Psychological Assessments.  The Service provides for a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  A child is referred for individual psychological assessment only where this approach does not result in reasonable progress.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputies that the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools.

On receipt of the completed application form, the appeal will be processed in accordance with the statutory provisions under the Act.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser, has also been engaging closely with the family.  My Department, along with the NCSE, recently met with the Patron of a school to which an application for enrolment was made.  A number of issues were discussed and clarification was sought in relation to the issue in question.  The Patron has agreed to consider the matter and revert to my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of an Occupational Health Strategy has its origins in the PCW negotiations in the mid 1990s.  A two year pilot programme for put in place and reviewed by a Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee which was made up of representatives from my Department, school management bodies and teacher unions, decided that the pilot would not continue and a fundamental review was undertaken.  Exploratory talks, involving representatives of Teacher Unions and School Management Groups, on the development of an Occupational Health Strategy for teachers followed.  It was accepted by all that the aims of an Occupational Health Strategy would be to promote the health and Well-being of teachers at work with a focus primarily on prevention rather than cure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having examined different approaches to delivering such a service it was concluded that the best method would be to invite tenders from private companies who would have the capability to provide a nationwide service.  The first stage in the development of the Overall Occupational Health Strategy for teachers was put in place following an EU competitive tendering process at the start of the 2006/2007 school year.  VHI Corporate Solutions was contracted to provide the Employee Assistance Service (EAS) for Teachers.  The service incorporates confidential counselling on issues such as health, relationships, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.  The second stage of the Occupational Health Strategy for teachers encompasses health management and has taken over from the Chief Medical Officer of the Civil Service who provided a limited service to the Department in respect of teachers concentrating largely on ill health retirement assessments.  The Occupational Health Service incorporates pre-employment health assessments, sickness absence management referrals, medical assessments of fitness for work and ill health retirement assessments and appeals.</P>
        <P>My Department sought proposals on the open market for the provision of the service to teachers and following an EU competitive tendering process, Medmark Occupational Healthcare, was chosen and has been contracted to provide this service since 2008.  The intro<Col N="549"/>duction of this new service did not require any legislative change.  The estimated annual cost of providing the Occupational Health Strategy is &euro;2m.  The agreed regulations and procedures regarding the sick leave scheme for registered teachers in recognised primary and post-primary schools are set out in my Department circular number 0099/2008, a copy of which I will arrange to have forwarded to the Deputy together with a list of companies who tendered for the provision of the Occupational Health Service.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is currently anticipated that there will be a saving of at least &euro;14m in expenditure on rental temporary accommodation in 2009, compared to 2008.  This clearly demonstrates the efforts being made by my Department to reduce spending in this area.  My Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  Work is well under way and the firm of specialists is working closely with officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department.  The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.  The work also involves negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate.  Progress has been made in all areas of the review.  An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further strand of this review is a pilot programme to replace prefabricated accommodation with permanent modular units.  To date ten schools have been visited to determine suitability and, from those, a short list of four schools is being drawn up.  When the short-list of suitable schools has been finalised, the schools will be contacted with the offer of a permanent modular unit replacement of their prefabs.  Once the schools have indicated their agreement to the <Col N="550"/>proposal, detailed plans and timeframes will be developed for the delivery of the projects.  This replacement programme will be extended to further schools as resources permit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my Department&rsquo;s policy to grant aid the purchase (rather than rental) of temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than three years.  Furthermore, since July 2008, schools being approved for grant aid for temporary accommodation are offered the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.  This will reduce the usage of temporary accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.  I would like to assure the Deputy that it remains a priority for my Department to continue to reduce rental costs on temporary accommodation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the terms of the primary School Transport scheme pupils are eligible for free transport if they reside 3.2 kilometres or more from, and are attending, their nearest national school or school of amalgamation.  In the case of amalgamations, pupils residing in a closed school area, may be deemed eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation only.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied resides in a closed school area and is not attending the school of amalgamation and therefore, is not eligible for free school transport.  In light of the information supplied by the Deputy, my Department has requested Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide background information and this will be examined on receipt of the report.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 588 of 20 October 2009, the reason the school has been allocated a band two rating when, in fact, a large part of the school catchment is contained within an electoral division which has shown one of the highest population growths here in Census 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">All applications for large scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  Under the criteria, each project is assigned a Band Rating which reflects the type and extent of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.  Full details in relation to the prioritisation criteria are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie.  The school to which the Deputy refers currently has six mainstream teachers.  The demographics for the school&rsquo;s catchment indicate that it will grow to an eight teacher school.  Given the level of additionality involved relative to the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation, the extent of the works needed, therefore, merits a band 2 rating.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Financial assistance is available to students under the Third Level Student Support Schemes, which are administered by the Local Authorities and Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department. Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic <Col N="552"/>attainment.  Under the terms of the Higher Education Grant Scheme a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.  However, in December 2000 clause 7.7 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme was amended to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course, at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.  The progression route at postgraduate level, for grant purposes, is as follows: Higher Diploma/Postgraduate Diploma, Masters, PhD/Doctorate Candidates who hold a masters qualification and are currently pursuing a postgraduate qualification cannot be considered for funding.  There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements.  Any such proposal would have to be considered in the light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for a higher education grant is a matter for the relevant local authority.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in her/his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

The overall number of approved PLC places is set at its current level because there is a continuing requirement to plan and control numbers and to manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and provision.  In May 2009, an additional 1,500 PLC places were allocated to VECs and other providers for the 2009-2010 academic year, bringing the total nationwide to 31,688.

	<P>The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 <Col N="555"/>September 2008.  While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.  Combined classes are a feature of the majority of schools in the country and this arrangement has no adverse implications for the quality of the education children receive.</P>
        <P>In terms of class sizes 80% of primary pupils were in classes of less than 30 pupils during the last school year. With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will inevitably be differences in individual class sizes.  Some schools can have class sizes of greater than 28 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes.  The Revised Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.  Under the revised programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.  These posts will be allocated to the schools that are most seriously affected by the recent increase in the PTR, using objective criteria which will be agreed in advance in consultation with the education partners.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issues raised by the Deputy pending the outcome of the consultation process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On 2 November 2009, there were 113 prisoners in custody in Portlaoise Prison.  The Prison is a high security facility and there are a number of different categories of prisoners who must be kept separate from each other in designated areas of the prison.  Two groups attend classes in the Education Centre, but due to the type of offender involved, the numbers allowed in each class are strictly controlled.  Teachers are required to deliver educational services to the other groups in their designated areas.  The number of teachers allocated to the prison by the County Laois VEC is 19.64 (whole time equivalents) for the academic year 2009-10.  This allocation is unchanged from previous years.  Educational services are provided on a year round basis from this allocation, including mid-term and holiday periods.  Courses are made available across morning, afternoon and evening periods.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department funds a wide range of further education programmes through Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  For example, for early school leavers aged between 15 and 20 years of age without any qualifications or vocational training and who are unemployed, there is the Youthreach programme which provides two years integrated education, training and work experience.  There are currently almost 6,000 places available nationally under the Youthreach umbrella.  Almost 3,700 of these are funded by my Department and delivered in just over 100 Youthreach centres by VECs.  The majority of the remaining 2,300 places are funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and delivered by F&Aacute;S in Community Training Centres (CTCs).  For more information on the range of options available, <Col N="556"/>the person referred to by the Deputy should contact their local VEC.

	<P>Under the terms of the Third Level Student Support Schemes, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  The objective of the student grant schemes is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to postgraduate studies.</P>
        <P>There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements. Any such proposal would have to be considered in the light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector.  Apart from the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the Student Assistance Fund. The objective of the Fund, is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Information on the Fund is available from the Access Officer at the candidate&rsquo;s College.</P>
        <P>In addition section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate course in EU Member States and postgraduate courses in non-EU countries.  Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from an individual&rsquo;s Local Tax Office.</P>

	<P>In March 2007 the then Minister for Education and Science announced changes in relation to the proportion of marks awarded for oral Irish in the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations with effect from 2010 and 2012 respectively.  These changes are set out in circular letter 0042/2007 which issued to schools  in 2007.</P>
        <P>The marks for the oral examination at Higher and Ordinary levels in the Leaving Certificate examination will be increased from 25% to 40%.  Marks for the aural will be reduced to 10% at both Higher and Ordinary levels, and 50% of the overall marks will be awarded for the written papers.  At Foundation level in the Leaving Certificate examination, the marks for oral Irish will be increased from 25% to 40%.  Marks for the aural will be reduced from 30% to <Col N="557"/>20%, and the written paper will attract 40% of the marks. In the case of the Leaving Certificate Applied, the marks for oral Irish will be increased from 33% to 40%, marks for the aural will be reduced from 30% to 25%, and 35% of the overall marks will be awarded for the written paper.  Where students take the oral examination in the first year of their senior cycle programme, the changed marking arrangements will come into effect in 2011.</P>
        <P>The changes will also apply to the Junior Certificate where the oral Irish examination will continue to be a school-based optional examination.  In the case of the Junior Certificate oral, the marks will be doubled from 20% to 40%.  Marks for the aural will be reduced to 10%, and 50% of the marks will be awarded for the written paper(s).  Where no oral examination is held, marks are awarded on the basis of the written paper(s) and aural only.</P>
        <P>The State Examinations Commission has issued details to schools setting out the format of the Junior Certificate Examination from 2010 in Circular S73/09, a copy of which is on the Commission&rsquo;s website at www.examinations.ie.  The intention of the increase in marks for oral assessment is to promote a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.</P>

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of an application for large scale capital funding from the school to which he refers. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 1.4 rating. This reflects the fact that accommodation is needed to facilitate an amalgamation.</P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The project is currently awaiting the appointment of a Design Team. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

	<P>The Report of a working group to examine potential problems caused by the weight of schoolbags, which was presented in July, 1998, acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level.</P>
        <P>One of the main recommendations of the report related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags. In this regard, my Department initiated an awareness-raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>A further circular was issued in 2005, again highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs and that fit with how the school organises teaching and learning.  The Report of the Working Group makes various recommendations in this regard, such as optimum use of storage facilities, developing pupil organisation skills and timetabling.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools on these issues. Actions consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers and in the case of second level schools, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</P><Col N="559"/>
        <P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level (mainly in the case of language subjects) school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use in schools are taken at school level. However, the report of the Working Group was disseminated by my Department to the Irish Educational Publishers Association, and they were asked to include consideration of the weight of school texts in their deliberations and liaise with teachers on finding solutions to the issue. It should be pointed out that the Report did highlight that both teachers and pupils favoured the use of multi-level textbook production for ease of convenience and ease of access and cited a high demand for them.</P>
        <P>A copy of the report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags and all current circulars in relation to this issue are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1130, 1131 and 1140 together.</P>
        <P>The Renewed Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. Under the revised programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years. My Department proposes to structure a consultation process through meetings with the education partners in accordance with the commitment to consultation as set out in the renewed Programme. In advance of such discussions it has written to the education partners to seek any observations or suggestions they may have in relation to the implementation of the commitment. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issues raised by the Deputies pending the outcome of the consultation process.</P>

	<P>The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, facilitates the transportation of over 125,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day. School transport is a very significant operation involving about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year.  The annual charge of &euro;300 was introduced from the beginning of the 2009/10 school year.</P>
        <P>In order to minimise the impact of the new charges:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A maximum family rate of &euro;650 applies</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />They have been confined to eligible post-primary children and children availing of concessionary transport</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Waivers continue to apply in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs still travel free</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Parents were facilitated to pay the annual amount in two instalments &mdash; in July and December.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">In 2008, receipts from transport charges represented 5% of the overall cost of school transport. The allocation for 2009 is &euro;192 million.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns, it is not envisaged that there will be a change in the payment arrangements or a reduction in the amount charged.</P>

The review is currently under way and it is intended that it will be completed by the end of 2009 or early 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">SENOs will communicate the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses. Schools may continue to apply to the NCSE for additional SNA resources as new pupils who would qualify for such support are enrolled or as changing care needs of existing pupils emerge.  The SNA position in relation to individual schools can continue to change.

        <P>It is not possible to give a timeframe or costs at present, given that the process involved will require discussions with the education partners, as well as the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and Children.  However, all parts of the EPSEN legislation, which have not been commenced to date, will be considered during this process.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently considering the process required to be undertaken to meet this commitment. The stakeholders that will be invited to consultations will include those who were consulted in the original implementation process and these will include the teachers unions, management bodies, parents&rsquo; representatives associations, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  The Deputy will appreciate that, until such time as the process is completed, it will not be possible to indicate what aspects of the Act will be implemented.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer. In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expen<Col N="568"/>diture. Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions. </P>
        <P Just="Left">In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of Finance. This framework allows flexibility around recruitment into posts that  are considered essential to maintaining core teaching and research activities, subject to an overall ceiling on numbers employed. The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy. The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing sufficient flexibility for the protection of frontline teaching and research activities. It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions, including the institution referred to by the Deputy, to manage their staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework. I understand that, within the terms of the employment control framework, the Higher Education Authority is currently in discussions with the particular institute in relation to options for addressing some specific operational issues that have arisen there.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. </P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13(3)(a) of the Education Act, 1998 provides that inspectors of the Department of Education and Science &ldquo;shall visit recognised schools and centres for education on the initiative of the Inspectorate.&rdquo; In line with this provision, the management of the Inspectorate determines the schools to be visited and so I have not instructed inspectors to visit a certain number of schools. </P>
        <P>Inspectors visit primary schools to carry out a range of evaluative, advisory and research functions. In 2009, it is expected that the Inspectorate will conduct over 160 incidental inspection visits to primary schools and approximately 250 whole-school type evaluations. In addition, during the school year 2008-09, inspection visits were made to 2,469 teachers on probation. A further small number of schools will be visited for other purposes.</P>
        <P>In the case of some types of inspection work, such as Whole-School Evaluations and General Inspections of individual teachers, advance notice is provided to the schools or teachers involved. Due to the nature of incidental inspection of schools the Inspectorate does not give advance notice of these visits.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if his Department, as the final arbitrator and controlling body, will permit a vocational education committee or a local authority to accept a sworn statement made before a commissioner of oaths as a final determination of the status of an applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to a mature student education grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent mature students or as independent mature students. An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course. </P>
        <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account. Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents&rsquo; income. The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.</P><Col N="573"/>
        <P Just="Left">In order to establish a candidate&rsquo;s status as an independent mature student, documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate&rsquo;s address from 1 October of the year preceding entry to college. In considering whether a mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt  that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</P>
        <P>The documentary evidence normally required by a local authority or VEC to establish independent residence includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or ESB bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department. In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible  to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary proofs. While an affidavit, if accompanied by other supporting documentation, may be considered as evidence of independent living, an affidavit in isolation is not considered acceptable as sole proof of residency.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in witnessing an affidavit, the role of a Commissioner for Oaths or practising solicitor is to witness the signature of the person making the affidavit. They do not verify the contents of the affidavit. An affidavit is generally confined to such facts as the person swearing it is able of his or her own knowledge to prove. It is considered that it is likely to be of little value where a candidate is unable to provide any form of documentary evidence to support his or her assertions in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department has reviewed the use of affidavits in the context of proof of independent living and is satisfied that the current practice in this regard is both reasonable and appropriate.</P>

        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.</P>

However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers is a recognised primary school and attracts funding in the same way as all recognised primary schools.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants. These grants have been increased substantially in recent years. The primary school capitation grant has increased from &euro;81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of &euro;200. This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.</P>
        <P>The ancillary services grant for primary schools has also been improved by &euro;3.50 to &euro;155 per pupil.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant have received &euro;355 per pupil &mdash; or almost &euro;25 extra &mdash; this year to cover their day-to-day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting &euro;7,475 more.</P>
        <P>In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than &euro;40,000 to meet its day-to-day running costs. That same school now receives &euro;106,500. This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants, which are paid by my Department.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. <Col N="581"/>The current rates range from &euro;512 to &euro;986 per pupil &mdash; an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants. These grants have been increased substantially in recent years. The primary school capitation grant has increased from &euro;81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of &euro;200. This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.</P>
        <P>The ancillary services grant for primary schools has also been improved by &euro;3.50 to &euro;155 per pupil.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant have received &euro;355 per pupil &mdash; or almost &euro;25 extra &mdash; this year to cover their day-to-day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting &euro;7,475 more.</P>
        <P>In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than &euro;40,000 to meet its day-to-day running costs. That same school now receives &euro;106,500. This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants, which are paid by my Department.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from &euro;512 to &euro;986 per pupil &mdash; an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.</P>

        <Quest> the consideration given to providing funding to extend a school (details supplied) in Dublin 16 in order that extra places are made available in the school at post-primary level for pupils who formerly attended the local national school; if an assessment has been done of the places required in the post-primary school in the current economic circumstances where fewer parents can afford to send children to other local fee paying schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding.</P>
        <P>The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in addition to recent schools&rsquo; enrolment data.</P>
        <P>The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in a total of 42 locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.  The area where the school in question is situated is not included in these locations.</P>
        <P>The Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out an analysis of each of the identified priority locations to establish the school accommodation requirements up to and including the school year 2014/2015.</P>
        <P>Following this analysis, decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</P>
        <P>When the required reports have been completed for the initial 42 areas, Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country including the area where the school in question is located.</P>
        <P>In the interim, it is open to the school authority to apply for temporary accommodation to meet any short term accommodation needs it might have.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers is operating with provisional recognition from my Department. It is entitled to grant aid for the rental for its accommodation, for school transport and for the payment of teacher salaries.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.</P>
        <P>The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and approaches to class grouping are matters for local decision by school management. Where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.</P>
        <P>The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The Principal of a school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. This Board operates independently of my Department. The school in question did not submit an appeal.</P>
        <P>Discrete allocations are also made to second-level schools to cater for example for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with language difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Revised Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. Under the revised programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years. My Department will be consulting with the education partners in relation to the allocation of these additional posts.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Until 31 August this year, a grant system operated which allowed the managerial authorities of primary schools to claim from my Department the funding required to pay part-time teachers employed in their schools. The teachers were paid by the managerial authorities.</P>
