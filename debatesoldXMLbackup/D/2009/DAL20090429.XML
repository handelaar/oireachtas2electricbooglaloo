      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Today we have seen the publication of the ESRI report on the economy, which illustrates the appalling economic catastrophe the country is now suffering.  Its figures show that 300,000 jobs will be lost between this year and next.  The economic decline forecast for Ireland is twice as bad as in any of our competitor countries and the rise in unemployment is also twice as bad as any of our competitor countries.  This underlines once again that the vast majority of the difficulties faced in this country are the result of the policies over which the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, presided in recent years.  It is a damning indictment of policy in this country, showing policy failure by policy makers, by regulators and by the property sector.</P>
        <P>The tragedy is that the Government is persisting with policies that will not address these challenges.  It contemptuously ignored warnings as they were delivered to it, and now Ireland stands alone as the only country that is attempting to deal with these catastrophic times by raising taxes and cutting investment.  This is not a strategy that can address our problems.  The recent budget showed a Government that is not willing to face up to the reform agenda this country needs.  It showed a Government that is turning to ordinary people to pay for mistakes in policy.  The central drive of the recent budget was to heap extra taxes on ordinary workers.</P>
        <P>This coming Friday, 1 May, which is International Workers Day, will see a single person on the average industrial wage in Ireland pay tax at 51%.  How can the Government think this is a strategy for recovery?  The Government is bereft of a strategy for job protection or job creation.  What are the figures we will hear later today for the latest month&rsquo;s increase in unemployment?  This is a barometer which measures the extent to which we are destroying ordinary lives.  I ask the Taoiseach what level of increase we have suffered in the last month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept many of the points in the question put by the Deputy.  Of course we are facing a difficult situation, and we have budgeted for a contraction of 7.7% in the economy.  The figure according to the ESRI is 8.3%, although it is more optimistic about next year than we have budgeted for.  There is no question that we are in difficult times.  I am glad to see the ESRI shares the short-term analysis put forward by the Government.  It acknowledges that the measures taken to ensure the sustainability of the public finances are appropriate.  We have taken measures to maintain the public finances on a sustainable path and I am pleased the ESRI recognises this.  There is obviously a difficult but important balance to achieve in terms of ensuring sustainability in our public finances while avoiding further contraction of <Col N="308"/>the economy.  However, it acknowledges the need to ensure sustainability in the public finances, and the corrective action we took in the budgets was necessary if we are to have the prospect of growth in the mid-term.  Not to take these actions would defer the return of growth.  It is important to acknowledge that this is also part of the ESRI&rsquo;s analysis.</P>
        <P>I do not for one moment underestimate the impact of such a contraction on employment.  The countries that are most affected by the current global crisis are small, open economies.  The Asian tiger economies have been hit to the same extent as we have.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the live register total for the week ending 17 April 2009 will be 384,113.  Within the constraints of the public finances, we are doing everything we can to help people who are losing their jobs.  That is also part of the social partnership talks that are taking place at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>These statistics, as the Taoiseach knows, reveal that the unemployment figure in the first four months of the year &mdash; up to 17 April &mdash; has risen by 94,000.  That is on top of an increase of 120,000 in 2008.  It is rising twice as fast for young workers as for older workers.  Behind those statistics dwell some grim facts &mdash; business people seeing their lives&rsquo; work destroyed as they have had to close their doors; and families terrified that their jobs will be the next to go as the ESRI tells us that another 300,000 are to be added to the total.  That would put unemployment levels above 600,000.  These are appalling figures.</P>
        <P>People&rsquo;s confidence is sapped because they see a Government without any strategy for employment.  What is the Government&rsquo;s strategy?  The Taoiseach may say that Fine Gael&rsquo;s strategy does not have all the answers.  However, we have set out clearly a major investment in the infrastructures that are needed for the future and which will not cost the Exchequer a red cent because it will soak up investment that is out there looking for a home, money that needs a home and which can transform our economy instead of lying wasted in international shares.  We have proposed a reduction in PRSI for those who are expanding employment.  We have proposed a cut in VAT to give a break to people, particularly in labour intensive service areas, who are trying to get things going again.  We have suggested small business loans to target the businesses that are struggling the most.  The Taoiseach may say these are not the correct options, but what is the Government&rsquo;s strategy?</P>
        <P>Consider the situation in the countries with which we are competing.  In the United Kingdom, for example, the Government is reducing tax burdens for small businesses and giving VAT breaks.  Canada is introducing accelerated tax allowances to encourage private investment.  The United States Government has a major infrastructural investment in the green economy.  Every economy has a strategy based on protecting jobs and defending employment.  Where is the Government&rsquo;s strategy?  What we saw in the recent budget was the very opposite, offering a blinkered view of the world.  The Taoiseach and his Government are smarting from criticism from their backbenchers that they are out of touch and paralysed, that they are unaware of what businesses need, are not responding to that need, and that a cosy circle is dictating policy.  This is nothing to the fury the Government will encounter from ordinary people who are seeing their life prospects and those of their children going up in smoke.</P>
        <P>We need a comprehensive strategy that has reform and job protection at its heart.  The Government is yet to produce that, but it is what the country is crying out for.  People are already saying that the Government, which brought us into this, cannot lead us out of it.  The Green Party is saying that in regard to the banking sector.  More and more people are now saying it about the Government.</P>

	<P>That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A strategy and plan are in place, as outlined in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Would Deputy McGuinness agree with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What we have had from the Deputy&rsquo;s leader is the prospect of addressing a redesign of the tax system without increasing income tax, which has no credibility whatsoever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government&rsquo;s jobs strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to our jobs strategy, first, as a prerequisite to economic recovery, we must get our public finances into order.  Second, we have increased the number of placement schemes available for people who are out of work.  Third, we are trying to ensure reductions in costs.  We are already seeing such reductions, as well as improvements in competitiveness in terms of a reduction in wage costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is no thanks to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>People in the private sector are taking decisions in order to maintain employment in the more difficult environment in which they now operate.  That is happening throughout the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government doing to protect jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition seeks to contend that in the short term, there is a way to mid-term growth without making a change in regard to our public finance position.  We have to take the corrective action currently being taken.  Everyone knows that, but the Opposition is not prepared to accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Government that will not accept reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition is trying to suggest there is some other, painless way forward.  We will do everything we can to bring the economy through these difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has ducked reform in the public service and reform of the energy sector.  It has ducked everything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Reform in the public service is ongoing in regard to control of numbers and providing opportunities for employees to leave in a planned and regulated way.  We are also seeking to implement the reforms outlined in the task force report on procurement and a range of other issues.  All these initiatives are in place and were discussed here yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that all the Taoiseach has to say about job creation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion from the Fine Gael Party that there is a way of moving on without the necessity to provide for an increase in taxation is simply dishonest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The party&rsquo;s health spokesman said at the weekend that we have not reduced public expenditure sufficiently.  In what areas in health, education and social welfare has expenditure not been reduced sufficiently?  It is time for Fine Gael to come forward.  We have set <Col N="310"/>out our position in the budget.  We have indicated where the tax and expenditure changes for next year and the year after will have to be made and the size of those cuts.  We have heard nothing from Fine Gael in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach began both his replies to Deputy Bruton with the words &ldquo;I do not accept&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not accept it last week either when the IMF told us that the bank bailout in this State would be more expensive for Irish taxpayers than for those anywhere else.  The Taoiseach told us in so many words that the IMF had its figures wrong.  The IMF later clarified the position and stood over its figures.  Today we have an ESRI report telling us that the economic recession in Ireland is the worst for any developed country since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  We are told that by the end of next year, almost one out of five people in the workforce will be out of work.  The Taoiseach tells us this morning that there are now 384,000 people on the live register.  How many will be on the live register by the end of next year, according to these ESRI figures?  How many more people will lose their jobs before the Taoiseach loses his?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach believe that what is happening to our economy does not have anything to do with the way in which Fianna F&aacute;il has mismanaged it in recent years?  Does he still hold to that view?  Does he still believe it has nothing to do with him and that it is something which has appeared like the Mexican swine flu, out of the blue and having nothing to do with the way the Government puffed the property bubble and did not face up to the problems in the economy?  The Taoiseach tells us again today that he will not accept what the Opposition is saying.  He would not accept it this time last year when we told him that an economic problem was coming.  He would not accept it before last summer when we told him there was a problem in the banks.  It  took a long time for the penny to drop with the Taoiseach that people were losing their jobs and that businesses were going to the wall.  Even as recently as last month, the Taoiseach would not accept in the House a Labour Party set of proposals to find work or meaningful activity such as education and training to deal now with the immediate problems of people who are losing their jobs.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach simply does not accept this reality.  He seems to be in absolute denial that outside the walls and gates of this parliamentary area, people are losing their jobs and businesses are going to the wall.  Those who are or were self-employed are telling us repeatedly that when they turn around, there is no help available to them.  They cannot turn to anybody in a State agency and they cannot get credit from banks to keep their businesses going and retain their employees.  We are now facing into the prospect, according to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own admission, of 500,000 people idle and without a job to go to in the morning.  He keeps looking across the Chamber at the Opposition parties and asking what we are proposing.  We have repeatedly put forward proposals but the Taoiseach has paid only lip service to them.  He certainly paid lip service to some of the Labour Party proposals in his Ard-Fheis speech.  However, nothing is happening.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach must get it into his head that the key to solving our economic difficulties is protecting jobs and getting people back to work.  The Government will not solve the problems in the public finances, the banks or the general economy without people going back to work. <Col N="311"/> The ESRI report today and the live register figures provided by the Taoiseach are confirmation that every day, week by week and month by month, more and more people are losing their jobs and more and more businesses are going to the wall while the Taoiseach and his Government are stuck like the proverbial rabbit in the headlights, absolutely frozen and unable to act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore can make all the contentions he like, even if the facts are different.  As Taoiseach of this country, I accept fully and am acutely aware that people are losing jobs.  Of course I am aware of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept it is the Government&rsquo;s fault?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is taking the action that is necessary in the short term to ensure we can return the economy to growth.  How does the Deputy expect jobs to come back into the economy without growth in the economy?  The Deputy has referred to the ESRI report.  The ESRI accepts that the balanced corrective action we are taking is the right thing to do despite, unfortunately, its very severe short-term effects.  In an economy which is contracting by 8% this year unemployment is, of course, growing.  We have factored in a projected 15% or 16% unemployment rate for this year and next year.  Is that complacency on my part?  Of course it is not.  It is a fact with which we must deal.  The ESRI is saying that unless this action is taken the prospects for growth will not reappear.</P>
        <P>If one is to create and maintain jobs, one must bring back growth into the economy.  The problem for a small open economy like ours, dependent for our standard of living on global demand, is that there is a global recession.  Singapore, Korea and all the famous Asian tiger economies are contracting by anything from 8% to more than 10% this year.  This is no comfort to us in Ireland but it is an indication of the global nature of the crisis and of the fact that the only way we can return to growth is by being more competitive and taking down our costs.</P>
        <P>On 1 May, gas prices will come down by 12% and electricity prices by 10%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not 30%?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those facts are clear.  The ESRI has budgeted for a steeper drop in the cost of living this year than the Government has done.  We budgeted for a drop of 4% and it says the figure will be 4.6%.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It says the Taoiseach is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It suggests that next year will not be as difficult as we think it will be.  We have been open, honest and transparent in out budgetary policy and have outlined to the people that the steps we are taking are necessary. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the employment strategy in all of this? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not enjoy taking these steps but they are necessary to get the country back to growth so that we will be ready when the upturn comes.  Is it the Opposition&rsquo;s contention that we should continue with public spending on an unsustainable path?  If that is Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s view there is no prospect of growth returning to the economy. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should admit he caused all of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESRI, which Deputy Bruton quotes this morning, speaks about the importance of maintaining as many jobs as possible.  Thankfully, even in the current situation, <Col N="312"/>we have 80% more in employment than 10 or 15 years ago.  There are more than 380,000 unemployed, and every one is one too many as far as I am concerned, but there are also 1,800,000 people at work and we must try to maintain those jobs.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is in denial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must help, to the greatest possible extent, those who are losing jobs or who cannot find work.  That is what we are doing and will continue to do.</P>
        <P>We are in discussions with the social partners about developing and evolving programmes, as we did in the 1990s when many schemes were developed.  However, we must be straight with the people.  We cannot grow jobs without taking whatever decisions are necessary to return to growth in the mid term.  That is not possible and will not happen.  We must take the necessary decisions now.  We learned the lesson that deferring difficult decisions on public finance merely prolongs the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fine bit of theory.  Of course getting people back to work depends on economic growth but the Taoiseach&rsquo;s strategy is not designed to grow the economy.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It will shrink the economy and take more money out of it.  The dithering approach of the Government, with one policy this week and another in two weeks&rsquo; time, is adding to the decline in confidence in the Irish economy, both domestically and internationally.</P>
        <P>People are losing their jobs, businesses are declining and there is a huge drop in consumer activity.  Much of this is due to the lack of confidence in our economy.  People need hope that there is a way through the economic recession and that we will get out of it.  Unfortunately, it is difficult for people to have such hope when the Government does not appear to know what it is doing.  All the signals the Government is sending out are affecting the confidence of people, both in their spending and in their hopes for employment.</P>
        <P>The Government does not have a pro-employment strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Social economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing in the budget will generate employment, support employment activity or encourage employers to take on new employees.  There are no measures in place.  The State agencies have not been re-geared to deal with the immediate problems facing people who are losing employment or are self-employed and cannot get assistance.  In some cases, self-employed people cannot even get income continuance because they were not in the social insurance system.  Those people are not getting help from the Government. </P>
        <P>The Government does not have a jobs-centred strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach can talk all he likes or as loudly as he likes but that is the reality. The proof is in the declining employment figures we see month after month.  There are now almost 400,000 people unemployed and the ESRI report states the unemployment rate will reach 17%,  almost one in five people, by the end of next year.  That is a disgraceful record.  It is not good enough.  It is no longer acceptable that the Government washes its hands of this <Col N="313"/>problem and pretends it has nothing to do with it.  Every report from the ESRI and the International Monetary Fund and all international commentary now state that the worst performing economy in the developed world, in terms of employment and banking, is the Irish economy.  The Taoiseach and the Government are responsible for that.  They have dug a big hole for the Irish people by the way they mismanaged the economy in recent years and Irish working people are paying for that.  They are losing their jobs, their businesses are going to the wall and their pay-packets are being plundered in order to bail out banks, developers and others who are the real <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre </i>on the Government side of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am defending my position.  It is not a question of being loud or otherwise but of answering with the same gusto as the Opposition use in attacking me.  I hope Deputy Gilmore does not mind me doing that.  I am as entitled to defend myself, as he is to attack me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>A bit of modesty would be appreciated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s contention that it is possible to have a pro-jobs strategy on the basis of unsustainable public finances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>No one said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is clever lawyer&rsquo;s talk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is a clever accountant, as she never tires of telling us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition claims that the Government does not have a strategy or policy.  In the past 12 months, through changes in income tax and expenditure, the Government took approximately &euro;8 billion out of the emerging deficit.  We were heading for a 15% deficit in gross national product.  </P>
        <P>Every one of those policies was opposed by the Opposition and yet it talks about the need to take corrective action to get the show back on the road.  It opposed everything.  It opposed our attempt to deal with the bank situation and to provide credit for Irish businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We were right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It now suggests we can have a thriving economy on the basis of an unstable banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Government not create a credit flow for small businesses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt while Deputy Gilmore made many charges against me.  I never do.  However, the moment I stand up to speak I am interrupted.  Deputies may feel that is the way to debate but people see through that.</P>
        <P>We are taking whatever steps are necessary to get us through this problem, and that is creating real hardship for people.  Like everyone in this House, I am aware of that.  We take these policy positions because there is not an alternative if we are to get our public finances back in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an alternative.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="314"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <P>Of course we will provide hope, but on the basis of taking necessary decisions now and next year.  The country will be then in a position to take off again when the international demand improves, as is predicted by international commentators.  There is not an easy way through this.  There is only a difficult way.  We will take whatever steps we can to help people who find themselves in difficulties.  The prerequisite for economic recovery is to get our public finances in order and that means making cuts in spending and raising taxes.  It has meant examining other areas where we must consider taxation and where we will have to cut further spending.  It will involve further reforms.  We need the agreement of many people working in the public sector and other sectors to help us get through this problem.  That is why we are talking to the social partners at present.  We have to manage our way through this crisis, but each time the Labour Party, particularly, or the Fine Gael Party come forward with proposals there is always an easier and a handier way out.</P>

    <entry>An Interdepartmental Committee on the Council of Europe meets annually. The last meeting took place on 27 June 2008 which discussed Ireland&rsquo;s role in the organisation and its impact on political debate within Ireland, particularly through its standard setting function and its monitoring of member states compliance with these standards.  Given the fact that the Council of Europe is the leading institution on human rights in Europe, Ireland affords a high priority to its responsibilities and obligations under Council of Europe conventions, including the European Court of Human Rights and the European Social Charter and these issues are central to the discussion at the Interdepartmental meetings.

	<P>Does the high level interdepartmental committee on North-South matters, the function of which was to exchange information and co-ordinate Government policy on North-South matters, still exist?  Does it meet or function in any shape or form?  Is the North-South interdepartmental co-ordinators group still in place?  Will the Taoiseach outline the function of these groups?  Has the level of North-South co-operation increased and is the Government working proactively to increase the level of co-ordination?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no wish to interrupt Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, but a ruling of the Chair exists to the effect that when a reply is to be published in the Official Report and not <Col N="320"/>given orally, it is wiser for Members to await the reply and then perhaps pursue the matter again, rather than to do so now through a supplementary question.  The recommended procedure is that if the Member wishes to pursue the matter subsequently, he or she may do so by putting a question to the line Minister.  The difficulty is that the Deputy is asking questions, which I realise are relevant, but the Taoiseach has already stated that he will circulate the reply for publication in the Official Report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is only one more part of the question and the Taoiseach will have the answer before him.  He will be able to say whether they exist and whether they are contained in his reply.  It is quite simple.  Does the interdepartmental group on drugs exist and what is its membership?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the rule governing this matter, when an answer is printed in the Official Report and not provided orally, I understand the rule is that Members await a reply rather than pursue matters by supplementary questions.  Upon receipt of the reply, there will be an opportunity to put various detailed questions based on the considerable number of committees which have been communicated.  I believe this is the best way to proceed.  I do not have any information other than the tabular information.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.  The Government press secretary and the staff in the Government press office and the Government information service are subject to all current guidelines applying generally in the Civil Service, as set out the in the Civil Service code of conduct, staff circulars and relevant legislation.  No particular guidelines have been prepared with regard to the circumstances and manner in which they contact RTE, or any other media organisation.</P>
        <P>The Government press secretary is constantly engaged with all elements of the media, including RTE, communicating news and information in respect of Government policy and the presentation of policies.  He has the primary responsibility with regard to the arrangements for interviews with officeholders and any dialogue with media on their reports and features relating to officeholders and official policy.  He works very closely with me and I am pleased to account to the House for any action taken by him in the discharge of his official duties.</P><Col N="321"/>
        <P>The staff of the Government information services are engaged in the dissemination of information and communicate with all media organisations on a daily basis regarding the communication of Government policies.  The projected cost of the communications unit in 2009 is &euro;294,083, with &euro;153,038 being a direct cost to my Department and &euro;47,005 on average being borne by three other Departments who have staff seconded to the unit.</P>
        <P>The projected cost for 2009 represents a reduction of 2.6% on the 2008 cost, of 11.4% on the 2007 cost and of 20% on the 2006 cost.  In fact, it is the lowest cost since 2003.  This has been achieved through greater efficiency in the operation of the unit and the application of Government policy on reducing staff numbers.  I have no current plans to alter the role of the communications unit.  The role of the unit is under continual review in terms of its efficiency and cost effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Following a recent review of the work of the unit, in conjunction with an audit of Departments&rsquo; usage of external media monitoring companies, various possibilities were explored with a view to improving efficiency, eliminating duplication and implementing cost savings.  To assess whether a viable solution was available that would achieve these objectives, my Department issued a tender for a centralised Government contract for the provision of a press cutting and media monitoring service for all Departments.  Following a detailed examination of the tenders, it was decided not to proceed with the award of the contract.  In fact, it became clear that the current arrangements were considerably more cost-effective than the alternatives proposed.</P>
        <P>Subject to current budgetary constraints, consideration will be given to updating the current somewhat dated equipment in the unit with a view to improving its efficiency and service provision to Departments, thereby reducing the usage of outside media monitoring companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What guidelines are in place and what is the manner in which the Government press secretary and the Government press office deal with complaints, especially to RTE?  I note from a reply to a written question from Deputy Varadkar on 1 April that two complaints have been made by the Government press secretary to RTE since May 2008.  One was in June of last year and the other in March of this year.  The latter complaint related to the drawings hung in the National Gallery of Ireland, which I believe was a rather juvenile exercise.</P>
        <P>My concern is not related to that issue as such, but we have heard reports concerning the way in which the complaint was made directly to the director general of RTE.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if this was the case?  If it was the case, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that the Government press secretary should deal with RTE on matters of programme or news content?  I do not have any objection to the Government press secretary making contact with news editors and I expect he does so on a very regular basis.  However, I was surprised to read that the approach was made directly to the director general.  Was this the case and what is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no guidelines and I do not believe there should be any strict rules of engagement.  There is always a two-way communication process between Government and media organisations and this also applies to Opposition party press officers.  It would be unhelpful to have any form of ban or restrictions on such communications or to suggest that there should be guidelines on Government communications with the media which would not apply in the case of Opposition parties.  Such a scenario would be absolutely unworkable.</P>
        <P>Last month, I read of reports of the communications personnel of the main Opposition party making direct contact with the director general of RTE regarding complaints.  Therefore, it is inaccurate to refer only to disagreement between Government and the media.  People cannot have it both ways.  There should not be a different set of rules for certain press advisers who complain to RTE but not others.  There will always be issues in the relationship between the media and the Government and between the media and Opposition parties.  The matter cannot <Col N="322"/>be dealt with through a vague set of written guidelines.  I am not in favour of any restrictions and a two-way relationship remains appropriate.</P>
        <P>Regarding the specific matter in March raised by the Deputy, the Government press secretary contacted RTE regarding a broadcast last month.  It stated it had already decided the particular broadcast was inappropriate before any complaints were made and this is an important point.  I understand a number of complaints were received.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of contacting the director-general, it may have been that the news editor was not available at the time but I do not know.  However, I was not involved and I did not give any instruction.  Perhaps the fact that they know each other was a means by which he could communicate the seriousness of his concern as quickly as possible to a relevant member of RTE who was available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand what the Taoiseach is saying in terms of formal guidelines but there is a relationship between Government and RTE as the State broadcasting service.  The Government appoints its authority and Government is primarily responsible for the introduction of legislation under which it operates.  Government is responsible for the issue of the licence fee and the level of it.  This is a relationship where care needs to be taken to have a dividing line between that relationship between the role of the Government and that of RTE as a State body which ultimately reports to a Department and a Minister.  To maintain that distinction and the kind of day-to-day contact that will inevitably occur between the Government press secretary and programme makers within the station is a distinction that the Government needs to ensure it honours, lest there should be any suggestion that the Government is exercising any undue influence on RTE and on what it might be broadcasting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore would know more about that than I would.  I have always regarded the Deputy as an acute observer of current affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>No more than myself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what goes on at all.  I only hear reports.  People tell me what was on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and I read about it in the papers the next day.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like myself.  At the same time, in fairness to the Deputy, they know where to find him when they are looking for him.</P>
        <P>When people talk about the independence of organisations it does not mean that contact is precluded or that if there is a complaint to be made either way that people should be too shy about making their views known.  It is important that the relationship is respectful and appropriate.  In this instance the fact that it was something to do with me is irrelevant; the organisation recognised it was inappropriate and that a mistake was made or whatever.  It got through the system, however it got through.  I did not ask for any action to be taken but rather it was a case of people acting on their own initiative and I understand they were not alone in that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach elaborated in his reply that an exercise was undertaken to look at the cost-effectiveness of the service and that it was decided that a centralised service would be less cost-effective.  I ask him to elaborate on what was priced and what were the savings shown up in that exercise.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask a general question about whether he takes responsibility for looking at the cost-effectiveness of back office services in Departments.  I understand on the last count, 85 people are employed in press and information services across the 15 Departments.  This seems excess<Col N="323"/>ive, a total of six or seven people involved in press and information services work for every Minister.  Does the Taoiseach regard it as his role to examine the cost-effectiveness or has he requested an expenditure review exercise to be done on this type of back office service?  It is the case now that every area is being looked at with an eye to making savings and I would be interested to know whether that area has come under scrutiny in any way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The vast majority of the people to whom the Deputy refers deal with the information side of a Department.  They provide information services.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a plethora of people interested in what is happening in the Department of Social and Family Affairs such as people in voluntary organisations and apart from the wider public who need to access information.  There is often talk in this House about the need for public service organisations to be efficient in that regard.  It must be recognised that the vast majority of this work relates to that side of the work of Departments rather than it being a case of press management of ministerial offices or Government issues specifically.</P>
        <P>I do not have the details to hand beyond the reply but it was mentioned before that we should consider whether the service could be centralised and I made inquiries.  When a tender was put out asking for one supplier to provide the requirements for all Departments, it showed that it was going to be more expensive than allowing each Department to provide for itself.  It should be noted that Departments have specialised requirements which are different from Department to Department.  For instance, the requirements of the Department of Finance are different to those of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  While one would have thought it would be a good idea to centralise the service, when this was examined it was discovered that it would not be less expensive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s substantive reply to these questions and I apologise if he has already answered and I am repeating.  Last November I asked the Taoiseach about the then proposed putting to tender of the work of the communications unit or a part of its work.  He indicated that the tendering process was then in train, that he would be subsequently advised of the result of the process and a decision would be taken about proceeding or not.  Has this happened and if so, what is the cost?  The real question is why are we looking again at external supports when within the system, within the public service, there are people who are clearly able and adept at dealing with the issues, apart from the  <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre </i>behind the communications unit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in my reply, I inquired whether a centralised solution was available that would achieve the objectives of improving efficiency, eliminating duplication and implementing cost savings.  A tender was issued for a centralised Government contract for the provision of a press cutting and media monitoring service for all Departments.  However, when the tenders were received it turned out to be a more expensive option than letting the Departments provide it for themselves.  The accommodation of all the needs of every Department in one tender from a single organisation turned out to be less viable than allowing Departments to work individually and collect the information particular to that Department.  This may be surprising but that has been the outcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification, do I take it from that information that the tendering process did not proceed, that the Taoiseach has not allowed access to the service to external interests and that it remains an in-house provision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever the existing arrangements, the proposed new arrangement was not going to be less costly than the existing arrangement.  There may be some Departments using outside media press cutting arrangements but I do not have that information available to me, although that may be the case.  I am not saying it is all in-house but rather that the suggested <Col N="324"/>alternative which might have been regarded as providing cost savings, on examination does not do so and therefore was not proceeded with on that basis.  However, every area of expenditure must be examined for cost-effectiveness.</P>

	<P>Is the communications unit subject to the recruitment embargo?   Did members of the communications unit see last Friday night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and did they report to the Taoiseach on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Sunday 5 April I travelled to Prague to participate in the EU-US Summit.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  This meeting, attended by President Obama, took place against the backdrop of the London G20 Summit on 2 April and the NATO Summit on 3 and 4 April.  The EU-US relationship is of paramount importance, bilaterally and in the context of tackling global challenges.  Among the key issues we discussed in Prague were the global economic crisis, energy and climate change, and regional affairs, including the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.</P>
        <P>On my travel plans for the remainder of 2009, it is my intention to attend the Eastern Partnership Summit on 7 May in Prague.  I will also attend the European Council meetings scheduled for 18-19 June, 29-30 October and 10-11 December.  I have not yet received an agenda for the European Council on 18-19 June and I currently have no meetings with other EU leaders scheduled ahead of the Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention that he will go to the Council on 29-30 October having held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  He has had discussions with colleagues on the timing of that referendum but no date has been set.  I presume the October Council will be the outer limit for having a decision here, or am I mistaken in that?  Does the Taoiseach share my belief that it would be helpful to indicate a date early so the campaign in support of the Lisbon treaty could begin rather than having it deferred and distracted by other political issues that perhaps were a factor in the previous campaign.</P>
        <P>Was there a discussion at those Councils on different models for addressing the banking crisis?  The German approach deserves more attention by our Government.  It requires the <Col N="326"/>separation of the good element of banks from within the existing banks as opposed to what is being proposed by Government.  Did he have the opportunity to examine different models and draw on the experience of other leaders as to their merits and suitability?  The Taoiseach will know there is a growing opinion among the economic community that the solutions being pursued by most governments are expensive for taxpayers and uncertain in their outcomes for banks.  An alternative approach that focuses attention on the creation of a good bank that could borrow is being championed by many.  Taxpayers&rsquo; effort focuses on the good bank, not the legacy, which is left to fend for itself over time.  That is the right way.  It will need co-ordination across countries so that it is not just one country pursuing it.  It has great attractions and I would be interested to hear whether the Taoiseach was able to explore that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot anticipate the date of the referendum.  It will depend on how everything ends up at the June Council meeting.  I take the general point that it would be important thereafter to try to come to a conclusion on the best time to hold the referendum and have everybody behind a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign who was behind it the last time.  People are examining that as we speak.  There is no great difference of opinion between us.  I cannot say whether there will be a referendum before the October Council meeting.  The Government will have to decide on that and in the context of our discussions we will have to ensure, as a precondition for our holding a referendum, that we get what we sought.  Let that process proceed and things will become clearer after the June Council meeting, we hope.</P>
        <P>There are EU guidelines on impaired assets.  On that matter and the recapitalisation question, Chancellor Merkel emphasised at the outset that this is a tool kit and it is a matter for member states to choose.  There is no uniform way by which member governments will come up with a solution to this problem across the union.  There are different requirements, circumstances and types of problems.  The broad EU guidelines that have been set out ensure it is done within a framework that is understood by everybody and involves the Commission, and ensures whatever action is taken is done in as co-ordinated a fashion as possible.</P>
        <P>We work on the basis of advice from people with market ability and experience in the NTMA and others.  We have put forward our proposals on the basis of seeking to protect taxpayers&rsquo; interests in a way that will, hopefully, try to overcome this problem.  The challenge is to underpin domestic and international confidence in our banking system and at the same time have people face up to the writing down requirements that exist to deal with the legacy issues, as Deputy Bruton describes them, separately from the core franchise in which banks should operate.</P>

	<P>Is it still the Government&rsquo;s intention to have agreement concluded at the June summit on the texts required to enable the Government to bring forward a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  What progress has been made on the development of those texts and at what point will the main Opposition parties be advised as to that progress?  Did I detect from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Deputy Bruton that there is some doubt that the agreement on those matters might be concluded at the June summit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I was being appropriate in not presuming on agreement until agreement and approval is provided.  The Council meeting is the format in which a formal decision will be taken in that respect.  In the meantime much preparatory work is being undertaken.  We are working with the Presidency, which has had its own difficulties in terms of the Czech Republic&rsquo;s domestic politics.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been in discussion with Mr. Alexandr Vondra from that Government on many occasions and continues to do so.  Work at a technical level continues with the legal services people and the Commission.  I spoke to President Barroso <Col N="327"/>on the last occasion I attended a Council meeting and I intend in the coming weeks to discuss the matter with Opposition leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the EU Council meeting in June address the so-called guarantees which the Taoiseach and his Government indicated have been won in principle?  Will those guarantees be addressed at the EU Council meeting?  Can the Taoiseach advise what stage these guarantees have reached?  Are they in draft form?  Have they moved forward from principles to actual texts?  Is he prepared to publish those texts?  If not, will he indicate the stage he is now at in the preparation of texts and when he hopes to have a conclusion with regard to same with his EU Council member participants?  Concerning that, what mechanism is intended to make these guarantees legally binding?  That is the critical interest of many people, including this Deputy.</P>
        <P>Will the summit consider the report on active dialogue with citizens on Europe which was recently adopted by the EU Parliament?  Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to read the report?  If so, did he note and does he agree with what I can only regard as its insulting conclusion that &ldquo;the less educated and the less affluent a Union citizen is the more likely he or she will be to oppose further European integration&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We see here a report that equates lack of affluence with ignorance.  That is an outrageous view and it was adopted by the EU Parliament.  What it actually shows is the arrogance of the EU elite.  As the report goes on to state, there certainly is a failure in communication but the failure is not on the part of the EU in communicating its position.  That is understood.  The failure is on the part of the EU to listen to its citizens.  That is exemplified in the Government&rsquo;s position and that of its counterparts within the European elite in respect of the referenda results regarding the EU Constitution-Lisbon treaties <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Ireland, France and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>If the Taoiseach has not had the chance to read the report, will he do so?  Would he agree it is an outrageous assertion to imply that a lack of affluence means ignorance and that this is insulting to citizens of the member states and to the Irish in particular?  What steps will he take to have that report challenged?  Will it be addressed at the EU Council meeting in June?  Will the Taoiseach accept that in the changing economic circumstances, and with the advent of a new EU election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on 5 June, we now have an opportunity to enter into negotiations for a new treaty and to allow the Lisbon treaty to be buried with some dignity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, I do not agree with the analysis of the Deputy in many respects, regardless of the specific report which I have not seen and on which I cannot comment.  A more benign interpretation of the situation might be to say that unless we have a socially inclusive Europe, the relevance of Europe to ordinary citizens is not as obvious as it is to those who see the benefits of the economic and social construct of the European Union at present.  I would be very surprised if the report were to be, given the Deputy&rsquo;s interpretation, but I have not seen it and am not in a position to comment on it with any degree of accuracy.</P>
        <P>However, that would be my understanding of the point that people are trying to make.  Europe must be meaningful for everybody and this must be on the basis of the social market economy which we are trying to develop.  The integration of the European Union and its economy has brought us very many benefits.  It has enabled us to earn a standard of living for our people far in excess of anything we might have hoped for if we had been dealing simply with a free trade area or an area that did not have common rules or was not so protective of <Col N="328"/>the integrity of the Single Market that enables smaller countries, or smaller economic actors, among the big developed economies.  We have been able to compete on the basis of a rules-based system that is at the centre of what the European Union has been about, namely, consolidarity and developing the Union and the nation states within it to the greatest extent possible on the basis of common policies.  That would be my analysis of the situation, rather than the Deputy&rsquo;s.  We must agree to disagree on that.</P>
        <P>The other 26 member states asked us to deal with the concerns we have identified in respect of our rejection of the Lisbon treaty.  An all-party sub-committee met and was very ably chaired and attended by Members of the House.  The House did itself a great favour with the quality of the work that was done and the report that emerged.  I commend everybody who was part of that process which enhanced the parliamentary process in Ireland.  The majority of that committee came to the analysis, backed by empirical survey evidence, that the Irish remain very pro-European in sentiment and are supportive of the Union but obviously have concerns they want addressed.  On the basis of very broad consultative process, listening to the varying views of people and various sides of the argument, the all-party sub-committee helpfully came forward with a very coherent analysis of the areas we must address to try to assuage people&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>At the Council meeting in December we saw a lot of goodwill and solidarity towards Ireland and acceptance and respect for the fact that we have had these concerns.  Our partners wish to help us address them adequately so that our people can look to this issue again.  The contention that the rejection of the treaty means that the people are opposed to the European Union or opposed in principle to the integration of the European economy does not hold water when one analyses the sentiments people expressed.  We must address certain questions and reassure people on certain issues.  One of the great problems is that exaggerated arguments are made to the contrary in respect of issues that are not in the treaty at all.  That does not contribute to an informed democratic debate.  There have been many instances of this.</P>
        <P>A far more moderate and accurate assessment of the situation is that, out of respect for the vote of the people, we seek to address the issues identified as those which have caused most concern and on which people need reassurance.  In respect of the guarantees we received, it has been made clear by our colleagues that they do not wish to reopen the re-ratification of the treaty in their own national parliaments or in their own countries.  However, they are prepared to give legal effect to those issues for which we sought legal guarantees in respect of subsequent accession treaties that would be ratified, and to incorporate them in that way.  That is a mutually satisfactory conclusion at which to arrive given the necessity for us to try to address the issues involved and at the same time to respect the decision of others to ratify the treaty under their own constitutional arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Contrary to what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asserted, in the lead up to the Lisbon treaty the EU was more involved in listening than it had ever been.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, and Deputies from all parties were involved in exhaustive work, preparing the ground for the treaty.  It is not that the elite is not listening.  However, given the very good work of the sub-committee on Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union, does the Taoiseach envisage any further work for that group now that the Forum on Europe no longer exists?  Does he believe it has a continuing role?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
        <P>Finally, in respect of the frameworks for financial dealings with the banks, the EU has not included in its list the type of framework suggested by the famous economist, Joseph Stiglitz, and several other people including George Soros, namely, this &ldquo;good bank&rdquo; creation.  Would the Taoiseach seek to have that as part of the framework, so that at least this option would be <Col N="329"/>on the table and examined as part of the menu?  The Government has not looked at it to date and I believe it offers really good prospects for governments right across the EU.  Could he, perhaps, pursue it as a matter that should be put on the list?</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach did not respond to my specific questions on whether the guarantees have been committed to paper in text form, what point this process has reached and what measures he envisages bringing forward in terms of their legally binding status.  While Deputy Bruton referred to my point about not listening, he spoke only about the lead-up to the Lisbon treaty.  My point is that the Government has failed to listen to the result of the referendum, and since. </P>

We have been involved in an all-party initiative on trying to come up with constructive proposals that move us forward while at the same time upholding our national interests.  Ultimately, the people will be the arbiter of these decisions.  That is part of the democratic life of the country.  I do not accept the idea that we must not discuss this matter any further or decide that there are ways forward other than &mdash; as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in would contend &mdash; a total rejection of the treaty, seeking to impose a position that the other 26 member states must accept.  They want to help us find a solution to this problem other than the one Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in suggests.  In my opinion, his suggestion would have very severe consequences for our national interests.

However, while discussions are taking place, there is a deliberative process in train which has to be gone through.  We are engaged with the Presidency and legal services on these issues. </P>
        <P>On Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s point, we should examine how the Oireachtas might use this democratic forum as a means of helping to put forward views and listening to various ideas.  We should consider it in the context of how we might add to people&rsquo;s understanding of the broad issues and the context of the decisions we will have to take.  I have no problem with that.</P>
        <P>Regarding the &ldquo;impaired assets&rdquo; to which he referred, obviously ECOFIN and the eurogroup will look at any ideas that are put forward to see whether they can be agreed and incorporated into the wider framework.

The T&aacute;naiste told us last Thursday the heads of the Bill would be published shortly.  Now the Minister for Finance has said he will establish it on some kind of a non-statutory basis.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach be precise about when the legislation and the heads of the Bill will be published, as promised by the T&aacute;naiste last Thursday?  I understand the job of the NAMA will be to acquire property but it cannot do that unless it has legal authority to do so and is a legal entity.  Any advance work would seem to be around the area of the valuing and discounting of properties which I understood was to be part of its work.  It does not have a legal basis to do that until legislation is enacted.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>What will a non-statutory an bord bailout do?  It will not have legal authority to do anything.  There is considerable confusion about this and the Taoiseach should clarify exactly when we will see the legislation and the heads of the Bill.</P>

	<P>I support the appeals of the earlier contributors in regard to the proposed establishment of the national asset management agency.  The Opposition voices can, and should, make an important input into the consideration of how this agency should be established and the work with which it will be entrusted.  It is the single biggest roll of a dice with public funding given all the risk factors involved.  </P>
        <P>It is crucial there is full consideration and that we are not left having to react and respond to legislation in a take it or leave it situation with minuscule and minor amendments being considered as a sop to Opposition voices.  The central thrust of the Government&rsquo;s approach must be included in the legislation.</P>
        <P>There must be full consideration and some value and respect given to the concerns to which Opposition voices have referred time after time since this was announced in the supplementary budget announced by the Minister for Finance.  I appeal that the Taoiseach allows for proper debate on this matter before it proceeds to a point of such certainty that there will be no Government or Opposition substantive amendment arising out of the discussion on the legislation in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interests of transparency, the Minister made the policy announcement as to what direction the Government would take in regard to this matter in his Supplementary Budget Statement.  We have said the heads of the Bill will be prepared in the coming weeks.  The agency will be put on a statutory basis.  In the meantime, and quite properly, preparations are being made so that when the legislation is enacted, the agency will become operational immediately thereafter and will get on with its business, including assessing the situation in regard to the logistical questions. Human resources and recruitment processes must be worked out.</P>
        <P>One can do nothing, wait for the legislation to be enacted and then spend more time going off to get people or one can do that in the meantime and ensure that when the agency is given statutory authority, it can get on with its business.  That is what is happening and what happens when any organisation is set up.  That is how we will proceed.  There is no mystery about it.  When we debate the legislation in the House, we will be able to debate all these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to open the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009.  It is a mark of the importance of the Bill that the debate on it in the Oireachtas has commenced so soon after its publication and presentation to this House.  The primary purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the use in evidence of material gained by means of secret surveillance in criminal proceedings.  At the same time, the Bill will ensure that the encroachment on certain rights relating to personal privacy and privacy of property, particularly a dwelling, which this entails is limited and proportionate.  It deals with these objectives in two ways.  First, the Bill provides for the first time a basis in law for secret surveillance by the organs of the State, principally the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its role as the primary law enforcement and security agency of the State.  The Defence Forces are included because of their parallel responsibility in protecting the security of the State, mainly against threats posed by subversives and international terrorism.  The Revenue Commissioners have a frontline role in protecting the financial interests of the State and the European Union and guarding against the illegal importation of drugs and firearms.  It is easy to see how the interests of these agencies may coincide  In the case of joint operations by the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners, money laundering and tax evasion are targeted.  That is a key element in the fight against organised and subversive crime.  Second, the Bill sets out the rules that will apply to the admissibility of that evidence.</P>
        <P>As the Garda Commissioner said at the launch of the Bill on 17 April, surveillance is as old as policing.  It takes many forms, the simplest of which is keeping a track on a person&rsquo;s movements on foot or in a car, or using binoculars, a camera or CCTV in public places.  Clearly, this Bill is not about such forms of surveillance.  The area of electronic surveillance, such as the interception of telecommunications, is the subject of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications (Messages) Act 1993.  Secret electronic surveillance devices, which are specifically designed to eavesdrop, film, monitor movements and record information, are being increasingly used in the 21st century.  This Bill seeks to regulate the use of such devices by the agencies concerned.  As secret surveillance is invasive and intrusive, the principles of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights must be considered before any interference with privacy rights can be contemplated.  It is generally accepted that in a democratic society, a state may exercise special powers denied to ordinary citizens in certain circumstances and in the common interest.  The right to privacy, which may be interfered with in certain circumstances and subject to certain safeguards like those set out in the Bill, is a case in point.  This area was examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1996 consultation paper and again in its 1998 report, Privacy: Surveillance and the Interception of Communications.</P>
        <P>Another area that is protected under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights is the right to a fair trial and the associated evidential issues, such as admissibility and disclosure of evidence.  These matters are dealt with in the Bill.  As I said at the outset, this legislation is designed to facilitate the use in evidence of information and material obtained by secret surveillance.  These matters have been carefully considered.</P>
        <P>The legislation has been drafted with the relevant principles in mind.  I believe we have struck the correct balance in the Bill between the competing interests of privacy and due process on the one hand, and the protection of people, the prevention of crime and the security elements on the other hand.  This is reflected in the fact that the Bill has received a general welcome from all sides in this House and from the various NGOs with a particular interest in this area.  The Garda has been reluctant to use evidence of this nature in court, mainly for legal and <Col N="337"/>operational reasons, but that policy has now changed.  In the opinion of the Garda Commissioner, the changing nature of crime, particularly the growth of organised and ruthless gangs, requires the security response to be stepped up.  The threat to society and the integrity and effectiveness of the criminal justice system that is posed by these gangs requires a corresponding robust legal response.  I refer in particular to the attacks on ordinary people going about their daily lives.</P>
        <P>The use of sophisticated surveillance devices is an essential tool in the fight against serious crime in many jurisdictions.  It provides tactical and strategic information for various agencies in their respective fields of operation and facilitates effective cross-agency co-operation, as required.  It delivers real-time intelligence on the plans and actions of criminals, subversives, terrorists and other sources.  The use of forms of surveillance allows various agencies to disrupt the plans and frustrate the actions of such people.  It can identify the perpetrators and facilitate their arrest.  It can reveal the existence of new sources, from which a broader understanding of the threat posed by criminals and others can be assessed.  Accordingly, preventive strategies can be developed by agencies.  The use of secret surveillance after a crime has been committed can lead to the arrest of the perpetrators.  It can also assist with the recovery of the proceeds of crime and help to unravel any related money-laundering operations.  Crucially, surveillance can prevent loss of life.  It is of inestimable value in dealing with ransom cases and crimes of revenge and retribution within the criminal community.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline the main provisions of the Bill in a general way.  Crucially, it will include strong checks and balances in the regulatory regime that governs the use of surveillance.  In nearly all cases, the use of surveillance devices will be subject to an authorisation issued by a judge of the District Court, on foot of an application based on specific conditions from a superior officer of the relevant agency.  Authorisations will be issued for a period of up to three months and will be renewable on application to the court for further periods of up to three months.  In the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, applications will be made by a member not below the rank of superintendent.  In the case of the Defence Forces, the applicant will be a member not below the rank of colonel.  The appropriate grade in the Revenue Commissioners will be principal officer.  In applying for an authorisation, the officer concerned must believe that the surveillance is the least intrusive means necessary and that it is proportionate to its objective of investigating or preventing serious crime.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows for two exceptions to be made to the requirement for judicial authorisation to initiate surveillance.  The first of these arises in cases of extreme urgency where there is a likelihood of a person escaping justice, where evidence is likely to be destroyed or where there is a risk to the security of the State if immediate action is not taken.  The limitation to 72 hours of an approval for the use of surveillance in situations of this nature underpins the requirement that emergency approvals will be used in limited circumstances.  Any extension of the time for surveillance beyond the 72-hour period must be authorised by a judge.  The second exception concerns the use of tracking devices, the purpose of which is to provide information on the location of a person, place or thing.  An approval by a superior officer for the use of such a device is necessary.  Such approvals can extend to a maximum of four months.  The Bill provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may make regulations prescribing a period of less than four months to protect the privacy rights of persons in the interest of the security of the State of the detection and prevention of crime.</P>
        <P>The superior officers who grant approvals will be required to make a report on the approval to include a summary of the results of the surveillance engaged in to an officer at a senior level within seven days.  This will be to an assistant commissioner in the case of the Garda and to an officer of equivalent seniority of rank in the other agencies governed by the Bill.</P><Col N="338"/>
        <P>A key element of the Bill is its facilitation of the use of surveillance material as evidence in criminal proceedings.  It provides for the admissibility of material obtained lawfully under the Act.  It also makes provision that where there has been an inadvertent error, omission or failure to fulfil the requirements of the Act, evidence may be admissible if the court, having regard to particular matters set out in the Bill, finds that it is in the interests of justice to do so.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for a complaints procedure where a person who believes that he or she has been subjected to surveillance may complain to the existing complaints referee Judge Carroll Moran, of the Circuit Court who adjudicates on complaints under the 1993 Interception Act.  He is empowered to investigate the matter and he may order certain actions to be taken if a breach of the Act is discovered.  This may include the quashing of the surveillance authorisation involved or a recommendation for the payment of a compensatory amount up to &euro;5,000 to the complainant.</P>
        <P>Similar to the 1993 Act, the operation of the surveillance legislation will be subject to the oversight of a designated High Court judge, who will report on the operation of the legislation in respect of authorised and approved surveillance to the Taoiseach, on at least an annual basis.  This will be a separate appointment by the President of the High Court.  The report will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This procedure adds to the safeguards already outlined in the Bill regarding the protection of privacy and other rights.  The complaints referee and the designated judge will have full access to all materials they require regarding the surveillance operation.</P>
        <P>I will now set out more fully the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with definitions, several of which are worth explaining further.  First, in defining member of the Defence Forces and member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purposes of surveillance under the Bill, members of the respective reserve forces are excluded.  Any powers of surveillance granted to the Garda or the Defence Forces are not granted to members of their respective reserves.  Second, revenue offences are defined for the purpose of the Bill as arrestable offences under specific Acts primarily dealing with tax fraud and smuggling.  Surveillance powers of the Revenue Commissioners under this Bill are restricted to these offences.  Furthermore, the Bill defines surveillance as monitoring, observing, listening to or making recordings of persons, places or things by or with the assistance of surveillance devices.  It does not include situations in which persons are followed or observed without the use of surveillance devices.  The Bill defines such surveillance devices as apparatus designed or adapted for use in surveillance but it specifically excludes certain devices in certain circumstances such as devices designed to improve night vision where the image is not being recorded, CCTV and cameras where they are used to photograph persons in places to which the public has access.</P>
        <P>Sections 2 and 3 provide that the Bill applies to surveillance carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners and that any such surveillance may be carried out only in accordance with the Act.  Nothing in the Act will render unlawful any activity which would otherwise be lawful.  An example in this regard is the provision in the 1984 Criminal Justice Act and the corresponding 1987 regulations for the tape recording of interviews with suspects.</P>
        <P>Section 4 deals with applications for authorisations to conduct surveillance.  It provides criteria which must be satisfied before an application can be made.  In the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, surveillance can be sought as part of an operation concerning an arrestable offence, to prevent an arrestable offence and in respect of the security of the State.  The Defence Forces may apply for an authorisation regarding matters concerning the security of the State and the Revenue Commissioners may apply in respect of revenue offences.  In all cases there must be <Col N="339"/>reasonable grounds for believing that the surveillance is necessary for the purpose intended and, further, that such surveillance being sought to be authorised is proportionate to the objectives and is reasonable.</P>
        <P>Section 5 deals with the issuing of authorisations for surveillance by a District Court judge, applications for which may be made <i>ex parte</i> and shall be heard in private.  Before a judge issues an authorisation, he or she must be satisfied that it is justified to do so having regard to all relevant circumstances and that any surveillance is not primarily directed at privileged communications.  An authorisation may be issued for a maximum of three months.  The judge, when issuing an authorisation, may authorise the person named in it, or other members, or other persons considered necessary to enter property, if necessary by reasonable force, to carry out such surveillance.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for the variation of the conditions attached to an authorisation and for the renewal of an authorisation for a further period of up to three months.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides for the approval of surveillance in situations where the matter is urgent and there are reasonable grounds to believe that before an authorisation could be issued, it is likely that a person would abscond to avoid justice, evidence would be destroyed, or the security of the State would likely be compromised.  In such a case, a superior officer may give approval for surveillance on grounds connected with the issuing of an authorisation for a limited operational period of up to 72 hours.  If continued surveillance is required, an authorisation will have to be obtained from a judge of the District Court.  The section also requires the keeping of written records and the making of reports by the parties involved.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for the approval of the use of tracking devices for a maximum period of four months.  Judicial authorisations are not required for their use, but the approval of a superior officer is necessary based on strict qualifying criteria in line with the criteria for the approval of surveillance.  Such tracking devices would be used to monitor the movements of persons, vehicles or things and provide information on the location of same.  The Bill requires that written records and reports have to be maintained in these cases.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides for the retention for a specified period of all official documents relating to authorisations for surveillance, reports, written records of approval sanctioning surveillance in urgent cases, the use of tracking devices and surveillance.  This period is either three years from the end of the surveillance, or the day after the information is no longer required for any prosecution or appeal for which it is relevant.</P>
        <P>Section 10 deals with the secure storage of, and authorised access to, information and documents generated as a result of the carrying out of surveillance, with the intent of protecting persons&rsquo; privacy and other rights.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for a complaints procedure where a person believes that he or she may be the subject of surveillance.  In a case where there has been a contravention of a provision of sections 4 to 8 of the Bill, the referee has the power to direct the quashing of an authorisation, the destruction of any information obtained and to recommend payment of compensation up to &euro;5,000.  If the judge believes, however, that it is in the public interest to do so, he or she may decline to make such directions or recommendations.  Where the referee finds no such contravention, he or she will notify the applicant stating only that there has been no such contravention.  The referee may also refer the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Finance depending on the particular State agency concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides for the appointment of a judge of the High Court to oversee the operation of the main provisions of the Bill and to make regular reports to the Taoiseach in the matter.  Such reports will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="340"/>
        <P>Section 13 is a confidentiality provision.  It prohibits the disclosure of any information about the operation of the Bill, unless it is made to an authorised person, as defined, and it is connected with specified criteria such as the investigation and prosecution of offences or in the interests of the security of the State.  The section applies to members and officers of the agencies concerned, including members of respective reserve forces, as well as to persons engaged on contract work.  It also applies to persons generally.  Breach of this provision is an offence which may be prosecuted summarily or on indictment.</P>
        <P>Section 14 is a core provision of the Bill.  It deals with the issue of admissibility of evidence in the narrow and very specific context of evidence obtained by means of surveillance.  It provides that such evidence, notwithstanding any error or omission on the face of an authorisation or a written record of approval, or notwithstanding any failure by any member or officer to comply with a requirement of an authorisation or written record, is admissible in certain clearly defined circumstances, where the error or omission was inadvertent or where the member or officer acted in good faith and the failure was inadvertent and where the interests of justice would be served by the admission of the information.</P>
        <P>The court, when deciding on the admissibility of such evidence, will have regard in particular to matters set out in the section, whether the error or omission or failure was serious or merely technical in nature, the nature of any right infringed, any circumstances of urgency and the possible prejudicial effects of the information and the probative value of same.  In effect, this means that a breach of statute-based procedures or a failure to fulfil particular statutory requirements will not, of themselves, mean that the material in question must be excluded.</P>
        <P>Section 15 deals with the disclosure of information about surveillance in court proceedings.  It provides that disclosure by means of discovery or otherwise shall not be made unless a court authorises otherwise.  A court shall not authorise such a disclosure unless it is satisfied that to do so would not create a risk to the security of the State, the ability of the State to protect persons, including witnesses and the integrity and effectiveness of security and crime fighting operations.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P>Section 16 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance may make regulations under the Act.  Any such regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 17 amends the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide for the non-application of the provisions of the Act to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  This is in line with the existing non-application of provisions of the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998, and the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.</P>
        <P>Section 18 provides for a technical amendment of section 32A of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 so as to extend the provisions of that section to include this Act.  Section 19 is a standard provision and provides for the Bill&rsquo;s Short Title.</P>
        <P>I regard this Bill as a significant advance in the process of bringing those involved in serious criminal, subversive or terrorist activity to justice.  It is a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the fight against crime and to the safety of all our citizens.  It adds to the draconian measures already introduced by the Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007 in dealing with the prosecution of gangland crime.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides an appropriate and, more importantly, a proportionate balance between the competing demands of protecting the privacy rights of persons and of ensuring that we live in a society that is safe from the threats of violent crime and terrorism.  The Bill respects our obligations under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, while <Col N="341"/>ensuring that effective mechanisms are in place in supporting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies in carrying out their work.</P>
        <P>The benefits and risks associated with using the material gained as a result of surveillance in evidence involve a complex interplay of legal, technical, operational, resource and organisational matters.  The security of the systems in use must be protected.  At the same time, technological developments in this area are continuing to evolve so quickly that the potential intrusiveness into our personal lives requires that it may only be resorted to in a proportionate way, accompanied by proper and effective legal safeguards.  I think the House will fully agree with me that the Bill now before it meets these requirements.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention briefly my intention to introduce further measures to tackle organised criminal gangs in a separate Bill, which complements to a large extent the provisions in this Bill.  In light of the ongoing intimidation of witnesses and jurors, I am considering that the powers available to combat subversive organisations be applied equally to criminal gangs.  This would mean that crimes involving criminal gangs would be scheduled offences for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act, so that they will be tried in the Special Criminal Court, unless the DPP directs otherwise.  I am also considering the introduction of several new organised crime offences with a maximum prison sentence of 15 years to life.</P>
        <P>There are complex legal and constitutional issues involved in these proposals.  I am in close consultation with the Attorney General and also with others in my Department on these matters.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House and thank the Opposition for considering it so quickly after its publication.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I wish to support the Bill and I welcome the initiative that has been introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I acknowledge the work undertaken, particularly by the Law Reform Commission a long number of years ago, which prepared the ground for this legislation.  I also wish to acknowledge the work, in more recent times, of the Oireachtas Library research team whose members prepared a fine document which has just come to my attention.  Due to pressure of time I have not yet had an opportunity to read it in full, other than giving it a cursory glance.  However, it seems to be a fine document and will be a great resource for Members in dealing with this legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for making themselves available to provide a briefing which I attended.  The Bill will allow background material gained by covert surveillance to be used in evidence, either to support criminal charges or as a basis for a charge of conspiracy in its own right.  While garda&iacute; have been conducting overt and covert surveillance for many years, this Bill will leave us in less doubt that the information so gathered can not only be presented as evidence in court, but also be admissible as evidence.  It can also form part of the body of opinion that will ultimately lead to the conviction of guilty parties.</P>
        <P>I hope we can complete the legislation by the summer recess.  In that regard I look forward to facilitating the Minister on Committee Stage, although we must have an opportunity of ensuring that we can go through the Bill on a line by line basis.  Fine Gael will support any measures to ensure that organised criminals in the State, and gangland crime in general, are successfully tackled.</P>
        <P>Looking back, we see a conviction rate in the order of 12% for the 171 shootings that took place in the past decade.  There can be no doubt, therefore, that our evidence-gathering mechanisms require an overhaul.  This legislation will no doubt assist in that regard.  Covert surveillance legislation is essential in the fight against organised crime.  Currently, garda&iacute; moni<Col N="342"/>tor criminals under targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.  It seems to be somewhat less than satisfactory, however, if the material they gather in the course of a criminal investigation cannot be admissible at a subsequent trial.  That is unsustainable, so I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s commitment towards addressing this difficulty.</P>
        <P>However, in its own right, this legislation will not comprehensively address gangland crime, organised criminals and the threat posed to our democratic society.  Alongside this legislation, the Minister must ensure, for example, that the resources available to the State prosecution services are such as to be satisfactory to meet the needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The DPP himself has indicated that given a 3% cut in his funding for last year, it will be impossible for his office to process its current workload.  Nonetheless, we hear flowery statements on the Minister&rsquo;s part and tough talking to the effect that gangland crime is to be no more and that all the resources of the State will be made available.  These utterances are echoed by his Government colleagues, particularly in the Limerick area, yet we have an unprecedented statement of anxiety from no less a figure than the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>It is also important that the Garda national surveillance unit, which I understand will run the new bugging and tapping operation, is properly resourced.  The Garda Commissioner is on record as saying that this legislation will not require the establishment or introduction of a new Garda unit and that the national surveillance unit will be charged with responsibility for running the operation.  However, that body will be charged with handling an increased workload, on the basis that written records of procedures must be kept.  The legislation places a considerable onus of responsibility as far as written records are concerned, and I am sure we will see more of that in the ministerial regulations.  This level of resources will demand a commitment on the Minister&rsquo;s part that I am sure will be forthcoming before we conclude the debate on this Bill.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier on the Order of Business, the establishment of a DNA database is long overdue.  It will be a key factor in improving the abysmal &mdash; I do not use that word lightly &mdash; conviction rate for the heinous crime of murder in this State.  We, in this Republic, should maintain a DNA database, as other European states do, and participate in information sharing in this area.  I look forward to the publication of the relevant legislation this year.</P>
        <P>The matter of resources for the Garda and State prosecution services arises.  It flies in the face of waste management practice and curtailment efforts in the Minister&rsquo;s Department and agencies under his jurisdiction that a bill of &euro;1,000 was paid to change a light bulb in a Garda station.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to have a word with his learned colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who recently retained his position in the Department of Finance.  At a time when expenditure on the building programme for Garda stations has been slashed and Garda stations are to suffer a reduction in activity, it is farcical that the Office of Public Works, in the knowledge of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can pay bills of &euro;1,000 to change a light bulb or two.  I ask the Minister to conduct an investigation into this matter to determine what precisely are the circumstances of the case.  I wonder whether Mr. Colm McCarthy and his colleagues, from whom we await a report, have visited a couple of Garda stations in the course of their review.</P>
        <P>In the context of forthcoming miscellaneous provisions legislation on the fight against crime, I ask the Minister to examine a Private Members&rsquo; Bill I published late last year.  His record on accepting or even acknowledging Private Members&rsquo; Bills is poor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is for sure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will read them provided they are not plagiarised. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="343"/>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not expect the Minister to accept my Bill given his form in this area and for this reason I have not even pressed it as a priority for Private Members&rsquo; time.  The Minister&rsquo;s forthcoming miscellaneous provisions Bill should tighten up loopholes in the matter of sentencing.  It should remove automatic remission and provide that remission be granted where good conduct has been observed.  Persons convicted of serious crime, specifically gangland activities, should not have automatic remission unless they are, in the opinion of the parole board, less likely to engage in recidivist behaviour.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming legislation should also increase penalties for the possession of blades and firearms to make them more of a deterrent.  The Minister should also consider introducing criminal organisation civil restriction orders, under which a judge can restrict the movement of gangsters and their association with certain individuals.  Electronic tagging, which was provided for in legislation enacted under the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, has not yet been activated.  The Minister should address this matter.  I will discuss criminal, jury and special courts in the context of gangland crime later.</P>
        <P>While we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to examine the exclusionary rule, I note the Minister has embarked upon an amending process.  As he will be aware, earlier this year my Seanad colleague, Senator Eugene Regan, published a Bill dealing specifically with the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials.  It is extraordinary that the Minister urged his Fianna F&aacute;il troops and their Green Party colleagues in the Seanad to vote against the Bill.  While I welcome his subsequent decision to introduce changes in this area, it is a monument to his political pride that he had a proposal designed to do exactly what is proposed in his subsequent legislation voted down in the Seanad.  Despite the approach taken by the Minister, I do not have a difficulty in supporting his Bill and I do not propose to take the narrow, politically partisan line he so favours.</P>
        <P>In light of the significant increase in criminal activity, particularly in the organised crime area, it is important to ensure certain evidence in criminal trials can be admitted in court.  Criminal gangs are running the show in certain communities, terrorising localities and intimidating individuals and families.  It is extraordinary that evidence is ruled inadmissible in court when it has been obtained by chance or when a minor clerical error is identified.  The &ldquo;fruit of the poisonous tree&rdquo; principle, as coined by the Federal Supreme Court in the United States, is the basis for such rulings.  It is unsustainable that numerous criminal cases have been thrown out of court on technicalities, with the result that criminals have been granted permission to remain at large and perpetrate further acts of violence against communities and individuals.  While I regret that the Minister&rsquo;s pride has taken precedence over combating criminal activity, I will nonetheless support the measures in the Bill which were first proposed in Senator Regan&rsquo;s legislation.</P>
        <P>Zero tolerance was the major electoral platform which swept the Fianna F&aacute;il Party back into office in 1997.  It is important, 11 years on, to assess the commitment the party made in this regard which has not materialised along the lines promised.  Gangland figures have no fear of the law.  Convictions have been secured in 14 of the 140 gangland murders committed since 1998.  In 2008, the number of incidents involving pipe bombs, grenades and improvised devices in Dublin increased from 24 in 2007 to 106, a staggering rise of 340% in one year.  Of 171 gun murders committed in the State since the Fianna F&aacute;il Party promise to implement a policy of zero tolerance was first placed on billboards throughout the country, only 22 convictions have been secured.  The average time served by those who have been convicted and put away for murder, the most serious crime on the Statute Book, is 15 years.  A minimum mandatory sentence of 25 years is required for persons convicted of murder, save in the most exceptional circumstances.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>To date in 2009, there have been 12 gangland murders.  It is clear that gangland criminals have stepped up a gear and possess superior technology and equipment to that of the Garda, which still awaits basic vital resources such as the roll out of national digital radio about which we have been hearing for 11 years.  The legislation affords the Minister an opportunity to ensure, for the first time, that modern equipment and communications technologies are available to assist the Garda, Naval Service, Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise in the fight against organised crime.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago, the Government gave a commitment to provide a national digital radio service.  The contract was only awarded in 2007.  It is still, in spite of a number of press conferences held on the issue, only available in parts of Dublin.  The current analogue radio system is unsafe and has been known to have been intercepted by criminals and gangland figures, so the digital radio service would provide increased protection for garda&iacute; on operational duty.</P>
        <P>Increased radio coverage will help and assist in this Bill.  If garda&iacute; are to monitor criminals on a covert basis, they also need to have the basic overt equipment, such as a radio that works, rather than having garda&iacute; using their personal mobile phones to pass on vital information in the area of intelligence gathering and detection.  This Bill will ensure the national unit dealing with it is given greater armoury by this House.</P>
        <P>The freeze on recruitment will mean a decline in Garda numbers from the end of this year onwards.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Ahern could put on the record the situation regarding Templemore and the Garda college.  There are some 160 garda&iacute; in the training unit there providing necessary training.  Approximately 100 recruits will come in early next month and then, I understand, the college will be mothballed for at least two years and perhaps more.  This matter needs to be addressed and we need to know the Minister&rsquo;s plans.  Jobs are currently being lost.  Staff have been let go and others have been notified to the effect that their future is uncertain.  I want to know what is happening to the full-time Garda training force in Templemore and what future plans the Minister has for its employment or re-deployment.</P>
        <P>There is also an expertise and experience drain that the 1% pension levy has imposed on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where, I understand, many experienced and loyal members of the force at all levels, including some at very high ranking levels, are opting for retirement, given the adverse personal consequences of the levy.  The pension levy on garda&iacute; will force people into early retirement, thus introducing something of an experience drain on the force which will have serious consequences.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has been in operation since 2005 and has been in place nationwide since 2006, the primary aim of which is to target active criminals.  In 2008, &euro;20 million was ring-fenced specifically for Operation Anvil.  However, only &euro;21 million is ring-fenced this year.  I find it difficult to see how new legislation can assist in the waging of war against gangland criminals if there is not an appropriate matching by the State of the necessary resources.  I heard what the Minister, Deputy Ahern and senior garda&iacute; said about Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>RT&Eacute; broadcast a &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on gangland and drug-related murders on 2 March.  A community garda in Finglas is quoted as saying Operation Anvil was operated in the &ldquo;K&rdquo; district, mainly in Finglas, seven days a week until recently, where, in the last number of weeks, it has been cut from seven days a week to four days a week, from Thursday to Sunday.  It now operates only at night time, whereas it had run from Monday to Sunday, day and night.  This is a direct result of the cuts inflicted by the Minister, Deputy Ahern on the Garda.  The area referred to in west Dublin is one which has seen gangland activity of the most vicious type, with a number of murders in recent times.</P><Col N="345"/>
        <P>In a response to a recent parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister, Deputy Ahern denied any reduction in activity by Operation Anvil in the Finglas area.  What is happening here?  The Minister is not giving the full picture to the House and is withholding information or he is not aware of what is happening on the ground, because what he said to me in response to a question is in direct contradiction to what community garda&iacute; and officers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are saying on the ground.</P>
        <P>In the context of this Bill, there is the ongoing matter of bail.  Serious criminals, some of whom are gangland figures, are being granted bail from the courts with some ease.  A review, which may have been referred to by the Minister on a number of occasions, does not appear to be forthcoming and we do not know where he stands on the matter of bail and the changes, if any, to bail.  He might let us know what are his views.</P>
        <P>Regarding the witness protection programme, I accept the Bill provides for the Garda to place covert audio and visual recording equipment in the homes of criminals and other places which they may, from time to time, frequent.  This is good and may also lesson the need for the Garda to rely on witness evidence in court.  It may reduce the number of witnesses who need to avail of the witness protection programme.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, the success of the witness protection programme has been extremely limited.  The Garda Commissioner conceded that asking people to give evidence and relocate abroad was difficult and I accept that.  We are a small community and family, friends and neighbours are important and it is not easy to expect people to uproot and leave communities where they may have lived for generations and set up abroad, often with a different identity.</P>
        <P>Former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Noel Conroy, goes further and has said many people are simply too scared to give evidence against armed drug gangs.  That may be putting the finger on the matter.  Recently, the DPP, Mr. James Hamilton expressed his doubts about the witness protection programme and said it was of limited use in tackling gangland crime because the demands on people entering the programme were fairly drastic.  The number of people who have passed through the witness protection programme is unknown.  In 1999 we spent &pound;41,000 on the programme and this year &euro;1.2 million has been set aside for it.  The spending on it has grown enormously but the fund remains modest.  It seems to me relatively few people are being maintained under the programme.  Perhaps the Minister could let us know what is the situation.</P>
        <P>There is also the question of bench warrants which, if we are serious about a comprehensive attack on gangland and organised crime, needs to be looked at.  This matter has been raised here on a regular basis.  There are some 30,000 outstanding bench warrants, some of which are in respect of fairly senior, well known gangland figures.  We had a totally unacceptable situation in Limerick earlier this year, when a known gangland figure, against whom a bench warrant had been issued and perhaps for his own protection, walked into a Garda station asked garda&iacute; to execute the warrant as he had come in.</P>
        <P>It seems an extraordinary lapse, which has happened under the Minister&rsquo;s watch, if there can be 30,000 outstanding bench warrants, some against serious gangland figures and well known criminals, and there is not the wherewithal on his part to deal with the matter in a satisfactory way.  I remind him of the programme for Government commitments on organised crime in 2007, only two years ago.</P>
        <P>The Government committed itself to the fight against organised crime.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led coalition made two specific commitments on gangland crime.  The first one has probably been used in Cork, the home of the Acting Chairman.  It involves the introduction of divestitures under which defendants would be required to divest themselves of interests in tainted enterprises, restrictions would be imposed on the future activities and investments of individ<Col N="346"/>uals, and the dissolution or reorganisation of any enterprise could be ordered.  This has not happened; I have not actually heard much about it.</P>
        <P>The second commitment was to introduce trusteeships which would allow the courts to empower trustees to run organisations that are infiltrated or controlled by criminal elements.  The Minister might update us on the progress made on these measures.</P>
        <P>Before I conclude I will mention special courts, to which the Minister made reference in a press conference announcing this legislation.  He may have been referring to this in the final couple of paragraphs of his speech earlier, when he stated he had other measures to introduce.  If the Minister is thinking of using the Special Criminal Court for gangland offences, I wonder about the legal advice in respect of constitutional concerns.  What has changed since last November when the Taoiseach, responding to such calls from me and my party, referred to section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006?  This section provides that a person convicted of gang membership may be sentenced to five years in prison.  The Taoiseach said this was inoperative and might in effect be unconstitutional.  This was based on legal advice he had received, presumably from the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach then, instead, addressed the possibility of using the Offences Against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court against organised crime.  He rightly said that the Supreme Court had declined to accept the word of a superintendent where a person had denied involvement on oath and where there was no corroborating evidence to support the original allegation.  The Minister is on record as having indicated he intended to introduce a law which would try alleged gangland criminals in the Special Criminal Court.  How can that be reconciled with the statement of the Taoiseach?  Was the Taoiseach badly advised with regard to this matter?  The Attorney General might wish to clarify the situation.  This is of some importance.</P>
        <P>For Committee Stage, we need to deal with the issue of self-certification and what constitutes urgency.  Somebody is on record as saying an authorisation would be granted on an urgent basis where it would be or might be authorised by a judge.  We need to tease this out, and we will do so on Committee Stage.  The matters of the right to privacy and judicial oversight are also important, as are the forms and procedures, under section 7, which must be carefully crafted.  Perhaps the House will have the opportunity to see these before they are in common use by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I also referred earlier to the exclusionary rule.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work the Minister has done on this Bill.  He will have the support of Fine Gael in this and other initiatives he undertakes to change the law on gangland crime.  However, it is one thing to change the law; it is another to provide adequate resources for the relevant State agencies.  I hope this will not suffer unduly in the context of the current economic crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I too broadly welcome this Bill, especially as it was prompted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers of Surveillance) Bill 2007, which I published in November 2007 on behalf of the Labour Party.  Not, as Deputy Flanagan remarked, that one would know that from listening to the Minister, who has not even referred to the fact that a Private Members&rsquo; Bill was published on the subject.  The important thing, however, is that there has been a major shift in official thinking since that Labour Party Bill was published in November 2007.  It has been prompted by the gangland killings which are now claiming innocent lives.  At the time I published the Bill, neither the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Minister favoured such a measure.  Indeed, the then Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, delivered himself of the opinion that by using bugged and intercepted conversations as evidence in prosecutions, the force ran the risk of &ldquo;alerting criminals to Garda investigative techniques&rdquo;.  It is fair to infer that the Minister was, in that extraordinary remark, reflecting the views of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P><Col N="347"/>
        <P>As I understand the official but unpromulgated position of the Garda, up to and including the publication of that surveillance Bill by the Labour Party, it was that it already had powers to engage in such surveillance but it would not be productive if intelligence so gathered was to be introduced in court.  That is the impression I have of why the Garda took the view it did.  I would be interested in teasing this out with the Garda.  I tried to do it in committee with the Commissioner when he was last with us, but the Garda does not especially want to engage in discussion about why it held those reservations.  I would have thought a police force would welcome the national Parliament&rsquo;s being disposed to give it such powers.  They are not everyday things that people particularly want to agree to; they have been introduced here only in emergency circumstances.</P>
        <P>However, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s traditional position has been that it has powers of surveillance and it engages in surveillance of criminal suspects, but it considers that, as the Minister said, if it was required or permissible to make that intelligence admissible as evidence in court, it would somehow be counter-productive in that it could alert criminal suspects to Garda investigative techniques.  If it does hold that position, it would have been more helpful for it to engage with those of us who do not have the same experience of the criminal justice system, based on its particular investigative role.  I would have been interested to hear the arguments in more detail.  However, the Garda has now been railroaded into this, due to political imperatives, in order to respond to what is happening in our country.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What is happening in our country at the moment is almost beyond belief.  To hear Stephen Collins in Limerick give an interview to the effect that notwithstanding the terrible tragedy that befell his family it again has been threatened, is incredible.  He is entitled to plead to this House, to the Government and to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular to know what steps can be taken to protect him and his family and to allow him to live some type of normal life.  We are taking an important step with this Bill.  I hope Committee Stage will allow for a somewhat more frank exchange so that Members on all sides of the House understand each other.  Whatever else we are divided on, we are not divided on the necessity to bring serious organised crime to heel.  We must have a more frank exchange of views.</P>
        <P>As I said, it is clear now that the position has changed, and I welcome that.  In my view, the murder of Shane Geoghegan was the turning point.  If a law abiding citizen can be shot down in a city with three times as many garda&iacute; as in similar urban areas, then we have reached a very serious stage.  If witnesses can be threatened and intimidated, things have come to a serious pass.  If a respectable businessman can be murdered because a relative did his civic duty and gave truthful evidence in court, then the very basis of our society &mdash; the rule of law &mdash; is challenged.</P>
        <P>In such circumstances, it is to be expected that there will be growing demands for extraordinary measures to be authorised by the State.  It would be a mistake to allow the belief to grow that the criminal justice system is incapable of dealing with organised crime without resort to extreme measures.  This Bill represents a proportionate and legitimate response to the difficulties we face.  When I introduced my own Bill on these matters in 2007, I made the point that modern crime requires modern responses and that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be given the appropriate powers to enable it not only to detect crime and put those responsible behind bars but also, to the greatest extent possible, to prevent crime from taking place.</P>
        <P>Most people will have been shocked to learn that the Garda currently has no legal powers to undertake electronic surveillance of criminal suspects, although these powers form a central part of the anti-crime armoury of most other countries.  It is important to reiterate this point.  Deputy Charles Flanagan spoke at some length about our rates of detection and conviction. <Col N="348"/> However, people outside the House are concerned not only with these matters; they are also very concerned that we should seek to be more effective at preventing serious crime.  I do not pretend that the extraordinary circumstances being confronted in some urban areas by the Garda are anything but daunting.  However, law abiding citizens expect that the first duty of Government is to protect them and to assure them of their safety in their homes, on the streets, in their places of work and in their recreational activities.</P>
        <P>We cannot currently say, hand on heart, that we can discharge that duty.  This Bill is relevant in the matter of preventing crime.  That was my own motivating factor in introducing our legislation.  Why should the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not have what it takes in terms of modern equipment to allow it to engage effectively in the gathering of intelligence, intelligence that hopefully will lead to the prevention of crimes that would otherwise have been committed?  I do not claim the legislation will be a panacea or anything like that, but it is an important step.</P>
        <P>I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the conclusion of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that intelligence-led policing not the restriction of fair trial rights is the most effective way to tackle gangland crime.  The council acknowledges that the Bill will place Garda surveillance &ldquo;on a lawful basis that broadly conforms to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights&rdquo;.  There is a difficult question that arises in regard to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of its purpose, in the first place, as well as the constitutional and other rights to privacy and so on of the citizen.  However, a vigilant body such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties would not confer approval on this measure unless it considered it reasonably balanced.</P>
        <P>I am not arguing &mdash; nor, I presume, is the Minister &mdash; that this Bill will of itself defeat organised crime.  However, it is a valuable instrument available to the Garda and its use broadly must be the result of judicial authorisation.  We should, within safeguards, be prepared to confer every possible advantage on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enable it to tackle organised crime effectively.  The Labour Party Bill provided for resort to the Garda Ombudsman Commission in certain circumstances.  This is something we might discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Flanagan said, the truth is that the corrosive and worsening effect of crime is taking a terrible toll on our society.  Some communities in particular are besieged by criminal gangs.  Crime bosses dominate these urban communities in the same way paramilitary organisations dominated certain communities in Northern Ireland and sought to obtain control over selected communities in the South.  Most serious crime is driven by the trafficking in drugs.  Nothing and nobody is allowed to stand in the way of the ruthless drive for lucrative profits.  As a result, we have seen a number of innocent civilians losing their lives as they became accidentally involved in the crossfire of the vicious feuding and pursuit of wealth.</P>
        <P>Given his period of time in the House, the Minister must find it difficult to understand the very considered reaction on this side of the House given the extent of crime in our society.  I said at Question Time last week that were it not for the disastrous condition of our economy and the state into which it has been plunged by the Government&rsquo;s poor management in the past four or five years, crime would be at the top of the political agenda.  Deputy Flanagan dealt at some length with the circumstances more than a dozen years ago and the position of the Minister&rsquo;s party at that time.</P>
        <P>There was a general election in 1997 when three or four seats separated the contending Governments.  Without doubt, it was the issue of crime and zero tolerance which tipped the balance in favour of Fianna F&aacute;il.  At that time, Fianna F&aacute;il was grossly irresponsible.  Some of the charges made were completely out of proportion and some entirely unfair, but that is politics.  There used be uproar in this House if even a letter went missing in the then Depart<Col N="349"/>ment of Justice.  Such an occurrence could lead to the adjournment of the House, special debates and censure motions on the Minister of the day.</P>
        <P>It is remarkable now, with things so much worse, to note the apparent complacency of the Minister and the people on the benches behind him.  Nothing we have ever seen was anything like what we have experienced in recent times: a garda on a motorcycle shot at 11 o&rsquo;clock in the day; murders of innocent civilians; and the drugs situation getting worse, corroding entire communities and poisoning generations of young people.  The drugs situation is at the bottom of all of this.  I am not saying it is easy to get on top of it.  However, compared to the circumstances obtaining in the early 1990s, the current situation is so much worse, and the Minister knows that.</P>
        <P>Deputy Flanagan presented statistics which dealt with the reality we are now experiencing.  How far we have come from the days when we were told things were under control and that we were experiencing the last sting of the dying wasp.  Unfortunately, the wasps are multiplying and are a very long way from their last sting.</P>
        <P>The critical section of the Bill is section 14.  It makes intelligence gathered from the measures being put in place admissible as evidence.  It is my understanding that if there is a breach of constitutional right evidence is automatically excluded and if there is a breach of statutory right the judge has discretion.  That is the exclusionary rule and the Minister has made reference to the Kenny judgment.  Perhaps this will be tested.  However, it seems that section 14 is probably making as good a fist of things as can be made in the circumstances.  We know from the Kenny judgment that inadvertent error does not invalidate evidence held to be admissible.  Section 14 deals with that.  It is at the heart of the Bill and the Bill will not have meaning without it.  If that section were neutered the Bill would not have meaning.  I hope that, subject to the safeguards and oversights built into the legislation, it is the intention of this House that intelligence gathered in this fashion can be made admissible in court.  I believe that is the wish of the people and it is manifestly the wish of this House.  I hope that turns out to be the case.  I do not know what additional comments the Minister would want to make on that.  Reassurance is what we need.</P>
        <P>May I ask the Minister about section 15?  Rather than denying that it held the view I have ascribed to the force, it would be healthier for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to engage with us and explain its reservations.  Section 15, which deals with disclosure of information and the processes to be followed, stipulates that, essentially, there will not be discovery of the processes.  That seems to connect with the point I made about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its wish that the position would be otherwise.  Subsection 15(1) provides the processes to be followed should not be disclosed by way of discovery.  How does that stand up in court?  If I am representing a defendant, surely I can cross-examine as to the processes that were followed.  I would like to hear the Minister address that when he replies.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the safeguard of the judicial referee although I am curious to know how I can complain to the judicial referee, who will be a Circuit Court judge, about surveillance or interception if I do not know it is happening.  I am not arguing that we should put a notice in the newspaper advertising the fact that a process of surveillance in under way or that material has been intercepted.  I can understand the role of the High Court judge who will have the very important job of assessing the performance of the interceptions and who, I am sure, will carry out his responsibility diligently and with great care and report to the appropriate member of the Government that all is well.  I can understand his role more clearly than that discharged by the Circuit Court judge who is the referee.  If, after the event, I become aware that my telephone has been tapped improperly should I go to the Circuit Court judge in the first instance?</P><Col N="350"/>
        <P Just="Left">We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to make sure that the legislation stands up to scrutiny.  It is not legislation which we can be satisfied to be put on the Statute Book and be then forgotten.  It requires to be implemented, given what is now happening in parts of the country.</P>
        <P>I refer to the last page of the Minister&rsquo;s script where he refers again in one or two paragraphs to the fact that he is contemplating additional measures.  He took the opportunity of the launch of the Bill to announce various other forthcoming measures.  He has put very little detail of this in his formal script.  I wish to hear more about this matter because gang membership seems to be fraught with difficulty in terms of trying to frame legislation that could stand up to challenge.  Is the Minister saying that there is intimidation of jurors in addition to intimidation of witnesses?  We are aware that the nub of the problem is intimidation of witnesses.</P>
        <P>However, it is even more serious if the Minister is saying there is intimidation of jurors.  I know of no evidence suggesting the Special Criminal Court would produce more convictions than the jury courts.  Will the Minister contradict that statement?  Is there evidence that the Special Criminal Court would produce more convictions?  It seems in so far as I have observed the matter that juries are not the problem.  It has been suggested that several cases have occurred where the jury might have been more likely to convict than the Special Criminal Court.  The issue of intimidation of witnesses is a different matter and it will not be solved by making certain actions scheduled offences to be tried by the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>I hope the measures before the House on Garda surveillance will be helpful in dealing with the matter of intimidation of witnesses.  I cannot understand how evidence by way of Garda opinion adds much to the evidence garnered from the surveillance mechanism we are putting in place today.  Does it add anything for a senior garda to state that his or her opinion corroborates the intelligence gathered from the surveillance measures in place?  I hope the Minister has thought out these matters, that there is clarity and that he believes it can bring extra value and more effectiveness in tackling crime.  However, I have some reservations concerning what has been put in the public domain thus far.  The Minister has devoted only a paragraph in his script indicating what he may or may not do in this regard and I wish to hear more on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly but sadly support the legislation.  I use the term &ldquo;strongly&rdquo; because I believe the legislation is essential in the war against organised crime and gangland terror.  However, I use the term &ldquo;sadly&rdquo; to note that society has come to the point at which such legislation is required.  The Minister will be fully aware that the courts have been vigilant in the protection of human rights in a series of decisions.  Human rights are enshrined in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and in the European Convention on Human rights which we incorporated into law in 2003.  In the Supreme Court decision, The People (DPP) <i>v.</i> Kenny [1990], Mr. Justice Finlay stated that &ldquo;the correct principle is that evidence obtained by invasion of the constitutional personal rights of a citizen must be excluded unless the Court is satisfied that either the act of constituting the breach of constitutional rights was committed unintentionally or accidentally, or is satisfied that there were extraordinarily excusing circumstances which justify the admission of the evidence in its (the Court&rsquo;s) discretion.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>This legislation will no doubt interfere with the constitutional rights of accused persons.  It should only do so in necessary circumstances and in a very careful way.  Checks and balances have been referred to by my colleagues concerning complaints and monitoring by a High Court judge is essential in this regard.  Further, on Committee Stage we must closely examine questions with regard to the admissibility of such evidence.  We must especially ensure that an accused person is shown the full deck of cards.  It is fine to hold one&rsquo;s cards close to one&rsquo;s chest <Col N="351"/>and proceed with a prosecution.  However, once the cards are laid down by way of evidence the accused is entitled to see the full pack of cards, such that he or she can properly protect or vindicate his or her own name.  I have no difficulty with surveillance, especially against some of the criminals of who have committed heinous crimes throughout the country but we have a very good system of criminal justice which should not suffer simply because of a very small and nasty minority of people determined to do bad throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the legislation because it is essential.  I am aware from events in my constituency, and the Garda have directly informed me, that without the use of a significant degree of surveillance evidence the detection and prosecution of criminals, especially in cases related to drug and gang crime, would not be possible.  There is no question that surveillance evidence must be allowed in court.</P>
        <P>The mechanism and architecture of the Bill makes much sense.  I wish to see most if not all of the authorisations coming from the District Court although I am less agreeable to a superintendent issuing such an authorisation.  I appreciate this may only take place for 72 hours and in exceptional circumstances but they should only apply in exceptional cases and should take place primarily through the District Court.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to closely examine sections 14 and 15 on Committee Stage relating to the admissibility of evidence and the disclosure of information to the accused respectively.  I seek clarity in the Bill at a later stage if possible that such evidence will not be used in any form of civil proceedings such as matrimonial or commercial proceedings.  The measures should never be available for such proceedings and should strictly be limited to the most serious of crimes, which, I understand, is the Minister&rsquo;s intention.</P>
        <P>Other Members have spoken of the framework for complaints to the referee judge and, ultimately, the Government will have this monitored by a judge of the High Court, which is essential.  The accused must be given equal access to information.  I am not saying that in all cases they should know the entire <i>modus operandi</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>The scheme of community support for older people was suspended on 7  April.  This was done with a view to affording my Department the opportunity to review the scheme&rsquo;s operation <?oasys _dc18- ?>and to consult with interested parties over the next few months to address a number of concerns.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>It is essential that we recognise the home security concerns of our older citizens.  While statistics will tell us that the incidence of crime affecting older people is low compared to other age groups, older people&rsquo;s perception of the risk of crime is high.  It also may be useful to remind Deputies of the background to this scheme.  It was introduced in 1996 arising from a special task force on security for the elderly following a spate of burglaries on the homes of older people.  It was based on the concept of providing funds to voluntary and community organisations working with or providing support for vulnerable older people to provide a range of personal security devices.  Since 1996, some &euro;43.7 million has been paid out under the scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department has operated the scheme since mid-2002.  In excess of &euro;20 million has been provided since then to community and voluntary organisations with an estimated 60,000 older people being direct beneficiaries &mdash; either by being supplied with a monitored alarm, sometimes referred to as the pendant alarm or panic button, or one of the other security items for their homes.</P>
        <P>My Department has reviewed the scheme on a couple of occasions in recent years and, as a result, a number of innovations have been introduced.  Arising from recommendations made in 2004 the grant is now fixed at &euro;300 per installation for the monitored alarm and lower amounts for the other equipment available.  This approach has helped to ensure that community groups get good value for money and that commercial suppliers are obliged to provide quality equipment at a reasonable price, given that these products vary little in their design or service.</P>
        <P>Other changes introduced include increasing the maximum individual grant in respect of physical security equipment to &euro;200 and the maximum individual grant in respect of security lighting to &euro;200; from 2006, the introduction of a grant of &euro;150 for interior emergency lighting for qualifying older people living on our offshore islands; providing grant support in respect of smoke alarms and emergency lighting; and providing funding for carbon monoxide detectors where they are supplied as part of other smoke detection devices.</P>
        <P>In addition, the 2006 scheme saw the introduction for the first time of an administration subvention to participating groups.  The amount of this subvention is based on the size of a group&rsquo;s previous year&rsquo;s grant, with a maximum of &euro;600 and a minimum of &euro;100 being made available.  This subvention recognised the role of the community groups in the administration of this scheme and I think Deputies will agree we owe a great debt of gratitude for their work over the years.</P>
        <P>The changes introduced in the past few years, however, have meant that the demand for grants has grown to unsustainable levels.  From 2002 to 2006, average annual expenditure on the scheme was approximately &euro;2.4 million.  In 2007, expenditure went to &euro;3.7 million and it increased further in 2008 when expenditure reached &euro;4.3 million.  Deputies will agree that these <Col N="353"/>levels of increase are unsustainable.  While the changes introduced to the scheme in recent years have provided for greater flexibility and access, I have concerns that it may no longer target genuine need among older people.  The suspension of the scheme will allow an opportunity to examine these concerns and a range of other issues that also have been identified.  I know there is broad agreement as to the value of the scheme but I honestly believe there is an urgent need to review it in order to ensure it operates effectively.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, last week the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and I met representatives of Age Action Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Muintir na Tire, Irish Rural Link and the Senior Citizens&rsquo; Parliament to discuss the suspension of the scheme and the concerns about how it currently operates.  Arising from those discussions, we have agreed with these groups a process that will set the broad parameters for a review of the scheme and for the necessary consultation to be undertaken as part of it. I am hopeful the review process can begin in May and be completed by mid-September.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>The bodies have agreed to participate in the review process and to work with my officials.  They have also agreed to work together to give their general view about the scope of the review and how they see it developing.  I assure Deputies that all applications received up to the suspension of the scheme will be processed and approved, as appropriate, in line with the current eligibility criteria.  Funding will be made available to eligible groups in the coming weeks.  More than &euro;1 million worth of applications have been received in the first three months of this year and at the end of March, nearly &euro;640,000 had been paid out to eligible applicants.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful that with the co-operation of the national bodies referred to, the terms of reference for the review can be finalised fairly quickly.  It is important to note, however, that the suspension of the scheme does not in any way affect those who have already received a monitored alarm device.  I wish to reiterate my commitment to this scheme.  It is my intention to relaunch it later in the year, once the review is completed.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>On 6 April the Minister of State announced funding for this scheme and on 7 April his colleague beside him, the senior Minister, announced the suspension of the scheme.  Many elderly people throughout the country are worried.  Many people who are living in their homes would be in nursing homes were it not for this scheme.  The scheme has had a great voluntary element with many people supporting it on a voluntary basis.  The Government attacked the over-70s with the removal of the medical card and it is now attacking elderly people who live at home.  This scheme worked well and it gave people confidence, particularly now when we have high crime levels.  Many elderly people have been beaten up in their homes, some of them having to go to hospital and others being robbed.  At least when they had a panic button they could press it and a neighbour or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would come to their assistance.  I hope this announcement is not merely to get the Government over the local elections.  I hope it is not the case that the Government is announcing the suspension of the scheme in order to reinstate it or review it by September.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it would not.  </P>
        <P>I want the Minister of State to answer a straight question.  Is this scheme going to continue?  That is my question.  I want the Minister of State to reassure the elderly people of this country who are waiting for an answer.  We do not want a review.  This scheme is working and it costs very little money in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall budget.  There are many other <Col N="354"/>areas within the Department where funding could be cut, and where it is being wasted, rather than suspending this scheme.  I want to know if this decision is being made just to get the Government over the local and European elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the Deputy&rsquo;s allegation about the local elections.  If I were being devious I would not have made the announcement until after the local elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>

	<P>It is easy for Deputy Ring to stand up and say there is loads of money in the Department.  When he suggests that funding should be cut elsewhere, where would he cut the funding.  On what programme would he cut funding?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify that the scheme was suspended following the budget and it is unfair to blame the Aire here beside me because it was my decision to suspend it and review it in the context of the budget.  The Deputy asked if it was a review and will the scheme be brought back.  The whole point of reviewing it is that the figures have increased very substantially&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>And rightly so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and at a time when we must be sure when spending the money that we are targeting those in real need.  If we did not review the scheme and have guidelines in place, those people in real need would be missed.</P>
        <P>I did not have an opportunity to complete my reply in the House but it is important to say &mdash; in case there is any misunderstanding &mdash; that the applications received on hand prior to the suspension of the scheme have not yet been processed but they will be processed in the normal way as part of the original or ongoing scheme.  Applications received before the suspension still have to be processed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an absolute disgrace that this has happened.  I do not blame the Minister of State, I blame the man sitting beside him.  It is a total lack of recognition of the value of this scheme.  What does one say to the Clontarf Active Retirement Association who held a meeting and 50 people turned up?  Does one say, &ldquo;Hold on, there are too many of ye, we cannot give ye all money, we will give it to one or two in the group&rdquo;?  This scheme worked and it was creating employment.  Does the Minister of State not realise the various groups created employment by hiring electricians or people to install the equipment?  It is unbelievable to think there will now be a fourth review of the scheme which has been in operation since 1996 when it was introduced by Prionsias De Rossa.  The Minister of State is now going to start another review.  It is unbelievable to think that the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is hiding behind all the associations and he is using them.  I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Curran. <Col N="355"/>The Minister is using those associations to hide one of the worst decisions of the budget.  He did not have the guts to come out and say the scheme was being cut because the money was not there.  He hid behind the associations, saying there would be a review when each and every one of them wrote to every Member saying the scheme should not be suspended.  They said the scheme was of wonderful benefit to the communities where it was being implemented.  The Minister should not try to tell us he is working with the associations.  He is hiding behind them.  The Minister, not the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, is the man responsible for this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the accusation that the review is a waste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an absolute and total waste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme has been reviewed on a number of occasions and every time it was reviewed it improved significantly.  The most recent review meant people could make an application on an ongoing basis.  Traditionally, one could apply only once a year and if one missed that, one had to wait 12 months.  If we are to target resources at people with real need, we must review this scheme to ensure it is doing that.  As I pointed out earlier, the scheme was working at a certain level and suddenly the figures increased dramatically.  We are in a time where a certain amount of resources are available to us and it is my job to ensure that those resources are targeted specifically at the elderly people who need them most.  The scheme is being reviewed.  The groups I mentioned previously sat down with us and are happy &mdash; very much so &mdash; to fully participate in that review, despite Deputy Wall&rsquo;s comments.  It is my firm intention to clarify, in case there is any misunderstanding, that the scheme will be back in operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>If there are problems in the scheme, the Minister should tell the House what they are.  He has enough officials in his Department to deal with these problems.  If there is a problem he should deal with it.  The overall scheme worked and elderly people felt safe in their homes.  There was a large voluntary capacity.  Many people actively supported this scheme and were not being paid.  There might have been a commercial element, but the Minister should deal with that if there is a problem.  I want, and I have, the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that this scheme will continue.  The Minister might tell the House what the problems are besides money because he has an overall budget.</P>
        <P>The budget was announced on 6 April and on 7 April the Minister said the scheme was to be suspended.  Did the Minister and Minister of State talk to one another?  Some Ministers do not talk to each other.  Do the Minister and Minister of State talk to one another?  If not, will they get together and talk and try to keep this scheme up and running?</P>

	<P>The reason there were more applications is that the groups around the country made the senior citizens aware of it.  There are not people who are not senior citizens applying for the scheme.  The Ministers should cop themselves on and not use the line that there are too many applications.  Did anybody ever hear such a stupid idea that there are too many applications when every one of them qualified for the scheme?  How does the Minister make that assertion when each applicant must state his or her age and qualifies?  The Minister said too many have qualified.  What he is trying to convince us of is unbelievable.  Ms Phyl Lee, secretary of the Clontarf Active Retirement Association, said the group recently held a meeting to explain the scheme and 50 people turned up.  They were 50 senior citizens who are entitled to the scheme and the Minister says there are too many of them.  It is an absolute joke.</P>

	<P>I repeat that the scheme was designed to meet real needs.  Members of this House, the Deputy&rsquo;s party included, have made representations and spoken to me and <Col N="356"/>the Minister about their concerns regarding the scheme.  There is a finite amount of resources available at any time and my concern is to ensure that the scheme is administered so that the real needs of those elderly people are met and accommodated through this scheme.  In response Deputy Ring, the Minister and I talk.</P>

        <Quest> the discussions he has had with cohesing Leader groups and partnerships with regard to assets held by groups in order to protect State interests in the context of the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Officials from my Department are in ongoing contact with the cohesing Leader and partnership companies to ensure State and community interests in assets, either held by the companies or otherwise developed under programmes delivered by them on behalf of the State, are protected either through the transfer of these assets to the relevant local integrated structure or other means as appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very short answer.  I have been raising this with the Minister for a while.  The previous Minister asked me to find savings for the Department.  This Minister announced the Leader programmes.  A number of Leader programmes all over the country have not made applications for the programmes and the Minister has amalgamated a number of groups.  There is great concern about this issue.  There were four Leader programmes in my county and the Minister has reduced that to two.  One did not even apply and the other is in discussions and is part of the process.</P>
        <P>What has the Minister done about the State funding put into these Leader programmes?  Will these assets return to the Minister, Department and the people of the country, or will they stay with the people who established companies?  There is outrage about this issue.  What is the amount of assets involved?  Which groups have not given the Minister the assets for which the State provided the money?  This is a very serious situation.  If taxpayers&rsquo; and European money is given to Leader groups which have property all over the country, and if these groups are no longer taking part in the Leader programme, are those assets returning to the State?  What has the Minister done about the new Leader programme to protect us and ensure that this does not happen again?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to answer those questions as speedily and comprehensively as I can.  All assets held by cohesing companies and identified under the due diligence process will transfer to the new, integrated company unless other arrangements are specifically agreed by the Department.  Capital funding allocated for the development of assets through the programmes administered on behalf of my Department by the companies in question is subject to contractual obligations.  These contractual provisions provide for the protection of the State&rsquo;s interest and will not be weakened in any way by the establishment of the new cohesing companies.</P>
        <P>My Department is also in discussion with other Government Departments and agencies to ensure that the State&rsquo;s interest is protected regarding funding provided by it through these companies.  My officials are in ongoing contact with the various cohesing groups regarding assisting them through the due diligence process.  If the Deputy has particular concerns on assets held or developed by any specific company he should contact my Department directly and my officials will be only too happy to help him.  That deals with the issues of bringing it forward.  There is the legal process of due diligence.</P><Col N="357"/>
        <P>On the new arrangements put in place by the Government, all integrated local development companies and partnerships are required to be compliant with the guidelines and model memorandum of articles of association issued by my Department in October 2007.  These provide that: &ldquo;The income and property of the company shall be applied solely towards the promotion of its main objects as set forth in this memorandum of association and no portion thereof shall be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of dividend, bonus or otherwise howsoever by way of profit to members of the [company].&rdquo;  It also gives a very detailed procedure for when a company is wound up and how the assets are dealt with.  I can send the Deputy a copy of this because it is very relevant.  We have due diligence, which is a legal process in which they must all come over.  I do not have the total value of the assets.  We are working with that process to ensure they all come over.  When we changed into these new structures to protect ourselves, there were very clear provisions in the articles and memorandum to protect all assets now and in the circumstances of a wind-up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to give the Minister the evidence I have.  There is concern that some of these assets are being offered for sale to the private sector, even though State and Leader funding provided the assets.  How many Leader companies had not co-operated with the Minister and will he take legal action against them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>If anybody has not complied with the law, legal action will have to be taken.  I know the company of concern to Deputy Ring and he knows I know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a number of companies about which I have received information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The first obligation is on the company to comply with the law.  Anywhere one gives a grant the State has a contractual arrangement for clawbacks if, for example, people dispose of assets.  All that is provided for and protected in the normal way.  However, if the Deputy believes there are people or groups not complying with their legal requirements and if he has information on this about which we are not aware we would appreciate receiving that information on a confidential basis and would follow up the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a final point.  This is very important on behalf of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to hear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not name any names.  I shall put it very simply.  Leader programmes equal taxpayers&rsquo; money equal European money.  These people did not get the Leader programme and they have major assets.  My information is that these people are holding on to assets which were provided by the State.  I wish to know whether the State and Europe are being protected because there is concern among the public that those in question have not handed the assets back to the Minister, namely, to the State, but, as private companies, are keeping them even though taxpayers&rsquo; money actually provided the assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A brief reply, Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Leader programme there is a provision whereby a Leader company cannot provide money to itself for building but can provide to other companies.   I assure the Deputy that where there are assets belonging to the State everything in our power is done to protect those assets.  If it happens, for example, that a Leader company gives a grant to a private individual for an asset such as a community hall, that is perfectly all right.  As the Deputy knows, if the person sells the community hall he or she must repay some of the grant, <Col N="358"/>depending on how long it had been held.  On the other hand, if the private individual continues to use the place as a community hall or if he or she has a little enterprise he or she then owns the asset.  As long as the grant is used for the purpose given the individual has outright ownership of it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the asset the Deputy mentioned I cannot judge how it was given and what were the contractual arrangements.  I do not have the details here.  However, if there are issues of concern about which the Deputy believes I am not aware, if he gives them to us on a confidential basis we will appreciate that and will follow it up.</P>
        <P>I wish to put on record that I would be as concerned as the Deputy that every contractual obligation be fulfilled, whoever it may be who gets a grant or any other funding from the State.  We are pursuing this with vigour.  I know the Deputy is concerned but I am equally so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 79 and 80 together. </P>
        <P>I have been re-appointed as a Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, community affairs and with special responsibility for integration policy.  I can assure the Deputies that the change in responsibilities will have no implications for the level of commitment I will bring to tackling problem drug use in Ireland, nor indeed, that of the Government.</P>
        <P>Work on developing a national drugs strategy is well advanced at this stage and the steering group, which is developing proposals in this regard, will be presenting me with their findings in the coming weeks.  I expect to be presenting the draft strategy to Government for consideration in late May or early June.  The measure, as approved by Government, will be published as an interim strategy pending the drafting and finalisation of a national substance misuse strategy.  In this context, the Deputies should note that a new steering group will be established in the autumn to develop proposals for the overall substance misuse strategy, which will incorporate the already agreed drugs policy element.  The group will be asked to report by the end of 2010.</P>
        <P>As part of the restructuring proposed in the new drugs strategy, the national drugs strategy team, NDST, will be discontinued from 30 April.  It is intended that proposals for the establishment of a new dedicated ministerial drugs office will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the new drugs strategy.  In the interim, the general functions of the NDST will be absorbed appropriately within my Department.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the members and staff in the NDST for their contribution over the years in tackling problem drug use in our society.  It is intended that the new office will build upon a partnership approach across the statutory and community and voluntary sectors while facilitating improved governance, management and overall effectiveness.</P>
        <P>To facilitate a smooth transfer of functions to the new office, the Deputies should note that transitional arrangements have been drawn up by my Department and are currently being rolled out. These cover a broad range of issues, including financial and day-to-day administrative issues in support of the work of the drugs task forces and local projects.  While they do not endorse the recommendation to establish the dedicated ministerial office, the issues of concern to the community sector representatives on the steering group, who left the process in March, have since been largely addressed and they returned to the steering group process last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good news that we are finally to get a look at this wonderful document.  Unfortunately, however, the drugs problem is worse that it has ever been.  One only has to look at the events at the weekend in Dolphin House in my area where there was a major incident involving thugs running rampant, vandalising more than 30 cars with paint and acid and terrifying people.  People at a public meeting the other evening had to be removed from the area because of the threat from a device left there.  It is about time that this new strategy was put in place.  There are major problems with drug abuse. </P><Col N="363"/>
        <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that he will rename the national drugs strategy the national substance misuse strategy and give equal attention and importance to tackling alcohol abuse?  Will the Minister of State explain how this strategy will be managed and if the national drugs strategy team will remain?  Who will manage the funding allocated to task forces which are in place to help communities tackle the drugs problems on their doorsteps?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The delay in publishing the strategy was due to the fact that during the consultation process, much interest was raised in the area of alcohol and the relationship between alcohol and drugs.  In that regard, the Government recently made a decision that alcohol would be included in a joint strategy.  However, the reality was that much work had been done towards the preparation of a current strategy.  As I said, the current drugs strategy will go to Government in late May or early June.</P>
        <P>In the autumn of this year, a new steering group will work to incorporate alcohol into what will be a substance misuse strategy but that will not be available until some time next year.  There will be two steps to this.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to include alcohol which was strongly put forward during the consultation process.  I said the contracts with the NDST will terminate on 30 April and the funding, to which the Deputy referred, will be managed by the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the alternative mechanism to carry out the work of the national drugs strategy team?  Is there any logic to terminating the national drugs strategy team without the alternative being in place beforehand?  The Minister of State mentioned transitional arrangements.  Is there any logic to terminating or fixing something which is not broken?</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will have to ask the Taoiseach but is there any logic to downgrading his office?  He is committed to tackling the drugs issue but giving him extra duties reduces the Government commitment.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State give a commitment that when the full drugs strategy, including alcohol, is produced, there will be no reduction in the overall spend on tackling drugs and alcohol abuse?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I refer to the last question on spending, an area which causes grave concern.  It is very difficult to quantify the spend at any point in time because a partnership approach is taken.  We can target the funding in respect of the community and voluntary sectors, so we know what we spend.  However, it is not possible to do so in respect of the statutory agencies, including the Garda and the HSE.  The intention is to continue the partnership approach.  The statutory agencies have given a commitment in respect of the level of funding they will provide in the current year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked why we are moving to a new structure.  It became apparent that if we were to avoid duplication and take cognisance of concerns raised at the Committee of Public Accounts, the structures in place would not address them.  There was much duplication between the NDST and the drugs strategy unit.  The intention is to merge the functions of those.</P>
        <P>The community sector had concerns about the new structure but it is fundamental that it is fully engaged with it, which I expect it to be.  However, this is to avoid that duplication, to address concerns raised at the Committee of Public Accounts and to bring in overall efficiencies where people can be accountable and where we can have better governance, management and clear lines of communication from the projects in the communities, of which more than 600 are being supported, right through to the task forces and all the way up.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="364"/>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Why terminate them now without the new ones being in place?  Why have transitional arrangements?  It is usual to transfer from one to another and not to have a transitional period.  That is what has caused major concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The transitional arrangements come into place because a Government decision on the strategy has not been adopted.  The contracts with the NDST will be terminated on 30 April.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the addition of alcohol to the overall scheme.  Will the submissions made form the basis of that or will a new process be undertaken?  Where stands the Licensed Vintners Association, which seems to be under so much pressure?  Will it have representatives on the group which will review this?  Now that we recognise this is a huge problem, what will we be able to do to offer assistance to young people in schools, in particular, in regard to the dangers of alcohol?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>During the public consultation process, it became very apparent there was much synergy between alcohol and drugs, particularly among young people and in respect of education, prevention and so on.  However, we were fairly far advanced with the drugs strategy, which will be adopted as is without the inclusion of alcohol at this point.  </P>
        <P>One of the specific actions is that in September of this year, a steering group will be formed to bring the decision the Government made recently in respect of alcohol into a substance misuse strategy.  It has approximately 12 months to do that.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the make-up of the steering group but that has not yet been decided.  The idea is not to park the drugs strategy and wait.  We did not set out to make that decision.  The consultation process led us in that direction.  It is important that if we are to engage in consultation, that we respond to what it throws up.  We had not expected it to turn out like this but in light of what we have done, we have decided to go ahead with the drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned the Licensed Vintners Association.  There are many similarities between alcohol and drugs but alcohol is not an illegal substance.  We need to be conscious of that and deal with it.  Many people, myself included, use alcohol and most use it sensibly.  However, we need to make that very clear distinction and that is what this consultation process will be about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been reports of threats of resignations in the task forces over proposals in the new strategy.  Is that true?  What meetings has the Minister of State had with these groups?  Have any outstanding issues been resolved?  </P>
        <P>I am glad alcohol has been included because I have been pushing for that for many years.  People in this country have a tolerance towards drink.  We do not seem to want to say we have a problem in regard to the abuse of alcohol.  It is the most disastrous drug in the country and it creates more problems for families and homes than any other drug.  It might be legal but by God it has created many problems in homes and I am glad it will be included in the new strategy.</P>
        <P>I hope the tolerance we have for the abuse of alcohol will diminish and it will be like drink driving.  I told the Minister of State I would support the strategy if alcohol was included in it, otherwise I would not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ring for his support.  In regard to threats of resignations in community groups or task forces, nobody has brought that to my attention.  During the <Col N="365"/>deliberation process of formulating the new strategy, the community group representatives walked away from the steering committee.  I met them and they had a number of specific concerns which we  addressed.  They are now back in the steering group and are engaging fully with it.  They had a different view in regard to the establishment of an office for a minister of drugs or whatever.  </P>
        <P>We must bear in mind that to tackle the drugs issue, the community and voluntary sectors and all the statutory agencies must take a partnership approach.  They recognise that there must be a compromise on the views of all concerned.  I am very pleased the community sector has re-engaged with the deliberation process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the situation in regard to funding for the strategy?  The Minister of State mentioned funding from different agencies but they are feeling the pressure at the moment.  Has funding from his Department for the strategy been altered in any way?  </P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree with a statement a community worker made to me the other night that drug use tends to go up in times of recession?  Has he any thoughts on that or plans in that eventuality?</P>
        <P>I refer to the rise in heroin use, particularly in rural areas.  There was a time when it was confined to Dublin but we now find heroin used all over the country.  Has the Minister of State taken account of that?  What plans has he to deal with that matter?  There are ten community drugs projects in the Cork and Kerry region.  Does the Minister of State have any plans to develop further projects in other towns and areas?  Can he guarantee that the projects will not be affected by cutbacks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked an interesting question about the possibility of an increase in drug use during the recession.  All I can say is that it depends on the evidence one examines.  The pattern of drug use often changes as economic conditions change.  The use of cocaine in affluent areas increased during the economic boom.  During a recession, there is often an increase in heroin use in disadvantaged areas.  I wish to compare the current strategy to the original strategy.  The original strategy was primarily based in disadvantaged parts of the country that are associated with high levels of heroin use, whereas the current strategy recognises that we are dealing with a national problem.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stanton also spoke about funding.  As a result of the recent supplementary budget, the amount of money that is available through the task forces this year will probably be a little lower than the amount of money that was available last year.  We are currently preparing figures in advance of advising the task forces on the funds that will be made available to them for the second six months of the year.  The Deputy pointed out that there are ten programmes in his local area.  As I do not have details on them to hand, I will make a general comment.  The strategy supports approximately 600 projects throughout the country.  They are funded from my Department through the various task forces.  I cannot guarantee that they will all remain as they are at present.  It is very important that they are evaluated on an ongoing basis to make sure they are performing and delivering the programmes that are needed in communities.  I have some concerns about this area.  If we are spending money on a project that is not delivering in an area, some other opportunity is being lost.  In the current economic climate, everybody has to work a bit harder for the scarce resources that are available.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the rural social scheme provides a supplementary income to certain categories of low-income farming and fishing families.  The scheme is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on an almost nationwide basis.  It is managed at local level by the integrated local development companies.  In Gaeltacht areas, it is managed by the relevant companies in conjunction with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  In the current economic climate, all aspects of the operation of the scheme are under review.  I am considering whether it might be more efficient for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to be responsible for the management of the rural social scheme throughout the Gaeltacht.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that efficiencies are needed in every scheme operated by every Department, particularly in the current economic climate.  There is some concern in this instance.  The rural social scheme is one of the best schemes being run by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The manner in which it is being operated by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta and other groups is working well.  Is the Minister thinking about taking responsibility for the scheme from Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta and giving sole responsibility for it to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta?  If so, will legislation need to be introduced in this House?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s thinking?  Has he had discussions with Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta?  I am concerned about the employment implications of such a move.  Would it lead to many job losses in the community sector?  If Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta officials lose their jobs, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will not be able to take them on as a consequence of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s embargo on public service recruitment.  Can the Minister reassure those who are implementing the rural social scheme that their jobs are safe?  Does he intend to disband this element of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta and re-establish it within &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta?</P>

	<P>Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta is responsible for administering the rural social scheme in some parts of the Gaeltacht.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is responsible for administering it in other Gaeltacht areas.</P>

	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see any sense in that.  The relevant Leader company administers it everywhere else.  The Gaeltacht is different.  It is the only part of the country with an elected statutory authority.  I said quite clearly in a previous reply that I intend to give &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta wide powers in the Gaeltacht.  It is intended that the saoist&iacute;, or supervisors, and the oibritheoir&iacute;, or workers, on the rural social scheme will transfer lock, stock and barrel to the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta schemes.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta already operates the community employment schemes in the Gaeltacht.  I am proposing that a single body will run the community employment scheme and the rural social scheme in the Gaeltacht.  I believe that would represent a coherent way of doing the job.</P>
        <P>I would like to focus briefly on employment.  The administration of money is the only issue at stake.  Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta will get &euro;97,000 in administration funds this year.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will get &euro;92,000 this year for administering the scheme on behalf of the Department.  If the scheme transfers over, we would obviously hope to make a little bit of a saving.  Most of the money will transfer to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to fund the administration of the scheme.  That is what will happen.  I have heard suggestions to the effect that 60 people will lose their jobs.  If somebody can employ 60 people for &euro;97,000 a year, good luck to them.  I wish they would explain to me how it can be done.  When I returned to my office in Dublin on Sunday &mdash; I happened to be in Dublin, so I came in to do a few hours of work &mdash; there was <Col N="367"/>an e-mail waiting for me.  The e-mail, which argued that I would be absolutely right to give total responsibility for this scheme across the Gaeltacht to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, came from the south of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>One would not want to, in this job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Why should we be impressed by the communication to which the Minister alluded, when we do not know who the mystery person who sent it is?  What exactly is happening here?  Are statutory measures or legislation necessary to allow the Minister to bring this sort of amalgamation into effect?  Is this something that will be done on the drip, by stealth?  Will it have to be addressed in the new &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta legislation?  I find it difficult to understand this trend.  What exactly is the Minister doing?  Does he intend to gradually remove funding from Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta so that resources are sent in the direction of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Deputy has got the drift of it, more or less.  This, in itself, does not need legislation.  Contracts have been given out for the first part of the rural social scheme, which is already being operated by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, so it is obvious that no legislation will be needed for the second part of the scheme.  Basically, we have given a contract to a group to run the scheme over a fixed period of time.  When that contract comes to an end, we intend to agree the next contract with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta only.  Some details of that have yet to be worked out.</P>
        <P>We have explained this openly.  As I wanted to make sure the two relevant parties were absolutely clear about what I was doing, I met representatives of both of them last Friday.  When I met the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in its offices, I discussed the whole issue and outlined the Department&rsquo;s vision for the future of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I reminded those present of the original concept that led to the establishment of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  It was set up as a Gaeltacht authority, comprising local elected representatives, with a wide range of powers.  The members of the board seemed very positive about my plans.  I can give the Deputy a copy of the statement they issued after the meeting, which outlined their views on what I had said to them.</P>
        <P>I also had a meeting with the board of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta in the presence of the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  When one meets the two boards together, one suddenly realises that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is represented on the board of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta.  Four of those who attended the first meeting as representatives of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta attended the second meeting wearing two hats.  In addition, one of the staff members of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is on the board of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta.  The two boards are not totally separate.  There are strong ties between them.</P>
        <P>I explained the direction of my policy in this regard in some detail.  I argued that the Gaeltacht needs a single strong statutory authority that runs a wide range of projects.  That is what was envisaged by those who fought strenuously for the establishment of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the first instance.  That is exactly what I intend to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had more reports about the Irish language than people speaking the language.  The Minister reported recently to me that &euro;800,000 had been spent on consultants to draft the Irish language report yet that report has not yet been published. </P>

	<P>I apologise but I get upset when Deputies are ill informed. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to the strategy for the Irish language.  The Minister is getting a report done for which he famously set up a Cabinet sub-committee.  How many times has that sub-committee met?  I know it met once because I have raised the matter here several times but how many times has it met since?  When will that report be published?  It has cost &euro;800,000 in consultants&rsquo; fees.  Does the Minister not know enough people who speak the Irish language?  Why does he need to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money on consultants?  We all know the problems around the language.  There are three Gaeltachts in my constituency and Irish is spoken in only one part of one of them, Ceathr&uacute; Thaigdhe, as the Minister&rsquo;s recent report has shown.  I support the Irish language but while the Minister, the Government and the Taoiseach talk a good game about it, this strategy was supposed to have been published, and up and running.  When will it be released and when will we know about its findings?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Funnily enough I have great sympathy for the Deputy and his questions.  Ceist &iacute;, marbh le tae agus marbh gan &eacute;.  Deputy O&rsquo;Shea is always asking about expert opinion so rightly or wrongly we decided because this is a major 20 year strategy that we would get expert opinion, including international opinion on sociolinguistics, to advise us in the preparation of the strategy.  I have a draft of the strategy and it is intended to publish this as soon as possible.  The next meeting of the committee, as the Deputy will find in the reply to one of his parliamentary questions today, will take place next month.  We are making progress on this.  The draft report is being read and it is hoped to publish it in the reasonably near future.  I will not put a date on it today and I will not give my stock answer &ldquo;before next Christmas&rdquo; because that covers any day from tomorrow until next Christmas Day so we will not play that little teasing game.  It will be done as fast as possible.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be done within 20 years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be done a lot sooner than the Deputy thinks.  I will surprise him some day just when he is getting very impatient.  It is a 20 year strategy and we want to get it as right as possible.  It will also include the response to the st&aacute;das theanga eolao&iacute;chta in the Gaeltacht.  This will be the big throw at having a proper strategy.  I have sympathy for the <Col N="370"/>Deputy in respect of the cost.  If it was not a 20 year strategy and if I did not think that Deputy O&rsquo;Shea would be asking all sorts of questions about whether the experts agreed with what the Government put into the strategy, we might have skipped some of the experts&rsquo; costs but there is a saying in Irish &ldquo;marbh le tae agus marbh gan &eacute;&rdquo; and I do not know whether I should have had the tae or fanacht gan &eacute; but sin mar&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government consulted plenty of experts on the economy but they did not do too much for us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I find the outburst about expert opinion bizarre and extraordinary.  I take no part of the blame for the Minister&rsquo;s dithering on the Irish language because on some occasion or occasions I have asked about expert opinion.  The Fr. MacGr&eacute;il report states that the biggest challenge facing the Irish language is to move from ability to speak the language to usage of the language and the gap between the two.</P>
        <P>I tabled a question for the Minister for Education and Science on this issue.  Will the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs address that issue and if so when and how?  I have not read the whole report but the point seems to come across strongly that there is a chasm between ability to speak the language and its use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  I could not agree more with the Deputy.  Some time before it was published I read a draft of the report from end to end.  It contains an incredible wealth of knowledge and I recommend that anybody who is interested in policy development in respect of the Irish language read it although it is heavy reading and contains quite a lot of detail.  </P>
        <P>We were willing to fund the other report because this is a series of reports undertaken by Fr. Miche&aacute;l over 30 years.  It offers something that one would not normally get, tracking over a 30 year period the usage and knowledge of the language and attitudes towards it, which is obviously very useful when we are building a 20 year strategy.  I was anxious that this report would be in the public domain before we published the 20 year strategy because it is informing my view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask the Minister to do that.  He is quoting me again on expert opinion.  That was his own decision, not prompted by this side of the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely, but I did so on the Deputy&rsquo;s good advice.</P>
        <P>Two things emerge from the report.  First, the growth of the language in urban areas is significant and, second, the gap between knowledge and usage is not simply a fact of saying one should talk Irish.  It seems to relate to opportunities to talk Irish in comhluadar &mdash; in other words, to interact with other people talking the language.  This report is useful and certainly will be reflected in the 20-year strategy.  The Deputy can take it that, sequentially, it is better that this report is published in order that we can build its recommendations into the strategy, thus taking account of the interesting recommendations that were made.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important new legislation coming before the House, <Col N="373"/>not least because a number of years ago I proposed this type of legislation when I was privileged to chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  In addition, I am a representative of Limerick and perhaps have more experience than most of the type of crime with which we are dealing through this legislation.  I am aware of the prolonged gang warfare and feuds which have plagued my city for so long.  I hope therefore to bring some of my experience and perspectives to this debate.  </P>
        <P>Let us be under no illusion or in any doubt that what we are dealing with is a sustained attack on everything in which we believe.  The people of Limerick believe this is not just confined to a small number of people intent on exacting revenge and counter-revenge, involving killing and maiming.  Rather, it is an attack on the city itself, its citizens, their way of life and everything in which we believe.  The people of Limerick believe in going about their daily business, bringing up their families and partaking in the city&rsquo;s great sporting tradition.  They want nothing to do with this violence and so they look to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and to the Government to provide an appropriate response to what has happened.</P>
        <P>Let us recall that we are not talking about ordinary crime in this respect.  We are talking about people who are not just content to maim or kill in the most horrific ways, as well as burning out houses, they will go much further than that.  Some have been caught by effective Garda action, but they want to go further by trying to rise above the law.  They want to be immune from all arms of the State, including detection, prosecution and sentencing.  That is quite an extraordinary situation involving a unique type of crime.</P>
        <P>The extraordinary circumstances we face demand an extraordinary response by Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, the Government and all other arms of the State.  Gangland crime constitutes an attack on the State in much the same way as the IRA attacked the foundations of the State for many years.  Its killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was an attack on the people of Limerick, while those who killed Veronica Guerin sought to attack the foundations of the State.  There is little difference between these crimes and the crimes the legislation seeks to address.  The common desire in all these cases is to confront the State and its people and undermine our way of life.</P>
        <P>The question the Oireachtas must address is what should be the response to the extraordinary circumstances we face.  The first aspect of the State&rsquo;s response should be for all parties in the House, in conjunction with the Garda, to send a clear and agreed message to those with whom we are dealing that they will not and cannot win and that collectively we will take whatever action is required to defeat them.  This message must go out not only to the gangs of Limerick but to every person in the State engaged in gangland activity.</P>
        <P>The second aspect of our response should be to recognise the nature of the criminals with whom we are dealing.  The cowardice they show in killing and maiming is matched only by the cunning with which they try to evade detection.  This, too, is unique and we need to match it by availing of all weapons in our armoury.  Before considering the characteristics inherent in gangland crime in Limerick, I will briefly allude to our approach to the issue until now.</P>
        <P>Even before the brutal murder of Shane Geoghegan and the callous killing of Roy Collins the Garda had achieved astonishing successes in its investigation of gangland activity in Limerick.  All the evidence and research shows that detection and successful prosecution rates match those for any type of crime either here or elsewhere in Europe.  Garda&iacute; in Limerick deserve to be congratulated on the manner in which they have gone about their business.  Members and the community of Limerick owe them their support and the message must go out that they enjoy this support.</P><Col N="374"/>
        <P>Garda&iacute; often express frustration that after spending long hours collecting evidence and investigating crime using all the skills and experience they have acquired over the years and having secured successful prosecutions against criminals, those convicted of gangland crime do not serve sufficient time in prison.  The consensus among people in my home city of Limerick and one I believe extends to the rest of the country is that a member of a criminal gang who is convicted of murder as part of a gangland feud should serve a minimum tariff of 25 years&rsquo; detention without remission.  A life sentence is a movable feast because the penalty imposed is unclear.  We need to be clear on this issue because it is only when gangland criminals are removed from society for long periods that the message will get through to remaining gang members that when they are caught, as they inevitably will be, they will be imprisoned for a long time.  Sending out such a clear message would have a deterrent effect as well as removing criminals from the streets and preventing them from committing further crime for a long time.</P>
        <P>The only objective of any individual caught in possession of a firearm in Limerick &mdash; this is almost certainly also the case elsewhere &mdash; is to kill someone.  A person caught in possession of a gun is clearly a gang member who intends to kill.  No other construction can be put on the mindset of someone who moves around Limerick or any other city with a gun.  For this reason, all such persons should serve an exceptionally lengthy prison sentence.</P>
        <P>How does one show that a crime is associated with gangland activity, a gang feud or membership of a gang?  This has been a difficult question for garda&iacute; to answer in the courts.  It is for this reason that legislation such as this is required.  It can make available to the Garda the corroborative, secretive evidence required to demonstrate that someone is part of a criminal conspiracy or gang and is intent on carrying out gangland type activities.</P>
        <P>What are the characteristics of a gang?  Gangs by nature are secretive and ruthless and usually have a leader.  Their members work together conspiratorially and in concert and communicate with each other.  The best way to determine whether certain activities are gang related is to deploy technological surveillance, as permitted under the legislation.</P>
        <P>It has taken me some minutes to come to the real reason this legislation is needed, namely, to counter the threat to society posed by the nature of gangland crime and tackle the difficult problems encountered by the State, Garda and courts in providing the final link of proving membership of a gang.  I hope the Judiciary will take the next step and match our determination by putting away those involved in such crime for extremely long periods.</P>
        <P>Given the technological world in which we live, it would be naive not to use the technology available to us.  Criminal gangs do so.  Technology has the capacity to solve and prevent crime and target gang leaders.  There have been many examples of surveillance technology being used for this purpose.  The targeting of John Gotti, a mafia leader, is perhaps the most celebrated case in point.  As Deputies will be aware, there is no difference between the mafia and the criminals who will be targeted under this legislation.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to give my full support to the Bill for the reasons I have set out.  The purpose of the legislation is to regulate by law the present practices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in some circumstances the Defence Forces and Revenue Commissioners relating to the secret surveillance of suspects.  These operations can often produce valuable intelligence material, not only at the planning stages of serious crimes and activity but also during the commission and cover up of offences and subsequent intimidation or planned intimidation of witnesses, an activity we have observed all too often in Limerick and elsewhere.</P><Col N="375"/>
      
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for a good system of authorisation and approval for the use of surveillance devices in security operations aimed at investigating and preventing these types of offences.  An authorisation will be issued on an application to a District Court judge, who has to be satisfied, based on the evidence presented to the court by a superior officer of the Garda, Defence Forces or Revenue Commissioners, that the surveillance is necessary and is the least intrusive method available to the Garda.  While, generally speaking, judicial authorisation will be required for surveillance to take place, there are two exceptions where approval from a superior officer in the Garda, as distinct from a District Court judge, will provide sufficient authorisation.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill and hope it is passed unanimously in the House.  It is the type of legislation we need to confront the very real threat which presents itself in my home city of Limerick and throughout the country.  I commend it to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the publication of this Bill as an instrument in the State&rsquo;s ability to fight gangland crime in particular.  It is worth noting that 16 other Acts are referred to in this Bill, including legislation covering courts, criminal law, defence and finance.  I would like to see the term &ldquo;gangland crime&rdquo; in the Title of the<i></i>Bill<i>. </i> We still talk of subversive and terrorist threats, but the landscape has changed.  While I do not question the substance of the initiative, it is almost as if we are afraid to acknowledge openly the specific modern threat gangland crime poses to our society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many Members of the Oireachtas have tried to enact proposals such as those contained in this Bill in recent times, with little support from Government parties.  In 2007, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated similar proposals were unnecessary and would alert criminals to Garda investigative techniques.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The events in Limerick over the past six months, including the murder of Mr. Shane Geoghegan and the recent murder of Mr. Roy Collins, notwithstanding the previous murder of Mr. Brian Fitzgerald, have brought us to what could be termed our very own<b> </b>appalling vista.  The murder of Mr. Collins, in particular, was designed to frighten people against giving evidence in court that could put leading criminals behind bars.  This is not a position in which any society wants to find itself.  In some ways, this Bill lightens the load on people as witnesses whose evidence heretofore may have been the only option garda&iacute; had to secure conviction against gangland members.  This is a welcome development.</P>
       <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>This Bill, and its potential, was played somewhat cynically following the last atrocity in Limerick just two weeks ago.  The impression had to be given that something was being done.  I listened to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, talk about it within 24 hours of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s murder and since then much has been written and spoken about regarding various aspects of this Bill.</P>
        <P>There has been a public presentation on how a member of a gang could introduce countermeasures before the State gets a chance to enact the provisions of this Bill.  In the Government&rsquo;s headlong rush to be seen to be doing something, the Minister has made true his comments in 2007 that criminals are now even more alert to Garda investigative techniques.  Some media reporting has actually provided a comprehensive list of potential locations for surveillance equipment, which is a helpful manual for criminals.</P><Col N="376"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Having said that, there are measures in the Bill which will help in the fight against organised crime.  Fine Gael welcomes its publication and we urge its implementation immediately.  In fact, we have called for such a Bill for a very long time.  Covert surveillance legislation is critical in the battle against modern day organised crime.  Hours and hours of criminal monitoring takes place in this State, but until now garda&iacute; could not use this material in a criminal trial.  Due to this barrier, garda&iacute; have been fighting a very difficult battle.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern&rsquo;s commitment to addressing this situation.</P>
        <P>If we are to really tackle gangland crime in this country, we need to unleash a holy war on illegal drugs.  The free availability and increased amounts of drugs on the streets of our cities, towns and villages are fuelling gangland crime.  No part of our country is free from drugs.  The monumental failure of Government to properly resource the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs and Excise service with the proper numbers of people and equipment makes our State an easy target for crime bosses.</P>
        <P>It is simply outrageous that Customs and Excise currently has just one boat to patrol the entire coastline and only one mobile scanner for use at the country&rsquo;s shipping ports.  One cannot tackle the drugs problem in this country if agencies such as Customs and Excise and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not properly resourced.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s threat to target rural Garda stations with closure is most regrettable.  In my own constituency of Clare, I want to say to the Minister of State &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; our vital network of rural Garda stations.  Stations in Quin, Newmarket-on-Fergus, Crusheen, Lisseycasey, Doonbeg, Labasheeda, Kilmihil, Broadford, Mountshannon, Ballyvaughan, Corofin and Inagh are vital.  Many housing estates have sprung up in these areas in recent years.  Instead of cutting back resources and threatening to close stations, the Government should be channelling resources into community Garda stations and ensuring that they remain open.</P>
        <P>In 1997, we were promised a policy of zero tolerance on crime by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice.   Since then, the State has witnessed some 140 gangland murders with a mere 14 convictions.  The average sentence served by murderers is only 15 years.  Fine Gael wants the crime of murder to carry a mandatory sentence of 25 years and it welcomes the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, in that regard.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Minister some specific questions about the Bill.  In the definitions section of the Bill, section 1(10)(<i>c</i>) the Minister refers to excluding a surveillance device, specifically a camera, to the extent to which it is used to take photographs of a person, or a thing, in a place to which the public have access.  I understand the Minister&rsquo;s logic.  Undue intrusion on members of the public is not what this legislation is about, but the question of whether it places restrictions on members of the Garda in clearly identifying persons on whom they are carrying out surveillance must be asked.</P>
        <P>Section 5(8) of the Bill outlines a three month period for which the surveillance can apply with the option of a renewal for a further three months.  Is it correct that, in total, surveillance on a suspect can only go on for a continual period of up to six months?  If this is the case, does the Minister believe this is enough time for the Garda to establish and build a case against a person?  Are there provisions to extend the period of surveillance beyond six months if this is deemed necessary?</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill fulfils the need to protect the integrity, effectiveness and security of a system of surveillance implemented by designated officers of the State.  It allows evidence gathered in this manner to be admissible in court for the first time.  This is a welcome development.  The Bill is cautious in nature and respects the International Convention on Human Rights.  I hope <Col N="377"/>that we will, in a short time, see the benefits of the legislation.  It is largely an operational measure for the collection of evidence and I hope, despite the amount of publicity about its imminent arrival, it ultimately will be effective.</P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; in Limerick have an exemplary track record in solving crime and bringing to justice the perpetrators of murders.  This legislation will, I hope, allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to go after more senior gang members, who have until now allowed the foot soldiers and those younger members wishing to progress through the ranks to carry out the murders that continue to shock and outrage the ordinary people of this country.  Those in custody for the Collins murder are 19 and 22 years old.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will continue in this vein of introducing legislation on gangland crime &mdash; legislation of an operational type which gives more practical powers of investigation to the Garda, whose members are on the ground battling day in, day out against gangland crime.  I also hope the Government will not place any funding obstacles before either the Garda or the DPP in their fight against organised crime.</P>
        <P>There has been an escalation of activity against innocent people with no connection to the activities of gangs.  This cannot be allowed to develop any further.  The Government&rsquo;s attitude must change from reactive to proactive and I welcome this legislation as a small, distinct step in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government are heralding the coming into being of the latest in a long litany of criminal justice Bills as another step towards victory in the fight against gangland crime.  This is a surveillance-oriented step that was taken by most EU countries years ago and by the US decades ago.  Why does the Minister continue to drag his heels?  His steps heretofore are having no effect in a situation that clearly requires leaps.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, here have been no less than ten criminal justice Bills incorporating a gangland element, but what has happened in the area of gangland crime?  So far this year there have been 11 gangland murders, as well as many more non-fatal shootings.  This is a total of more than two killings every month since January.  In 2008, there were 19 such murders; in 1998, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in Government, there were four.  The figures do not just speak for themselves; they scream.  Ten gangland-orientated criminal justice Bills later, not only has there been no let-up, but there has been an unprecedented increase in such atrocities.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i> reported on 22 January of this year that only 21 convictions for gun murders had been secured in the last ten years out of the 161 gun-related killings during the period, with not one person jailed for a gun-related death in 2007 or 2008.  It seems the Government has adopted a cure-is-better-than-prevention approach, waiting for a catastrophic event such as the murder of Shane Geoghegan before instituting any change.  Any legislation born of such an atrocity must be viewed with much caution.</P>
        <P>More worrying still is the fact that even if gangland legislation is envisaged, its inception is a long and drawn-out process.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government appears to insist on delaying criminal justice legislation; this is not a recent phenomenon.  The Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill, aimed at reducing the importation of narcotics, came into being in 2000 yet was not enacted until June 2003, representing a three-year delay, while the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill of 1997, aimed at amending the enforcement of penalties against drug traffickers, was not enacted until May 1999, a significant two-year delay.  More recently, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which contained provision for admissibility into evidence of witness statements to counter witness intimidation, also lingered for two years before becoming law, finally being enacted in July 2006.  Still lingering in Second and Committee Stages, respectively, are the <Col N="378"/>Criminal Justice (Violent Crime Prevention) Bill 2008 and the Criminal Law (Admissibility of Evidence) Bill 2008.  These Bills provide for the abolition of automatic remission of sentences in criminal cases and for civil restrictions on persons involved in organised crime, along with changes to the existing evidence laws.  Will it be another two years before these provisions are enacted?  How can it be that the Minister for Finance is capable of driving through Bills such as the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009 in a matter of weeks?  It is clear the Government considers the bailing out of our nation&rsquo;s incompetent bankers a much more pressing issue than the saving of innocent lives and the promotion of criminal justice.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, the prison population has exceeded 4,000 for the first time in the history of the State.  This problem is not going away or even easing to any extent.  When will the Garda actually be capable of utilising the provisions of this long overdue Bill?  Will it be 2010 or, perhaps, 2011?  Two or three years does, after all, seem to be the average time it takes to implement any gangland-related legislation.  In the meantime, how many more innocent people will have died?</P>
        <P>The recently announced embargo on recruitment of garda&iacute; will hardly lend itself to effective enforcement of the new provisions contained within the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.  Our economy has just exited a period of boom and extreme growth, yet not even the large amounts of extra capital and resources available to the Minister could secure a higher detection rate for gang activity.  If the Minister could not achieve victory in the fight against organised crime with the Celtic tiger behind him, he certainly will not achieve it without.  The implementation of this Bill will require massive amounts of capital and manpower which are no longer readily available, if available at all.  Had we followed our European and US counterparts long ago in the enactment of such laws when we had the budget to do so rather than now attempting to play a feeble game of catch-up, the picture being painted would surely be a prettier one.</P>
        <P>The Minister has also pledged forthcoming legislation which will make membership and directorship of criminal gangs a criminal offence.  How is it that it is not already an offence?  Gang violence has been escalating at unprecedented levels on this island over the last decade, yet physical membership and even leadership of these gangs remain entirely legal.  Every day our media portray reports and headlines involving known criminal leaders and associates who are roaming our streets freely.  Everyone knows who they are and what they do, but this does not appear to be enough to ground a conviction.  Yet again, we see the Minister waiting for more inevitable bloodshed before administering the legislative cure, rather than aiming towards prevention.</P>
        <P>The Minister has also promised to increase the maximum sentence for intimidation of juries and witnesses from ten years to life imprisonment.  This is good in theory but, in practice, even the dogs in the street know enforcement on this island is weak.  Maximum sentences are rarely imposed, even for repeat offenders.  The Minister cannot even ensure the enforcement of mandatory sentences, let alone discretionary ones.  Existing law coupled with the 2006 and 2007 Criminal Justice Acts apparently imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years for offences committed pursuant to sections 15(1) and (2) of the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act for possession or importation of controlled drugs with a value of more than &euro;13,000.</P>
        <P>However, the extent of legislative exceptions to this apparently mandatory sentence means it morphs into an entirely discretionary sentence which is rarely imposed.  These mandatory minimum sentences may not apply where there has been a guilty plea by the accused, assistance by the accused to the Garda &mdash; this has lately become relevant due to the case of Kieran Boylan &mdash; the accused is addicted to controlled drugs, or even where there any exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence which would make a sentence of not less than <Col N="379"/>ten years&rsquo; imprisonment unjust in all circumstances.  In addition, with the Judiciary being given leave by virtue of this legislation to have regard to any matters it considers appropriate in its assessment of the suitability of what should have been a mandatory sentence, how can the Minister expect tough enforcement?  When even mandatory sentences are being qualified in legislation by vague rhetoric which allows any hardened criminal to excuse himself from such a sentence, there is little or no chance of strict enforcement of any new legislation.  The Minister has even stated that he will send gangland bosses and gang members to the non-jury Special Criminal Court for trial.  However, one must question the effectiveness of such a threat in light of the brutal killing on 9 April last of an innocent Limerick father, Roy Collins, following the giving of testimony by his cousin, Ryan Lee, against a key associate of the killers.  The Special Criminal Court may eliminate the need for juries and the Criminal Justice Act 2007 may allow for witness statements to be admissible in court, but this is of little use when these gangs are willing to kill innocent family members who are far detached from any court proceedings.</P>
        <P>The Ministers who are part of the Government&rsquo;s inadequacies are not doing us any service.  Instead, they serve only to damage Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation.  The <i>nolle prosequi</i> entered by the DPP in the Kieran Boylan case is disturbing.  Instead of serving the minimum mandatory sentence as set out by this House, the perpetrator in that case was not even prosecuted.  Moreover, he was given a licence to operate as an international haulier.  This beggars belief.</P>
        <P>It was neither Aristotle nor Plato but Spider-man who said: &ldquo;With great power comes great responsibility.&rdquo;  That statement is pertinent to our situation.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government for 20 of the past 22 years, in the course of which it has abdicated its responsibility to the public.  Many people&rsquo;s response to the 19 gangland murders that took place last year may be that it is okay as long as these people are killing each other.  However, there will always be innocents caught in the crossfire.  The Minister of State referred to the deaths of Mr. Geoghegan and Mr. Collins in Limerick city.  Let there be no more such deaths.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009.  The legislation provides a comprehensive statutory backdrop for the use of covert surveillance techniques by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners.  It also provides powers to acquire intelligence on individuals and vehicles in a manner outside the system of warrants upon which law enforcement agencies have relied heretofore.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, on his deserved reappointment.  I listened carefully to his fine speech on this legislation.  Given that he mentioned Limerick so often, I presume I will be allowed to make some mention of Tallaght in my contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, I do not have the power to prevent the Deputy from doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always proud to mention Tallaght, but I now have another incentive for doing so.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday, Miriam Lord&rsquo;s fine article referred to the new <i>kildarestreet.com</i> website.  As she pointed out, the website informs its readers that Charlie O&rsquo;Connor has mentioned Tallaght 696 times in parliamentary debates over a period.  I hope to mention Tallaght four times today so that I can reach the 700 mark.  Having said that, Ms Lord also records that our good friend and much loved colleague, Deputy Ring, has managed to mention Mayo almost 2,000 times.  Perhaps he should give the classes on this particular subject.</P><Col N="380"/>
        <P>I have listened carefully to Members&rsquo; contributions.  It is important that we understand the importance of this legislation.  I bring to the debate not only my views as a Deputy for Dublin South-West but also as a Member who in my first term in the D&aacute;il was privileged to be a member of the Oireachtas committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  That was an amazing experience.  On a local level, I am a member of South Dublin County Council&rsquo;s joint policing board, which involves significant contact with local garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>We must not be afraid to take every opportunity to applaud the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do so in the first instance as a proud Dubliner but also with particular reference to my own area.  My constituency is serviced by Tallaght Garda station and Crumlin Garda station and, to a lesser extent, by Clondalkin and Rathfarnham Garda stations.  We must support the work of the garda&iacute; in every way we can.  My constituency colleagues and I are strongly supportive of the campaign for a new modern Garda station for Tallaght.  The current building was constructed in 1987 and is lacking many facilities.  It is very outdated and requires at least to be refurbished.  I will continue to stress to the Minister, even in these difficult times, that proper resources and facilities should be provided for garda&iacute; in all constituencies.</P>
        <P>I do not get as many opportunities as some colleagues to go on the radio, but I was interviewed by Derek Davis last Sunday week on the new radio station, 4FM.  In the course of our discussion, we spoke about this Bill and crime in general.  Mr. Davis reminded me that my constituency, which embraces Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills, Brittas, Bohernabreena and so on, has had serious crime problems in the past.  Without wishing to offend the Minister of State, I am grateful these problems have not been on the same scale as those in Limerick.  As I said, it is important that we support the Garda.  The force enjoyed success recently in a court case which followed the investigation of a murder in my own parish in Fettercairn.  I applaud the garda&iacute; for their work on this case which has been welcomed by the community.  Deputy Rabbitte and I have been involved in a campaign in Tallaght relating to the case of a young man, Robert Delaney, who was seriously injured in a shooting incident and is currently in a very poor condition in hospital.  I take this opportunity to wish the investigating garda&iacute; and Mr. Delaney&rsquo;s family well as we all seek justice for that terrible deed.</P>
        <P>As has been said in regard to events in Limerick and elsewhere, these types of crimes gravely upset the communities concerned.  This Bill will help to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice.  As a proud Dubliner, I am greatly concerned by the growing incidence of such crime in the city and county in recent years.  While many Members may assume I am from Tallaght, I was reared in the inner city and in Crumlin.  During the last election, a constituent remarked, upon being told that I had lived in Tallaght for 40 years, that this was not very long at all.  There has been a high incidence of crime in the general Crumlin-Drimnagh area.  We must continue to support communities throughout Dublin and the State who are suffering from this type of violence, as well as the garda&iacute; who serve them.</P>
        <P>I was in the Chair earlier today when Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Catherine Byrne expressed concern about problems in Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn and Crumlin which have been reported in the newspapers in recent days.  Everything possible must be done to ensure that nobody can hold communities to ransom.  We are all entitled to live in safety in our community and to go about our business in a normal way.  As a near neighbour of the community in Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn, I emphasise that what is happening there is an absolute disgrace.  All my colleagues in Dublin South-Central are working hard to tackle the problems and it is important that we support them.</P>
        <P>When people talk about crime and its effects, they often refer to regeneration and the need to continue to provide facilities in areas that are under pressure.  I have often made the point <Col N="381"/>that in the good times, when all boats are rising, it is important to remember the small boats.  When all boats are struggling, as they now are, it is even more important to remember the little boats.  Despite the current difficulties, we must continue to press the Government to ensure that facilities and services are provided in all communities, particularly in those where such problems could occur.</P>
        <P>May I express my solidarity with the Minister of State, Deputy Power, and his colleagues in Limerick, including Deputies Michael Noonan and Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell?  I do not know as much about Limerick as they do but I am a frequent visitor to Doon and I know people in that community.  What has been happening in Limerick has upset the rest of the country.  I am glad efforts are being made to improve the circumstances in which people live.  Mr. John Fitzgerald was formerly city manager in Dublin and also served as an official in South Dublin County Council, of which I was a member, when it was formed in 1994.  He impressed us then and we were very sorry to lose him.  Mr. Fitzgerald has been a superb public servant and I know he has done great work in Limerick.</P>
        <P>I will never condone criminality.  I never take the view, which is sometimes expressed, that young people would not turn to crime if they had community centres.  I lived in Crumlin when things were difficult there.  Almost everyone in Crumlin, including myself, avoided a life of crime.  We should not be afraid to support those endeavours which try to deal with community problems.  Every public representative will fight for resources for his own constituency.  I hope my colleagues will not mind my saying that Limerick has got the sort of publicity which communities do not deserve.  I say this as an expression of solidarity with Limerick.  We must continue to support the people of that city.  The Bill will not apply to Limerick alone but it has a particular importance for the city.  I wish all of my colleagues well as they continue to deal with the problems of crime.</P>
        <P>The Minister told the House that the primary purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the use in evidence of material gained by secret surveillance in criminal proceedings while, at the same time, ensuring that the encroachment on certain rights relating to personal privacy and privacy of property, particularly a dwelling, which this entails is limited and proportionate.  He said the Bill deals with these objectives in a number of ways.</P>
        <P>All Members have contact with organisations which articulate views and concerns regarding civil liberties.  The Irish Human Rights Commission is currently carrying out a major analysis of the Bill.  I am sure we all look forward to reading that analysis when it becomes available.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for five years, I had much contact with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which keeps in touch with all Members.  The council has made it clear to Members that it will shortly release a brief submission on the Bill.  I note that the council has given a cautious welcome to the Bill and stressed that intelligence-led policing, and not the restriction of fair trial rights, is the most effective way to tackle gangland crime.  I also note that the council&rsquo;s chief executive, Mr. Mark Kelly, said the Bill &ldquo;will, at last, place Garda surveillance on a lawful basis that broadly conforms to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights&rdquo;.  Mr. Kelly pointed out, on behalf of his organisation, that the &ldquo;need for judicial authorisation of most forms of surveillance is welcome but it does remain unclear why it is felt acceptable to allow tracking devices to be placed on people&rsquo;s vehicles on Garda authority alone&rdquo;.  He also points out that in the interest of the protection of privacy, his organisation has urged the Minister to &ldquo;publicly disclose, before the Bill becomes law, the proposed content of the regulation foreseen in subsection 8(2) of the Bill in order to ensure that there will be a human rights compliant framework for use by garda&iacute; of tracking devices&rdquo;.  Mr. Kelly said his organisation hopes the Bill will bring an end to the &ldquo;patent nonsense mooted in recent days&rdquo; regarding the expansion of the role of the Special <Col N="382"/>Criminal Court, which would do nothing whatsoever to tackle the problem of witness intimidation.  I quote Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s words because it is important that we have balance in this debate.</P>
        <P>I fully support the Bill.  It is necessary.  The Minister is responding to a situation which has been brought to his attention by colleagues on both sides of the House.  We must continue to support those who uphold the law.  Crime has been a problem throughout the ages.  In times of economic recession fighting crime becomes even more challenging.  I have lived in difficult times.  I grew up in Dublin in the 1950s and 1960s.  My grandmother, who died 43 years ago, lived in Stephen&rsquo;s Street in the south inner city of Dublin when the British were still here.  She had strong views about criminality and the importance of protecting the rights of citizens and those who were vulnerable.  She abhorred petty crime.  I often wonder how she would respond in modern days when committing crime has become so easy for some people.  It is important that law and order be upheld at all times.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to cause friction between my two colleagues on the front bench.  I mentioned Deputy Peter Power earlier and I am glad my good friend, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, is now present in the House.  I want them to know that what is happening in Limerick has caused a reaction in my community in Tallaght.  One often hears reference to the relationship between Limerick and Tallaght.  I hope my three Limerick colleagues will not mind my saying that.  What is happening in Limerick is something we should be upset about and I know the Minister, with his colleagues, has taken several recent initiatives in respect of those issues.  I wish him and all public representatives in Limerick well.  It is important that law and order should prevail.  I am not afraid to visit Limerick and I hope to do so again soon.  As Limerick colleagues come to Dublin to relax I go to Limerick to relax.</P>
        <P>In contrast to the 1993 Act, authorisation to carry out surveillance under this Bill may be granted by a judge of the High Court.  I apologise for my throat.  Mentioning Limerick and Tallaght tends to dry my throat.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that authorisation is granted by a judge of the District Court only in circumstances of exceptional urgency.  I further note that the Bill is narrower than the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its 1998 report, which proposed judicial and administrative authorisation, a broadly based, flexible and workable system of authorisations, both judicial, granted by the District Court, and administrative, granted by a chief superintendent, which should be put in place and which would give the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the protection it needs in carrying out its function of the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
        <P>I understand an application may be made to a judge by or on behalf of a superior officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners.  Given the covert nature of the proposed surveillance these applications may be made without the other side or the public being present.  I note an officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply for authorisation if it is a necessary part of an investigation, the prevention of an arrestable offence or the maintenance of the security of the State.  An arrestable offence is one which may be punished by imprisonment for five or more years.</P>
        <P>I have welcomed the opportunity to make my brief contribution.  It is important that we all support it and I sincerely do so.  I am pleased to have taken the opportunity to continue to <Col N="383"/>support the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not only in my community, but throughout the country.  We are all impressed by the attitude of the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, in that regard.  The responsibility of the House and the Government is to ensure that the Commissioner and the force continue to receive the resources, facilitates and services required to protect the public as much as possible not only in Limerick, Cork, Tallaght and Dublin South-West, but throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and I agree with the approach of the Minister and his officials, but I have several queries I wish to raise related to some of the proposals about which I have concerns.  I will come to these in due course.  The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 was promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform following the murder of the late Shane Geoghegan in November 2008.  At the time we understood it would be introduced before Christmas 2008.  However, it was not and it took another murder, that of Mr. Roy Collins, to provide the impetus for its publication.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies have been involved in surveillance since the foundation of the State.  That surveillance has a weak statutory basis and evidence gathered from the surveillance is inadmissible.  The Bill provides a statutory basis for surveillance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Army and the Revenue Commissioners and the evidence gathered through surveillance will be admissible.</P>
        <P>The procedures to be followed before surveillance takes place and the record keeping prescribed seem reasonable.  The role of the Judiciary at various stages in the process is welcome, as are the provisions for complaint.  However, some issues remain a cause for concern.  Section 4 sets down the conditions under which a superior officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Army or the Revenue Commissioners may apply to a judge for authorisation for surveillance.  It is implicit in the section that the surveillance would be carried out by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Army or the Revenue Commissioners.  However, section 13, which makes provision to preserve confidentiality, lists the persons to which the section applies.  These include members of the Garda Reserve and the Reserve Defence Forces.  It is pointless including such people unless it is the intention of the Minister to have members of the Garda Reserve and the Reserve Defence Forces involved in surveillance.  Otherwise, it is inexplicable &mdash; how would such people access confidential information, which must remain confidential under penalty?  A period of up to 12 months in jail is the penalty set down.  This is of concern and must be clarified.  There is a mismatch between sections 4 and 13.</P>
        <P>More worrying is the inclusion in the definition of &ldquo;a relevant person&rdquo; of persons &ldquo;engaged under a contract or other arrangement to work with or for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.  Upon reading this any normal person would believe the Minister intends to allow these agencies to employ contractors.  The concept of private sector security contractors involved in surveillance does not appeal to me.  The use of private sector contractors in security has become widespread both nationally and internationally.  Their record in Iraq does not inspire confidence and I do not approve of private sector security contractors being involved in surveillance on behalf of State agencies.  The Minister must explain to the House why the measures in section 13, which refer to the confidentiality of the procedures in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaged, would apply to contractors working on behalf of the Garda or persons who have entered other arrangements on behalf of the Garda.  I presume it is not to allow for a situation where contract cleaners encounter documents on a night when they are cleaning a Garda station.  This requires an explanation.  There is a mismatch between sections 4 and 13.  I cannot envisage a plausible explanation and I want the matter <Col N="384"/>clarified as quickly as possible.  I do not approve of private sector contractors involved in surveillance.  It is simply not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The provisions of section 7 are probably necessary.   The duration of the emergency surveillance envisaged is confined to 72 hours but I believe this section may encounter constitutional difficulties.  Its chance of not being struck down would be improved if the superior officer in the section were defined as an officer not below the rank of chief superintendent, rather than that of superintendent.  There may be a case for extending the conditions required for authorisation beyond those listed in section 7(2), in which authorisation may be granted if there were a likelihood of absconding, obstructing the course of justice, destroying evidence, or if there is a likelihood that serious crime could be prevented.</P>
        <P>The provision that authorisation may be sought if it was considered that a person was likely to commit an arrestable offence is too wide.  The normal procedure is that the Garda must go to the District Court.  If it does not do so and is permitted to proceed through the authorisation of a superior officer for surveillance for a 72-hour period without the authorisation of the district judge, then that is, by definition, an exceptional situation.  The conditions under which that section operates should be exceptional.  To state that for an arrestable offence, a superior officer may grant authorisation without recourse to the courts puts the measures on very thin constitutional ground.  It seems the provision is only applicable in exceptional circumstances and in cases of urgency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us suppose a child is kidnapped, there is a clear danger and no District Court judge is available.  Then it is fine for the superintendent to authorise surveillance.  The definition in the section refers to a case where the Garda suspect that an arrestable offence may occur but there are innumerable arrestable offences.  The definition is too wide for an exceptional provision.  I realise an arrestable offence is one for which a penalty of imprisonment for five years applies.  Why not recast the section and have something along the lines of &ldquo;if in the opinion of the Garda a murder or serious injury to a third party may take place&rdquo;?  If they only apply in exceptional cases, then the provisions under which the Garda may act in this way must be clearly seen to be exceptional.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>I do not propose a full solution, but the section as drafted is constitutionally suspect.  There must be specific grounds if one moves away from the procedure of authorisation from the District Court judge and vests the procedure in the hands of the Garda authorities, even though the period of surveillance would not pass 72 hours.  The passing of the authorisation by a District Court judge should be exceptional as should the bypassing of authorisation by District Court judges, and the conditions which allow it should be quite specific and spelled out in law.</P>
        <P>The final point I wish to raise is another section which should be more specific, section (5)(iv), which provides that a judge should not issue an authorisation if the surveillance being sought is likely to relate primarily to communications protected by privilege.  This is fair enough in one way.  The restriction on surveillance is unclear.  We all know about privilege with regard to solicitor-client relationships, patient-doctor relationships, but would conversations between husbands and wives in gangland families be excluded?  Is that not privileged also?  What about gangsters being interviewed by journalists?  Is that excluded? What about money-laundering financiers and gangster clients?  Is that privileged and excluded?  Just to say that privileged conversations and occasions are excluded is not enough.  More detail must be given, if only in the interests of the District Court judges who will have to apply the law when an application goes before them.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="385"/><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  This Bill is long overdue.  In the wake of the murder of Shane Geoghegan we understood that this covert surveillance legislation would be forthcoming and now five months later and just after the terrible murder of Roy Collins it is being introduced.  Many years ago when Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue was the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman on justice, he spoke about zero tolerance.  It is critical that these criminal gangs are taken on and it is ensured that law-abiding people feel safe because at the moment many people in Limerick do not feel safe.  We must ensure that this legislation is enacted.  Regulations are required for sections 7 and 8, for approval of surveillance in cases of urgency and the use of tracking devices and these sections must be considered on Committee Stage.  These regulations, which will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to proceed with proper covert surveillance, need to be brought in as soon as possible and any issues can be ironed out on Committee Stage.  </P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already involved in gathering evidence by means of covert surveillance but it is not admissible in a court of law.  When this legislation is enacted, at the discretion of a District Court judge, the current legislation governing surveillance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be considered with a view to being admissible.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already doing the work on the ground carrying out covert surveillance.  We must enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out its work which has been fantastic in Limerick in particular.  They have gathered evidence by surveillance but it is not admissible in a court of law.  I hope to raise this issue on Committee Stage and ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
        <P>The video evidence of the interviewing of suspects by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is not currently admissible, should be allowed as evidence in a court of law.  A judge should be allowed see the video of an interview as it is a transparent means of gathering evidence.</P>
        <P>I can talk knowledgeably about my own constituency of Limerick East.  People want this issue dealt with.  Regeneration projects are under way in the city but people living in those areas and in the wider city want the issue of gangland criminality dealt with.  Innocent lives are being lost and gangland criminals are operating as if they are above and beyond the law.  They have no fear about murdering people and think they will get away with their crime.  This legislation should be applied to prevent people being murdered.  I understand the Minister is carrying out a review of the bail laws.  There should be no bail for murder and no bail for those caught in possession of a firearm.  A person caught in possession of a firearm means to do harm and we cannot allow people to be out on bail.  Murder should carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years, possession of illegal firearms should carry a sentence of ten years and automatic remission of sentence should be abolished with remission based instead on good behaviour.  If evidence gathered by covert surveillance is to be admissible in a court of law, it is extremely important that the Director of Public Prosecutions is given the resources to deal with this additional work and the cut of 3% in the budget needs to be re-examined.</P>
        <P>Membership of a criminal gang must be made an arrestable offence.  I note the Minister has given an assurance that he is currently preparing proposals to this effect for Cabinet.  The use of the Special Criminal Court must be considered.  We need preventative measures.  The leaders of these gangs are drawing younger people into the gangs and being a member of a gang is becoming a status symbol which is something it should not be.  We must put these people out of circulation so that ordinary law-abiding people can live in their communities free of worry for their children, their parents and themselves.</P>
        <P>There must be a review of the juvenile court system.  The waiting times are too long.  Young people are coming before the criminal courts a full year after a crime has been perpetrated and they may have moved on to committing more serious crimes.  Resources must be put in place.  Most of the gangland activity in Limerick is fuelled by drugs, greed and money and by <Col N="386"/>heroin in particular.  Heroin rather than cocaine is the growth drug in Limerick.  An extra patrol boat is needed because there is only one patrol boat and one mobile scanner to cover the whole coastline.  Once the drugs come into the country they will get to the cities and to areas like Limerick.</P>
        <P>I have a worry about the numbers of garda&iacute; in Limerick.  A total of 40% of the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have less than four years service experience and this is a worry.  The knowledge to deal with gangland crime comes with experience and cannot be learned from a textbook.  I commend the garda&iacute; and detectives dealing with gangland crime in Limerick.  They have years of experience.  It is critical that these people are encouraged to remain in the service so that they can use their expertise.  My worry is related to the embargo on recruitment and the taxation of gratuities which has been proposed in the budget.  We cannot drive people out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because we need them to stay.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome this legislation.  I want it to be enacted and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na given the resources.  I want people in Limerick to feel something practical is being given to the Garda to deal with gangland crime.  As I mentioned earlier, the surveillance evidence already gathered by the Garda at the date the legislation comes into operation should be allowed to be used in a court of law at the discretion of the judge.  That is critical.  The regulations must come into being as quickly as possible in terms of enacting sections 7 and 8.  We must bring in legislation that will make membership of a crime gang an arrestable offence and we must use the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>People might regard these measures as extreme but in recent months two innocent people have been killed. Shane Geoghegan was innocently returning home from the Canada-Ireland game and Roy Collins was going about his daily work in his business with his family.  The Collins family upheld the law, and their son has been murdered for that.  We, as a society and people, must act, show solidarity and bring in legislation to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with gangland crime and ensure these people are brought to justice.  We need to bring in other measures such as denying bail to those caught in possession of an illegal firearm or accused of murder.  We must increase the penalty for murder to a mandatory minimum of 25 years &mdash; it is currently approximately 15 years &mdash; and the penalty for possession of an illegal gun to ten years.</P>
        <P>Limerick is a great city.  The people who live throughout Limerick city are fantastic, sporting people.  My colleagues will also know that.  The problem is a certain criminal section which is a serious threat to the local communities in the city.  We must deal with the issue.  This legislation goes some way towards doing that but we must make membership of a criminal gang a criminal offence and I look forward to the proposals in the legislation the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will bring before Cabinet and the D&aacute;il as soon as possible.</P>

Deputy Noonan made a point about the Garda Reserve and the Reserve Defence Forces and the apparent mismatch between sections 4 and 13.  The Minister can deal with that matter in his winding-up speech and I will bring it to his attention.  There is no question of private contractors carrying out surveillance.  The refer<Col N="387"/>ence in the section is to people such as Eircom technicians, computer experts, etc.  I hear what Deputy Noonan says about section 7 and I accept his logic, but unfortunately it is based on a misinterpretation of section 7(2).  Again, I will bring it to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  Deputy Noonan raised the question of what is meant by &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; in section 5(4).  In my opinion there is only one type of privilege known to the law, and that is the relationship between solicitor and client.  Communications there are privileged and no other privilege is known to the law.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell made the point about evidence already collected being admissible.  That is a fair point and I will bring it to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  The Deputy also made the point that the legislation should not stand alone but other measures are needed.  I fully accept that and so does the Minister.  The Minister has already discussed with his colleagues and the Cabinet various other measures he intends to bring forward.  Listening to the tenor of Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s remarks, I do not think he will be too disappointed when those other measures are published.</P>
        <P>Last November this House came together to express its anger and outrage at the brutal and callous murder of Shane Geoghegan, whose family are friends of mine.  The message we sent out then was that Shane&rsquo;s murder, and the other crimes and violence we have seen in Limerick and elsewhere, would be met with the full force of the law, within the law.  That we have done and will continue to do.  We also stated clearly and forcibly that this Government would provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with whatever powers it deems fit to defeat the gangland leaders in Limerick and elsewhere.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform assured the Garda Commissioner that any additional assistance needed, whether legislative or by way of resources, to deal with the Limerick criminal gangs would be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>This is precisely what we are doing today with this important legislation and, as I have indicated to Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell, it will not stand alone.  When passed, this Bill will enable the Garda to build on the successes it has had in its fight against gangland crime in Limerick to date.  This legislation is particularly important to me as Minister for Defence because I have a role in the matter, which I will address presently.  It is vitally important to me as a representative of the people of Limerick.</P>
        <P>The vicious slayings of Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins, and the earlier slaying of Brian Fitzgerald, all of whose families are friends of mine, with the Collins family particularly close friends, has horrified and appalled every right-thinking person across the country.  Shane, Roy and Brian were decent, honourable and respected citizens of Limerick.  Both Shane and Roy contributed positively to the social, business and sporting life of our city, but were murdered at the behest of people who continue to show nothing but contempt for the value of human life and the people of Limerick.</P>
        <P>With the murders of Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins the leaders of these gangs have demonstrated the threat they pose to the State and to decent society.  The message they sent with the killing of Roy Collins was very clear and unambiguous: &ldquo;If you dare open your mouth we will get you, no matter how long it takes.&rdquo;  No State or society can allow a small number of people to hold it to ransom in this way.  Theirs is not a criminality born of want or need.  Theirs is not a criminality born of neglect or a deprived childhood.  What they inflict on the people of Limerick is beyond criminality.  Those who lead these gangs and who order such killings are motivated by sheer greed, depravity and vindictiveness, whether they operate in Limerick, Dublin or elsewhere.  They confuse callousness with toughness and inhumanity with bravery.  It is all the more sinister that many of these gangs, particularly those in Limerick, have close associations with dissident republican paramilitaries.</P>
        <P>The people of Limerick have been shocked and stunned by the sheer ferocity, depravity and vindictiveness of what has happened in recent months.  The fact the Collins family, a family <Col N="388"/>deep in mourning for their son, are still being intimidated and threatened demonstrates the absolute inhumanity of those who persecute them.  The people of Limerick are angry and frustrated.  They want to see the people truly responsible for the killings of Roy Collins and Shane Geoghegan put away.  By &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; they do not mean just those who carried out the crimes.  They also want those who ordered those killings from a safe distance to be punished.</P>
        <P>That, among other things, is what this legislation is designed to do.  It will help the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its mission to punish the gangland leaders who pull the strings from a safe distance and send their people out to do these unspeakable deeds.  Where evidence cannot be obtained from witnesses, because they are terrified of gangland intimidation of them or their families, we will have the means to use the criminals&rsquo; conversations, actions and movements in evidence against them.  We are empowering our law enforcement and security organisations to use as evidence or corroboration the information and intelligence gathered by a range of methods on the conversations, movements, contacts and methods of operation of key individuals and criminal gangs.</P>
        <P>My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has set out the main provisions of the Bill.  As Minister for Defence I want to briefly address certain aspects of the Bill as it pertains to the Defence Forces.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces perform complementary roles in the protection of the security of the State.  There is ongoing and close liaison between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding internal security matters including in the intelligence field.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State.  In the intelligence field, the Defence Forces act in a complementary role, primarily regarding the gathering and analysis of intelligence on paramilitary activities, while also providing intelligence on external threats.  Military intelligence is also responsible for ensuring the security of the Defence Forces against internal threats.  This Bill provides a legislative basis for surveillance activities carried out by the security services of the State, including the Defence Forces, in respect of their role in protecting the security of this State.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that throughout the period of the Troubles the Defence Forces were deployed extensively in support of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting the State against the threat from paramilitaries.  In this regard it is vitally important that the Defence Forces have the capacity to undertake surveillance and other intelligence-gathering activities to support them in this role and to target their operations.  They continue to support the Garda in respect of the potential threat from dissidents and international terrorists.  They are also engaged in monitoring and assessing any potential emerging threats.  Although the assessment of the threat from international terrorism in Ireland is low it is not one we can ignore.  The collection of intelligence and information, including through surveillance, is vital to ensuring the security of the State against any potential threat.</P>
        <P>Military intelligence also supports the internal security mechanisms within the Defence Forces to ensure that the security of the Defence Forces and its installations are not compromised.  This Bill will support the important activities carried out by the Defence Forces in protecting the security of the State and, perhaps more important now, in supporting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will also enable information and material gained through such surveillance to be admitted as evidence in trials for arrestable offences.  At the same time, the Bill also introduces a range of protections in terms of surveillance activities carried out by the security services of the State whereby authorisation of a District Court judge will be required in most cases for the carrying out of such surveillance.  The Bill also makes provision for a judicial mechanism to <Col N="389"/>deal with complaints, and for separate oversight of the operation of the Bill by a judge of the High Court.</P>
        <P>This legislation is important to me, as Minister for Defence, because it enables and supports our Defence Forces in their important tasks of protecting the State and supporting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I also reiterate its particular importance to me, as a long-standing representative of the people of Limerick.  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation I have been associated with in my time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Although it is balanced in its provisions, it is a powerful and groundbreaking initiative in nailing crime gang bosses.  The leaders of such gangs in Limerick and elsewhere may feel they are invincible.  They will learn in time, as others have learned across the world, they are not.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill to the House and urge everybody on all sides of the House to ensure its speedy and efficient passage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Deputy M. J. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased this Bill has come before the House and I commend the Minister on its introduction.  It is unfortunate that an interpretation may be that it has taken the deaths of Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins to have had it brought forward.  However, I wish it every success and a speedy passage through the House.</P>
        <P>It is important to put on record that it is not only Limerick which has been affected badly by the crime bosses of this century.  There is not a town, an urban or rural area in this country that has not seen the effects of drugs, the impact of drug abuse and the huge amounts of money made from this vile trade.</P>
        <P>I understand the position of the previous speakers in this Second Stage debate who are mostly from Limerick.  Rural Irish towns are being affected badly by drug abuse.  We must commend the work of the Garda who are trying to limit the effects of the drug problem in our country.  I support 100% the efforts being made by the Minister to put legislation in place to support the security forces, both the Garda and the Defence Forces.  It is interesting to note the Revenue Commissioners have been included.  That is a move I welcome because if we did not take some action to support the efforts of our security forces very soon the Garda in particular would become fed up with the abuse its members receive at the hands of these thugs.  It is interesting to view television clips of these individuals being brought into court.  The contempt with which they treat the garda&iacute; and the courts is something to behold.</P>
        <P>In that light, I wish to outline my reservations concerning the way this country can continue to support the legal aid these individuals receive.  This is a difficult area to police but it beggars belief that individuals who have a track record as long as one&rsquo;s arm can be brought into court having driven up in four wheel drive vehicles with &rsquo;08 or &rsquo;09 registrations.  They get out, go in and are represented by individual barristers or legal professionals who are paid by the State and by the taxpayer in the very areas where they ply their trade outside the court.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister cannot deal with this matter in this Bill.  However at some stage in respect of future legislation I would like him to examine cases in which there is a track record of individuals being brought to court.  It might be possible to look at the evidence given against them or the verdicts delivered on them.  If there is a continuing record of these individuals being found guilty for whatever type of crime it may be, then at some stage we must call stop and say that these people are not entitled to and should not be dependent on legal aid from the State that gets them off the hook.  I believe that measure would receive widespread support not only from the public but from garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Having looked at the legislation I wonder whether it goes far enough.  Perhaps there is scope to examine the Bill and see whether some more draconian measures might be implemented in it.  If safeguards are required then let us have a time limit for the renewal of the legislation, <Col N="390"/>whether in six months or a year.  In order to have public support for the legislation we are implementing now and that it be seen in a positive light, it is important that the security agencies, namely, the garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces, do not overuse it.  Let us not take the easy option every time and go to this form of surveillance in order to gather evidence.  If the evidence can be gathered through normal channels let this be done.  It is only in extreme cases that the security agencies should resort to the contents of this legislation.</P>
        <P>In addition, it is worth noting that this country is party to international treaties that will have a direct bearing on the operation of the Bill when it is enacted, as we hope it will be.  We are party to the European Convention on Human Rights and in that regard we must be mindful that the convention states that everybody has the right to respect with regard to his or her private and family life, home and correspondence.  I trust that when the Minister drafted this Bill he looked at the implications of this, and that in three or four months time when aspects of the legislation are being implemented and when individuals are charged, as one hopes they will be, we will not find a conflict, or that some of the individuals in question might look to the European Convention on Human Rights as a way out for the charges preferred against them.  I hope that area has been covered well and I trust it has.</P>
        <P>I briefly mention another matter, namely, Garda numbers.  This Minister and others have gone a long way to ensure that Garda numbers have been increased and this is all very welcome.  They should be put in areas where the need is greatest as I believe they will. Urban areas must be tackled immediately.</P>
        <P>There is also an issue concerning the imposition of jail sentences by judges.  This continues to be source of irritation, not only to me but to many people.  A criminal is sentenced to ten years in prison but one finds that after four, five or even six years that person is free once more.  Can we not reach a position where, if a judge gives a sentence of ten years, the particular person serves ten years?  If it is the judge&rsquo;s intention that such a person should serve only six years, let him or her say so, but this charade of giving a sentence of ten years in the full knowledge that only six will be served, is doing neither the Judiciary nor the legal system any credit.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that it has taken the death of two individuals before this legislation has come before the House.  I acknowledge the efforts being made by the Minister, the Department and the Defence Forces in bringing it to fruition now.  I hope it has a speedy passage and that those aspects of the legislation in terms of its constitutionality and how it deals with our partnership as part of the European Human Rights Convention have been examined comprehensively so that we may be able to see the implementation of this Bill in the short term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Pat Rabbitte in introducing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers of Surveillance) Bill, which I believe is the forerunner to the legislation before the House today.  I also acknowledge the very helpful document published by the Oireachtas Library and Research service, which was an invaluable source for me, in particular, in seeking to interpret the legislation. </P>
        <P>The basis on which we would support the legislation is the morass that exists in Irish society today.  This is exemplified by the spate of ruthless killings we have borne witness to over a number of years.  The question outside these walls is whether the tipping point has been reached &mdash; and whether this legislative proposal will facilitate that tipping point to restore some semblance of peace, again, on our streets.  We were previously told that the murder of Veronica Guerin was the turning point in the context of gangland killings.  That point came and went and now we are being told that the murder of Shane Geoghegan in Limerick is the turning <Col N="391"/>point.  I hope it is, and I continue to hope that this legislation, while it will not be a panacea, will facilitate a process that will allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have the necessary tools to allow it to carry out its work in this regard.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Rabbitte has said recently, in outlining the Labour Party position on this, the fundamental question is whether the response by way of legislation is reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.  I believe that it is and that the Garda must be given powers to respond in a manner that facilitates a preventative mechanism.  The powers within this legislation, on first reading, would deem that to be the case.  I am encouraged, also, by the statement on 17 April by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which gave a cautious welcome to the Bill.  Its statement said that intelligence-led policing and not the restriction of fair trial rights was the most effective way to tackle gangland crime.  I refer specifically to Mr. Mark Kelly, the ICCL&rsquo;s director who stated that the Bill would at last place Garda surveillance on a lawful basis that broadly conforms to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  He went on to say that the need for judicial authorisation of most forms of surveillance was welcome.  However, it remained unclear why it was felt unacceptable to allow tracking devices to be placed on people&rsquo;s vehicles on Garda authority alone.</P>
        <P>While the ICCL has reservations, I am sure many of them can be worked through on the later Stages of the Bill.  Mr. Kelly said that in the interests of protection of privacy, the ICCL was urging the Minister to publicly disclose before the Bill becomes law the proposed content of the regulations foreseen in section 8(2) in order to ensure that there will be a human rights framework for the use by garda&iacute; of tracking devices.  I understand that Deputy Rabbitte stated earlier that this would also be teased out on later Stages.  However, I welcome the ICCL&rsquo;s support while appreciating its concerns in relation to Article 8 under the European Convention of Human Rights 2003, and the recognition of the need to ensure that the right to a fair trial is maintained, or not compromised in any way.</P>
        <P>I hope that putting into effect an explicit statutory provision in relation to surveillance will assuage any fears regarding the rights of an individual and the need to reduce crime.  I believe that ICCL support for this, while qualified, is significant.  My interpretation of this support is that there is no danger such an Act would contravene Article 40.3 of the Constitution in term of the personal rights of the citizen.  Such Article 40.3 rights are germane to the tipping point or the turning point I spoke of earlier.  What Shane Geoghegan&rsquo;s murder teaches us is that at some crucial point the personal rights of a citizen must not be unqualified.  That is to say, they are not absolute.  If we are to pursue his killers and those of others, then the constitutional rights of some must be subservient to the common good, and as the late Mr. Justice Hamilton previously stated, subject to the requirements of public order and morality.</P>
        <P>I believe that is what this legislation is about.  It is about ensuring that we can reach a stage where a person&rsquo;s personal rights are vindicated but that the common good and the desire for the rule of law is maintained or restored within this country.  We need to get to a point where we can have some confidence that the powers the Garda have will be used to such an extent.</P>
        <P>If I was never involved in the legislative process, I would still take the view that it is necessary for the Garda to have such powers to enable it to carry out its functions.  That this Bill will provide a statutory framework for carrying out such surveillance by garda&iacute; and others is the right approach at this time.  In fact, it is overdue and if the garda&iacute; are not given such powers, then the morass that this society finds itself in, which incorporates the slaughter of innocents, will continue and go unpunished in some cases.</P>
        <P>In addressing the specific provisions of the Bill, there are a number of questions to which I seek answers.  Section 5 provides that &ldquo;an authorisation may be made <i>ex parte</i>  and shall be heard otherwise than in public&rdquo;.  I hope that the power to seek authorisation for surveillance <Col N="392"/>in such circumstances is balanced against the power of the judge to grant a specific authorisation.  If I interpret that provision correctly, there is no onus on the superior officer to state a particular offence and I hope that this power will be used wisely.  However, I am satisfied the specifications in regard to the authorisation leave no grounds for a potential abuse of power.</P>
        <P>Section 5 outlines that where an authorisation is sought, there are specifics in regard to the particulars of the surveillance device authorised to be used, the person who or the place or thing to be the subject of the surveillance, the name of the superior officer to whom it is issued, the conditions subject to which the authorisation is issued and the date of expiry.  It is necessary that there are specific provisions within that authorisation which will ensure there is no vagueness about the authorisation and, therefore, it will not be potentially open to abuse.  I welcome that provision in regard to the authorisation and I hope it will be stringently adhered to when implemented.</P>
        <P>In regard to sections 5 and 6, where an authorisation is sought, it may authorise the superior officer named in it or any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, member of the Defence Forces or officer of the Revenue Commissioners designated by that superior officer.  There is a provision where a superior officer may seek the authorisation but that any other member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can also be subject to that authorisation.  If another garda who is not a superior officer is subject to that provision, is he or she named in it?</P>
        <P>If we are to grant new powers of surveillance, will there be specific training or will resources be allocated to train junior officers under the legislation?  If the legislation is to work, it must be on the basis that every officer, whether in the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces, is given specific training which will ensure there is no scope to challenge the provisions of the legislation thereafter where criminal proceedings are brought.  Will the Minister address that in his reply?</P>
        <P>I refer to section 8.  What does the Minister interpret as a &ldquo;tracking device&rdquo;?  I have watched many cop shows and we all know what a tracking device is.  In practical terms, how will this play out?  I know it provides for specific vehicles to be tracked.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s take on that section when he responds to the debate.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the powers vested in section 11.  There is a complaints procedure in the legislation which states specifically that recommendations can be made and that a matter can be reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  What are the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in regard to the legislation?  There is a reporting procedure but is there a power of intervention or recommendation which must be acted upon where a complaint is made?</P>
        <P>I understand the provision in regard to the power of a Circuit Court judge and the complaints referee.  That is very clear.  However, the powers in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission are unclear to me and I would like a more specific interpretation of that.</P>
        <P>I hope from a societal point of view, that we have reached a tipping point where we can now restore some semblance of peace on our streets and that once this legislation is enacted, there will be a pressure on people who have acted with impunity which will stymie their activities and put them out of business for a long time to come.  It is necessary to enact this legislation and in that sense, I welcome it.  It will not provide a panacea for all our ills but it will provide the start of a real process which will restore some semblance of peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome this legislation which is long overdue but I well understand the hesitation up to now to introduce what many people might regard as an extreme measure.  Everyone in Ireland accepts we have an extreme situation on our hands in <Col N="393"/>certain parts of the country in regard to organised and violent crime and that we need stronger than normal measures to combat it.  Everyone wants, and is entitled to, his or her privacy.  In an ideal world, we would not introduce or support such a measure as this.  However, we are responsible for, and accountable to, every citizen of this State and it is our duty to see they are protected by every reasonable measure and by taking whatever lawful action is deemed necessary at any given time.</P>
        <P>The people are crying out for action against the growing criminal element which is seeking to take over areas of our cities and towns.  This is one more step in what has been a progressive programme of action in passing legislation, providing resources and signalling through the law enforcement agencies of the State, that gangland violence is totally unacceptable and will be opposed with every resource at our disposal.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Garda on the fine job it has done under very difficult circumstances.  We have seen the level of threats these criminals have levelled against innocent people and the level of violence, including murder, which they employ to maintain their evil empires.  The Garda is not exempt from these threats or immune from their actions and yet they go out on a daily basis and place themselves in harms way on behalf of every citizen.  If there is something we can do or some measure we can enact, it is our bounden duty to do it.</P>
        <P>Having grown up against the background of violence in Northern Ireland that occasionally spilled over into this jurisdiction, it was one of my happiest days when the Good Friday Agreement was signed which signalled the beginning of the end of paramilitary violence.  I do not wish to see that violent regime replaced by an equally violent criminal one and that is why I have no reservation in supporting the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill forward and my only questions are those seeking clarification of certain points.</P>
        <P>It is time we further tipped the scales in favour of those who support a lawful society.  I have no sympathy for the position held by those who say this is an infringement of civil liberties.  Our freedoms are, by necessity, dictated by the society in which we live.  While we all aspire to the perfect society, in which everyone is treated equally, it is the criminals who introduce inequality into our system, unfortunately.  Intruding into people&rsquo;s privacy is not something we should or do take lightly.  Certain measures have been forced on us.  We must react accordingly.  CCTV cameras have been installed in many towns, including Dungarvan in my constituency.  Those who were uneasy when CCTV facilities were first proposed have come to accept them.  They give a measure of assurance to those who use our streets at night.  They offer a general feeling of security to everyone.  The vast majority of our citizens, who are law-abiding and guilt-free, have nothing to fear from CCTV cameras.  If such facilities help to catch a rapist or a murderer, or to thwart criminals in the areas they cover, they are worth every penny invested in them and the minor unease they might cause.</P>
        <P>While the provisions of this Bill might be seen as intrusive, they will deliver beneficial returns over the years to come.  People will come to accept them as they have accepted other legislation about which they were originally concerned.  Law-abiding citizens do not need to have any fears.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has proven itself to be a trustworthy organisation.  It is an honest custodian of the wide-ranging powers it has been given over the years.  I am more than willing to trust the Garda with the latest tool we are giving the force to help it to fight serious crime.  It is up to us to ensure that sufficient safeguards are built into the system.  Civil liberties and rights are for everyone, including those who live in daily terror of the gangs that keep them in subjugation and in constant fear of their lives.  Such people are entitled to walk the streets without the threat of being hit by a stray bullet.  They have the right to live in peace without trembling at the sight of well-known criminals when they cross their path.  The people to whom <Col N="394"/>I refer should not have to wonder if they will be the next victim of retaliation for a real or imagined slight or offence.  A recent revenge attack took place over five years after the incident that prompted it.</P>
        <P>Those of us who are familiar with the problems in Limerick know how easy it can be for feuds to start.  We know how difficult it can be to get people into the witness box to testify against known gang members or their lesser partners.  Feuds and criminality are inclined to dominate our law-enforcement agenda.  It is our duty to discharge to the fullest extent our role in combating the rise in the power of the gangs.  We acknowledge and applaud those who have taken a stand by stepping back into the witness box at great personal risk and giving valuable testimony to contribute to the reaching of a guilty verdict.  Some of those people have paid a supreme price for their bravery in doing their civic duty.  It behoves us to vindicate their courageous stand by doing all in our power to ensure that everyone involved in criminality is brought to justice.</P>
        <P>While I laud those who intervene to try to stop violence, I cringe when I see newspaper headlines declaring that a feud has come to an end, accompanied by photographs showing known gangsters shaking hands for the benefit of the cameras.  We need to be a little more responsible, for example by ensuring that we do not reward criminals by giving them cosy column inches.  They should not be applauded for not murdering each other and not beating up their so-called rivals, particularly when they continue to terrorise innocent people in housing estates.  Criminals, by their very nature, are secretive people.  They are not particularly intelligent, however, in many cases.  In the case of Limerick alone, more than 50 serious criminals have been successfully put through the legal system and lodged in prison for varying lengths of time.  They have generally received long sentences as a result of good policing on the part of the Garda.  I do not doubt that this process has saved many innocent lives in the community.  How much more effective might this campaign have been if the Garda had been able to acquire vital information about the movements of gang members and the potential for crimes to be committed?  How much more effective might it be in the future as a result of this legislation, which deals with such scenarios?  I have no doubt about its success.  The Garda is entitled to our active support, where we can provide it through measures that are justified.</P>
        <P>This country&rsquo;s drug culture, which has long since started to pervade all levels of society, is destroying communities.  It has been pointed out previously &mdash; it bears repeating &mdash; that those normally law-abiding citizens who purchase so-called &ldquo;recreational&rdquo; drugs each weekend represent, perhaps unwittingly, a significant part of the problem.  If there were no drug users and buyers, there would be no drugs trade, no financing of greater criminality, fewer guns and fewer deaths on our streets.  Everyone has a contribution to make in this respect, including people in comfortable suburbia who think the ills of society are other people&rsquo;s problems and are well away from them.</P>
        <P>Evidence is a requirement of our criminal justice system.  I have no problem with the gathering of evidence through secret surveillance, as long as the proper safeguards are in place and are adhered to.  I note that the Bill requires the District Court to give its approval to any surveillance operation, so that the evidence that is gleaned can be used in court.  I am happy that this will be the case.  Secrecy is paramount in all such matters.  I wonder who, other than the relevant judge, will know that a surveillance order has been made.  Will the decision of the court have to be typed up and filed by a junior member of the court&rsquo;s administrative staff, thus widening the circle of people who know about it?  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention that the Garda will generate such records?  After all, the Garda has an established record of confidentiality, as proven by the multiple dawn raids it has kept secret and implemented in recent times.  The <Col N="395"/>Garda has been able to co-ordinate searches of up to 30 premises, involving 100 officers, without prior word of the operation leaking out and tipping its hand.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision for surveillance to be authorised in the absence of a judge in cases of emergency &mdash; for example, if it is deemed likely that a suspect may abscond or destroy evidence or, more seriously, if the security of the State is threatened.  In such circumstances, a senior Garda officer of superintendent rank or above may authorise such surveillance.  I note that such an order would last for 72 hours only, which should be sufficient to allow evidence to be placed before a proper court and the order extended, if appropriate.  What if a judge later decides that there had not been sufficient urgency to warrant the making of such an order by a senior Garda?  Will all the evidence that was collected under such an authorisation be null and void?  What will happen if an order is made allowing a bug to be placed on foot of a suspicion that a person is dealing seriously in drugs, but evidence of a different crime, such as gun smuggling or sex trafficking, is uncovered?  Will that evidence remain valid?  Will it be allowed by the courts even though it was discovered during surveillance that was originally authorised for a different reason?</P>
        <P>Section 11 is important because it provides for a system of complaints, which will initially be made through the Circuit Court.  It is essential for people to be clearly seen to have access to their records, to a review of their cases and to compensation if it is found that the surveillance was not justified.  Access to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is also possible.  Perhaps that will give the best guarantee of reasonable behaviour on the part of the force.  I am pleased that it is proposed to give the High Court the power of oversight of the orders that are made.  It will be an avenue for complaints.  I am happy to note that safeguards will exist in respect of the justification of the surveillance, the duration of the operation and the level of intrusiveness in each case.  The secure storage of documentation and other records that are generated by the surveillance will also be required.  The Minister has gone to some lengths to ensure that the intrusion into people&rsquo;s private lives, and the resultant risks to people&rsquo;s character and good name, are kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to clarify whether the tapping of the telephones of Ministers, Members of the Oireachtas, serving garda&iacute; of all ranks and judges will be permitted under this Bill.  Will everyone be subject to this legislation?  Does the Minister propose to nominate exemptions?  Does the Minister intend to make available some sort of general information about the number of orders made, or the general extent of the surveillance carried out, on an annual basis?  Will a tally be kept of the bugging devices that are installed, the telephone lines that are tapped or the other means that are used to gather intelligence?  I do not think people would look for specific details, but it would be valuable to provide for an indication of the level of usage of this process.  It seems odd that we would not use all the modern electronic means available to us to gather information.  These days of Google Earth and the most up-to-date electronic technology are a far cry from the days when employees of the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs had to climb poles to use what was known as a &ldquo;spare pair&rdquo;.  In those days, spare telephone lines were used to eavesdrop on telephone conversations.</P>
        <P>We live in dangerous times, as I have already said.  Society is under threat and must be protected.  People live in fear, which must be eliminated.  I wholeheartedly support this reasonable method of trying to achieve that.</P>
        <P>I note that the Bill specifically mentions the Defence Forces which include the Naval Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners.  The National Fisheries Protection Authority about whose activities I have serious reservations is not mentioned.  Its members go about their duties in a heavy-handed manner and adopt an unreasonable stance in some situations.  One person described them to me as the &ldquo;garda&iacute; of the sea&rdquo;.  However, they behave differently <Col N="396"/>to garda&iacute; who are mainly willing to adopt a degree of flexibility and common sense in policing, recognising that they are there to serve the people as well as to implement the law.  They have rightly earned and enjoy the respect of the majority of people which is hard won and not easy to retain.</P>
        <P>I am less than happy about the approach and unreasonable attitude of the National Fisheries Protection Authority whose attitude to policing is best described as blind justice at its worst.  I have recently come across cases in which its approach was heavy-handed and its obdurate attitude imposed the distress, expense and hardship of a lengthy trial on hardworking and law-abiding fishermen before the trial was prematurely ended by a judge who clearly sympathised with the fishermen&rsquo;s position.  Such cases bring the justice system into disrepute and generate hostility and disrespect for the agencies of the State and do more harm than good.  I would like the Minister to outline what role, if any, this body has in respect of this Bill.</P>
        <P>There is a serious threat to our social framework.  No society can allow organised crime to dictate to the State.  There is a history in the past century of governments taking the kind of action, sometimes violent, which would otherwise not be entertained.  This Bill thankfully does not propose any such approach.  It proposes measures designed to be effective in gathering evidence so that the criminal justice system can work as it was designed to do.  This discommodes only criminals and it is hoped that it may lift some of the onus to testify in court from ordinary people.  If law-breakers can be convicted by their own words and recorded actions I am quite happy and unreservedly support this measure and thank the Minister for bringing it forward.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Crawford.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The previous speaker spoke a great deal of sense.  He asked whether the telephones of Ministers, Deputies and Senators would be exempt from the legislation.  I hope they are because the Deputy may remember that not many years ago members of Fianna F&aacute;il were ahead of their time in tapping one another&rsquo;s telephones.  I hope those days are gone and will not come back.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Those people were very sophisticated when they did that.  I welcome the Bill because Fine Gael has looked for these measures for a long time. We put our own Bill forward and it was voted down.  I am glad that the Government has brought this legislation forward.  A few weeks ago I read that the Human Rights Commission was not happy with the first draft of the Bill but saw in one of yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers that it welcomed it in principle, with some minor reservations.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision that a garda must go before a judge to get permission to put surveillance on a person&rsquo;s home.  The garda&iacute; must always be answerable to somebody and somebody else must make that decision.  If a garda does this without the permission of a judge what sanctions does he or she face?  I would appreciate if the Minister could answer that question when he concludes this Stage.  We must ensure that this does not happen.</P>
        <P>Some private investigators use very sophisticated equipment to spy on people and get information.  How does the law cover them or will it cover them?  What sanctions do they face if they break the law because they will not get permission from a judge?</P>
        <P>I welcome this legislation because the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have held the most difficult job in this country since the foundation of the State.  They do it well and put their lives at risk.  I recently attended the funeral of a fine young man in Swinford, which is in my county, <Col N="397"/>who was serving the State well.  This is a great loss to his family.  I would like that people who attack garda&iacute; never see the light of day again.  We need some legislation to deal with that problem.  I hope legislation will come before this House that will protect anybody, whether the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, medical workers, ambulance drivers, who works on behalf of the State and is attacked by thugs at any hour of the night when doing his or her civic duty.  The legislation covering the killing or injuring of a garda is not enough.  I believe in law and order and that people who attack the garda&iacute; must if convicted spend a long time in jail.  I would go even further but my party would not share my view on what should happen to some of these criminals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The garda&iacute; have a very difficult job.  They are dealing with sophisticated criminals who have lots of money to hire professional people including legal specialists and accountants.   They have the resources, the money and the manpower.  In some cases our garda&iacute; do not have the manpower, the resources or the backup they need and they are frustrated, when, after working hard on a case to bring it to court they are not able to prosecute a serious criminal.  Something needs to be done about that.  The garda&iacute; think they can get a conviction but because of some technicality, such as a letter not signed or something else not done, these people walk away from the courts and are on the streets again giving the finger to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the State.</P>
        <P>These criminals have no respect for human life, they drive up on motorbikes or walk into pubs and put a gun to a man&rsquo;s or woman&rsquo;s head and shoot to kill.  What is wrong with these people?  We must deal with them.  The decent, honest hardworking people of Limerick have suffered on account of a few families over recent years.  Their county and city have got a bad name because of feuds between these families.  We must stop them.  There were also feuds recently between families in local authority estates in the midlands.  The garda&iacute; should be given the resources to deal with this.  Otherwise, the Army should be brought in to deal with these dangerous armed criminals.</P>
        <P>A young man was killed recently because a family member gave evidence against serious criminals.  According to the newspapers this week the criminals are again threatening his family.  This is a small country of only 4.5 million people.  I do not know why we cannot deal with these criminals.  They are dangerous.  They are in the drug trade, robbing banks and intimidating people.  Surely we can introduce the legislation to give the Garda the necessary resources and backup to deal with these criminals who are the scourge of the country and are giving it a bad name.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have referred before to people with no known wealth who are driving BMWs and Mercedes, as well as having three or four homes.  Some of them are drawing social welfare and pretending that they are dependent on it.  We should be giving powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Criminal Assets Bureau to identify such people in all our communities.  If they can show that they won money on the lotto, then by all means they are entitled to it.  In that regard, I want to congratulate the usher staff of this House who recently won &euro;1 million on the lotto.  The win was well spread out and they deserve it.  I am delighted for them and hope they enjoy it.  At least they can show where they got that money, but I see people in my own community who do not work driving around in big cars.  We all know what they are at, so the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be given whatever powers it needs to deal with them.  These serious criminals must be dealt with.  Something must be done because we cannot continue with people being frightened by gangsters who are roaming around the place.  We saw it again last night in Tipperary where they were driving around five or six pharmacies.  The time has come to give the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the support required to deal with such criminals because the number of murders taking place has got out of hand.</P><Col N="398"/>
        <P>As regards the Bill before us, I welcome the Garda ombudsman&rsquo;s role.  Everybody has to be regulated but nobody should be regulating themselves.  If someone makes a complaint against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the ombudsman&rsquo;s office can deal with it.  If there is a complaint under the terms of this legislation, a person will be able to deal with it in the High Court.</P>
        <P>The Judiciary does a good job and has a major role to play.  In some cases, suspected criminals have the financial resources to hire the best legal advice in the country.  The time has come for whatever legislation is needed to combat such criminal activity and the Opposition will not be found wanting in its support for such laws.  Fine Gael is the party of law and order and will always support what is right for the country, including whatever legislation must be introduced to deal with these criminals who are roaming around the country murdering people and committing other crimes.</P>
        <P>It is a small country so we should be able to deal with the problem by isolating those involved.  We should not let these people operate as if they were above the law.  People ask me regularly whether these criminals are above the law, but I say they are not.  We have always had a good police force in this country since the foundation of the State.  I want to congratulate both the newly appointed Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, and the reappointed Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, who are present.  I wish them well and must tell them that my grand-uncle, Michael Staines from Newport, helped to establish the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When he had to make a decision which side to take, he took the Free State side.</P>
        <P>I welcome this legislation which I hope will go a long way towards dealing with these criminals who must be tackled.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing a good job in difficult circumstances and must be given the required backup.  However, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not abuse its powers, but rather use them to deal with the criminals we need to tackle.  I hope the garda&iacute; are successful because these criminals seem to be getting more and more powerful.  We need to deal with them by taking them out of the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill, which is a necessary support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Ring, for sharing time with me.  As he said, Fine Gael proposed a similar Bill not so long ago, which was rejected by the Government.  Thank goodness this Bill is now before the House but, unfortunately, not before further deaths have occurred.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the first time a legal basis for secret surveillance by the organs of the State.  In his earlier contribution, the Minister said the legislation will allow for the use of secret electronic surveillance devices which are specifically designed to eavesdrop, film, monitor movements and record information.  The Bill seeks to regulate the use of such devices by the interests concerned.</P>
        <P>Secret surveillance is invasive and intrusive, but the death of a loved one as a result of the abuse by others who are using many secret devices is extremely serious.  I certainly welcome anything we can do to ensure that is stopped.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will welcome this measure.  Earlier this week, I attended one of the Garda policing committees where it was made clear that they welcomed a number of changes that have been made in the past year or so.  Those changes have allowed them to deal with situations in different ways, especially the issue of crowd control.</P>
        <P>Up to now the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been reluctant to use such evidence in court, mainly for legal and operational reasons.  It is important, however, that garda&iacute; will now be able to use the benefit of sophisticated surveillance devices, which are essential tools towards that end.</P><Col N="399"/>
        <P>The Minister cited two exceptions to the requirement, which is an important point.  I agree that there must be control over such matters, but some of the persons involved in these serious crimes will not wait for the judicial process to take its course.  It is therefore important that exceptions are allowed for and that people can adhere to them if there is a likelihood of a suspect escaping.  The second issue of tracking devices is equally important.</P>
        <P>A key element of the Bill is to facilitate the use of surveillance material as evidence in criminal proceedings in light of some of the cases that have come about.  I am thinking specifically of issues that arose outside this jurisdiction, in Omagh, where lack of evidence was the main issue in failing to prosecute those responsible for the most serious incident arising in the history of the Troubles.  Some 29 people were murdered in that bombing, including a woman pregnant with twins.</P>
        <P>Coming from the Border area, as I do, one cannot help but think of issues such as oil laundering and smuggling in general.  The death of a young garda in Donegal has already been mentioned.  These issues bring home to us the pressures on garda&iacute; and what they have to put up with.  It is vital that all possible help is given to them to try to stop such criminality.  This week, policing committees, especially in the Clones district, have been discussing the ongoing activities of difficult people in the Border areas on a stretch of road just outside Clones.  There is no doubt that if proper surveillance could be used it would be much easier to catch those people and deal with them.  While they are not murdering people, as is happening in Limerick, they are causing enormous distress to families in that area.  Part of the road that goes through Northern Ireland is being used for joy-riding by cars, motorbikes and quads.  Unfortunately, their use of electronic devices means they know when garda&iacute; are approaching the Border or the PSNI is arriving on the scene.  It is important, therefore, that the Garda is also able to use such devices.</P>
        <P>One cannot overstate the tragedy of Limerick.  It is one of the reasons the Fine Gael Party, of which I am proud to be a member, is so committed to the issue of law and order.  It is unforgivable that a person&rsquo;s family can be placed at risk when he or she gives evidence in court.  No one wants to live in a country where that is possible.  It is essential, therefore, that every possible tool is made available to the Garda to ensure thugs and criminals are brought to justice in a proper and expeditious manner.  If the Garda delivers justice, it will send out a clear message to individuals who may be inclined to become involved in criminal activity, that crime is not an option.</P>
        <P>We are moving into a difficult period with large numbers of people facing unemployment.  Many young people in my area and further north do not remember the Troubles and they may be easily led into engaging in activity whose outcome they do not understand.  It is vital that these young people see that means are available to bring those who do wrong to justice.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decision to introduce a Bill to address the attachment of fines.  It is wrong that garda&iacute; drive out to people&rsquo;s homes to collect fines when the force should be fully utilised to catch those engaged in smuggling, murder and other illegal activities.  We must ensure it is able to pursue these crimes.  For years, we have been promised that garda&iacute; who sit behind desks doing jobs that could be done by civilians will be released to perform other duties.  I ask the Minister to ensure as many garda&iacute; as possible are made available to utilise surveillance equipment, as permitted under the legislation, and bring criminals to justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide a proper statutory basis for the existing work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Defence Forces, Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise, as appropriate, in the use of secret surveillance methods in preventing and detecting <Col N="400"/>serious crime and safeguarding the security of the State against subversive and terrorist threats.  In regulating this area by law the Government is removing possible legal obstacles deriving from constitutional or European Convention on Human Rights privacy considerations.  The Bill will ensure material obtained by secret surveillance may be used as evidence to support other direct evidence on criminal charges or on its own for charges of conspiracy.</P>
        <P>Much of the work of the relevant agencies is directed at serious gangland crime.  A multi-agency approach is often taken to the targeting of criminals, particularly in cases where, in addition to the commission of serious criminal offences involving witness intimidation, assaults, murder and extortion, other offences connected with money laundering, for example, drugs and firearms importation activities, may be involved.  A crucial element of strategy in such cases is the secret gathering of important information about planning, movements, contacts and methods of operation using the latest technological aids, devices and expertise available to police and security services worldwide.</P>
        <P>While the Garda is already good at performing such tasks, they are primarily undertaken for intelligence gathering purposes and the force has been reluctant for legal and operational reasons to use as evidence information gathered in this way.  The Government must make available all possible tools to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Defence Forces and other State agencies to tackle this serious threat to the State.</P>
        <P>The south Tipperary-west Waterford area has been affected by armed gangland activity, most of which has drugs at its root.  While illicit drugs cause misery for those who use them, they provide rich pickings for gangs and the thugs who peddle them.  It is beyond time that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were armed and equipped with all available tools to enable them to tackle gangs.  For this reason, I fully support the surveillance measures proposed in the Bill.  In accepting that such measures have been a cause of concern in the past, there should be no doubt about our determination to meet head on the serious challenge we face.  The Garda Commissioner and Minister are correct to show serious intent in this matter.  The enactment of this legislation is vital as it will send out a message to blackguards and thugs that ordinary people will not allow themselves to be terrorised.</P>
        <P>In Limerick and other areas members of the public going about their lawful business have faced a naked threat.  In some cases where persons gave evidence in court, entire families and neighbourhoods have been threatened and in one recent case, a family member of a witness paid the ultimate price and lost his life.  This is shocking, outrageous and intolerable and cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about recent events in my constituency of Tipperary South to which State agencies appear to have helped to relocate some marauding gangsters.  I do not ask that south Tipperary should be treated as sacred.  Some people have moved from towns where there have been minor problems with intimidation, as occurs in every town, to outlying areas of my constituency.  In a recent incident, people picking up their children from school were caught up in what can only be described as a scene from the wild west when gangsters made an assassination attempt in a quiet country village.  It is frightening that young people witnessed this incident.</P>
        <P>With the support of the emergency response unit, Garda superintendents and their officers, whether working in the drug squad, fraud squad or other areas, are willing and able to deal with the problem of gangs.  However, a proper legal framework must be in place to enable them to perform their duties and bring criminals to justice.  Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.  It is vital, however, that people are not afraid to give evidence and provide a valuable <Col N="401"/>service to the State.  We are fortunate to have a jury system because it has served us well.  While it may be past time, the legislation will be effective in addressing a serious problem.</P>
        <P>Certain groups that claim to work for civil rights and so on may object to this Bill.  The rights of ordinary people were trampled on during the Celtic tiger and ordinary law abiding citizens continue to be harassed, intimidated and threatened.  Our forefathers did not fight to free this country to allow gangsters take control of it.</P>
        <P>As a board member of Muintir na T&iacute;re and a member of the second oldest community alert group in the country, I support any activities and continually urge the public to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and use their community alert neighbourhood watch groups, be vigilant and aware, contact their local garda&iacute;, use the freephone numbers and pass on information on any kind of strange activity to relevant bodies.  The garda&iacute; will not mind hearing every little piece of information on a serious situation.  It is vital they receive support, information and different leads.  One telephone call could be very important in linking a serious situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had shooting incidents and intimidation in my community in recent weeks.  Many families contacted me in recent times to express their concerns about unlawful intimidating activities in their areas.  I have written to the superintendents in Clonmel, Cahir and Dungarvan recently to thank them for their swift and prompt action and for using the emergency response unit, CAB and all the vehicles of the State to show the gangsters this situation will not be tolerated.  From what I have heard, the public are delighted and pleased.  Unfortunately, we cannot have a garda at every crossroads.</P>
        <P>I spoke to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, recently when there were media reports on the downgrading of rural stations.  In my area, we lobbied ten years ago for the reopening and reoccupying of a number of local Garda stations, namely, Ballyporeen, Clogheen and Ardfinnan.  I compliment and thank the garda&iacute; who have moved, in some cases with their families, to live in local station houses and communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The communities concerned now have confidence in the Garda.  There is no replacement for it.  There is no point in driving a squad car, unmarked car or motorbike on an occasional basis.  There is no replacement for the garda on the beat, in the butcher&rsquo;s shop, in the GAA field training the lads or bringing his own children to matches or school.</P>
        <P>People have the confidence to get to know them and feel free to ring them or drop into the station when it is open to meet them to pass on minor pieces of information.  They are not informers in away way, shape or form and should not have that tag attached to them.  They are interested in making a good, clean, honest living for themselves and their families in the community.  Without the garda&iacute; and public support for them, we cannot have that.  The garda&iacute; cannot police on their own.  They need the support of the community and in the vast majority of areas they have such support.</P>
        <P>Muintir na T&iacute;re, which runs the community alert programme nationally, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, does a great deal of work.  It has a number of field offices throughout the different provinces whose members go out to community alert and neighbourhood watch groups to encourage and train them to be active and hold various functions.  They empower people to come together and have confidence in themselves and they do so with the support of garda&iacute; who address meetings and make people feel easy about ringing them at any time, day or night.  Many local garda&iacute; are grateful that members of the public have their mobile phone numbers.</P>
        <P>We often criticise the garda&iacute; for not being available, but they are on duty 24-7 via their mobile or home phone numbers.  Such members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide a wonderful <Col N="402"/>service and we should never forget that.  A number of them have paid a price for that, as we saw recently in Donegal, which activity must be condemned.</P>
        <P>I hate the term but we experienced the &ldquo;heavy hand of the law&rdquo; in my own local area in recent weeks.  It was badly needed because some gangsters had moved from the towns.  The Celtic tiger was bad in that way, in that many houses were built and bought by people as rental properties.  One does not know to whom one is renting.  In many cases, when one rents a house and then finds one has a troublesome tenant or one who engages in suspicious activities, one cannot remove him or her.</P>
        <P>There was an incident in my locality yesterday evening, where some gangsters went into a pub, asked to be served and, when they were refused, threatened to burn the place down.  Such outrageous and unacceptable behaviour must be stamped out.  These thugs must be shown they cannot and will not succeed.</P>
        <P>I compliment the garda officers involved because we have an unarmed Garda force.  Their bravery, diligence and duty in facing up to gangsters must be commended and applauded.  We must support them and continue to do so.  We must have the proper surveillance and legislation to allow for this.  As other speakers have said, we trust it will not be abused.  I do not lightly say &ldquo;to hell with all the people who say we cannot have this and ask about civil liberties&rdquo;.  At what cost civil liberties?  Is it at the cost of people not being able to sleep peacefully in their homes?</P>
        <P>I met two groups today, the Vintners&rsquo; Association of north and south Tipperary and a group from the chamber of commerce from the south east.  All these groups are struggling to do business, which has become much tougher.  They are all paying their rates, taxes and workers and have associated insurance and other costs</P>
        <P>The publicans now have a much more difficult job in dealing with unlawful activity.  We had the smoking ban and other legislation.  We expect them to run good houses, which they do.  They can be under threat from people, some of which is more subtle than one might think, and may have to deal with extortion and other issues.  It is difficult enough to survive in business without any semblance of extortion, bullying, or the outrageous threat that if somebody is refused drink for their own safety if in command of a motorbike or other vehicle, a publican could be burned out of house and home.</P>
        <P>It is high time we had this legislation and get these thugs off our streets.  We cannot have any hand wringing, crying or gnashing of teeth, or people saying it is too tough.  We must preserve our democracy.  We have freedom of expression and the right, under the Constitution, to live without fear or favour and go about ordinary daily living without being threatened or intimidated.</P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; are getting on top of the situation in Limerick and I hope they deal with it soon.  I listened to a radio programme last Sunday where a family man told his story.  It sent a message home to every law-abiding citizen in our State that we are under a threat which must be treated very seriously.  We must deal with it and we all must put our shoulders to the wheel and support the institutions of the State.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to see the moves made by CAB in my own town of Clonmel in recent days.  It seized property it decided, following investigation, was obtained from unlawful revenue from drug dealing and other crimes.  This situation is frightening and unnerving for rural and urban communities, but rural communities may be further away from a Garda station or patrol.  It is good to have mobile patrols.  People are entitled to sleep in their beds at any time of the day or night, to keep their door open or unlocked and not be under threat.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <P>&ldquo;Threats&rdquo; would be too strong a description, but I have often received phone calls when I make a public statement or do something else in support of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which I did recently, and again this morning.  I said in the past when people are convicted of these activities and have served their sentence, there should be double checks on where they get their dole or rent allowance from.  As taxpayers, we cannot provide such payments.  The people concerned can be in bed all day and out all night.  When other people are trying to sleep they are out planning, plotting and terrorising.  If they have past involvement in crime, and the Garda knows that, they must be watched and tagged, not physically but placed under surveillance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our criminal justice system must also be changed.  Our prisons are sometimes more like hotels, with a choice of menus and other facilities. We cannot just lock them up and throw away the key. Community service should be considered more seriously.  There is much work to be done.  Much damage is being done by these people in communities; why not have them out doing the repair work?  It is also good physical and mental therapy for them.  When they do work such as this which is therapeutic and beneficial to the community, their mindsets can be changed and they can become exemplary citizens.  It is a struggle in communities at the moment with the cutbacks in certain areas, and people may wish to develop playground or community facilities.  This Bill should include provision for community service as a real option.</P>

        <P>I commend our judges on the hard job they do.  They should have refresher courses on an ongoing basis because matters are constantly evolving.  There is no comparison between the situation in 2009 and that which obtained ten years ago and we must keep adapting.</P>
        <P>On the retirement age in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, senior officers, inspectors and sergeants, and ordinary garda&iacute; should be allowed to stay in the force if they so wish.  This is because of their valuable acumen; there is no substitute for the experience they have gained over long and dedicated careers.  It is a pity that if they wish to stay on a few more months or years they cannot do so.  They should be encouraged and facilitated, otherwise we are losing a major resource.  Although security is a concern, we should as far as possible bring in white-collar workers to do much of the paperwork in Garda stations to allow more garda&iacute; on the beat.  We need them to integrate with the public and we need the public to engage with them and support them.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister and wish the legislation God speed.  I hope it will be up and running soon so we can tackle together the atrocious situation that pertains in many communities.  We need to rid ourselves of that and get back to peaceful living.</P>

I mo thuairim, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach n&iacute;os m&oacute; b&eacute;ime a chur ar an s&oacute;rt duine a rachaidh isteach in &aacute;iteanna mar seo.  Measaim go mba ch&oacute;ir gur garda&iacute; armtha a rachadh isteach, mar n&iacute; fios cad a tharl&oacute;idh.</P>
        <P>While we on the Opposition side welcome the Bill and support it in principle, we have no doubt about the certainty that must be required in terms of evidence in the courts.  We have no doubt that all new technologies, including those which are yet to be implemented, should be used to deal with people who may be about to commit crimes involving a sentence of at least five years in jail.  We are talking about serious offences with significant jail sentences.</P>
        <P>I must mention, in the most constructive way, that the powers in the Bill allow at least three categories of people to plant the evidence&mdash;&mdash;I am sorry; I did not mean to say &ldquo;plant the evidence&rdquo; but &ldquo;plant the bug to get the evidence&rdquo;.  I thought I was in Fianna F&aacute;il for a minute.  I am sorry &mdash; I was only joking.</P>
        <P>The three categories of people who can break in to plant devices are garda&iacute;, Army officers and Revenue officials.  As they are going into places that are occupied, owned or frequented by highly dangerous, evil people &mdash; some of whom, as we know, have murdered people in cold blood on the streets of Dublin and Limerick &mdash; I am concerned about the safety of these officers.  Some of the powers apply <i>in extremis</i>; in other words, if I am a Revenue official and believe that a serious crime is about to be committed, I must carry out this operation now, as I do not have time to go to court.  In that case the person carrying out the operation is in extreme danger if he or she is not physically protected.  There may be nobody there when he or she goes into the room or building; but that is not to say the people involved will not come thundering over in five or ten minutes, and if they find the person with evidence of bugging, they may treat him or her very aggressively.</P>
        <P>Thus, I am concerned about the different categories of people who will have these powers.  It should always be an armed garda or a garda with armed backup.  We need that degree of certainty about the support the person will have while conducting the operation.  I am not sure of the legal position but I do not know whether an Army officer can be armed in the State on his or her own.  This should be considered and debated with the aim of protecting the individual who is carrying out the operation.  A Revenue official would be in grave danger.  The issue needs further reflection.</P>
        <P>I understand the Bill allows covert surveillance for up to 72 hours without recourse to a court.  I do not have a problem with allowing the designated officer &mdash; on Committee Stage we should be given clarity on who this will be and whether he or she will have armed support &mdash; to protect himself or herself, but there is currently no recourse to the courts to authorise the action being taken <i>in extremis</i> for a period of up to 72 hours.  That time should be shortened.  I do not see why any authorised officer, whoever that person may be, cannot resort to the courts in extreme circumstances.  One should be able to approach a District Court judge within <Col N="405"/>24 hours.  That is not unreasonable.  Wherever possible, there should be due process.  In other words, it should be done through the courts as soon as possible, wherever possible, in order to ensure there is absolute certainty as to the actions taken in an extreme and exceptional situation.  I absolutely accept that such action may have to be taken.  To be clear, I have no problem with these measures provided that the persons concerned are protected and the courts are involved as quickly as possible.  As I said, 72 hours is excessive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to consider why people end up in these types of situations.  In all our urban centres, there are young people being raised in homes where no parent is regularly present.  These are the children who used to be called latchkey kids.  Such people are at risk in their own homes because there is no person with whom they can identify who is on the side of the law and who can affirm to them the values, attitudes and beliefs shared by the majority of society.  It is important that we address this issue in communities throughout the State in terms of support for families who are likely to end up in a situation of significant conflict, which may ultimately lead to the callous, brutal and evil behaviour we have seen recently.</P>
        <P>Intervention at the earliest possible stage is vital and is what we must strive towards.  As a former teacher, I dealt with students who were in trouble, some of them from very difficult family backgrounds.  That is why I am able to deal with the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Were any of these young people members of Young Fine Gael?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Interaction with these families is the means by which we can affirm to young people in difficulty that they have their own importance and worth.  Many of those who end up in trouble cannot read, write or communicate properly.  These are the young people who never received support in their family homes.  It is possible to identify the children and families at risk at primary school level.  The families appearing before the District Court today will be the same families appearing before it in 20 years time.  We must get to the root of these problems by supporting children who do not receive any support at home.  We must affirm their worth and identity in order to ensure they become fully functioning members of their communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There must be an increased emphasis in schools on out-of-hours activity.  Likewise, there must be an improved provision of recreational and sporting facilities in local authority housing estates.  Young people must have access to better support services, which would involve not only social workers but also people who work with and like young people and who can be role models for them.  This type of approach, even in these most difficult of times, is the best way to address the inequalities in our society and the problems arising in communities throughout the State.  I have passed through Limerick city many times but do not know it well.  Significant changes are taking place there under the former Dublin City Manager and the excellent committee for whom I have nothing but the height of praise.  There must be more of that approach in disadvantaged communities throughout the State.</P>
        <P>We should look again at the role of the Garda, particularly community garda&iacute;.  What is important about the latter is that everybody in the community knows them by their first name.  They walk around the area rather than travelling in squad cars.  Most important, they identify with the community they serve.  That is the type of policing we need.  Rather than an oppressive authority figure, the local garda should be somebody who will help people, offer them advice, get them involved in the local boxing club and so on.  These are the types of links we must build within communities.  In their absence, we will continue to have drug-ridden and crime-ridden areas in our cities and towns.  In these difficult economic times, it is particularly important that we provide support to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who are likely to end up in conflict with the law.</P><Col N="406"/>
        <P>There must be a focus on community supports, interaction with schools, the provision of youth and sports facilities and efforts to counteract antisocial behaviour.  We must increase the numbers working full-time in education and youth work and support them in their work.  What a child from a background of crime needs above all is a friendly face.  Such children must be brought into society via education and other means.  In the absence of such intervention, a child of nine, ten or 11 years of age, who is without parents or whose parents are disinterested, unsupportive and offer no affirmation of the child&rsquo;s worth to society, will become isolated and will turn against the system.  Their only pleasure will be from drugs and crime.</P>
        <P>When I was spokesperson for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs, I made it my business to meet staff and clients in some of the drug support centres in Dublin city.  I met former heroin addicts and people who had done time in prison.  I went to the drugs court where I met families who were trying to break the drug habit.  Although this court required significant resources in terms of teachers, garda&iacute;, youth workers and so on, it was very satisfying to see people being presented with certificates to signify their success in breaking their drug addiction.  These were people who had been convicted in the courts of a crime not involving violence and who, instead of going to jail, had opted to beat their habit.  Judge Gerard Haughton of the District Court affirmed the achievements of these people, who had pleaded guilty to their crimes and overcome their drug addiction, thus indicating their desire to re-enter society, by declaring them full and excellent members of our society and affirming their goodness and worth.</P>
        <P>Such a process takes a great deal of time and effort but it is already working successfully in this instance.  If we have that type of fair and progressive attitude towards people who want to escape a life of crime and drugs, and who have not been convicted of any offence involving violence, much can be achieved.  On the other hand, the perpetrators of the appalling and evil crimes we are discussing today represent the other side of the equation.  We are 100% behind what has to be done and so is all of society.</P>
        <P>Legislation must be balanced.  We cannot allow further generations of families to find themselves in the same situation.  In five, ten, 15 or 20 years, we do not wish to see people before the courts of Limerick and Dublin with different first names but the same surnames as those before the courts today.  We must break that cycle.</P>

	<P>I will believe that when I see it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>My generosity overflows.</P>
        <P>We need to be very careful when we move in this direction.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has said, there are truly evil people who know no bounds and who are determined not only to dominate their own society but also to poison it.</P><Col N="407"/>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd mentioned the extraordinary work going on in Moyross.  When Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government I was very pleased to fund that work and to be instrumental in selecting the former Dublin City Manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, to lead it.  Moyross is an extraordinary example of a society which is struggling against great evil.  It needs to be praised and not stigmatised.  There are many actual and potential Moyrosses throughout the country.  There are many areas where societies need to be freed from the extraordinary influence of small numbers of evil people who are not prepared to be bound by any sense of decency or by any or the mores and norms of civilised society.  I agree fundamentally with the Deputy.</P>
        <P>A Bill such as this cannot be taken lightly.  We must strike a balance.  There is a requirement that we do not cross the boundary between the protection of civil liberties and the natural anxiety of law makers and public representatives to protect our constituents.  There is a need for this legislation.</P>
        <P>I listened earlier to contributions made by Deputy Pat Rabbitte when he spoke about the Labour Party on a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill and by Deputy Michael Noonan when he spoke about specific areas.  Members may know that long before I became involved in politics I was honoured with the positions of membership and later chairmanship of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.  To establish where that boundary line exists between the right of a society to protect itself and the issue of civil liberty is always difficult.</P>
        <P>The Bill strikes an interesting balance.  Crime and the technology that surrounds it has changed dramatically in recent years.  A few years ago, while canvassing with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in a part of Bray that will be well known to Deputy Liz McManus, we noticed that something untoward was happening.  We agreed to phone the garda&iacute; because we suspected that drugs trafficking was going on.  As soon as the call was made and was being responded to by the garda&iacute;, one could see activity.  The traffickers were scanning Garda networks, finding out what was happening and were able to clear away.  We need to catch up with the technology the criminals have.  That point was made by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.</P>
        <P>However, we face a problem in this regard.  Garda surveillance is ongoing.  The garda&iacute; are using new technologies in this area but there is a legal ambiguity.  The last thing we need to see is courts, which have no option but to uphold the law, striking down cases which are otherwise well constructed because there has been ambiguity about the use of surveillance equipment.  It is critical that there is a proper statutory basis for the use of new technologies by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners, and for the appropriate use of secret surveillance methods in preventing and detecting serious crime and safeguarding the security of the State against subversive and terrorist activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd that one of the most subversive activities in our nation at present is the peddling of drugs and the barons of that industry.  The misery they visit on societies and the knock-on effect of their activities is astonishing.  It is as if a large rock were dropped into a still pool.  Their effects ripple out and touch all parts of society.  We have all seen this phenomenon in our own constituencies.  We have seen how the smart alecs stand back and, because they have power or are particularly ruthless, use other members of society.  The only way we can get to them and protect society is by providing the Garda and the other forces of law and order with the equipment to fight the battles.</P>
        <P>Much of the work of the agencies concerned is directed at serious gangland crime and subversion.  We have seen in recent times how people in these groups could not care less about the normal mores of society.  They could not care less about what we do in this House.  On behalf of the people we represent, we must make it clear to criminals that there is no place they can hide.   There are areas where a multidisciplinary approach can be effective, particularly regarding <Col N="408"/>serious offences such as witness intimidation, assaults, murder, extortion and a web of other offences.  We must arm ourselves and our society to protect it.  What has happened in recent times in parts of Ireland is truly awful.  Witnesses have been intimidated.  We thought we were past that but we are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be in a position to clamp down on those people.  There is no question of striking a balance between their civil liberties and the rights of the rest of society.  I have listened carefully to the contributions of the Opposition and I am sure the Minister will do so too.  When we enact this legislation we will be making a strike for civil liberties.   </P>
        <P Just="Left">A crucial element in the strategy is the secret gathering of important information about planning, movements, contacts and methods of operation.  It is extraordinary that we have not equipped the Garda and other agencies with the necessary statutory protection in this regard.  We need to ensure that legislation keeps up with rapidly changing technology.  How many of us had a mobile phone 15 years ago?  Virtually every child now has one.  Technology has stepped ahead of us and we need to put legislation in place to protect the garda&iacute; in the use of the devices and expertise which are available worldwide in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is not a simple question of clamping down on drugs barons and their minions.  I am pleased Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd mentioned a judge from Wicklow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a very good judge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">He is, and there are many very good judges on the Bench.  I say that because in this House we are, from time to time, critical of judges.  There is a need for that type of proactive approach to assist people who are getting through addiction.  I was pleased Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd mentioned a number of drug rehabilitation centres.  Very few of us, thank God, have had the experience of trying to deal with an addiction.  Drug addicts, particularly people who live in the socially impoverished settings which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd spoke about, are the real prey of this group of criminals.  We have a special responsibility to protect them, particularly where their families are incapable of providing the supports which the rest of us take for granted.</P>
        <P>The changing nature of crime, particularly the growth of organised and ruthless gangland crime, requires a correspondingly robust legal response.  I am pleased the Minister and his Department have put that in place.</P>

        <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Simon Coveney on Tuesday 28 April 2009:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the publication of ambitious, radical and achievable proposals from the opposition for investment in key infrastructure needed for future economic growth <Col N="409"/>and job creation, achieved through a new and restructured portfolio of State companies;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that the State faces an extremely difficult economic future and that immediate action is required to stabilise the national finances, restore competitiveness and to create new employment;</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that Ireland requires urgent and unprecedented investment in new infrastructure in the areas of communications, energy, transport and water services to restore Irish competitiveness and to create a new economy that is capable of thriving in the 21st century;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges that an economic stimulus package is needed not only to create immediate short term jobs but to lay the foundations for future sustainable employment; and</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises also, the dire current financial position of the national Exchequer and the need for creative new ways to raise finance for the investment required to fund the substantial stimulus program needed for economic development;</P>

       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />implement a multi-billion euro modern infrastructure stimulus package and building programme to drive investment in areas of critical national importance such as next generation broadband, renewable and bio-energy projects, electric grid construction, water treatment and supply and electric transport infrastructure;</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />drive this investment through the creation of new and existing State companies;</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />create a new State industrial holding company, the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA), to co-ordinate, restructure and finance new and existing State companies in the best strategic interests of the Irish people in order to develop the most competitive economy in Europe;</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />finance this investment programme through funding from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, borrowings from the European Investment Bank and a public bond, with a possibility of non-critical State assets being sold at a future date to replenish the National Pensions Reserve Fund;</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />reduce current and future State borrowing by moving planned infrastructural investment expenditure away from direct Government expenditure and into State companies that will seek a commercial rate of return through competitive charges for the use of new infrastructure;</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />implement this investment programme and create up to 100,000 construction, engineering, project management and planning and research jobs over the next four years in addition to creating the conditions for future employment and economic growth; and</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it necessary to say so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is simply for the record.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the Private Members&rsquo; motion.  This debate could not be more timely.  Today&rsquo;s analysis by the ESRI shows that we are now suffering the worst recession of any advanced country since the 1930s.  Working our way out of this crisis will require leadership and radical thinking.  We live in a fast-moving world especially in the communications area and we must ride the tiger if we are to catch up with other countries who have developed vital infrastructure. If Ireland is to maintain high productivity and to compete internationally as an open economy with the highest services exports <i>per capita</i> in the world, we must become leaders rather than followers.  Broadband provision, next generation networks and high quality education are key drivers of economic growth.  To be competitive we must be among the best.  In 2003 this was acknowledged when the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, committed to placing Ireland in the top 10% of OECD countries for broadband connectivity within three years.</P>
        <P>The harsh reality is that since then Fianna F&aacute;il failed this country terribly in many ways.  It failed to regulate the banking sector, drove up the property bubble until it burst and failed to deliver on broadband.  Today Ireland lies 22nd out of 30 countries and is floundering near the bottom of the league.  Universal access to good quality, good value broadband is critical, especially for the small and medium sized enterprises sector.  We must also make the shift towards next generation networks.  However, at the basic level of clearing the bottlenecks for operators trying to access existing ducts to deliver new services, there is no mechanism in place to make progress.</P>
        <P>Smart Government is required in these challenging times but too often it seems that silly Government is what we get.  Instead of strategies to tackle unemployment, we get squabbles in the Fianna F&aacute;il party aired on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  It is not simply a result of one party in power.  It is a silly Government that sets up yet another quango at a time of such stringency.  However, because the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, refuses to address the matter or change policy, we will have two communications regulators which make no sense when one regulator would do the job better.  This is especially the case when the roll-out of digital terrestrial television, DTT, has received a severe blow with the recent withdrawal of the Boxer consortium. Last August the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was standing over a commitment that 80% of Irish households would have switched to DTT by the end of 2009.  Now, we learn that no contract was signed, Boxer has walked off the pitch and the entire programme is in disarray.  Inevitably there will be a delay &mdash; whether long or short we do not yet know &mdash; in taking what <Col N="412"/>the EU Information Commissioner described as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that could, if properly managed, deliver new services in a new digital Ireland.  We should be enjoying the prospect of a digital dividend, but instead we have been landed in another fine mess which is not good news for a country with rocketing unemployment.</P>
        <P>Where do we go from here?  In a recent report from Forf&aacute;s the challenge is clearly set out.  It states, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s current telecommunications industry structure, infrastructure and market characteristics make the timely availability of next generation services very unlikely unless Government plays a strong role in progressing the range of actions necessary to ensure that advanced services become available in Ireland no later than they become available in leading EU countries.&rdquo;  Smart Government is vital for our future.  Nowhere is this more pressing than in the case of Eircom.  Much of our difficulty results from Eircom&rsquo;s current situation as a private company poorly managed and loaded down with debt.  That an offer could be made for Eircom of a paltry &euro;95 million reflects its sorry state.  If another sale goes ahead it would be the fifth change of ownership since the ill-thought out privatisation under Deputies Bertie Ahern and Mary O&rsquo;Rourke was announced to great fanfare.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that availability of broadband is of critical importance for our economic recovery.  The Government simply cannot sit back and do nothing as Eircom is sought for sale at a bargain basement price.  The role of Government is crucial in this case.  It can develop an ownership structure for Eircom which combines commercial agility with a strong public interest mandate.  Now, the key issue is not how to return to some old style State ownership model reminiscent of the days of the Department of Post and Telegraphs, but how to establish Eircom as a public interest company.  Several options for involvement by the State exist outside of full nationalisation.  These include a strategic partnership for the State with a strong European telecommunications company.</P>
        <P>Whatever arrangement is devised we need a structure that will ensure ongoing investment in this vital infrastructure; ensure that broadband is universally available; provide access to that infrastructure for new operators; and provide a good level of consumer protection.  It must also ensure that the infrastructure and operators keep pace with latest technologies and adhere to the central principle of serving the public interest and help restore competitiveness.</P>
        <P>We have seen how semi-State enterprises such as ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann have adapted to changing circumstances while maintaining and developing essential utilities.  There has been a sea change in ideological terms whereby in the past competitiveness was often sacrificed in the interests of competition.  As a result for a long period we have had unduly high utility costs which have created problems in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  However, a sea change has taken place and there is now a greater understanding of what is required for a country with a small critical mass such as ours.  There is a recognition that the role of the State can be very proactive and productive and the models of semi-State enterprises exist from which we can learn. The investment in the national grid and the recent announcement by the ESB of up to 6,000 new jobs and training opportunities is very significant and we all support it.  It shows the benefits of exploiting new technologies and new sources of renewable energy for electricity production.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clearly, the emergence of new technologies presents us with great employment opportunities.  They also provide opportunities for more sustainable ways of working.  Today in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security we heard examples of such changes which showed that with good information technology it is possible to have a greater level of home working, flexibility in the workplace and cost savings as a result.  The recasting of the national development plan with a strong pro-jobs focus as proposed by the Labour Party would <Col N="413"/>be a good first step towards delivering the change we desperately need if we are to become a leading digital and knowledge country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Cuffe, Thomas Byrne, White and Sargent.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Private Members&rsquo; motion dealing with the crucial issue of the development of our new and modern economic infrastructure for the 21st century.  The motion is set around Fine Gael&rsquo;s NewERA document published some weeks ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To summarise my response to it, the good elements are being addressed by the Government.  However, I find some of the proposals shocking and flawed and they would do real damage to the development of the country and the development of our economic infrastructure.  I will set out some of the reasons for my analysis.  We agree on the principles that investment in our telecommunications and energy infrastructure in particular will provide the economic opportunities and will lead to recovery.  This is happening already.</P>
        <P>I attended the energy show today in the RDS where the numbers of stands has increased by 20%.  People there are saying they are busy and that new jobs are being created.  The Irish Wind Energy Association has seen membership increase by 50% in the past year.  There is real progress in both the large and small companies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to investment by the State.  The ESB has set out &euro;22 billion in a strategic plan and this is delivering the change which Fine Gael recommends.  We are ahead of the curve in the implementation of smart meters compared with other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are indeed ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is starting a pilot project.  He should not mislead people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pilot project of several thousand meters.  If the Deputy were honest and talked to people involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pilot project of a couple of thousand meters and it will take two years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and compared with the UK or America or any other country, we are ahead of the curve.  I refer to the roll-out of electric vehicles and the signing of the memorandum with Renault-Nissan which gives us access to the vehicles.  We have a commitment from the ESB to install the plug-in connections and the Government is committed to this.  This is not an exclusive arrangement; we will work with any and every company and by any measure or understanding we are ahead of the game.  We are delivering on some of the aspirations set out in the Fine Gael motion.</P>
        <P>Our home energy savings scheme has been hugely popular. Tens of thousands of people are looking to apply.  It is the best possible investment and the best way of reducing our emissions and improving our housing stock.  The Government is delivering on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Moneys were now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The State company, EirGrid, has a &euro;4 billion investment plan which is well thought through and providing a long-term all-island grid development strategy.  If Deputy <Col N="414"/>Coveney&rsquo;s party is serious about developing renewable energy he might support some of the initiatives in grid development rather than obstructing them.  The Government is delivering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like spending &euro;600 million on an interconnector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are delivering in terms of interconnection which provides us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;flexibility to help meet our renewable energy targets.  We are on target for 50% renewables next year, a target set for 2010.  It is bringing down prices and creating jobs.  The ESB strategy allows for 3,700 direct jobs and several thousand more indirectly.  These are real jobs in a real economy which is recovering and which is providing the opportunities.  We have equal necessity to develop broadband infrastructure and it is crucial that the regulatory system allows investment in next generation broadband to occur.</P>
        <P>We have doubled our broadband numbers in the past two years.  We have a range of different schemes such as bringing high speed broadband to schools and a national broadband scheme covering rural areas. It is ahead of what is being proposed in the UK or America.  They are talking about what they want to do but we are delivering.  It is being delivered on the ground.  It is a good aspiration and it is the right thing to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The electricity and gas prices are falling next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>By half of what they should be falling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; and they are falling for one reason among others, because wind power is coming on stream and it is bringing prices down.  We are delivering a better economy by going green and it is happening on the ground across this country in new insulation schemes, in grid development schemes, in Bord G&aacute;is investment and in Bord na M&oacute;na investment.  Each of the State companies is following the direction of a green recovery and it is working for them and for the country. The Government is delivering rather than talking about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael has made a remarkable proposal of this New ERA company whose chief executive officer would be appointed by the Taoiseach rather than by a line Minister and that company would include everything, An Post, the ESB, Bord na M&oacute;na, the MANs and EirGrid.  How in <Col N="415"/>God&rsquo;s name would that not just turn out to be the most bureaucratic, Kafkaesque organisation the country had ever seen?  There are proposals to sell certain assets such as selling the ESB&rsquo;s telco assets although keeping the MANs and buying in Eircom.  I do not understand the reason for selling Bord G&aacute;is because it is a crucial State infrastructural asset.  This is a mishmash.  To expect to manage An Post &mdash; which is not easy &mdash; Bord na M&oacute;na, Coillte, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is in one company would be a bureaucratic nightmare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a holding company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see how it could provide any benefits or bring any clarity in management or any improvements for our country and our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Minister reads the document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would kill enterprise and it would kill the initiative of our semi-State companies because it would be creating a monster that would bring no efficiencies.  That would be the most bureaucratic black hole one could possibly imagine&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister think we have efficiencies in our State companies at the moment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the right way to go and this is the fundamental new concept behind this document with which I do not agree.</P>
        <P>I do not disagree with looking at a range of options for financing and funding.  However, this new green economy is generating funding.  The utility companies have set out their multi-billion investment plans and are raising revenue on the bond markets to pay for those investments.  There is no shortage of capital and no credit crunch for this new, green economy because in every country it is seen as the solid, safe, clever investment for the future.  It is happening and we have the funding available and the political direction, we have our regulatory and other systems pointing in this direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This gives me confidence that we can deliver this recovery through this green economy and protect our country from future oil shocks and climate change requirements.  However, I do not see that this is in any way benefited or supported by the creation of a single quango, a super quango, beyond anything we have ever seen before, a multiple of the HSE that would have such difficulty, such incredible labour relations management problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a quango.  The Minister is worse than Fianna F&aacute;il when it comes to spin.  He has forgotten what it is like to have a bit of humility. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;such incredible lack of transparency, lack of political control, other than a single appointment by the Taoiseach of the chief executive officer and the board.  I reject this proposal but commend and welcome the support in the rest of the document for the initiatives on which the Government is delivering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many commendable proposals in the Fine Gael motion and I hope we can move away from an adversarial position in the House.  </P>
        <P>Is it a case of changing existing systems or setting up a new body?  I find the discussion this evening to be similar to a discussion I had when I was lecturing in Dublin Institute of Technology.  We were setting up a new course, a master&rsquo;s degree in planning.  We were deciding whether we should teach a course in sustainability as a module but after much consideration we decided instead that sustainability would be embedded into every subject that was taught. <Col N="416"/> Sustainability would be discussed with regard to water supply, project management and all the way down the line.  In a similar way, the proposal for the New ERA agency makes me wonder whether or not it is better to re-invigorate the existing Departments to continue doing and do better a lot of what they do or to set up a completely new agency.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar has expressed concern at the setting up of new bodies in the past, although many of the 800 or 900 bodies he referred to are worthy new semi-state bodies which should stay in operation.  In his quango list he included bodies such as the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design &amp; Technology so we should be careful when we get into that area.  A new agency is not required.  We need to work with what we have.  The Green Party is working well with what is there.  We have record investment in water infrastructure and new tariffs for the ESB.  Bord G&aacute;is is spending billions of euro on clean energy projects and &euro;100 million of State funding is being spent on retrofitting and insulating homes.  Many of the Green Party policies are being implemented.  I would like to see more being implemented and, I imagine, if we had a majority Green Government we would see many more good green jobs being created and more emphasis on these issues.  We are changing the systems through VRT &mdash; which Fine Gael was complaining about yesterday &mdash; telecom links and Irish banking funding for green businesses.  All these are happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fine Gael Front Bench must bring its whole party with it.  While it was talking about pushing investment in water treatment and electric transport, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Fine Gael Councillor Mary Mitchell-O&rsquo;Connor said investing in electric car power points is unjustifiable and that the Green Party proposals on this issue &ldquo;illustrate the degree to which the Greens are removed from the reality of everyday life&rdquo;.  We are trying to put in what Fine Gael is suggesting and its councillor is objecting to it.  Get real.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken to the councillor.  That is a pathetic spin.  Local authorities should not have to pay for power points for electric car charging.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is another example.  Fine Gael is talking about further investment in water infrastructure.  However, Fine Gael Councillors John Bailey and Louise Cosgrave of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council are tabling section 140 motions to halt the construction of sewage treatment plants.  Fine Gael must get real and ensure that its members are singing from the same hymn sheet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s Government is not giving them any money.  That is the problem.  Fine Gael people understand what a budget is, but Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s party does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to see improvements in water and sewage treatment and electric charging, yet Fine Gael councillors are trying to block them. Before Fine Gael members put fantastic ideas into the discourse about what we need to do, they should ensure that its party members are on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is pathetic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy Cuffe raised this issue of Fine Gael activities at a local level.  While Fine Gael calls for electric grid construction, it has never outlined whether it is for or against putting these electric grid constructions underground.  Councillors and some of my friends who are D&aacute;il Deputies would give the impression that at a local level Fine Gael supports putting them underground, yet it has never made that clear and has not done so tonight.  It has called for electric grid construction.  Does it tell Fine Gael local representatives in County Meath that Fine Gael at a national level supports putting these wires overground?</P>

It wants to privatise some of our most important State assets, and I assume the Labour Party will not support that.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Which ones are we proposing?  Deputy Thomas Byrne does not know what he is talking about.  He should inform himself before he speaks in a debate in this House.</P>

	<P>Please allow the Deputy to make his contribution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We have serious difficulties in this country.  I agree with the Fine Gael motion where it asks the Government to open a real and constructive dialogue with the Opposition on how best to proceed.  However, how can one do that when the leaders of both parties come in here and raise unsubstantiated rumours about golden circles and the Anglo Irish Bank ten?  We had to listen to that for weeks and it damaged the banking system.  How is the Government meant to engage seriously with the Opposition when the leadership and Front Benchers spread rumours not even behind our backs, but in this House, which had a serious impact on our national banking system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be better do it behind the Government&rsquo;s back?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition has to get real and consistent.  We have a serious responsibility with so many people unemployed.  Many things are happening.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is doing a fantastic job, has outlined many of them in the energy and infrastructure fields.  Our general infrastructure has improved substantially and there is further to go.  The Government is spending much money on capital projects this year.  The question is where one gets the money to do more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, that is what our proposal is about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are already spending a massive amount of money and I do not know, given the large social welfare bills that we, unfortunately, must pay, where we will get the rest.  I do not believe in the Fine Gael proposal for the super quango that will have to go out and borrow more and more.  We already have to borrow for NAMA, a crucial initiative.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance because it would be very easy to put his head in the sand and say we are only a small country and we are in deep trouble.  Instead he has launched <Col N="418"/>a very innovative proposal, one that is not yet fully worked out.  The details will be in the legislation, but the main points are there and it is crucial to the further development of this economy.  However, when that was announced, without even examining the details, the Opposition talked about bank and builder bail outs instead the real issue, the real economy, the jobs we need to create and sustain, and the money that needs to go into the economy and out of these zombie banks.  The Opposition has a duty to recognise sometimes that some ideas the Government puts forward are good.  They can be amended and tweaked, and we welcome constructive proposals from the Opposition, but to denounce this proposal immediately as a bail out for builders or bankers is outrageous and incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Deputy doing with this proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>On this side of the House we know our responsibilities, which are major and unprecedented.  First, we have to get on with the job of stabilising the public finance system and the banks.  We have to maintain a pro-enterprise, competitive taxation system.  I would like the Commission on Taxation to examine ways we can maintain a low tax system with taxes adjusted to best attract jobs and investment and encourage people to stay and work and invest in our economy.  We recognise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to building a world-class science and technology sector in Ireland.  There is plenty of evidence of that and plenty of employment in my region of the country.  The Labour Party motion calls on the Government to avail of lower tender prices for school building.  Of course we are doing so.  Why would anybody have to call on us to avail of lower tender prices?  That is why the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, is able to get many more schools done this year than last year.  We must get prices down all over the economy to make up for the tax increases and wage cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to speak this evening on the importance of sustained and increased infrastructural investment in the green economy.  Speakers from all sides of the House mentioned the great economic potential for this country from tapping into the environmental services and goods markets, and they are right.  I heard Deputy Ferris speak last night about what he terms cheap talk from the Government about the green economy and of cuts running deep.  He is  wrong.  This Government is investing more in green infrastructural spend than any previous Government has done.</P>
        <P>When this Government was formed, we expected &euro;100 million to be spent over five years on the delivery of energy efficiency in housing stock; this year alone &euro;93 million will be spent on such schemes as the home energy saving scheme, the warmer homes schemes and a scheme for social housing.  There is also the rolling out of the smart meters programme, which will see between 6,000 and 8,000 houses receive smart meters in the initial pilot project so people can increase energy efficiency, save money and lower their bills.  The Government is providing funding for research into renewable energy such as the &euro;26 million ocean energy initiative and the extension of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s remit to include sustainable energy and energy-efficient technologies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Only &euro;7 million of the &euro;26 million is committed.  The Deputy should not fool people.  She should at least be honest.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="419"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>This year also sees massive investment in water infrastructure and a continuing increase in the number of group water schemes, in compliance with national drinking water standards.  Water is a fundamental issue.  It is everybody&rsquo;s issue.  It knows no boundaries.  Water is precious and we must safeguard it.  We are putting considerable resources towards that, which is one of my major objectives.</P>
        <P>The Government has a commitment to investment in public transport, another form of environmentally friendly infrastructure.  Almost &euro;1 billion is being spent this year on public transport projects and the safeguarding of future public transport projects will ensure jobs are sustained and that our travelling and commuting trends will be sustainable.</P>
        <P>An issue which must be addressed is co-operation between State agencies and local players in developing the green economy and green infrastructural spend.  I am trying to advance an example of a project in my home town so that Carlow can become the first green energy town in Ireland.  What would such a town mean?  It would mean energy efficient housing stock powered by green energy.  It would mean that public transport is powered by renewable energies, with commuter buses for neighbouring towns and villages, running on bio-fuel.  Some already do so, as do some of our businesses which feed into light rail powered by bio-gas.  That offers farmers an example of an end use for waste straws and slurries.</P>
        <P>It would mean the establishment of a biomass depot, as envisaged by Coillte, where residual wood such as thinnings might be used as a source of energy.  These are particularly good examples for a rural community.  It would mean a bio-gas plant as a source of power.  I think of third-level institutions and hope that Carlow Institute of Technology might become the first Solarteur school in Ireland, training engineers, designers, installers in all forms of renewable energy.  I have spoken to the director, Dr. Ruairi Nevin, about the need to progress this idea, to my county manager, Tom Barry, and to Dr. Jimmy Burke of Teagasc about bringing all these initiatives into play so that we can create jobs in Carlow and make it a dynamic green town.</P>
        <P>All these projects, and similar concepts for other towns throughout rural Ireland, need co-ordination between agencies.  I would like to see a further role being played by the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this regard.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is advancing the digital economy with his work on next-generation broadband, the national broadband scheme and other projects.  Capital borrowing makes sense at this juncture and that is why the Government is continuing to spend.</P>
        <P>Recessions have the potential to sap the very soul of people.  It is easy to get depressed when one has lost one&rsquo;s job or one&rsquo;s savings or both.  What we must do is send a very clear message, not only of hope for a quick recovery but of a clear path that will chart Ireland&rsquo;s journey back to a solid financial recovery that will boost confidence in the markets and grow jobs.  That is our mandate and that is what we are doing, offering simple pathways to progress based on the new green deal which is long-term and eminently achievable.  There is no other way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted we are debating this Fine Gael motion which calls for the creation of a new economy capable of thriving in the 21st century.  Athough the motion does not mention peak oil specifically nor state that the fossil fuel energy we take for granted today will be unaffordable in the future, we must presume that what we are discussing in this debate is a post-carbon economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done, Minister.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="420"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I had to put two and two together but it is not always clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall tell the Deputy the reason.  This post-carbon economy needs to be able to support a sufficient number of jobs to meet its basic needs and must be run in a way that prevents problems whose cost will become unaffordable.</P>
        <P>With all this in mind I am delighted my position makes me responsible for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry.  Recent figures show it had an annual estimate of &euro;16.6 billion in turnover, namely, 8% of GDP.  The food and drink industry accounts for 20% of net exports and 9.1% of total employment.  The industry includes 678 companies and 136,500 family-run farms with a further 111,000 people employed in the food and drink industry and in associated services.</P>
        <P>It is obvious why the food and drink industry is regarded as the country&rsquo;s most important indigenous industry.  When I saw the Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion it appeared at first to be long and comprehensive.  It mentioned important developments such as broadband, bioenergy products, electric grid construction, water treatment and supply, electric transport infrastructure and various engineering and construction projects.  I know the Opposition cannot do everything but I believe it is important to try to fill in the gaps in the debate.  Unfortunately, I did not see any mention of infrastructure relating to food and agriculture.  Notwithstanding this omission by Fine Gael, I wish to state the Government is committed to developing the potential of food industry infrastructure to ensure food security and establish a maximum number of sustainable jobs in Ireland.  We continue to market the country abroad as the clean green food island.</P>
        <P>Sadly, as input costs rise it will be difficult to sustain some of the jobs which depend on those input costs.  However, there are opportunities to create new jobs in the transition period now under way as we move towards a post-fossil fuel economy.  At present the international food production and trading system means that for every calorie of food an EU citizen eats there is a requirement to use seven to ten calories of fossil fuel in the production and transportation of that one food calorie.  In the case of a South African carrot sold in Ireland, the ration is more like 66 fossil fuel calories required to bring one calorie of food onto an Irish plate.  It must be borne in mind that one third of fossil fuel input is made up of agri-chemical inputs in food production.  This considerable dependence on fossil fuel energy to meet basic food needs is one of the many reasons organic food production, for example, is growing in popularity.  On average, organic production uses one third less fossil fuel and therefore is more resilient to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.  Research by the Soil Association in the UK indicates that organic farms sustain one third more jobs than do non-organic farms.  Some organic farms have increased their efficiency to an extraordinary extent.  One farm I visited in Oxfordshire in England was 78% more energy efficient than a non-organic equivalent, according to a University of Essex study.</P>
        <P>Another part of my work is to encourage the establishment of new food businesses and to highlight new opportunities for new businesses to grow.  These opportunities are enhanced with the development of planning infrastructure which facilitates more direct sales, for example, through farm shops and farmers&rsquo; markets.</P>
        <P>Food production is not just about making money but also about developing sustainable jobs.  Given the cost of obesity and poor health to our health service, we also need to have healthy food in Ireland.  The 2005 report from the national taskforce on obesity highlights the very great costs of overlooking this issue and shows that provision of healthy food is essential to a sustainable society.  The report indicates that premature deaths, days lost to the workplace due <Col N="421"/>to illnesses arising from obesity and the many medical costs of diet-related illnesses land the State with a cost of well over &euro;4 billion per year.  Clearly all efforts to encourage the consumption of healthy food need to be encouraged if we are to have that sustainable post-fossil fuel economy.</P>
        <P>I hope it is clear to my colleagues on the Fine Gael benches why I feel this is vital.  If we are talking about grids, transport and all the other consumers of energy we must include food.  It is not obvious enough, unfortunately, that we need fossil fuel energy to produce the food we now take for granted.  We will not have it in future so must move to a post-fossil fuel food economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Deputies O&rsquo;Mahony, Terence Flanagan, D&rsquo;Arcy, McHugh and Doyle.  The motion on which we speak today is really about creating jobs, more jobs and then further jobs for the economy.  On a day when we heard figures from the ESRI and the CSO which predict that by the end of next year one in five persons will be unemployed in this country, we must place our emphasis on protecting jobs, stopping the haemorrhaging of jobs now in the economy and creating new ones.  To do that we need investment.  We must invest in infrastructure, water and wastewater treatment.  Broadband is essential for a small open economy such as ours which depends so much on exports.  Exports will once again become very important to the economic success of this country.  I heard the Minister speak tonight about broadband and on the &ldquo;Six O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo; I saw a representative of small and medium enterprises speak about the lack of broadband facilities across this country.  There is a great disconnect between what we hear in this Chamber and what is said on the &ldquo;Six O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody should inform the Minister what it is like to try and establish a small business outside Dublin.  It is abysmal, given the broadband infrastructure, which is a major impediment against improving competitiveness.  Time and again it comes up as one of the gaping holes in this country&rsquo;s infrastructure and it must be tackled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend and support the motion.  It is about a new type of thinking for a new era.  If we do not change, we shall always get the same results.  When we think back to Ardnacrusha, the establishment of the ESB and rural electrification, these were major challenges at the time and they were brave and bold initiatives.  This new era fits into that category.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed at the response of the Minister of State, where he totally dismissed the motion.  He seemed to be looking at it for the first time and was not familiar with it.  That is disappointing since there are so many positive new ways of moving forward in a green economy.  This small open economy wants to play its role again, to re-establish where we were in the 1980s and 1990s.  At that stage it was our infrastructure and also our education standards that ensured we reached the heights to which we became accustomed.</P>
        <P>Today we received a response from the Government to the motion, which is extremely disappointing.  One wonders whether the people who drafted this response are aware of what is happening in the light of the announcements that have been made in recent weeks.  The Government response talks about investment in public transport, for example.  Is it aware that bus routes have been axed and that there are empty bus lanes?  The car parking levy which was supposed to encourage the use of public transport has been scrapped.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment to the motion asks us to commend its action directed at stabilising the public finances.  We had a budget earlier this month that did nothing to tackle public finances.  It was a tax on workers, there was no emphasis on tackling waste and inefficiencies <Col N="422"/>or bureaucracy, no mention of a stimulus package to encourage job creation and job maintenance.  The Government&rsquo;s response was to note the commitment to science, innovation and technology.  Are the people who drafted the amendment aware that funding for science and engineering research has been cut this year?  Are they aware that the cuts we had in the budget before Christmas, as regards education and class sizes, will mean that classes in physics, applied maths, chemistry, etc., which are essential for an economy that wants to develop as world class science, innovation and technology sector, are being withdrawn and will not be available for many leaving certificate students this year?</P>
        <P>The Government needs to examine its response and recognise that it contains gaping holes.  It does not measure or match the reality that exists.  I should like if more thought were given to the motion by the Government.  It should respond positively to it because it is constructive well thought out and meaningful and it goes a long way towards ensuring that Ireland can return to the era of competitiveness we have seen heretofore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad to contribute to the motion and commend Deputy Coveney and Fine Gael on bringing it forward.  It is an opportunity to explain that we in Fine Gael have a clear strategy that is constructive, positive, possible and deliverable, with a measured outcome of 100,000 new jobs in the next 3.5 years.  As well as providing those jobs, this plan will provide the infrastructure in transport, technology and energy in a way that will protect our environment yet stimulate the economy and provide a platform and a magnet for investment in our country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach this morning spoke about the important need to get the finances in order first, and said that jobs would only follow on that once economic growth appeared again.  The problem with that strategy, unfortunately, is that while we wait for it to happen unemployment will have rocketed to unprecedented levels.  One in ten workers, at the moment, according to the ESRI report, is dependent on the State help to survive and we are told that this will be one in five by the end of next year.  The Government cannot sit on its hands and let this happen.  It asked for constructive suggestions from this side of the House.  I have been flabbergasted in the last half-hour listening to the response, in which we have been accused of speaking through both sides of the mouth.  Speaking out of both sides of the mouth was invented and patented by the people on the Government side of the House.</P>
        <P>The Government now has a positive suggestion to consider, and all it does is provide an amendment which says we shall muddle on as we are, with no clear strategy or plan to create jobs.  We have heard of a few thousand here and a few hundred there.  There is no encouragement for businesses who live from week to week under the threat of closure, no hope for the well educated and highly qualified workforce that is capable of providing and guiding the growth of the economy, but will only do so if it can be kept in the country.  My constituency office in Mayo is no different from that of any other Deputy, with days in recent times when it resembles an unemployment office &mdash; with young people looking for hope and a job, and a leg-up to get one.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach and the Government say we need to get the finances right first.  That will happen automatically if we can protect the jobs we have and help create the 100,000, as suggested in this motion.  It would be an enormous saving to the State.  Every 1,000 extra on the unemployment register, we are told, costs &euro;13 million per annum.  A new job created contributes, on average, &euro;8,000 in tax to the economy.  One does not need to be a mathematician or a genius to see that if one projects the jobs and creates new ones the finances will automatically be restored to order.  The 14,000 people who lost their jobs last month alone will cost the taxpayer over &euro;180 million in the next year.  The ESRI projection of an extra 103,000 unem<Col N="423"/>ployed by the end of next year will cost the State another &euro;1.5 billion on top of the &euro;20 billion it is already paying out.</P>
        <P>I was listing to a F&Aacute;S representative on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning explaining some of the schemes it is rolling out to deal with the crisis in terms of training courses.  It is like trying to keep the tide out with a hayfork.  In Mayo alone, the unemployment figures have rocketed by 100% in the last year, from 6,000 to nearly double that, with Ballina, a small town having almost 3,000 unemployed.  We have empty business premises and business parks around the county.</P>
        <P>I can give an example of how incompetent the State structures are in terms of support for the owners of small and medium sized businesses that have gone to the wall in recent times.  I met a person a couple of days ago who had a business in my constituency until recently.  At its peak, it employed 80, it was tax compliant over the years and paid millions of euro in taxes annually, yet its directors were entitled to nothing once the business was liquidated.  They could get nothing by way of redundancy or for retraining and were not deemed eligible for F&Aacute;S-funded schemes.  There is a notion abroad to the effect that they have stashed away millions, but that is not true.  They are effectively non-persons.</P>
        <P>We need more of a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; approach from Government.  Let us stem the tide, accept this motion from Fine Gael and rather than letting it happen, make it happen.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I too, welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this motion and wish to congratulate our front bench spokesman, Deputy Simon Coveney, on his great work in publishing a very constructive strategy document, Rebuilding Ireland, which has the potential to create up to 100,000 jobs in the new green energy industry over the next four years in areas such as construction, engineering, software research and forestry.</P>
        <P>We all know the most recent emergency budget from the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government was cruel towards middle income families.  It was also clearly lacking in areas relating to a jobs plan.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party have no jobs plan in regard to retaining existing jobs and how to create new jobs in the new economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Investment in renewable green energy in both wind and wave is the way forward for Ireland.  It is time for us to focus and become a leader by investing in all aspects of renewable energy.  In 2008, for example, we spent an outrageous amount of money &mdash; &euro;6.5 billion &mdash; importing fossil fuels which did nothing to improve our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and did great harm to our climate change plan.  The importation of this amount of fuel needs to stop.  We need to keep this money here and use it to become more energy self-sufficient and to help rebuild Ireland.</P>
        <P>One example of where we missed out in not becoming a global leader is in regard to wind energy.  This industry is worth billions each year to the Danish export market and it is an area in which we should have excelled rather than continue to import that technology.  Another opportunity for this country is in ocean energy.  This cannot be missed.  Commercial prototype models are still being developed but, sadly, progress in Ireland has been very slow.  It has been proved through wave intensity maps that this country has the best potential of all countries in Europe to utilise this energy and to make money by becoming a world leader in this area.  By becoming a leader in renewable energy, Ireland will come out of this depression and we will create thousands of new jobs in the renewable energy industry and take thousands of people off the dole queues.</P>
        <P>A false economy was built in this country by Fianna F&aacute;il based on the sale of property over the past ten years.  The Government was completely reliant on stamp duty and VAT receipts from the sale of housing to finance day-to-day Government spending.  Sadly, the past ten years <Col N="424"/>were dominated by land speculation, developers&rsquo; greed and banks handing out endless amounts of money through 100% mortgages.  We have now had a crash.</P>
        <P>This country is practically broke and has collapsed spectacularly thanks to the failed Fianna F&aacute;il polices adopted.  We now must bail out the developers who not only bought land here, but abroad.  Where was the Financial Regulator?  Where was the governor of the Central Bank during this time?  The house of cards has collapsed spectacularly and now the taxpayer must foot the bill.  The Government is forcing every taxpayer to take out bad loans to the tune of &euro;90 billion, which is a disgrace.  Fianna F&aacute;il has presided over this mess.  It has no plan to get the 388,600 people now unemployed, including construction workers, back to work.</P>
        <P>We cannot again build an economy based on property sales.  Fine Gael is the party which will never allow land speculators and developers&rsquo; greed to dominate and destroy this country.  Fine Gael is the only party to have a job creation plan which will get 100,000 back to work.  Our party will invest in renewable energy.  We will install electricity smart meters in every home.  We will establish the country as a leader in ocean energy.  We will invest in the bio-energy industry which is currently under-utilised.</P>
        <P>Green energy is the future for this country but is the Green Party?  By investing in it now, we have the opportunity to take people off dole queues and provide them with sustainable employment.  As part of our climate change strategy, we cannot indefinitely continue to important fossil fuels into Ireland.  It is time for change in this country and Fine Gael&rsquo;s new document, Rebuilding Ireland, which is forward looking, sets out how a new green energy revolution, which is badly needed, will help get this country moving again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing more important than the retention and expansion of jobs.  Sadly, with today&rsquo;s unemployment figures, we see the Government is failing in this regard.  These numbers have doubled in the past 12 months.  This is an unprecedented increase in our history.  However, behind every figure is a person and a family.  As public representatives, we must never become indifferent to their difficulties.  This Private Members&rsquo; motion would directly benefit 100,000 people by producing 100,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il, which has been in Government for 20 out of the past 22 years, has lost its once famous touch with the electorate.  This will be verified in a few weeks&rsquo; time after 5 June when the local, European and by-elections are held.  The old rules established years ago no longer apply.</P>
        <P>In the past I have advocated reducing the corporation tax level.  We are allowing other countries which have studied our success to replicate it.  They are bettering our rates and some are even charging a rate of 0% for poorer located regions.  It is in the interests of the State that we get jobs even if we do not get corporation tax.  The jobs will benefit the people who are unemployed.  We will lose corporation tax but at least we will have people earning and not costing the State money by being on the dole.</P>
        <P>We need to think strategically and to cleverly drive the burgeoning smart economy.  Encouraging the smart economy will cost money.  Those involved in research should be considered for tax breaks.  Those in RTE, ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and others in the State sector are not paying the pension levy.  Some hundreds of millions of euro are being pumped into research each year, most of which comes from non-governmental organisations.  Exceptional staff in Irish agencies and Irish universities must be retained in all circumstances.  The HEA brief that only one salary can apply no matter how good and qualified a person and no matter what his or her background is another one of those old rules established in a different time.  We cannot afford to allow <Col N="425"/>other universities to come in and head hunt the exceptional people in our universities for the sake of offering additional funds.  It would be the worst possible scenario.</P>
        <P>Broadband has been well covered by other speakers but I wish to touch on two other matters.  The ESB and Bord G&aacute;is have been overcharging with the consent of the Commissioner for Energy Regulating so that we can encourage competition.  Now the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is have a war chest of tens of millions of euro.  This has an impact on other companies trying to compete with them.  The Taoiseach eventually intervened when the Green Party Minister was not prepared to do anything about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many Members started their political life in local authorities.  There is a crazy scenario where, on the direction of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, local authorities must apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for a discharge licence when the local authorities know they need a discharge licence and additional funding.  One agency is telling another what it needs to do.  The cost for Wexford County Council alone is &euro;1 million.  We should stop spending money on reports and start building wastewater treatment plants so that in a couple of years&rsquo; time, we will not have to pay fines under the wastewater directive.</P>
        <P>I looked up the number of young people unemployed in my home town of Gorey.  There are 900 young people between the ages of 18 and 22 unemployed.  We need Youthreach, F&Aacute;S programmes and other programmes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, to the House.  This country has an opportunity to transform its economic and environmental models.  I congratulate Deputy Coveney on proposing this motion and working on this stimulus plan.  Deputies on this side of the House are confident that the positive economic and environmental transformation we have proposed will happen in the not too distant future.  We have to get ourselves out of the current impasse.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I would like to ask the Minister of State a few questions.  An EU stimulus package worth &euro;400 billion, or 3.3% of the Union&rsquo;s GDP, was announced in January.  What is the current position in that regard?  Has any of that money come to Ireland, particularly the regions?  People in my constituency are asking what has happened to the &euro;400 billion, which is a great deal of money.  Other countries are using their imaginations to develop creative stimulus packages.  The Government of Finland has put together a &euro;2 billion stimulus package to incentivise Finnish householders to spend money on renovating and refurbishing their homes.  The Finnish Government has provided for creative VAT reductions to encourage people to spend money on kitchens, tiles, plants and eco-friendly products.  It is an absolute shame that no Green Party Deputy is present in the Chamber to defend the role it is playing in government.</P>
        <P>In last October&rsquo;s budget and again in the recent mini-budget, the Government chose to ignore the opportunity being taken by countries like Finland and Sweden to reduce in a creative manner the rate of VAT that applies to plants and eco-friendly products.  It is a disgrace that Government Members dare to talk about the green energy sector at a time when such basic opportunities are being missed.  Ireland should be introducing energy technology incentives.  Grant aid has been provided for solar energy.  Ireland is in a peripheral location on the Atlantic Ocean.  We should consider the development of grant incentives in respect of tidal, or wave, technology.  The Minister has missed that opportunity.</P>
        <P>We are not tapping into the market of 1.6 million people that exists in Northern Ireland.  We are falling into the trap of saying that it is a question of swings and roundabouts.  It has been suggested that it does not matter when a petrol station closes in Lifford or Enniskillen, as another petrol station will open in Strabane or Ballyshannon.  Such circumstances, which may <Col N="426"/>be described as swings and roundabouts, may have existed 20 or 30 years ago.  That is no longer the case, however.  People travel up the M1 from Deputy Doyle&rsquo;s constituency of Wicklow and Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s constituency of Dublin South because there is no incentive for them to spend money in this jurisdiction.  We need to take the opportunity to be creative with our VAT regime.  In 2006, household products in the Republic of Ireland were 11% more expensive than in Northern Ireland.  In 2009, the differential is 51%.  That is why so many consumers are choosing to spend their money in the North.  They would be contributing to our economy and our Exchequer if they were spending their money in this jurisdiction, but that is not happening.  It is time we rectified that situation.</P>
        <P>We could approach the impasse in which we find ourselves in a defeatist manner by saying &ldquo;we will be out of it in three or four years time&rdquo;.  I suggest that we would be better advised to introduce certain mechanisms and schemes in the short term.  Like other Deputies on this side, including Deputy Bruton, I made recommendations to the Minister for Finance before the recent budget.  I would like to know why the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, claims to take our suggestions on board but then fails to implement them.  When we made creative proposals in respect of a bundle of products at the higher end of the VAT scale &mdash; we wanted to incentivise people to buy such products by moving their VAT rating from the high end to the lower end &mdash; he said he would look into the matter.  He was like a county council engineer looking into a pothole.  That was the last we heard of it.  The Minister looked into it, but he did nothing about it and the opportunity was missed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the chance to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I compliment Deputy Coveney on introducing it.  I sincerely believe that over the next four or five years, the manner in which the world prioritises the development of a model of producing energy, infrastructure and food will become a prime economic driver in itself.  It will become a whole new economy.  Although one might wonder when one hears Government Deputies speaking on it, this motion sets out to identify and recognise shortages in this country&rsquo;s infrastructure.  It was introduced by this party&rsquo;s spokesperson on communications, energy and natural resources, rather than by our spokespeople on food or agriculture.  It was discussed by the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, which considers that food is a whole new area.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has accused us of trying to create a massive quango.  The Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, has argued that we are not making it big enough.  They might be better advised to concentrate on what this motion is trying to do.</P>
        <P>This motion identifies the infrastructural deficit that exists and proposes the establishment of a company.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, missed the key point about the establishment of this company when he referred to the six sub-companies that will be commercially run.  They will not be run in the way State companies were run in the past.  When I watched the Minister on my monitor, it was clear that he did not understand that key point.  Instead, he chose to ridicule the main company by referring to it as a &ldquo;super quango&rdquo;.  The motion also sets out how the development of infrastructure will be funded.  We are proposing to take money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and to get private investment through a public bond.  The aim of this proposal is to get the mattress money back into the system.</P>
        <P>It is recognised and acknowledged that people have lost confidence in places where money can be invested.  Many people have cut their losses, taken the money out and put it somewhere safe.  Their money is no longer invested in a stock, a bond or a bank.  We are proposing the establishment of an alternative location for such funds.  Such investment has the potential to create 100,000 jobs.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the proposal relates primarily to <Col N="427"/>infrastructure.  One of the benefits of the proposal will be the creation of up to 100,000 jobs.  It is not as if we are aiming to create 100,000 jobs &mdash; while that is a key part of our proposal, it is not our primary motivation.  Infrastructure needs to be developed if we are to have a vibrant economy once more.</P>
        <P>I was heartened to see four Green Party Deputies come to the House to speak on this motion.  Members on this side have been continually asked to make creative and constructive proposals.  Fine Gael has endeavoured to do that.  Over the next couple of weeks, I look forward to hearing Government Deputies try to take the proposals outlined in Fine Gael&rsquo;s new health Bill asunder, just as they have attempted to take this measure asunder.  When we tried to rationalise the number of Ministers of State, people like Deputy Thomas Byrne ridiculed our proposal and called us &ldquo;fools&rdquo;.  We were told it was a token gesture, but the proposal had been taken on board, generally if not entirely, within two weeks.  I anticipate that much of what is in this proposal will be adopted as Government policy within a couple of weeks.  The Government will hope that people will have forgotten that Fine Gael proposed it in the first instance.  If that is the way it has to happen, so be it.</P>
        <P>The last part of this motion calls on the Government to open &ldquo;a real and constructive dialogue with the opposition on how best to proceed with developing the Irish economy via investment in much needed new infrastructure&rdquo;.  Contrary to the Government amendment, we do not want &ldquo;to continue to invest as planned in those infrastructure priorities that will ensure economic recovery&rdquo;.  While broadband, which is the focus of the Government amendment, is essential, the infrastructure deficit in many other areas will have to be addressed if our economy is to be reconstructed and move forward.  That will be the priority for the global economy.  The saddest part of it is that Ireland probably has the best potential on the planet for exploiting those possibilities to the benefit of everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all sides of the House for their active participation in a debate on issues about which we all care greatly &mdash; the future prosperity and well-being of this country and how Government policy and investment can help secure that.  That said, I must express some perplexity at some of the comments from Opposition benches about the wealth of the boom having been squandered and the Government not caring about public infrastructure like schools, public transport and so forth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last night, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance gave us an extensive resum&eacute; of what has been achieved with the proceeds of the years of prosperity.  We can see a public infrastructure transformed, with greatly improved roads, enhanced public transport networks, massive investment in social housing and other social infrastructure, very significant investment in environmental services and enhancement of our educational infrastructure as well as a comprehensive programme of investment in enterprise support and science and innovation.  Much of our public infrastructure now bears comparison with the best in Europe.  The Government is not saying that we do not have ground to make up.  That is why in our recent supplementary budget we provided over &euro;31 billion in Exchequer capital expenditure for the next five years, an annual average of over 4%, one of the biggest in the EU 15.</P>
        <P>The Government does not deny that we face very difficult choices in the next several years, choices that any Government of this country would have to confront.  Expenditure plans, however ambitious and laudable, are never enough in themselves and must be firmly placed in a sustainable, multi-annual economic and budgetary framework.  It was this consideration that I most missed in the contributions from those on the opposite benches.  Not only have they attempted to deny the real progress and achievements of the past decade or so, they also fail <Col N="428"/>to recognise the active and decisive steps the Government has taken to address the grave economic and financial challenges Ireland faces.</P>
        <P>This Government has responded quickly to the rapidly changing economic conditions over the past year and we have taken a series of measures to reduce public expenditure and raise revenue this year, with further adjustments in the coming years.  A progressive series of measures, starting last July, continued in the October budget, augmented primarily by the pension-related levy in February and further strengthened in the recent supplementary budget, have helped stabilise the public finances.  This is absolutely essential if we are to turn the economy around.  Sustainable public finances will help restore international confidence abroad in Ireland and will enhance international and domestic investment in the Irish economy, which in turn will lead to better times for all our citizens in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>The Government has also taken significant steps to restore the banking and financial system to full health.  The Minister for Finance has announced the Government&rsquo;s plan to establish a national asset management agency to strengthen the banks&rsquo; balance sheets, reduce uncertainty over bad debts, ensure the flow of credit on a commercial basis to the real economy, to protect and grow employment, while also maximising and protecting the interest of taxpayers.  This is essential if we are to get the economy moving again in the right direction.</P>
        <P>This Government has always been committed to, and will maintain, a business-friendly tax framework which will encourage enterprise development and job-creation.  In budget 2009 and the subsequent Finance Act, the Minister for Finance introduced a considerable enhancement to our research and development tax credit regime, which will help to position Ireland at the forefront of innovation-based enterprise and employment.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies on the benches opposite complained about lack of investment in infrastructure.  The National Development Plan 2007-13 sets out a comprehensive framework for delivering public infrastructure.  Much has already been achieved and, despite severe budgetary constraints, significant investment will continue until the end of the plan in 2013.</P>
        <P>Over the next five years, this Government will spend some &euro;31.4 billion on public infrastructure.  This amounts to over 4% on average of estimated GNP.  In 2009 some 5% of GNP will come from the Exchequer to be spent on public infrastructure.  This investment programme will make a substantial contribution to turning the economy around and help sustain activity and employment in the construction sector.</P>
        <P>Government investment in infrastructure is most clearly evident in transport.  The Government is also committed, however, to helping enterprise through the current difficulties.  The recently introduced stabilisation fund will provide targeted support to indigenous companies to assist them in the present exceptionally difficult business environment.  The stabilisation fund will have a total budget of &euro;100 million over two years.  Enterprise Ireland and the IDA will also continue their regular supports for indigenous companies and foreign direct investment, respectively, in 2009 with total capital funding available to support industry in 2009 of over &euro;170 million.</P>
        <P>The decision by Government to allocate significant levels of funding to science, technology and innovation sends out a signal to the research and development community that Ireland is committed to the research and development-led smart economy path.  The work of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, puts Ireland at the forefront of research and development regimes globally and will complement the favourable research and development tax regime.</P><Col N="429"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is well aware of the challenges facing the country and has shown its resolve to turn the economy around by taking hard and unpopular decisions to deal with the problem.  The road ahead will be difficult.  We will put the enduring long-term national interest above short-term political popularity when taking the necessary difficult decisions.  We are charting a way out of the current difficulties.  It will not be easy but a start has been made.  I commend the Government&rsquo;s detailed and specific record of achievement in this area and solid proposals for continued action as set out in its amendment to the motion before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Simon Coveney.  I congratulate him on the constructive motion he brought before the House, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, concerning a substantial infrastructure stimulus package.  I regret that the Government at a time of economic crisis seems to think that it is a case of business as usual as Ministers come into the House to deliver set scripts rejecting practical and constructive proposals from the Opposition and continue the Government&rsquo;s ill-conceived policies.</P>
        <P>The self-congratulatory counter-motion tabled by the Government is particularly nauseating.  It lacks any shred of credibility.  Astonishingly, it asks the D&aacute;il to commend &ldquo;the Government&rsquo;s actions over the past ten months to stabilise our public finances&rdquo; and goes on to commend &ldquo;the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining a pro-enterprise and competitive taxation system&rdquo;.  This Government comprising Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and its Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats predecessors is directly responsible for what the Taoiseach and Ministers now frequently refer to as &ldquo;our structural deficit&rdquo;.  Having created the deficit it is extraordinary that it has the brass neck to come into the House and congratulate itself on its failure to rein it in.  Instead of individual groups demonstrating outside the House about the impact of ill-considered Government decisions on them there should be tens of thousands of people gathering in the city demanding that the Government leave office and calling for a general election.  The Government which created the mess has demonstrated that it has absolutely no capacity to get us out of the mess.  This is a Government that deserves no better than to be driven from office.</P>
        <P>The inconvenient truth is that the State&rsquo;s so-called structural deficit is a result of the profligate public expenditure that Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, authorised and for which he is uniquely responsible.  He has created an unprecedented financial burden which not only impacts on every adult residing in the State but will affect the lives of their children and grandchildren.  The structural deficit is a black hole in our public finances for which this Government and its predecessor are responsible.  We have entered into it without the type of intergalactic travel that excites the imagination of Green Party members.  It is firmly rooted on this island.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s ESRI report confirms that the Government has got all its financial projections and assumptions wrong.  Three weeks after the most recent budget not one figure detailed there can be relied on.  Today&rsquo;s scandalous figures on jobs, 388,000 unemployed which will likely reach at least 500,000, tragically confirm the Government&rsquo;s utter failure to either protect jobs or create new ones.  Instead of maintaining a taxation system that contributes to competitiveness the Government is by taxation increases impeding the capacity of businesses to remain viable and creating obstacles to salary readjustments within businesses which allow jobs to be retained.  No country has ever successfully taxed its way out of a recession.  This country cannot do so.</P>
        <P>This Government is taxing everyone who lives on this island into a deep and prolonged economic depression.  We need a credible strategy to create and protect jobs.  That is what Fine Gael is proposing, but the Government is failing to take it up.</P>
        <P>The House has heard lectures on budgetary issues from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Leader of the Green Party, Deputy Gormley, as Minister for the Environment, <Col N="430"/>Heritage and Local Government.  This evening we heard from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a unique way, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has sleep-walked his way through office in the past two years.  He is essentially an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> member of the Government who, despite being in Cabinet, disclaims all responsibility for the catastrophic budgets of December 2007, July and October 2008, and the most recent one on 7 April.  He has been, of course, quick to claim credit for the economically astounding initiative taken by him on environmentally friendly lightbulbs.  Clearly, his fixation with lightbulbs has dimmed his capacity to constructively contribute to Government deliberations on budgetary matters.  Lectures on budgetary matters from members of the Cabinet deserve no more credibility than a lecture from a drunk on sobriety.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a time of economic crisis, we have in office a floundering, disintegrating Government of increasing and unprecedented incompetence.  In my view, and in the view of thousands of people outside this House, it is time for the Government to go.  On 5 June, we should not be simply having local and European Parliament elections, as well as two by-elections, we should also have a general election.  The longer the current Government remains in office, the greater the damage that will be done to this country.  It is time for our people to have their say.  It should not require a march of the legions of tens of thousands of unemployed on this House to force this Government out of office.  It is time for those who are responsible for where we are now to be held to account for the greatest financial and economic disaster that has ever occurred in the State.</P>
        <P>For the good of the country, it is time for the Government to resign and let the people have their say.  Many people outside this House sum up their views of this Government in one simple sentence, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, and for the sake of this country, resign&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate on this motion, and in particular the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, who showed support for the majority of the principles of what we are proposing.  I want to put on the record again what the big idea is here because Government spokespersons seems to have missed it.  The Fine Gael motion is trying to bring forward a constructive draft policy document &mdash; a Green paper, although it is more detailed than that &mdash; to finance an &euro;18 billion stimulus package over the next four years, without the Government having to borrow a cent.  I will be exact for the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, in stating that the package would create 98,880 jobs.  That is the exact figure predicted from an independent analysis of our figures in terms of what job creation can be produced from our proposal.  </P>
        <P>We are proposing to rebuild infrastructure, as well as building new infrastructure, to prepare people for the new economy.  Our economy can no longer survive on selling and building houses for each other.  That is in the past.  We can no longer expect six out of every ten young men going into the workforce to work on building sites, because that is also in the past.  We need to find new ways of employing these people so they can pay for their mortgages and other debts, as well as feeding their families and being confident in Ireland&rsquo;s future.  My generation has grown up in a period where confidence drove investment, spending and economic growth, but that has disappeared in the space of eight months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our proposal is trying to bring back direction to where the economy is going, where we will channel investment and how we will raise that money.  The Government is broke and will probably have to borrow &euro;21 billion to pay the bills this year, not to mention an extra stimulus package on top of that.  What response have we had from the Government to our constructive <Col N="431"/>document?  It may not be perfect and needs to be tested, but it already has been tested in a serious way within our party.  The response we get is one of disdain and arrogance.  We hear set scripts, written in the Department of Finance and elsewhere, from Ministers who are supposedly too busy to read our policy document.  Government spokespersons dismiss the NewERA concept as a new super quango.  A quango is financed by Government, by taxpayers&rsquo; money, but we are talking about financing a new State holding company.  It will finance itself by getting a commercial return, thus changing the way in which State-owned companies operate.  It would introduce accountability and targets for such companies in order that they can deliver on behalf of the State.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, regularly states that the ESB is doing all we need in terms of energy policy.  It is an important company which is doing many good things and it has many good people working for it, but the ESB should not be deciding energy policy; the Government should be doing that.  It should be implementing it on behalf of the shareholder, which is the State, but that is not happening.  Irish energy prices are too high, whether for gas or electricity.  Even though next week gas prices will reduce by 12% and electricity prices by 10% or 11%, that is not enough.  In the open market where gas is currently being provided to the industrial sector, there are savings of 30% or 40% on what companies were spending last year.  However, the poor old consumers and small businesses which rely on the regulator to provide a competitive price, are getting shafted again at a time when they need relief.  Meanwhile, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, claims we do not need any change or new Government thinking on the approach to sectors such as energy, broadband and water.  I reject that argument.</P>
        <P>I agree with him on one level, however, in that the green economy will be the basis of Ireland&rsquo;s new economic growth in two, three or perhaps five years&rsquo; time.  It is arrogant for him to reject a costed and well thought out alternative proposal on how we will get there.  For him to dismiss our proposal and continue on as he has been doing for the past two years under his reign in the energy sector, displays the kind of arrogance he has learned from Fianna F&aacute;il.  I reject that too.</P>
        <P>This proposal is about reform because Ireland needs to reshape and recreate itself.  Fine Gael has also proposed reforms for health care and third level education.  Deputy Richard Bruton has been trying to propose reform of the public sector for four years.  I am trying to propose reform of how State companies are managed, including the targets set for them and the performance indicators by which they operate.  By doing that, State companies can deliver what the State is not capable of delivering at present through borrowing.  The ESB is able to raise significant sums of money for required investments.  In the same way, if we were to restructure the way in which State companies operate we could raise very large sums of money from private sector investment and pension funds to develop a far more competitive economy.  In rebuilding that new Ireland we could employ tens of thousands of people.  That is what this constructive motion is about.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his Government need to listen because their approach is wrong and they are driving the country into the ground.  Realistic predictions indicate that there will be 600,000 people in dole queues.  As we head in that direction, the Government refuses to listen or show humility and accept it was wrong.  We are not only experiencing an international recession.  Irish unemployment figures are very much out of kilter with those of other countries in recession because policy has been wrong.  We need to rebuild and start again, as the motion sets out to do.</P>
        <P>I expected the Government to respond to the motion by at least reading and assessing it.  It should have accepted the good points while rejecting elements with which it cannot live, yet it <Col N="432"/>has not even done this.  That type of arrogance has resulted in a complete loss of faith in the leadership the Government is providing.  We need change &mdash; new ideas and new people &mdash; and if it does not come about soon, the population will demand it.  The country cannot continue to move so quickly in the current direction.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this very important issue for my constituency.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to move quickly to ensure that jobs lost due to the closure of the Amann plant are replaced quickly and every opportunity for retraining and up-skilling is afforded to those affected so they may re-enter the workforce as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The closure of the German-owned Amann Industries in Tralee, the second largest manufacturing plant in north Kerry, which was announced last Friday, is a major blow to the region.  An attempt to restructure to maintain jobs has proved unsuccessful and now a total of 340 jobs and millions of euro in revenue will be lost to the area.  I call on the Minister to instruct the IDA to make Tralee its number one priority.  I am making this case to the Department and I will be taking it up directly with the IDA.  My first thoughts go to the employees and their families.  I hope the company will put a generous redundancy package in place to see them through this difficult time.  It is the least they deserve after all their loyal service and the hard work they have done for Amann over the years.</P>
        <P>I have already spoken to the Minister of State on this issue and I am repeating my call for more support for Tralee town.  I do not believe enough is being done to promote Tralee as an investment location and the IDA needs to take more responsibility for bringing jobs to Tralee.  We need to be positive about all Tralee has to offer if we are to attract foreign investment.  We need to be part of the marketing and PR effort to promote Tralee and help bring more jobs to the north Kerry and west Limerick areas.</P>
        <P>The increase in the numbers on the live register across the north Kerry area is unwelcome and is an indication of the challenges that now face us, particularly with regard to manufacturing.  These challenges must be faced and job losses must be minimised as far as possible.  Our <Col N="434"/>priority must be to create an environment that will allow those who have lost their jobs to return quickly to the workplace.  Every opportunity for retraining and upskilling must be afforded to those affected so they may re-enter the workforce as soon as possible.  Indeed, retraining and education should be offered immediately, even before the employees complete their employment with Amann.</P>
        <P>We need to see results from the IDA&rsquo;s concentration on the linked hub locations of Killarney in south Kerry and Tralee in north Kerry.  I recognise the need to mobilise initiatives and resources on a regional rather than a purely local basis.  However, taking all these factors into account, it must be made clear that we are taking action to deal with the economic and employment challenges facing the people of Tralee and the north Kerry and west Limerick areas.</P>
        <P>Before I conclude I will take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, on his recent appointment.</P>

	<P>Amann Industries Corporation announced a two-stage plan to close its production plant in Tralee at a general meeting of all employees last Friday.  The plant, which has been in production since 1998, manufactures high-quality technical sewing threads with a range of industrial applications.  A restructuring programme aimed at reducing manufacturing costs was already announced earlier this year with the loss of 120 jobs, and Friday&rsquo;s announcement was of the loss of the remaining 210 jobs.  The company issued a press release which stated: &ldquo;The need to remain competitive in a very difficult, cost sensitive market, combined with high labour, energy and other manufacturing costs have led to this regrettable decision.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy McEllistrim that not enough has been done to bring industry to Tralee.  Nothing of any note has been done either by the IDA or by the Government.  Over the past ten years Tralee, the county capital, has lost many of its manufacturing industries, including Denny, Ridgeview, Kerry Fashions, Klopman, Maycon Mouldings, Glen Dimplex, Kleinhuis, Wilson socks and now Amann.  Its industrial base has been decimated.</P>
        <P>Since 1998 no new IDA-supported company has been established in Tralee or Kerry, but 30 new IDA-assisted international companies were established in Cork between 2002 and 2007.  The IDA arranged 145 site visits in Cork for potential foreign direct investment between 2002 and 2007, whereas over the same period only 13 visits were organised for Kerry and, apparently, these were not of a serious nature.</P>
        <P>One of the most exciting developments in the county was the opening of Kerry Technology Park in 2001.  This resulted from the shared vision of Shannon Development &mdash; not the IDA &mdash; and the Institute of Technology in Tralee.  Kerry Technology Park is now home to 17 companies which employ more than 300 people in well paid jobs.  In 2007 these companies generated annual sales of more than &euro;60 million.  In 2007 the Government, in its wisdom, stripped Shannon Development, the prime driver of job creation in Tralee, of its industrial brief and transferred it to Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has no office in Tralee and no permanent presence there.</P>
        <P>The live register figure for Tralee in March was 6,181, a 69.4% increase on the March 2008 figure.  Tralee is a national black spot when it comes to job losses and employment creation.  It has been ignored by both the IDA and the Government over the past ten years; it is simply not on the map.</P>
        <P>The loss of 230 jobs at Amann is as big a blow to Tralee as the loss of more than 1,900 jobs at Dell in Limerick.  The Government task force established in the aftermath of these job losses <Col N="435"/>at Dell should be extended to include Tralee.  I also ask that F&Aacute;S now put in place retraining programmes for those unfortunate workers who will now not be able to pay their mortgages, in some cases, and will find it difficult to get alternative employment.  These measures should be put in place now.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment.  He was responsible for setting up a chamber of commerce in Listowel and I thank him for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies McEllistrim and Deenihan, and all Deputies and Senators, for their good wishes.  I also thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>On Friday 24 April, Amann announced that its plant in Tralee was to close with the loss of 215 jobs.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Department are keenly aware of the impact on the employees of Amann and their families.  In many cases, such company announcements are a result of global conditions or decisions over which we have little influence.  The closure announcement follows the announcement in January of the loss of 120 jobs in the dyeing operations due to their transfer to a new production plant in Romania.  These job losses are under way, with 50 jobs lost and the remainder to go by September this year.  The remaining labour-intensive spinning and twisting operations are to cease in June and will transfer to the company&rsquo;s facility in China over the period September 2009 to September 2010.</P>
        <P>I am advised this decision is part of an overall restructuring and consolidation of the Amann operations to reduce manufacturing costs in light of the significant decline in its business due to the weakening global economy and the dramatic downturn in the automotive industry.  The textile industry is extremely competitive and cost-sensitive, and the decline in sales is having a significant impact on its business, which relies on high volume and economies of scale to ensure its viability.  Amann will no longer spin in-house and will replace this with material sourced from suppliers at low cost.  The labour-intensive, low-value-added operations of twisting and spinning can no longer be sustained in Tralee and significant cost savings are envisaged in the transfer of these operations to its facilities in lower-cost countries.</P>
        <P>The IDA has worked closely with the company to assess opportunities to sustain the plant, which was highly regarded as a productive and efficient plant within the group, and its representatives have met both local and German management.  However, given the cost pressures and weak demand, the company felt it had no option but to restructure its operations to sustain the Amann group.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The role of F&Aacute;S, the industrial training agency, is particularly important in assisting those who lose their jobs.  Following the internal company consultation process, which has just commenced, representatives of F&Aacute;S have met with Amann management and staff representatives and have formulated a plan of action to deliver the full range of F&Aacute;S services to all staff being made redundant in 2009 and 2010.  These services will include on-site presentations to all staff; advice on setting up a resource centre in-house to facilitate staff in career guidance and job search activities; and the provision of a range of pre-redundancy and, where necessary, post-redundancy training courses to assist all staff in skills updating, which will enable them to compete in the labour market.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The State development agencies, including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the Kerry County Enterprise Board, will continue to work to support existing jobs and secure new jobs in the Tralee area, liaising where appropriate with the local institute of technology.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to join my colleagues on the other side of the House in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, on his appointment.  I am sure it was great news for his family, close supporters and constituents.</P>
        <P>My colleagues and I find ourselves in something of a predicament tonight in terms of the channelling of information.  Last Monday, as far as the women of Donegal, Leitrim and Clare were concerned, BreastCheck was finally to be rolled out in these regions, nine years after it was rolled out on the east coast and 13 years after the national cancer strategy was introduced by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, in 1996.  After all the campaigning by various groups such as Donegal Action for Cancer Care and Co-operating for Cancer Care North West, and the several occasions on which hopes have been dashed, 2009 was eventually given as the date of roll-out.  However, as of Tuesday morning, rumours were rife throughout the regions in question that because of the recruitment freeze, the roll-out would not go ahead.</P>
        <P>We should consider this issue not as politicians, but from the perspective of the women concerned.  They put up with the fact that they were being treated in an inequitable, unfair and discriminatory way for a period of nine years in the expectation that BreastCheck would be rolled out to their areas this year.  By Tuesday, however, the entire project was up in the air.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach that day and by the evening, it seemed there was reason to be hopeful.  As of today, it seems the train is back on the track and that the BreastCheck roll-out will proceed.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the women concerned, what assurances can the Minister of State offer in regard to the delivery of this programme?  On too many occasions, expectations and hopes have been raised only to be disappointed.  To withdraw the roll-out of the scheme would be an injustice to the women of these regions.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that it will proceed and that the health information Bill from the Department of Health and Children will be introduced as a matter of priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, on his appointment.  I wish him well.  I had the pleasure of serving with his father for many years.  I am sure he is very proud that his son has now attained the same high office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday&rsquo;s revelation by the Health Service Executive that the embargo on recruitment to the public service could prevent the planned roll-out of BreastCheck to counties Donegal, Leitrim and Clare within the often promised timeframe of 2009 came as a shocking bolt out of the blue not only to the thousands of women who are left without the benefit of this crucial health facility, but to the entire population of the region.  We all have mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts and nieces who may be vulnerable to breast cancer.  Fortunately, its incidence can be greatly reduced by the availability of a screening service.</P>
        <P>It is now nine years since BreastCheck was made available in certain parts of the State and it beggars belief that Donegal, Leitrim and Clare remain out of the loop.  It is unacceptable that geographic location seems to determine the availability of such a critical health screening service.  While we all understand the crisis in the public finances and the need to curtail recruitment to the public service, delivery of critical health services should and must be exempt.  A blanket ban on recruitment is too blunt an instrument, particularly when it impinges negatively on the delivery of BreastCheck and other critical cancer services.  This was acknowledged when <Col N="437"/>arrangements for a derogation in certain critical areas were announced.  What areas are more critical than cancer diagnosis and treatment?</P>
        <P>To facilitate the roll-out of BreastCheck to the north west, I understand interviews have already been successfully concluded and that the radiography personnel are virtually on stand-by to operate the service.  What is necessary now is to allow an exemption under the derogation clause so that the Health Service Executive can proceed without further delay in providing this long awaited cancer service to Donegal and the north west.  Like my colleague, Deputy Joe McHugh, I am anxious to hear what the Minister of State has to say.  There are rumours circulating in Donegal all afternoon, as I am sure there are in Clare, which have emanated from Government Deputies, to the effect that there is no cause for concern &mdash; nudge, nudge and wink, wink &mdash; and that everything will be all right on the day.  This is not acceptable to the women of Donegal, Leitrim and Clare.</P>
        <P>There must be a clear indication from the Minister of State of what is intended to be done.  We will not tolerate a nudge, nudge and wink, wink approach.  I understand a letter is circulating on the Government benches to some Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad reassuring them that the programme will go ahead as planned.  The Minister of State must explain the situation in no uncertain terms in this House.  Every woman in Donegal, Leitrim and Clare will listen to this debate when it is broadcast on the radio tomorrow morning.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s response must be in black and white, no more and no less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, on his appointment.  However, I am disappointed that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, is not in the Chamber to respond to our concerns.  The BreastCheck programme was launched nationally in 2000.  In 2002, an announcement was made that the women of County Clare would benefit imminently from the screening service.  Seven years later, no progress has been made in delivering the service to the women of the county.</P>
        <P>The latest obstacle in the way of the roll-out is the recruitment embargo in the public service.  It is astonishing that we should have to debate this issue today.  It is astonishing that the Minister for Health and Children did not move immediately to clarify the situation.  On 27 March, I tabled a parliamentary question regarding the appointment of a respiratory physician for cystic fibrosis sufferers in the mid-west.  The Minister responded that the moratorium on public service recruitment does not apply to consultants and therapists.  Why is this not the case in respect of the radiography services required for the roll-out of BreastCheck?</P>
        <P>In 2007, some 66,500 women availed of the BreastCheck service where it was available.  As a result, 396 women were diagnosed with breast cancer, representing a small percentage of the numbers screened.  However, for those women, none of whom showed any obvious signs of cancer and who presented merely because they had been invited to do so, the service was a life saver.  How can the Minister for Health and Children stand over any further delay in the delivery of BreastCheck to women in every county, including Donegal, Leitrim and Clare?</P>
        <P>It was confirmed to me in the reply to a parliamentary question that &euro;1.35 million was spent in 2007 by the national screening service on advertising, promotion, recruitment and consultancy.  However, the allocation for front line services is being reduced.  There have been enough false dawns in regard to the rolling out of BreastCheck in County Clare.  It is high time the women of Clare were offered this service.  The Minister must get on with her job and deliver this programme in the interests of patient safety.  I ask the Minister of State for a guarantee that it will be delivered without further delay.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="438"/>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  On her behalf and my own, I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter, to address the Deputies&rsquo; concerns and to clarify the situation with regard to the national roll-out of BreastCheck.</P>
        <P>The National Breast Screening Board was established in 1998 as a specialist agency with the sole remit of providing Ireland&rsquo;s first quality assured population based breast screening programme, BreastCheck, for women aged 50 to 64.  Governance of BreastCheck was transferred to the board of the National Cancer Screening Service on its establishment in January 2007.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck provides free mammograms to women aged 50 to 64, sequentially on an area by area basis every two years.  BreastCheck began offering free breast screening to women aged 50 to 64 in the then Eastern Regional Health Authority and North Eastern and Midland Health Boards areas in February 2000, nine years ago.  Screening was extended to Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow between 2004 and 2006.</P>
        <P>In December 2007, construction of two new static units, the BreastCheck western unit in Galway and the BreastCheck southern unit in Cork, was completed and screening began from both units in counties Cork and Galway in December 2007.  These two static units, together with eight mobile digital units, will provide screening to more than 144,000 eligible women aged 50 to 64 in the south and west of the country.</P>
        <P>Since December 2007, the BreastCheck service has been extended to nine of the 12 counties in the south and west, these being Mayo, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary and Waterford.  The completion of the national roll-out with the extension of BreastCheck to the remaining counties will proceed in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Government decided to introduce a moratorium on recruitment across the public service, with effect from 27 March 2009 to end in 2010.  However, certain posts in the health sector may be filled, including medical consultants.  The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas for which significant funding has already been provided.</P>
        <P>Contrary to what has been said regarding an announcement that BreastCheck will not be rolled out in Donegal, there has been no such announcement.  In fact, I am very pleased to confirm that BreastCheck will be extended as planned to Donegal, Leitrim and Clare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Indicative dates for the roll-out are June for County Clare, September for County Donegal and October for County Leitrim.  At the same time, it is vital to stress that any woman, irrespective of her age or area of residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms, should not wait for an invitation to screening from BreastCheck but should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>
        <P>Within the past three weeks, the National Cancer Screening Service applied for a series of derogations to allow the recruitment of radiographers to extend the BreastCheck service to Donegal, Leitrim and Clare.  This is in accordance with procedures put in place under the recruitment moratorium.  The screening service was permitted to proceed with interviews for radiographers last week while the application to recruit these posts was under consideration.  I am very pleased to confirm that recruitment of radiographers in these counties can now proceed immediately.</P><Col N="439"/>
        <P>In the wider context, the scope for redeployment of staff from the HSE to the NCSS and within the NCSS itself will continue to be explored with the HSE.  In the first instance, however, we will proceed with the recruitment of radiographers as originally planned.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge the excellent results of BreastCheck to date.  In 2008, BreastCheck screened more than 90,000 women around the country.  Indeed, from the commencement of screening in 2000 until 31 March 2009, BreastCheck has provided almost half a million screening appointments to 236,000 women and 3,075 cancers were detected.  The 2009 allocation to the National Cancer Screening Service is over &euro;67 million, of which approximately &euro;25 million is allocated for BreastCheck.  Screening is an integral element of the national cancer strategy and BreastCheck has a key role in reducing the incidence of and mortality from breast cancer in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Separately, funding for cancer services this year also includes an additional &euro;15 million provided to the national cancer control programme on budget day, which is in addition to development funding of almost &euro;22 million allocated in 2007 and 2008.  This additional funding during these difficult times is evidence that the cancer control programme and the continued roll-out of BreastCheck are priorities for the Government and I am very pleased that the roll-out of BreastCheck can now proceed on schedule in Donegal, Leitrim and Clare.</P>

      <sTitle>Animal Health Investigations.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1990, Mr. Dan Brennan from a Castlecomer farm in north Kilkenny noticed problems with animals and the environment of his farm in what veterinary experts refer to as lack of thrive, stunted growth and low milk yields.  Even the trees and hedgerows were dying on part of the farm.  In 1991, Mr. Brennan was unable to sell his animals on account of their lack of growth and despite the absence of sickness among them and the feeding of supplements such as cobalt, zinc and copper, the situation did not improve during the mid-1990s.  By 1995, Mr. Brennan had noticed that heifers bought in at 360 kg, which should have weighed 500 kg six months later had gained a mere 30 kg or 40 kg.  </P><Col N="440"/>
        <P>The water supply was thought to have been the source of the ill thrift but a change in the farm&rsquo;s water sources yielded no change.  In 2000, the animals were put on 50 acres of rented ground on a nearby farm.  Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s vet observed that the animals looked completely different.  When they were brought back to his own farm they began to lose weight again.  Laboratory tests confirmed this.</P>
        <P>In the winter of 2003-04, feeding trials were conducted.  Two sources of silage, one from Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s farm and one from an external source, were used for the trials on both Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s herd and an external herd.  Yet, intermittent weight loss was recorded among the animals using either silage feed.  Department officials told Mr. Brennan that he had conducted the tests incorrectly.</P>
        <P>In 2006, departmental vets completed a report stating that the source of his animals&rsquo; problem was disease management.  The report was never published because of Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s unhappiness with the findings.  A petition, which I wrote and which was accepted by the European Parliament petitions committee, was scathing of the progress being made in this deeply disturbing case.  The petition was followed by a visit from Brussels of the committee, who saw the stunted cattle on the farm.  In October 2006, the departmental vets ceased conducting tests on Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s farm.</P>
        <P>A team of vets from UCD then commenced further tests.  When feeding trials in 2006 and 2007 were conducted it was noticed that the animals were gaining weight.  The local factory, however, which is in the maximum fall-out area of Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s farm, was closed during the course of these trials.  Two letters from Teagasc in the past four years have stated that they do not believe it is the practices on Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s farm which have caused the ill thrift.  In July and October 2006, the then Minister for Agriculture and Food promised Mr. Brennan that when a downturn in cattle occurred again, post-mortems, liver biopsies and digestibility studies would be carried out.</P>
        <P>My understanding from reports in last week&rsquo;s <i>Kilkenny People</i> is that the investigation undertaken by the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis based at UCD has finished its work and the report of its findings allegedly shows that cadmium, a dangerous, highly toxic and cancer causing substance has been identified as one of the main causes of health problems on the farm.  The levels of the dangerous chemical element found were, apparently, the highest ever recorded in the country.</P>
        <P>Cadmium is often found in industrial work places, particularly where ore is being processed or smelted.  Cadmium compounds can lead to cancers in animals and organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the American EPA and the US national toxicology programme have all deemed cadmium a problem and a human carcinogen.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to expedite the publication of this report to give Mr. Dan Brennan and his family answers and justice after 19 years of waiting and to address or alleviate the concerns of the people of Castlecomer about public health issues which might arise if such reports are true.  In a recent letter dated 14 April the Minister promised me that the publication of the report would take place at the end of this month or early May.  Last week, on the day of media reports on the matter, an official from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food told local radio that it would be several months before the report would be completed.  I understand the report, which I have not seen, is being peer reviewed, but one does not peer review a report if it is not completed.  I call on the Minister of State to clarify these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The animal health problems on the farm referred to by Deputy White have been ongoing for several years and relate mainly to ill-thrift and stunted growth of cattle on the farm in addition to reduced milk yield.  I thank Deputy White for her tenacious determination to pursue this investigation in recent years on behalf of Mr. Dan Brennan, his family and the wider community of Castlecomer.  The farm in question, which I have visited, has been the subject of extensive investigations in recent years.  Since late 2006 it has been the subject of further thorough and comprehensive investigations by the Department&rsquo;s centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis, CVERA, based at University College Dublin.  A high degree of inter-agency involvement and co-operation has been a feature of the investigations.  The agencies involved have included the EPA, Kilkenny County Council, Teagasc, the HSE &mdash; previously, the South Eastern Health Board was involved &mdash; and my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2004, my Department&rsquo;s veterinary laboratory service arranged for a wide-ranging study to be undertaken into the problems on the farm, following which a report was produced in June 2006.  The report documented the range of the investigations, the methodology involved and the results of different aspects.  The farmer involved had certain difficulties with some aspects of the report and, at his request, the report was not published.</P>
        <P>As part of the inter-agency investigation, several reports, in addition to my Department&rsquo;s 2006 report, were produced.  These included the UCC report of 2006 commissioned by the EPA entitled, An Impact Assessment on Epiphytic Lichens; the Ambient Air Quality Survey report of 5 May 2006; the John J Gardiner report, entitled Condition of Trees on the Farm of December 2005; and the EPA summary report of the work completed by the EPA as part of the multi-agency investigation of animal health in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny of September 2006.</P>
        <P>Apart from these reports my Department and others have also been involved in several initiatives on this farm.  For example, a herd health programme was developed by the farmer&rsquo;s private veterinary practitioner and supported by my Department, to deal with respiratory disease in calves and mastitis in cows.  The Department also funded treatment for mastitis, a vaccination programme, the provision of calf hutches to segregate the calves from each other and feeding trials.  Other initiatives included a grassland management plan, monitoring growth of calves at grass and checking sources of water to the farm.</P>
        <P>Following finalisation of the Department&rsquo;s veterinary laboratory service report in 2006, the then Minister met a delegation of interests, including the farmer, in July 2006 and confirmed that the authorities were more than willing to pursue the investigation further and to seek to get to the root of the problems on the farm.  The Minister also met with the director of the EPA to discuss a report it had produced on the environmental impact of emissions.  Arising from this process, in 2006 the then Minister asked the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis to conduct a further thorough and comprehensive study.</P>
        <P>The centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis study is designed to complement the work to date and used some different approaches to investigate the production problems on the farm.  The study entails a major sampling and testing programme, including investigation of various metabolic pathways, as well as epidemiological studies.  In addition, a comprehensive and detailed soil survey is included in the remit of the study.  A draft report arising from this work has now been sent for peer review and when this is completed the report will be finalised and published.</P><Col N="442"/>
        <P>The article in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> refers to a report.  However, I am not aware to which document the newspaper refers and I trust the Deputy would agree, therefore, that it is inappropriate for me to comment in detail upon it.  I emphasise that my Department and I, along with the other agencies involved, are determined to establish the underlying cause of the problems on this farm.  It is inappropriate at this stage to make any further comment on the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis investigation until the report is finalised and published, which will take place shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Charities Act 2007 was signed into law on 28 February 2009. The Act may be commenced in whole or in part by way of Ministerial Order.  </P>
        <P>The Act, when commenced, will introduce a modern regulatory framework for charities in Ireland for the first time.  The Act provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a new Charities Regulatory Authority, which will be responsible for establishing and maintaining a Register of Charities. Any organisation that wishes to operate as a charity within this jurisdiction will have to be on the Register. Only organisations that have been established exclusively for charitable purposes, and which have a public benefit, will be permitted entry onto the Register.</P>
        <P>The Act further provides that any organisation that holds charitable tax exemptions from the Revenue Commissioners on the day the Register of Charities is introduced will be automatically deemed to be entered onto the Register, and thus such organisations will not have to apply to the new Authority for registration. My officials are in discussions with their counterparts in the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the information held by Revenue on organisations that are eligible for charitable tax exemptions, as well as the appropriate arrangements for the transfer of this information to my Department in anticipation of the introduction of the Register of Charities in due course.</P>
        <P>As there are over 7,000 such organisations, the Deputy will appreciate that there is a considerable body of work to be done in this regard alone. It must also be recognised that this is only one element of the wider programme of work to be undertaken by my Department to <Col N="444"/>ensure that the essential elements are in place to enable the introduction of the statutory regulatory framework provided for in the Act.  In other countries, it has taken a number of years after enactment of the legislation for the new regulatory system for charities to be formally introduced and this is likely to be the case in Ireland also.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 81 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies may be aware, I launched the Dial-to-Stop Drug Dealing Campaign in September 2008.  The first phase was run across five Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces areas with funding being provided by my Department (&euro;100,000) and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (&euro;50,000).  The confidential number used in the campaign is open for all to use, regardless of which area they come from and this was highlighted during the national launch.</P>
        <P>Following Government approval, &euro;300,000 has been allocated from the Dormant Accounts Fund for 10 further campaigns.  Campaigns under phase 2 have already rolled out in the following areas:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Cork Local Drugs Task Force and the Southern Regional Drugs Task Force (23rd March);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Co. Kerry (25th March);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />North Dublin City and County RDTF (31st March);</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Mid-West RDTF (2nd April); and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />South East RDTF (27th April).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The dates for the launch of the phase 3 local campaigns that have been finalised are listed below.  It is likely that the remaining local campaigns will be rolled out in May:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />East Coast RDTF &mdash; 12th May;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />D&uacute;n Laoghaire LDTF &mdash; 18th May;</P><Col N="445"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Finglas Cabra LDTF &mdash; 21st May;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Bray LDTF &mdash; not finalised yet; and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Midlands RDTF &mdash; likely to be between 11th and 18th May.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">With regard to any future funding, as the Dormant Accounts funding is once-off in nature, the &euro;300,000 referred to above is the total that will be allocated. As the allocation for funding for drugs initiatives in my Department in 2009 is fully committed, I regret that there is no scope, at present, for further campaigns.   Neither do I envisage any additional campaigns in 2010.</P>
        <P>However, by the end of phase 3, I am confident that all Task Forces that expressed an interest &mdash; and had the capacity to do so &mdash; will have received funding to run a campaign in their areas. Should Task Forces decide to run further campaigns, they would need to do so from within their existing resources.</P>
        <P>Again, I would like to emphasise, as I highlighted during the national launch, the confidential number used in the campaign is open for all to use, regardless of which area they come from.  Calls from the areas that have already run campaigns are still being made to the confidential phone-line.  I understand that there is a fixed cost for every call answered so the campaign will run until the funding is exhausted.  The level of calls, therefore, over the coming weeks and months will determine the lifetime of the funding. At the current level of calls, it is envisaged that the line could remain open up to early autumn.</P>
        <P>Overall, I believe that the campaign to date has proved to be successful.  According to the latest information, I understand that there have been nearly 2,200 calls to the phone-line that have generated nearly 600 information reports to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The information reports have been referred to a wide geographical spread of Garda stations for follow up.  The calls are spread right across the country, including areas that have not directly run a campaign.  In all the areas where the campaign is being rolled out, I understand that the local Garda&iacute; are following strong lines of enquiry resulting from the information arising from the free phone number.</P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; have also confirmed that there has been a number of seizures and arrests on foot of information received including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the seizure of a substantial quantity of cannabis in one area;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the seizure of a substantial quantity of cannabis and a firearm in another area; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the seizure of a substantial quantity of heroin in one area.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Finally, the Deputies should note that, from the evidence of the original campaign in Blanchardstown in 2006, it would seem that campaigns are best targeted at small local areas and for a defined short period.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 91 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in the current economic circumstances, the Government was faced with difficult decisions in the recent Budget. Accordingly, it considered a range of measures to maintain a prudent fiscal outturn for 2009 and to provide the basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation.  Across Government, our approach has been to do this in as balanced a way as possible.</P>
        <P>The revised 2009 net allocation for my Department at &euro;443.7m shows a reduction of &euro;47.4m on the initial estimated allocation announced in October 2008.  Full details of the reductions at an individual programme level are available in the recently published Revised Estimates Volume 2009, which is available on line via the following website address: http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=5745</P>
        <P>&euro;11.8m of my Department&rsquo;s reduction relates to capital expenditure.  This includes a transfer of some &euro;2.5m to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs relating to the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund.  The balance reflects adjustments in capital expen<Col N="447"/>diture made in the package of measures announced by the Minister of Finance at end-January 2009.</P>

        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to publish a 20-year Strategy for the Irish language, which will lay the foundation for practical action for supporting and promoting the language, based on a modern, integrated approach. Issues raised in the report referred to will be considered in the discussions and formulation of the final Strategy, including in discussions with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>I have received a draft of the 20-year Strategy, which is being considered at present by my own Department and by other relevant Government Departments, which will have responsibility for its implementation. The draft Strategy will be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht before being submitted to Government. It is anticipated that the necessary steps to this end will be taken shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 96, 105 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>On 31st March last, the Government gave approval for the development of a combined National Substance Misuse Strategy to cover both alcohol and drugs.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Deputies will agree, this decision is very welcome and recognises the widespread public concern in Ireland in relation to the problem use of alcohol &mdash; both as a stand-alone public health issue and in association with illicit drug use.  Developing a substance misuse policy, which encompasses both drugs and alcohol, presents many challenges, therefore, given the nature and complexities of the public health and other issues involved.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, I am also very conscious that work on developing a National Drugs Strategy is well advanced at this stage and that the Steering Group, which is developing proposals in this regard, will be presenting me with their findings in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, having considered the matter, it has been decided to proceed on the following basis:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Work on completing the National Drugs Strategy will be finalised in the coming weeks and I expect to be presenting it to Government for approval in late May/early June.  The Strategy will be published as an &ldquo;interim&rdquo; Strategy pending the drafting and finalisation of a National Substance Misuse Strategy; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A new Steering Group will be established in autumn 2009 to develop proposals for an overall Substance Misuse Strategy that will incorporate the already agreed drugs policy element.  The Group will be asked to report by the end of 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As part of the restructuring proposed in the new Drugs Strategy, the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST) will be discontinued from 30th April.  It is intended that proposals for the establishment of a new dedicated Ministerial Drugs Office will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the new Drugs Strategy.  In the interim, the general functions of the NDST will be absorbed appropriately within my Department.</P>
        <P>There has been no change in the number of staff working on the new Drugs Strategy within my Department.  As outlined above, this work is being overseen by a Steering Group comprising representatives of the relevant Departments, statutory agencies and the community &amp; voluntary sectors.  The Steering Group is chaired by my Department, at Assistant Secretary level, and four other officials are also engaged in the development of the Strategy, as part of their on-going Departmental work.</P>
        <P>No decisions have yet been made on the funding of the National Substance Misuse Strategy.  Considerable resources are already targeted at problem substance use in Ireland and the challenge over the coming years, given the current financial constraints facing the country, will be to maximise the overall effectiveness of that funding.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, language schemes constitute the core element of the Act. The schemes approved by me to date reflect the resources and capacity currently available to public bodies and build on what is already there.  The approach being adopted when agreeing schemes with <Col N="451"/>public bodies is to emphasise practicality and the need to live within existing resources.  Cost issues continue to be addressed from within existing allocations, or otherwise on a marginal or replacement cost basis.  It remains critically important to get the balance right &mdash; to show real progress on meeting our constitutional obligations while at same time managing the process within existing resources as far as possible and planning for the long-term.  </P>
        <P>Given its position as the first constitutional language, the objective is to ensure that delivery of public services by public bodies through the Irish language is seen as normal and required to meet minimum standards of customer service and corporate governance, rather than an optional extra or add-on. Given the constitutional position and how that was applied in the &Oacute; Beol&aacute;in case of 2001, it would be a mistake to think there is a choice between implementing the Act &mdash; with consequent costs &mdash; and not implementing it.  The Act provides a planning mechanism by which constitutional obligations can be met over time in a planned and coherent way.  The alternative is an <i>ad hoc</i> approach, in which public bodies respond in a fragmentary and crisis management way to perhaps much more prescriptive judicial orders.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of translation costs, I should once more point out that the Act does not require that all documents have to be translated into Irish.  It provides that a number of key documents shall be published in each of the official languages. In relation to the question of costs, I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Questions on the 3rd of February 2009 in respect of the costs associated with the implementation of the Act since its enactment in 2003.  Of the 15 Departments of State, 11 replied.  When the figures are totalled, I have estimated that the average direct costs per year amounted to some &euro;600,000, or put another way approximately &euro;11,000 per Department. I am of the view that no fair-minded person would consider these costs either excessive or unreasonable.</P>
        <P>I also believe that public bodies, particularly in relation to translation of documents, can achieve greater cost-effectiveness.  This could be secured by planning earlier in the process for translation; greater use of standardised templates for documents such as annual reports; and publication by way of CDs or the Internet, rather than hard copy. The Government adopted a similar policy last year as one of a number of measures designed to reduce costs across public bodies.  The roll-out by Foras na Gaeilge of the accreditation system for translators, which it has developed at my request, will also help ensure that public bodies receive translation product that is reliable and meets a high standard.</P>
        <P>I should also refer to the Official Languages Act 2003 (Section 9) Regulations 2008, which I made on 1 October 2008. These Regulations were drafted to allow a phased approach to ensuring compliance and to minimise costs.  For example, the Regulations provide that existing stocks of stationery that do not comply with the requirements may nonetheless be used up over a period of years.  In relation to signage, the Regulations take immediate effect only in the case of new signage.  Existing signs that are not in compliance may nonetheless remain in situ for varying periods of years, up to 1 January 2026.  These provisions are intended to ensure that any costs arising in updating signage are minimal and &mdash; if any such costs indeed arise &mdash; they can be spread over a number of years.</P>

        <P>Contracts with all but one Local Action Group have now been signed to implement these supports throughout the country.  I expect the final contract to be signed in the near future.

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is normal practice for my Department to seek to recoup funding where appropriate circumstances arise from beneficiaries of my Department&rsquo;s various schemes and programmes.  Records indicate that in 2008, my Department recouped funding in the amount of &euro;2.027 million as set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>I should advise the Deputy that under the Leader Programmes 2000-2006 the funding was provided to Leader groups on an advance basis.  My Department is now dealing with the groups in reconciling amounts disbursed where there is a balance owing.  It is anticipated that the amount of &euro;395,725 will be recouped.</P>
        <P>In addition I understand that &euro;104,099 has been recouped to date in relation projects approved for funding under the Dormant Accounts Fund.  A further amount of under &euro;10,000 is expected to be recouped.  These amounts represent funds approved for projects that did not proceed to implementation and completed projects where small amounts remained unspent at completion.  Furthermore, over &euro;122,815 has been recouped under the Programme of Grants to Locally Based Community and Voluntary Organisations.  Details of all monies recouped by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, are published in the organisation&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts, which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  While the organisation&rsquo;s 2008 Annual Report and Accounts are currently under preparation, I understand from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that the provisional figure in respect of 2008 is &euro;291,000.  I should also point out that moneys recouped by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are not repaid to my Department.</P>

        <Quest> the number of employees in Waterways Ireland; the grades of those employed; the number employed in Northern Ireland; the status of those employed, whether civil service or otherwise; the employment description of those employed; the number of vacancies for outside staff within the agency; if such positions are to be filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that Waterways Ireland currently has a total of 358 employees, 88 of whom are based in Northern Ireland and 270 based in Ireland.  This is further broken down into 82 permanent staff in Northern Ireland and 269 permanent staff in Ireland.

        <P>Under the relevant legislation, staff of the body are employees of Waterways Ireland and are not civil servants.  They are, however, treated as public servants in each jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Waterways Ireland has approval for 381 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs), of which some 352 FTEs (equating to the 358 employees referred to above) are filled at present.  Taking account of seasonal workers employed on a short-term basis during the summer months, 18 vacancies <Col N="458"/>exist currently.

	<P>I have been informed by Waterways Ireland that it is aware of, and greatly appreciates, the work done by local community groups along our waterways, in particular the canals.  Waterways Ireland is not a grant-aiding organisation.  However, it has from time to time provided support in kind to a number of groups to help with cleaning the canals.  If a particular group located along the canals requires such support, it should contact the Waterways Ireland Regional Office at 01-868 0148.</P>

        <Quest> the number of day care facilities in each county funded prior to the 7 April 2009 budget through the community services programme; the number of persons in each county who are attached to each facility; his views on funding the schemes through another aspect of funding from within his Department; if he has had discussions with the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs as to ways and means of overcoming the problems that such facilities are facing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 440 organisations are currently approved for funding under the Community Services Programme.  In the region of 2,600 people are in employment with organisations being funded under the programme and of these, in excess of 250 people are employed in 29 facilities providing child care services across 15 counties.  The number of groups and level of staffing grants approved by county are set out in the following table.  The Deputy may wish to note that the number of people employed is higher than the number of posts due to the use of part-time working arrangements. </P>
        <P>Of the 29 organisations funded, 18 provide child care services as the exclusive or main component of their operations; and  the remaining 11 organisations provide child care as part of the overall range of services provided to their local communities.  All of these organisations are contracted until the end of 2009 in line with the general arrangements applicable to all organisations currently in contract under the programme.  There are no plans to fund these organisations from other programmes administered by my Department.</P>
        <P>No Department has been in contact with me in relation to any problem being experienced by these organisations.  In addition, the Deputy should note that neither have any of these organisations been in touch with my Department in recent months to express any concern with the operation of their contracts with the programme or of other aspects of their service provision.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s allocations for 2009 for the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes are  &euro;16.860m and &euro;7.49m respectively. Deputies will be aware that it is a matter for individual Departments to report on their investment in RAPID areas.  I expect a strong spend on the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID leverage programmes during the year to meet existing commitments. In addition I will be concentrating on focusing both programmes on priority needs in RAPID and CL&Aacute;R areas. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department is currently undertaking a review of the RAPID boundaries, where attention at present is focused on an analysis of recent Census data with a view to ensuring that the boundaries of existing RAPID areas are appropriate.  I hope to be in a position to report on the results of this review shortly.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 8 of 29 January 2009 in which I outlined the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing essential public services in rural areas in order to secure a proper environment for economic development, promote social inclusion and support dispersed, viable rural communities. I would re-iterate that the Programme for Government contains a series of commitments to strengthen and underpin public service provision in rural areas, across a range of Government departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>Since that reply my Department&rsquo;s 2009 allocations in the supplementary budget are now known. Apart from the LEADER programme, funding for most of the other programmes operated by my Department has been reduced, reflecting the realities of the economic situation facing the country. I still expect a strong spend on programmes such as the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID leverage funds as existing commitments are met. In addition I expect strong delivery by the local action groups selected to deliver the LEADER programme. My priority will be to ensure that my Department&rsquo;s programmes are focussed on propriety areas and frontline services, which should minimise negative consequences of funding reductions.</P>

	<P>Family support has been identified as a priority under the National Drugs Strategy (NDS) and many drugs projects that are funded by my Department include such support as part of the wider range of services that they provide. Some 36 projects in Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas focussing particularly (but not exclusively in some cases) on family support issues have been approved funding of approximately &euro;1.2m for the first 6 months of this year. Furthermore, my Department funds the Family Support Network on an annual basis to facilitate its on-going development. The funding helps the Network to develop local family support groups around the country in a co-ordinated way, and to promote opportunities for networking between them.  It also assists in improving links and partnerships between the families of drug users and others involved in the implementation of the Strategy.</P>
        <P>During the consultation process for the NDS 2009-2016, and in particular the public meetings, the need to strengthen family services was consistently highlighted. I am conscious that the Steering Group currently finalising the new Strategy is very aware of the need to engage and support families. The Group is due to report to me in the next few weeks and I will be presenting proposals to Government as soon as possible. The issues raised also reflected many <Col N="462"/>of the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation. The implementation of that Report &mdash; which included five recommendations in respect of the role of families in the rehabilitation process &mdash; is likely to remain a priority under the new Strategy.</P>
        <P>By way of information, the Deputy should also note that an indicative allocation of &euro;1.7m has been approved under the Dormant Accounts Fund to develop once-off initiatives aimed at improving services for families of drug misusers in Drugs Task Force areas. I expect the specific proposals will be advanced over the coming period.</P>

	<P>The situation pertaining to electrical apprentices is governed by the Standards Based Apprenticeship System, a standard based system of training and education for apprentices leading to the award of an Advanced Craft Certificate; this is the recognised award nationally and internationally for qualified Craftpersons. The Advanced Craft Certificate qualification is awarded to apprentices when they have met the following criteria:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Successfully completed all on-the-job and off-the-job phases and have reached the minimum qualifying standard in all modular and competency based assessment.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Completed a minimum of 12 weeks in employment as an apprentice in phase 7.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Completed a minimum of 4 years from the date of registration in employment as an apprentice for the specified trade.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Apprentices are given three opportunities to reach the minimum standard to qualify as an apprentice. Apprentices who fail to reach the minimum standard after 3 attempts at a modular assessment will have their apprenticeship automatically terminated. Apprentices are permitted to appeal the termination of their apprenticeship and where the appeal is granted the apprentices are permitted to undertake a fourth and final attempt. Apprentices who fail to reach the minimum standard at the fourth and final attempt will receive confirmation of the termination of their apprenticeship.

	<P>Standard forms for Suitability Assessment for Works Contractors have been developed in compliance with EU procurement rules and health and safety legislation. Suitability assessment procedures involve inviting applicants to submit information in response to a customised standard questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed in response to difficulties which had been experienced by firms, especially those in the small and medium-sized sector, arising from widespread use of various types of questionnaires across the public sector.</P>
        <P>Individual public bodies use the information set out in response to the questionnaire to determine which applicants (under a restricted procedure) or which tenderers (under an open procedure) meet the suitability standards and which do not. The standard approach to suitability assessment is intended to ensure that only those works contractors who qualify against certain objective criteria that are transparent, non-discriminatory, proportionate and fair are permitted to progress to the next stage of the procurement procedure for publicly funded works projects. The setting of minimum standards in questionnaires is left to individual contracting authorities on the basis that each is best placed to decide what is appropriate to meet its own <Col N="464"/>requirements. These requirements and the corresponding minimum standards will vary not only between individual cases but also over time. Accordingly, it is not proposed to review the pre-qualification process.</P>

	<P>The Valuation Act 2001, which came into effect on 2 May 2002, provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property. The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils. The South Dublin County Council revaluation was completed in December 2007. Fingal County Council will be completed later this year and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will be completed in 2010. Once a local authority has been revalued the Valuation Act provides for a subsequent revaluation not sooner than 5 but not later than 10 years. </P>
        <P>The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the rates income of the local authority to be capped in the year following a revaluation; therefore a revaluation will not increase the commercial rates income of a local authority. The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. Following revaluation there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability. A valuation date that coincides with a period of buoyant property values will not in itself increase the amount of rates collected by a rating authority or the amount payable by an individual ratepayer. It is the relative value of properties to each other rather than the absolute value of an individual property, which will determine whether a property&rsquo;s rates liability will decrease or increase following a revaluation. Once the revaluation is completed in the three County Dublin local authority areas and the Dublin City Council area, it is proposed to initiate the revaluation of Cork City and County as the next areas of highest population.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the charge is to cover the long-term costs of borrowing to the Exchequer that arise out of the provision of the Guarantee to the covered institutions. These additional costs initially were estimated to be about &euro;1 billion. The charging model for recouping these costs was based on covered liabilities of circa &euro;450bn. However, as I have pointed out previously, about &euro;90bn of that amount is covered by the enhanced Deposit Protection Scheme. The covered institutions do not pay the quarterly charge on liabilities covered by this scheme. Furthermore, the total of covered liabilities will naturally adjust over time as bank balance sheets change in the normal course of business.  For these two reasons, therefore, the fees paid to date have been less than was estimated originally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nevertheless, there is provision in the Act for amendments to certain elements of the Scheme, including the charge to the covered institutions. For example, I am empowered to review the application of the guarantee charging model every six months and to make such adjustments as I deem necessary to ensure the recovery of the aggregate cost to be borne by the State as a consequence of the provision of the guarantee, and to ensure that the overall objectives of the Act are achieved. Therefore, I will review the rate of charge to ensure that there will be no inappropriate shortfall in the yield to the exchequer.  I would like to assure the Deputy that I will utilise fully the powers given to me under the Scheme to safeguard financial stability and ensure that the long term interests of the taxpayers are protected.</P>

	<P>Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 allows tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to eligible charities and other approved bodies, including first and second level schools and third level institutions providing education based on a programme prescribed or approved by the Minister for Education and Science. The arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varies depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, or is subject to self-assessment, or is a company. In the case of a self-assessed donor, the individual taxpayer himself or herself claims the relief in respect of the charitable donation. Likewise, in the case of a company, the company claims a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense. However, in the case of a PAYE donor, the relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the eligible charity (or approved body) and the claim for refunds is made by the charity and not by the PAYE donor. For example, a donation of &euro;1,000 by a taxpayer on the higher rate results in a refund to the charity of &euro;695. Thus the charity benefits in total to the extent of &euro;1,695. The Commission on Taxation, as part of its remit, is reviewing all existing tax reliefs including reliefs in respect of donations to charities and other approved bodies.  It is expected that the Commission will furnish its report to me at the end of July.</P>

Preschool leaders will be expected to have a qualification in child care to FETAC level 5 or 6 qualifications, or equivalent, or to be in the process of completing their qualification. All services will be required to provide an educational programme consistent with the principles of S&iacute;olta and appropriate to the age of participating children. A national team of S&iacute;olta co-ordinators will assist services in meeting these standards.</P>
        <P>Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1 September of each year.  The 15 month age range is provided to facilitate parents in aligning their children&rsquo;s preschool year with the year they commence school.  The majority of children start school at the age of 5 years. Exceptions will be allowed where children have a <Col N="467"/>developmental delay or it is necessary to accept them at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school. Participating services will receive capitation of &euro;64.50 per week where children attend for 38 weeks, and &euro;48.50 where they attend for 50 weeks of the year. Services will receive payments at the start of each term.  Where the child is attending full-day or part-time child care, the service will be required to reduce the child care fees by the amount of the capitation.</P>

	<P>&rsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; the Report on the Expert Group on Mental Health recommended that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented and that the resources released by these closures should be re-invested in the new mental health service infrastructure requirement. The Departments of Finance and Health and Children have agreed in principle to the release of the proceeds of the disposal of properties prior to 2006 for reinvestment in mental health capital development. The arrangements for property disposal require Department of Finance approval in each case, the lodging of the proceeds as Exchequer Extra Receipts and the re-Voting of the funds for approved projects. Disposals to date amount to over &euro;42m and a submission detailing the projects to be funded from these disposals was received from the HSE on 12 February last. At a meeting between officials from my Department and the HSE to discuss the matter, it was agreed that the HSE would forward a revised submission to my Department and this is expected shortly.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings). In assessing a medical card/GP visit card application, the HSE uses guidelines based on people&rsquo;s means which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on people&rsquo;s ability to meet the cost of GP services.</P>
        <P>Under the 2009 Medical Card and GP Visit Card Income Guidelines, the weekly rates for a single parent with a dependant child is &euro;304.50 for a medical card and &euro;457 for a GP visit card. These figures are after tax and PRSI have been deducted and before any allowances have been given for rent/mortgage payments, child care costs or travel to work expenses. I have no role in the process of determination of eligibility to medical cards or GP visit cards for individual applicants. If an applicant is not content with the outcome of a medical card application to the HSE, the matter can be appealed to the Executive and can also be raised with the Office of the Ombudsman for adjudication.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, was published on 23 January, 2009. A core principle of the Hague Convention is that inter-country adoption should be child-centred &mdash; that is, in all stages of the process, the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount. Legislating for inter-country adoption is essential to give protection to children during the process of adoption. The Hague Convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between States to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. This is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland with regards to the standards that are being applied in the sending country &mdash; over which we have no jurisdiction. As a receiving country, it is especially important for Ireland to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, in the status of the child as adoptable and in a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention, provide an assurance for individual children, their families and the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.  As such, it is our intention that inter-country adoptions will now meet the standards of the Hague Convention. Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention as well as from those countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague standards. As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries who continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care that cannot be provided domestically. We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries, including the Russian Federation.</P>
        <P>As regards the Russian Federation, my Office is undertaking preparatory work to consider the contents of such an agreement, including anticipating the likely requirements of the Russian Federation. While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral agreement in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Government of the Russian Federation. However, I would respectfully suggest that any applicant seeking to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague country, or from a country with which Ireland does not have a <Col N="470"/>bilateral agreement, should have regard to the likelihood of the adoption being completed in advance of the Bill being commenced.</P>

        <Quest> if, regarding representations made to her on 9 April 2009 by An Bord Altranais which outlined the reason she should grant approval to the Board to manage staff numbers within an overall employment ceiling of 47, causing no added financial burden on public finances, she will approve the request; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>An Bord Altranais (The Nursing Board), which was established under the Nurses Act, 1985, is the statutory regulatory body for nurses and midwives. The Board consists of 29 members, 17 of whom are elected by nurses and 12 appointed by the Minister, 2 of whom are representatives of the Department of Health and Children. </P>
        <P>Under the Act the Minister has a range of functions in relation to the Board one of which, Section 17(1), relates to the officers and servants of the Board &ldquo;In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, there shall be appointed such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the Board, as the Board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Act also provides that the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 applies to the Board and its officers and servants as if it were a local authority.</P>
        <P>In addition to its statutory functions, the Board also administers the Nursing Careers Centre on behalf of the Health Services. For this purpose ongoing funding is provided by the HSE and the amount of this funding in 2007 was &euro;600,000. While the bulk of the Board&rsquo;s income is generated by fees paid by nurses and midwives, it is a statutory body whose staff have access to a public service pension scheme. It is thus covered by the recent Government decision that, with effect from the 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. The decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term <Col N="472"/>basis and to the renewal of such contracts. Therefore, when vacancies arise each agency must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly.</P>
        <P>In the case of the health sector, any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I am advised that An Bord Altranais has an overall complement of 47 staff, 11 of whom are employed on fixed term/purpose contracts. The CEO of An Bord recently wrote to the Secretary General of my Department in this regard. My Department is currently examining the submission from An Bord Altranais and a response will be issued in the near future.</P>

	<P>Tysabri was licensed by the European Commission in June 2006 as a therapy for multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon, or</P><Col N="475"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.</P>
<P FLI="0">There are risks with this drug and Tysabri has been associated with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) which is related to a virus in the central nervous system of immune-compromised individuals. As a result of this the drug is licensed to be administered under strict guidelines.</P>
        <P>The therapy must be initiated and supervised by specialised physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions and under strict clinical conditions.  Tysabri 300 mg is administered by intravenous infusion once every four weeks. Continued therapy must be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit within six months.</P>
        <P>Data on the safety and efficacy of Tysabri beyond two years are not available. Continued therapy beyond this time should be considered only following a reassessment of the potential for benefit and risk.</P>
        <P>The Irish Medicines Board as statutory body responsible for regulation of medicinal products in Ireland and in co-operation with the European Commission and European Medicines Agency,  is keeping the status and other safety issues of this medicinal product under review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from the indications outlined above no other indications for Tysabri are permitted in any member state in Europe. I also understand from the Irish Medicines Board, that it is not aware of any other uses for the drug being considered at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of &euro;14 million is available to my Department for the promotion and implementation of sustainable travel and transport initiatives in 2009.</P>
        <P>When I announced Ireland&rsquo;s first National Cycle Policy Framework recently, I specifically referred to the availability of &euro;3 million in 2009 for the provision of cycling infrastructure in the Dublin region.  The projects that I envisage will be progressed this year by Dublin City Council include development of premium cycle routes (from Portobello to the Liffey via the Grand Canal; from the North Quays towards Fairview Park, and via Heytsbury Street to the centre city); refurbishment of existing cycle lanes; and the provision of both additional permanent cycle parking in the city and mobile cycle parking facilities to service public events.</P>
        <P>My Department is also exploring options with Dublin City Council in relation to progressing the Sutton to Sandycove project.  This, however, does not fully represent the extent of my financial commitment to the cycling agenda in 2009.  I will be providing finance to enable the organisation of National Bike Week 2009 (details of which will be announced shortly) and I am also committed to providing, through the Dublin Transportation Office, up to &euro;2 million to An Taisce&rsquo;s GreenSchools Travel Module (which inter alia supports cycling among school children through education and infrastructure).</P>
        <P>My Department is also currently in discussions with a number of local authorities outside the Greater Dublin Area in connection with the possibility of providing financial support for the delivery of a number of flagship cycle-related schemes as demonstration projects.</P>
        <P>Delivery of the vision of a culture of cycling in Ireland that underpins the National Cycle Policy Framework will require a considerable timeframe &mdash; stretching up to 2020.  This will not <Col N="476"/>only involve the provision of excellent infrastructure but also a change in the national mindset.  I am satisfied that sufficient funding is available this year to commence not only the process of changing the public perception of cycling but also to enable progress on key cycling infrastructure.</P>

        <P>By letter dated 22 January 2008, the first named person concerned was notified that he could, if he so wished, submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State. He was also invited to update his earlier representations to the Minister. He was requested to respond within 15 working days. Updated representations have been submitted on behalf of the first named person concerned. An application for Subsidiary Protection in the State has also been submitted on behalf of the first named person concerned and this application is currently under consideration in my Department.  When this consideration has been completed, the first named person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is unsuccessful, the case file of the first named person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this overall consideration has been completed, the case file is passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>In relation to the second named person concerned, the position is that if an application for asylum has been made by the person in question, the Deputy will be aware that it is not the practice to comment on asylum applications that are pending.</P>

	<P>The McMorrow Commission of Investigation is a statutorily independent body, the legislative basis for which is the Commissions of Investigation Act, 2004. As such, the scheduling of its work programme is a matter for its Chairperson, Ms Grainne McMorrow SC. Notwithstanding that, it is my understanding that she expects to have completed her report on the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Douch and other related matters early next year.</P>
        <P>Under Section 38 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is generally required to publish the report of a Commission as soon as possible following its submission to him. However if the Minister considers that the contents of a report might prejudice criminal proceedings then he must apply to the Courts for direction. The question of  publication then becomes a matter for the Courts.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</P>
        <P>Waterways Ireland works proactively with a wide range of statutory, commercial and community stakeholders to stimulate increased activity on both the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal.  Waterways Ireland markets and promotes Ireland&rsquo;s inland waterways, including the Grand and Royal Canal, in a strategic and integrated manner to deliver five key marketing objectives: Awareness Creation; Development of Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s corporate identity; Promoting greater use of the waterways; Working in partnership with other bodies; and building a platform for sustained market development.</P>
        <P>These marketing objectives are achieved through the delivery of a number of actions, including a sponsorship programme, the development and distribution of publications, an award winning website, attendance at national and international tourism and trade shows, advertising and public relations, and joint initiatives with other trade and tourism organisations.</P>
        <P>Consultants have been engaged by Waterways Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Dublin City Council and Dublin Docklands Development Authority with the terms of reference of examining the Recreational, Tourism and Commercial potential of the Dublin City Canals and the development of an Investment and Maintenance Framework.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>In addition, Waterways Ireland also continues to develop and enhance the recreational products associated with the Royal and Grand Canal. In this regard, it may be noted that the Royal Canal is presently not fully navigable, with restoration works ongoing at both ends &mdash; namely, Spencer Dock at the eastern end and the last 25km of the western end from Ballymahon to Richmond Harbour, Clondra, Co. Longford.   It is envisaged that the Royal Canal will be open for boat navigation in 2010.  Waterways Ireland liaises with a wide range of stakeholders, including the Royal Canal Amenity Group in relation to boating issues, and will continue to do so when the Royal Canal is fully open for navigation. Waterways Ireland also liaises with the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland (IWAI) and individual boat / barge owners in relation to the Grand Canal, which is fully open to navigation, and to that end have been working <Col N="481"/>closely with IWAI Dublin Branch in organising the Dublin Rally (Lucan to Grand Canal Dock, Ringsend) over the period 9th to 23rd May 2009.</P>
        <P>There is a range of locations in which boats can moor on the Grand Canal, including Grand Canal Dock, Mespil Road, Charlemont Place and Portobello, as well as along the canal bank itself.  A feasibility study is ongoing in conjunction with Dublin City Council regarding a possible marina at Park West (the 8th level of the Grand Canal Main Line) and planning permission has been obtained by a developer at Pelletstown (the Cabra/Ashtown area of Royal Canal) for a 19-berth marina.</P>

	<P>Funding for most programmes operated by my Department has been reduced, reflecting the realities of the economic situation facing the country. I still expect a strong spend on programmes such as the CLAR and RAPID leverage funds as existing commitments are met.  My priority will be to ensure that my Department&rsquo;s programmes are focussed on priority areas and frontline services, which should minimise negative consequences of funding reductions.</P>
        <P>My Department has approved funding for the Drugs Task Force for the first six months of 2009 and this expenditure will be reviewed before allocating the remaining funding for the second half of the year.

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 46 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, the RAPID leverage schemes support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.</P>
        <P>The 2009 budget for RAPID is &euro;7.49m.  I would emphasise that one of the strengths of the RAPID Programme has always been the ability to focus on priority needs in those areas.  As Minister, I believe that we need to be constantly addressing the new challenges faced by both small rural communities and the most deprived urban communities.  The RAPID programme will be continuously refocused to deal with the priorities for those areas, especially in the <Col N="483"/>current difficult economic climate.  Furthermore, the Programme works to ensure, now more than ever, that local service providers work together efficiently to ensure effective results within the constraints of reduced budgets.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department is currently undertaking a review of the RAPID boundaries, where attention at present is focused on an analysis of recent Census data with a view to ensuring that the boundaries of existing RAPID areas are appropriate.  I hope to be in a position to report on the results of this review shortly.</P>

	<P>The CL&Aacute;R Programme provides funding and co-funding to Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities to accelerate investment in selected priority developments in areas that have suffered significant depopulation. These investments support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures. The measures introduced under the Programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas.  </P>
        <P>Against the background of the current economic climate I am reviewing the CL&Aacute;R programme as a whole, having regard to demand, the funding available and the level of outstanding commitments.  As the Deputy is aware the CL&Aacute;R programme budget for 2009 is &euro;16.860m.  One of the strengths of the CL&Aacute;R Programme has always been its ability to focus on priority needs in CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 to 179, inclusive, and 184 together.</P><Col N="484"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the majority of expenditure allocated to community groups through my Department for drugs initiatives is channelled through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.</P>
        <P>I expect the revised allocation for the Drugs Task Forces for this year to be of the order of &euro;32m.</P>
        <P>Projects have been approved funding for the first six months of 2009 and this expenditure will be reviewed before allocating the remaining funding for the second half of the year.  My Department will be working with the Task Forces to ensure that this funding is targeted in the most appropriate manner.</P>
        <P>Capital funding of around &euro;4.5m will be available in 2009. This allocation will fund existing and some new initiatives under the Premises Initiative Fund, which addresses the accommodation needs of community based drugs initiatives in Task Force areas. It will also complete the outstanding commitments under the once-off 2008 Regional Youth Initiative Fund. This initiative provided for the development of dedicated youth facilities in RDTF areas not covered under the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the funding being provided in 2009 by my Department will continue to facilitate the delivery valuable community-based initiatives to help address problem drug use.</P>
        <P>Across Government, we are taking a number of difficult decisions, but our approach is to do this in as balanced a way as possible. There is a critical need to ensure that resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that the maximum benefit is achieved. I would like to assure the Deputy that my primary concern has been &mdash; and continues to be &mdash; the protection of front-line community-based services delivering vital programmes and initiatives in areas worst affected by problem drug use.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Drugs Strategy is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and Agencies and my Department&rsquo;s allocation is part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.  In 2008, it was estimated that total expenditure on drugs programmes was over &euro;264m and initial indications are that this level will be broadly maintained in 2009.</P>
        <P>In relation to Co. Kildare, which is part of the South West RDTF area, the following allocations have been made: Abbey Project &mdash; funding of &euro;150,000 has been provisionally allocated in 2009 to provide a number of services such as drop-in, family support, referral, counselling, holistic therapies and advice and information on housing to drug users and their families from Celbridge and the surrounding areas; Community Drug Team for Kildare and West Wicklow &mdash; for 2009, funding of &euro;350,000 has been provisionally approved for this service which will expand and complement existing treatment services along with family support and early responses to young people at the early stage of drug misuse; and Newbridge Family Resource Centre  &mdash; in 2007, an amount of &euro;22,354 was approved under the Premises Initiative in respect of the purchase and installation of a semi-permanent structure for the Centre to provide a dedicated drop-in facility for &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youth.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department receives a large number of applications annually under the range of schemes operated by it, details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie. Such applications may be from national or regional organisations, local community or voluntary groups, or, in many cases, from large numbers of individuals or families.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that all applications for funding received by my Department are examined in line with the eligibility criteria of the relevant schemes. However, collating the detailed information sought in the Question would require a considerable amount of research, which I do not consider justified in the circumstances. If the Deputy has any particular cases in mind, I would be glad to have such cases looked at if he wishes to provide the necessary details.</P>

	<P>I have no statutory responsibility for rural housing. </P>
        <P>The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) addresses many of my concerns on issues such as rural housing. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. In this way it seeks to ensure key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the local circumstances of different areas.</P>
        <P>In the course of my day-to-day business, I regularly have contact with Ministers of other Departments, Local Authorities and as the need arises, other bodies and organisations regarding rural development issues. I have had a discussion with an Taisce in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>All social welfare schemes have different qualifying criteria, depending on the contingency the scheme seeks to address. Often these criteria include an upper and/or lower age limit. It is intended that these age limits ensure that the appropriate group is targeted for support. Legislative provisions in general and any changes to existing schemes are subject to approval by the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office. </P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended). The review is examining the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, (i.e. gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community) that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.</P>
        <P>The findings of this review will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of all citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs. The review is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A. (A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.) </P>
        <P>In Ireland self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s payments &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseekers Allowance.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>Self-employed people can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services. <Col N="488"/> Their means would be taken as any net profit that they will earn in the coming 12 months.  While their income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year&rsquo;s earnings will be received in the coming year.  Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</P>
        <P>There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</P>

The most common forms of ID produced are Passports, National ID cards, Driving Licenses and employer identity cards. This is not an exhaustive list and customers can prove their identity in other ways such as being personally known to post office staff.  Other checks can also be carried out for example, proving an attachment to an address or validation of their social services card. </P>
        <P>The Post Office is obliged to satisfy themselves as to the identity of the person to whom they are making a payment.

	<P>My officials recently met with the Carers Association to discuss proposals which they had put forward. The majority of the proposals relate to services provided by the Department of Health and Children and the Health Services Executive. However, my officials are committed to working with the Association on any proposals which can be progressed by this Department within existing resources.  </P>
        <P>The Government remains acutely aware of the sacrifices made by carers and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.</P>
        <P>The Carers Allowance scheme has been significantly improved in recent years and in Budget 2009, I continued this process.  The rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged 66 or over increased by &euro;7 to &euro;239 per week and for those aged under 66 by &euro;6.50 to &euro;220.50 per week.   These increases took effect from January 2009. Recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance are also eligible for household benefits, free travel and the respite care grant.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P>Since 1997 weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit, half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of &euro;60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure that those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that combined expenditure on carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carers allowance will be &euro;650 million in 2009.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management employing some 250 money advice staff operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country. In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday at lo-call number 1890 283 438 and budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.</P>
        <P>MABS money advisors focus on providing assistance, advice and intense support to people who have financial difficulties. They do not pay debts or provide any funds to clients. The money advisor works out a budget, negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of the debts. Where required by the client, the money advisor can assist with setting up a special account with their local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the money advisor makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client. Money Advisors provide ongoing support to people who successfully overcome their financial difficulties.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The recent supplementary budget provided for changes to the current back to work scheme.  In order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the live register and the current employment situation, it was decided to refocus resources on the enterprise strand of the back to work allowance which supports people into self employment.  To this end the employee strand of the back to work allowance will be closed to new applicants.  The changes provide for: A reduction in qualifying period required for access to back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) from 2 years to 12 months provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  This is in conjunction with a reduction in the period for which the BTWEA is payable from 4 years to 2 years, at 100% of existing social welfare entitlement in the first year and 75% in the second; Immediate access to a shorter BTWEA, to be called Short Term Enterprise Allowance, for someone who qualifies for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit (with 104 contributions paid in the past 2 years) or who qualifies for statutory redundancy.  It will be paid for the duration of the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit claim entitlement; Allowing  persons who previously participated in the BTWEA scheme and exhausted their entitlement after completion of the scheme, to participate a second time after a period of at least 5 years has elapsed.  These changes will come into effect from 1st May 2009.  The changes will not affect participants who are already on either strand of the back to work allowance at that date.</P>

        <Quest> the new ceilings for rents under the rent supplement scheme; the guidance she is issuing to tenants who are expected to secure an 8% rent reduction from landlords, particularly in contracts which do not provide for unilateral requests for a rent review; and the protections she envisages for tenants where landlords refuse. </Quest>
        <QRef>[17107/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented <Col N="492"/>accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>In recent years a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods. There are currently almost 84,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 40% since the end of December 2007.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable different types of eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions.</P>
        <P>Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at a higher level than are justified by the open market can have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels and in landlord income. This in turn may worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</P>
        <P>Maximum rent limits are prescribed in regulations and are time limited so that they can be adjusted in the light of rent levels generally. The most recent regulations cover the period to 31 December 2009.</P>
        <P>The recent Supplementary Budget provided for changes to be made to the rent supplement scheme. One of the measures being introduced is the reduction in the maximum level of rent supplement payable by the State in respect of all new tenancies or on renewals of tenancies. The limits will be reduced by up to 6% to 7% on average, ranging up to 10%, depending on the geographical area and household size and by reference to an analysis of rent supplement and the Private Residential Tenancies Board rent data as well as the downward trends in private rents as recently published by the CSO. Trends in the private rent sector indicate that rents have fallen considerably in the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>The new maximum rent limits will be prescribed in regulations to be made in the coming weeks and to take effect from 1 June 2009. These regulations will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas/Dail.</P>
        <P>Payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants are being reduced by 8% and the minimum contribution payable towards rent is being increased from &euro;18 to &euro;24 a week. While tenants are contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally. It is essential that state support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords.</P>
        <P>Existing recipients of rent supplement will be advised by letter in advance of the change being made to their rent payment and this communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases. Landlords will be advised through advertising in the print media of the general reduction in rent supplement payments.</P>
        <P>It is also open to any rent supplement recipient in dispute with their landlord over the level of rent being charged to refer the dispute to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) for mediation or adjudication when a rent review is due.</P><Col N="493"/>
        <P>Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case e.g. where homelessness might result due to the inability of a person to meet their rent payment.</P>
        <P>The Department intends to mail-shot up to 94,000 people whose entitlement to rent or mortgage interest supplement will be reduced automatically. The letter will advise people of their existing rate of payment and the new rate payable from 1 June 2009. The mail-shot will issue the week commencing 25 May 2009.</P>

	<P>There are no plans to stand down the Reserve Defence Force. The budgetary provision for training of members of the Reserve has been reduced but will provide sufficient funds to allow all current members of the Reserve to undertake paid training. Summer training camps have not been discontinued.</P>
        <P>The Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment to the Public Service with effect from 27th March 2009.  In this context and given the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force has been suspended for the present.</P>
        <P>The Reserve Defence Force has been selected as a review topic for inclusion in the 2009-2011 round of the Government&rsquo;s Value for Money and Policy Review initiative.  It is expected that the findings of this review, the general budgetary situation together with lessons learned through the RDF Review Implementation Plan process, will assist in informing decisions regarding future plans for the Reserve.</P>

        <Quest> the manner in which the &euro;200 million savings announced in the supplementary budget of 7 April 2009 that included water services infrastructure will impact on the need for <Col N="499"/>water treatment facilities in various counties to be upgraded to guard against contamination of drinking water supplies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The capital provision for water services infrastructure in 2009 is &euro;500 million &mdash; a reduction of &euro;60 million on the &euro;560 million envisaged in the 2009 Estimates for Public Services and Summary Public Capital Programme published in October 2008. The provision represents an increase of 1% on last year&rsquo;s outturn and, given the very difficult economic circumstances against which the 2009 estimates were framed, reflects the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the sector.</P>
        <P>Good progress will continue to be made under the Water Services Investment Programme in 2009. It is expected that 40 water and waste water schemes will be completed this year and that up to 50 new schemes will be able to start; a total of 160 schemes are expected to be in progress at the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The Water Services Investment Programme is currently under review to ensure that spending is focused on priority schemes. Water Services Authorities will be asked to undertake updated assessments of needs in the middle of this year which will be used as a key input to the review of the Programme.  Priority objectives for the new Programme will include the need to deliver infrastructure required to meet National and EU standards in relation to drinking water.</P>
        <P>The recently published EPA Report The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland &mdash; A Report for the Years 2007-2008, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the EPA&rsquo;s website www.epa.ie, identified 341 public water supply schemes requiring remedial action to address deficiencies in infrastructure or operational practice. These supplies are being addressed on an ongoing multi-agency basis, involving my Department, the EPA, Water Services Authorities and the HSE as appropriate.  As well as investment in major upgrading under the Water Services Investment Programme, which will address the deficiencies in some of the supplies highlighted, a special &euro;16 million fund was established in 2008 to meet the costs of relatively small scale improvements required in affected supplies.  It is anticipated that &euro;10 million of this Fund will be expended in 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 and 220 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme ceased with effect from Tuesday 14th April 2009. This was as a result of budgetary constraints and also reflects the greatly reduced incidence of BSE in this country.  The State will continue to provide financial support <Col N="502"/>for the collection of certain dead animals, notably bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme.</P>
        <P>The disposal of dead farm animals is subject to EU Regulations, notably Regulation (EC) No 1774 of 2002. The basic legal requirement is that animals, which die on farm, must generally be disposed of through approved rendering plants. Farmers may continue to use the existing collection network or, in the alternative, may transport dead animals by prior arrangement to approved plants, provided they transport the carcasses in leak-proof, covered containers or vehicles.</P>
        <P>The burial of animals that die on-farm is precluded unless the farmer has a burial licence issued by the local District Veterinary Office. Such licences can only be issued in respect of fallen animals in remote areas i.e. listed islands, boglands and mountains. All keepers of bovine animals are reminded of the legal requirement to notify movements of all bovines (live and dead) off their holdings to my Department. Failure to account for animals may lead to restriction of the holding, prosecution and/or a deduction from the Single Farm Payment. Failure to comply with the law in relation to disposal of fallen animals generally may also lead to enforcement action.</P>
        <P>We are now in a period of adjustment with pricing of collection/disposal for animals not covered by the new scheme left to the market and yet to settle. My Department will play its role within the boundaries of legal requirements in enabling reduction of costs in such areas as direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants, considering removal of some costs currently built into the rendering process, encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy, and facilitating cross-border trade.  The application of competitive market forces should ensure the avoidance of excessive costs of disposing of fallen animals.</P>

	<P>The previous question requested the number of issues logged by planners on the eREPS system and, as I indicated in my reply, that information is not readily available.</P>
        <P>My officials are in ongoing contact with Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants&rsquo; Association (ACA) which represents the majority of private planners, about the interpretation of issues relating to REPS including the use of eREPS.</P>
        <P>Outside these direct discussions, issues are raised in various forums, including direct contact by individual planners with my Department&rsquo;s local AES offices.  However, there is no central <Col N="503"/>record maintained of such issues.  My Department has already provided specific answers to a large number of questions raised by Teagasc and the ACA in direct discussions and further clarifications will continue to issue.  To log and analyse all queries centrally would be very time-consuming and would involve analysing data from various sources.  It would divert valuable staff resources from the urgent work of expediting REPS 4 payments and would not, in my view, represent the best use of those resources.  My Department is not, therefore, in a position to provide a response to the query raised at this time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 to 224, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme ceased with effect from Tuesday 14th April 2009. This was as a result of budgetary constraints and also reflects the greatly reduced incidence of BSE in this country.</P>
        <P>The State will continue to provide financial support for the collection of certain dead animals, notably bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme.  The disposal of dead farm animals is subject to EU Regulations, notably Regulation (EC) No. 1774 of 2002. The basic legal requirement is that animals, which die on farms, must generally be disposed of through approved rendering plants.</P>
        <P>There are 8 approved rendering plants in this country. Four of these plants are Category 1 rendering plants, which can process animals that die on-farm.  The rendering subsidy previously payable by my Department under the Fallen Animal Scheme was &euro;180 per tonne for ruminant material and &euro;116.52 for non-ruminant material. With the ending of the Scheme the cost of rendering is now a matter for commercial agreement between the individual rendering plants and their customers. Equally the cost of exporting meat and bone meal (MBM) is dependent on commercial arrangements.</P>
        <P>It has been a national requirement that all MBM produced in this country is manufactured using Method 1 as set out in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. This method involves the sterilisation of the resulting MBM. Other methods are permitted under the Regulation. I am open to submissions by the rendering industry if they wish to use these alternative processing methods. I am not in a position to estimate the savings that might result from using alternative methods, which would again be dependent on commercial arrangements by the plants concerned relating to disposal outlets.</P>
        <P>We are now in a period of adjustment with pricing for animals not covered by the new scheme left to the market and yet to settle. My Department will play its role within the boundaries of legal requirements in enabling reduction of costs in such areas as direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants, considering removal of some costs currently built into the rendering process (such as sterilisation), encouraging indigenous use of MBM for energy, and facilitating cross-border trade.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Fuel Duty Rebate Scheme (Provisions of Section 99  (1) Finance Act 1999) allowed for a rebate in respect of the excise duty paid  on fuel used by private contractors on delivering school transport services.  This scheme, which was processed by the Revenue Commissioners, ceased on 31st  October 2008 in accordance with the EU Energy Tax Directive. </P>
        <P>I indicated in my reply to the Deputy in Parliamentary Question Number 729 of  22 April, 2009 that Bus Eireann was informed on 7th April that due to the very  difficult fiscal conditions, it was not possible for my Department to approve  any increase towards compensating private operators on contract to Bus Eireann  for any loss of income arising from the termination of the fuel rebate scheme.</P><Col N="506"/>
        <P>The reply also indicated that provision of &euro;2 million was made in the 2009  Estimate to meet the estimated cost of the compensatory allowance. The school  transport estimate has now been reduced by &euro;2 million to &euro;192 million in the  supplementary budget.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact that the school transport estimate has been reduced by &euro;2  million to &euro;192 million, funding is not available to Bus &Eacute;ireann to pay a  compensatory allowance to private operators.</P>

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the  managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to  intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main  responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater  for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard  a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in  respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case  of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the  Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can  assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order  to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at  National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street,  Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the  managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to  intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department&rsquo;s main  responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater  for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard  a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in  respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>In 1993, the Department issued a circular (M 51/93) to post-primary schools,  advising of a memorandum of agreement between the Department and the  post-primary schools managerial association, that selection for the purposes of  enrolment based on academic ability should be discontinued.</P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally  obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that  policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their  children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case  of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the  Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can  assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order  to assist in securing a school place<Col N="508"/>ment. The Board can be contacted at  National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22  Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 726 of 22 April 2009, the number of school projects with details of each school, location and roll number, which will not proceed due to the &euro;30 million reduction in the school building programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A reduction of &euro;30m in the capital allocation in respect of the primary and  post primary sectors was a feature of the supplementary budget delivered on 7  April 2009. The allocation now in place for the 2009 school capital programme  is &euro;613.8m and this amount is almost 5% greater than the allocation available  at the beginning of the 2008 financial year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that there are many sub-programmes within the  School Building and Modernisation Programme such as large scale projects, the  acquisition of sites, the summer works scheme, the primary schools minor works  grant and others. The level of complexity in delivering the sub-programmes  varies greatly &mdash; the allocation of the minor works grant which costs almost  &euro;30m annually is a relatively straightforward process whereas the delivery of  large scale projects from inception to project conclusion has many stages to  complete over a period of up to three years.   The pace at which individual  projects proceed and the pace of expenditure can vary across the different  areas, therefore it is difficult to forecast the particular impact of the  adjustment at individual project level at this stage of the year.</P>
        <P>In that context the reduction of &euro;30m will be applied to the large scale  projects but the impact as I outlined in my reply on 22 April will be mitigated  due primarily to the expected very keen tender prices available in the current  construction market. As I stated after the recent supplementary budget I expect  that all school building projects I&rsquo;ve already announced to go to tender will  proceed this year and that the more competitive environment in the construction  sector will enable me to maximise the return I get for the Government&rsquo;s capital  investment in education.</P>

	<P>My Department has been working closely with the HEA and third level institutions over the last 6 months in seeking to identify ways in which the third level sector can respond to the up-skilling needs of people who are losing their jobs or are facing uncertain employment prospects. This process resulted in the development of a number of new initiatives to support unemployed people engage in up-skilling in the third level sector, as outlined in my response to Question Nos. 720, 721, 722 and 740 of 22 April 2009.</P>
        <P>The purpose of establishing the Higher Education Labour Market Response Group is to provide for a more formal structure to the process that has already been under way in order to further develop the initiatives already announced and to identify other appropriate responses which the third level sector can contribute in this area. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Secretariat to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs is also represented  on the Group. The primary focus of the Group which is chaired by the HEA is on  further developing the specific contribution of the Third level institutions to the activation agenda.</P>
        <P>The Up-skilling Co-ordination Group was established by the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Employment in early 2007 in order to facilitate a more  co-ordinated strategic approach to labour force up-skilling and training policy  and enhance co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies on relevant policy and operational issues. My Department participates in this Group which also includes representatives of FAS, Skillnets, Enterprise Ireland, the City  and County Enterprise Boards, Forfas, the HEA, and the VEC and IoT sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 and 234 together.</P>
        <P>The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</P>
        <P>In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the pro<Col N="510"/>cesses by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</P>
        <P>My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a  net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my  efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts &mdash; a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</P>
        <P>The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position  as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</P>
        <P>Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The application form for appeal is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is  final.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standarised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The identification process was in line with international best practice and had  regard to and employed the existing and most appropriate data sources  available. Primary schools serving rural communities including towns with  populations below 1500 are included in the rural strand of DEIS. The school to  which the Deputy refers is included in this strand.</P>
        <P>The following supports are available to rural DEIS schools: additional capitation allocation based on level of disadvantage; access to the School Meals Programme; access to Home, School, Community Liaison services or access to Rural Co-ordinator; access to planning supports.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that were dissatisfied with their DEIS classification. The review process  operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring  that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly  followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The review <Col N="511"/>was concluded  and the results were notified to schools who applied for the review in August,  2006. There was no application for review received from the school to which the  Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>A new streamlined model for allocating financial supports was devised in 2006  which took account of level of disadvantage and relevant financial supports  already in place and replaced all other models of grants paid to schools under  previous disadvantaged programmes. The grants paid per eligible pupil are based on schools&rsquo; level of disadvantage relative to other schools as identified by  the DEIS identification process. The same rate of grant is paid in respect of  each eligible pupil in both DEIS Urban and DEIS Rural schools.</P>
        <P>The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the  current DEIS programme which runs from 2006-2010. There will not be an  opportunity before this for the school to be considered for reclassification  from rural to urban.</P>

	<P>The survey of over 900 schools carried out by my Department was primarily carried out to consolidate information already available on individual files in order to set up a database of rented accommodation. It also obtained information on purchased prefabricated units in those schools. My Department does not hold records on an electoral area basis. However details sought by the Deputy are included in the following tabular statement which lists all schools renting prefabs in Dublin City and County.</P>
        <P>Separately, arrangements are being made to conduct a survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary level using the Department&rsquo;s recently commissioned Geographical Information System (GIS) and this will establish the position relating to the extent of all accommodation. The specifications for this inventory are being drafted and my Department will be in contact with the education partners in relation to this later this year.</P>
        <P>My Department provides grant aid towards the provision of temporary school  accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is  established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists. Generally,  where schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of Management is  responsible for acquiring such temporary accommodation and the rental contract  is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor.</P>
        <P>Following analysis of costs in my Department, it is now practice to purchase rather than rent temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years. This should reduce the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.</P>
        <P>A review of rental policy is ongoing which will, inter alia, cover an examination of the contract terms to incorporate buy out, buy back, rental costs and relocation options if local circumstances require it. The review will involve an investigation of all existing rental contracts between schools and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of changing market prices.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if there are questions regarding religion and nationality of pupils on the enrolment forms for the new community national schools which are being piloted by his Department; if it is his policy to ask questions on these topics on enrolment forms for all schools here regardless of patronage <Col N="520"/>model; if he will provide a copy of the enrolment form used by the community national schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The new community national schools welcome and respect children of all faiths  and none.  They recognise and aim to accommodate the wishes of parents to have their children receive religious education within the school day and also cater for parents who do not wish their children to receive religious education based on any one particular faith.  Therefore the enrolment form for the community national schools includes questions seeking information on both religion and nationality.  It is not compulsory for the parents to declare their religion or nationality when enrolling children in the schools.  For operational reasons and to assist the evaluation of community national school pilot model, it is helpful to know what religions, faiths and nationalities are represented in the  schools.  The pilot phase provides an opportunity to test approaches to the  practical issues that arise and to draw lessons from that experience that can  allow the model to be developed and refined.</P>
        <P>The matter of the admission/enrolment policy for other schools, is a matter for  the board of management of each individual school, as provided for in the  Education Act 1998, Section 15. A copy of the enrolment form for Scoil Choilm Community National School is set out below.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Paul Connaughton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway is not entitled to free school transport even from a pick up point within the catchment area of Castleblayney; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are difficult problems in this family; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>School transport has been requested for the pupil referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied under the terms of my Department Post-Primary School Transport Scheme and also under the terms of the Transport Scheme for Children with Special Needs.</P>
        <P>The Transport Liaison Officer for Co. Galway has advised my Department that  this pupil is not eligible for transport under the terms of the Post-Primary  Scheme as he resides less than 4.8 kilometres from the nearest school in the  catchment area in which he resides.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education has responsibility, through its  network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for the establishment of special education facilities <Col N="526"/>and for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.</P>
        <P>School transport for children with special needs is generally provided to the  nearest recognised mainstream school, special class/special school or unit that  is, or can be resourced to meet the child&rsquo;s special educational needs under my  Department&rsquo;s criteria.</P>
        <P>The SENO has advised my Department that this pupil is not attending the nearest mainstream school, special class/special school or unit that is, or can be  resourced to meet the child&rsquo;s special educational needs under my Department&rsquo;s  criteria.  Therefore, the question of providing school transport for this pupil does not arise under the terms of both schemes.</P>

        <Qid>242</Qid>
        <asker>Deputy David Stanton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if he will arrange for his Department to make contact with the board of management of a school (details supplied) in County Cork as soon as possible in order to discuss the need to construct four new classrooms; if he will examine the possibility of the board arranging for the construction of these classrooms locally with the assistance of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[17101/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that an application was received for large scale capital funding for an extension/refurbishment project from the School to which he refers. It was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects by my Department and assigned a Band rating of 2.4.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including the project in  question, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and  Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands  on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, an application for Temporary Accommodation has been received.   This application has been considered by my Department and unfortunately was not approved due to tightening economic circumstances and the availability of a  capacity within the school.</P>
        <P>In such times, where schools have alternative accommodation, such as a GP room or library, this should be used as an interim measure.  While the Department accepts that it is not ideal for children to be taught in non-customised accommodation, sometimes, this is unavoidable until more favourable economic circumstances prevail and the Department is in a position to regularise the situation.   The Management Authority of the School has recently been notified of this decision.</P>
