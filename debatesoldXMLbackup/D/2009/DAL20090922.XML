      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The steering group on active citizenship, chaired by Mary Davis and appointed in October 2008, has been overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on active citizenship, which completed its work in March 2007.  The group is working in consultation with the relevant Departments and a progress report was completed in December 2008.  Copies of the progress report are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The report outlines what had been achieved up to the end of last year and the status of those recommendations which will take more time to implement, subject to resources.  In addition, it outlines many active citizenship initiatives being pursued by universities, businesses, volunteer organisations and others which underpin the task force&rsquo;s call to everyone, not just to the Government, to encourage greater connectivity with the community and maximise the potential we all have to generate positive engagement for the greater good.  The Central Statistics Office reported in its recent publication on community involvement and social networking in Ireland that, based on 2006 data, 85% of people agreed that by working together, people in their neighbourhood can influence decisions which affect them.</P>
        <P>The public policy recommendations that have already been progressed include the audit of community, sports and arts facilities, undertaken through the local authorities in 2008.  Up to 27 of the community facilities audits have now been submitted to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with the remaining seven being finalised at <Col N="696"/>present.  The audit will inform the Government on the provision of facilities and identify opportunities for getting the best use of recreational facilities.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs already supports the community and voluntary sectors through a range of funding measures.  In supporting capacity development and training for groups in the sector, the Minister launched a new training grants scheme in 2008 for national and locally based organisations.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs now supports a network of 21 volunteer centres which are linked by a common database and a common best practice approach.  Through these local offices and websites, volunteer centres act as brokers between potential volunteers and organisations seeking volunteers.</P>
        <P>Regarding the recommendation to establish an independent electoral commission, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government engaged consultants to conduct preliminary research on related issues and to recommend a way forward.  The Minister published the report for consultation on 10 February 2009, with a closing date for submissions of 26 June 2009.  The process being followed also includes consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Concerning the task force&rsquo;s recommendations for strengthening local civic participation, its views were taken into account in drafting the Green Paper, Local Government, Stronger Local Democracy: Options for Change.  The Green Paper discussed civic participation in local government decision-making and proposals for considering novel forms of engagement, such as local plebiscites, petition rights and town hall meetings, to address the democratic deficit identified by the task force.  A public consultation process was conducted by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to inform the preparation of a White Paper, which is being finalised for publication following the Government&rsquo;s consideration.</P>
        <P>Arising from consultations conducted by the task force on active citizenship in 2006, the task force report recommended the expansion of education for citizenship in the school and adult education systems.  In response, the National Council for Curriculum Assessment is developing a syllabus for a new leaving certificate examination subject entitled politics and society, as an extension of the current civic, social and political education subject in junior cycle, which gives students practical experience of active citizenship.  With regard to the adult education sector, the possibility of including more voter education into adult programmes in the vocational education committee sector is being further considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Several higher education institutions have developed civic engagement awards which recognise outstanding voluntary activities and achievements by students.  The National University of Ireland, Galway, for example, is leading a national collaboration programme -     Civic Engagement, Student Volunteering and Active Citizenship - to increase opportunities for students to engage with the community through their studies.  Campus Engage was launched in 2008 to allow students to browse volunteer opportunities by region, institution and related academic disciplines.</P>
        <P>The task force&rsquo;s report proposed a national presidential citizens award to recognise outstanding contribution by our citizens to the life of this country.  The options for developing such an awards scheme are being examined in consultation with the relevant authorities, including the Office of the President.</P>
        <P>The progress report not only outlined the public policy elements of the active citizenship initiative, but also highlighted the significant contribution to community life by the business sector.  Examples of community-related activities include corporate giving, employer-supported volunteering and school-based initiatives among others, worthwhile partnerships that will help <Col N="697"/>to sustain us through the challenging times ahead.  At present, the steering group is focusing on plans for an active citizenship conference and active citizenship week during 2010, as well as examining ways in which awareness of active citizenship can be supported through the media, the business sector and professional bodies, as well as Government.</P>
        <P>In view of the need to secure maximum value for scarce resources, I have decided that the work of the steering group will be supported from within my Department and that it is not necessary to maintain a separate office.  The principal actions and policies to support active citizenship are, in any event, the responsibility of a range of Departments and bodies as they implement their respective core functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The task force on active citizenship&rsquo;s latest report states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Community Development Programme provides community premises, development workers and capacity building projects to disadvantaged communities in over 180 locations throughout the country. These projects are primarily in the most disadvantaged communities. They play a significant role in building community infrastructure and enhancing the capacity of their communities.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">How can the Minister of State reconcile that statement with the decision in the budget for 2009 to cut the budget to community development projects by 15%?  Will he avail of the opportunity today to give us a firm assurance that the Government will not adopt and implement the savage cuts of &euro;44 million in funding to community development projects and local partnerships proposed in the McCarthy report in budget 2010?  Does he agree that if they were implemented they would devastate the network of voluntary and community activists who do Trojan work in all our communities?</P>
        <P>Every Member of this House is fully aware, and appreciative, of the major work done in the voluntary and community sector through the supports provided by the community development programmes.  These cover child care, meals on wheels, after-school projects, youth groups, literacy groups, drug rehabilitation and many more areas.  Active citizens provide all these services.  Many of them marched recently in this city in opposition to the cuts proposed in the McCarthy report.  Will the Minister of State give us a guarantee and protect these schemes, recognising that such cuts as well as those proposed for the family resource centres will have devastating consequences for the most needy, disadvantaged and marginalised in our society?  It is incumbent on all of us, irrespective of the current condition of the economy, to ensure that those sections of our community are protected.  Will the Minister of State give us that assurance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware of the debate outside the House about community development projects and family resource centres but as I mentioned in my reply the relevant Departments will bear the main funding of active citizenship projects.  It is a matter therefore for each Department to identify where savings can be achieved in the current economic climate.  This and previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments built up the community development projects in all areas.  In the short time that I was a Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs I saw the very valuable work that the community development projects carry out.  The model developed for delivery of community development projects is one of several that could be used with equal effect for active citizenship and the benefit of citizens.  There are different parts of the country where the integration of community development projects, with RAPID and CL&Aacute;R programmes and others is already working very successfully.  I saw this in the west and Carlow.  It is over a year since I worked in that Department but I have no doubt that local partnerships and their expanded remit can incorporate very <Col N="698"/>successfully and appropriately the work community development projects are doing and will continue to do. I believe that consolidation is probably the way forward for many of them.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will know as well as I do that in some cases there is duplication of effort and outcomes between family resource centre work and community development projects.  More efficient outcomes can be achieved with greater consolidation of resources and integration between local development projects at local level.  The commitment I will give at this stage is that the Government will continue to invest in the concert of local community development.  The models for delivery of that outcome will inevitably change from time to time and from area to area.  That is the definition of local community development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very important.  I noted the statement last week by the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy John Curran, regarding his proposals to bring about integration across the different programmes.  He was specific about this when he spoke in my constituency, Cavan.  Has the Government carried out a real net effect assessment of this proposition?  Will it guarantee the continuation of the range of services and activities that currently enjoy support under the different programmes, or are some at risk as a result of the consolidation about which the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, speaks?  Is this another means of cutting back on the already stated commitment which, as I indicated, was reduced by 15% with respect to community development projects, CDPs, in last year&rsquo;s budget?  What are we looking at in the upcoming budget, other than the adoption of a &euro;44 million reduction, as recommended by McCarthy?  What percentage is the Government currently considering and what are the outcomes and net effect of that?  It will mean further reduction in service provision and supports.  The idea of integration is a smokescreen to cover the Government&rsquo;s real agenda, which is to cut back the funding provision.</P>
        <P>We can look at the task force and the range of recommendations it put forward from which I shall mention a small number.  The Minister of State can pick any one or two of these and tell me the status of the Government&rsquo;s address of the recommendations of the task force.  We are seeing neither the actuality of address of the recommendations nor any stated intent to go forward with any or all of them.  To take the potential for North-South co-operation, for example, in which I am keenly interested, the implementation of the task force recommendations should take account of opportunities to develop pro-actively on an all-island approach.  What about ethnic and cultural diversity and the challenge of engaging newcomers?  What of the proposal to reach by the end of the current decade &mdash; next year &mdash; a level of at least 60% voter turnout among the 18-24 year old age group?  Will we see major improvement in voter turnout on 2 October in the second Lisbon referendum as a result of any action by the Government in following the recommendations of the task force?</P>
        <P>My final two points refer to the establishment of the independent electoral commission and a group insurance scheme open to members of local community and voluntary fora.  This last was one of the recommendations, as was its wide promotion among relevant organisations and groups.  Will the Minister of State give us a progress report on those recommendations of the task force on active citizenship?  Will he take the opportunity today to put at ease the significant concern of people within the CDPs, the partnerships and those in the family resource centres about what might very well be facing them in the budget announcement in December?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department does not have a direct role in delivering any or most of these projects, but nonetheless, as we all know from experience, community development projects have developed.  In my time at that Department, considerable rationalisation was undertaken on community development projects.  I heard criticisms from Members from all sides of <Col N="699"/>the House about the lack of capacity community development projects to deliver the outcomes that they were expected to deliver, without adequate support and without adequate linkages.  Where those linkages exist, be they with area based partnerships or even the local authority, then there are far better outcomes.</P>
        <P>There are excellent models of integration in the Deputy&rsquo;s own constituency which are part of LDSIP for the last three, four or more years.  The Minister of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been heavily involved in that and I know that the Deputy has more than a passing knowledge of what has been attempted and achieved.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also spoke about the group scheme.  The group scheme is still there, with a code of practice that is working extremely well.  There is an intention to change the group scheme which is being negotiated and renewed each year.  The Department appointed consultants to research issues arising from the electoral commission and to recommend a way forward.  The consultants&rsquo; report was received by the Minister late last year.  He subsequently published a consultation report in February 2009, with a closing date of 26 June.  The establishment of the commission will be a major body of work, with issues arising for consideration including international best practice, the commission&rsquo;s structure and functions, whom it reports to, its relationship with other bodies currently involved in the approach to be followed on the extensive legislation that will be required.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised the issue of North-South linkages, and this is one of the areas in which really excellent work is being done.  The Belfast and Dublin education exchange programme is an initiative which takes groups of young people from similar backgrounds on a North South basis, and invites them to meet and discuss common interests.  The civic link project, which was launched in 1999, aims to build positive relationships between young people North and South.  It is an action learning project where young people are forced to explore their own communities and the issues that affect them.  The European studies project is a post-primary school programme that is curriculum with a strong ICT element.  The Washington Ireland programme has been in operation since 1995.  It extends opportunities to promising university students from Northern Ireland and the Republic to partake in summer career training and professional development in the US, mainly in Washington.   However, I happened to be in Milwaukee earlier this year and I met four people from Northern Ireland and four from the South of Ireland working there and discussing issues to do with event management and so on.  I certainly was extremely proud of them, and I would invite any Member to meet with them.  The Irish Peace Institute is an NGO committed to the just and peaceful transformation of violent conflict.  Its projects involve bands performing together from cross-community and cross-Border schools over a three day period.</P>
        <P>These are just some of the examples of the initiatives that have been taken, not directly by my Department, but by a number of other Departments.  The Depaul Trust is a project in this city that has been ongoing for a number of years.  It particularly targets those people who do not register or, if they do, do not participate in the electoral process.  That has been quite successful.  It works in my own constituency.  I have seen it in Finglas and Ballymun.  I certainly know it works in Tallaght and in other places throughout this city.  I am sure it operates elsewhere also.  It is not fair to say these recommendations and suggestions by the task force are not being followed through.  There is no doubt that some require further resources.  However, there is a strong commitment on my part and that of the steering committee to progress every recommendation as well as possible.</P>
        <P>Some discussions recently took place with the President&rsquo;s office regarding a President&rsquo;s award and how it could be progressed further.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="700"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to appear cynical about the task force on active citizenship.  However, prior to the 2007 general election there was a great fanfare when the task force was established.  Very little has been done since the publication of the task force report.</P>
        <P>Deputy Carey, as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, is responsible for the task force.  How many meetings has he had with the task force or the review group since becoming Government Chief Whip?  The report recommended a new honours system which would recognise outstanding contributions by individuals to Irish society and would be part of a wide-ranging plan to promote higher levels of civic engagement.  We all know how important this is for community and voluntary activists.  Can the Minister of State give the House an update on this?  The report recommended that a national presidential citizens award be awarded to a limited number of people selected annually through an independent process based on nominations from members of the public.  Could the Minister of State provide the House with further detail of this worthy project and tell us exactly how it has progressed to date?  This is only one part of the task force&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>Deputy Carey also spoke about community and development projects and said the Government has built them up in recent years.  I do not disagree.  However, the Government is now pulling them asunder.  It was all very well to throw money at worthy projects when it was available.  Deputy Carey says many of these projects are now duplicated.  His Department should look at the productivity and efficiency of these projects.  Why has he not done so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the number of meetings, the steering committee met in November of last year and in January, April and July of this year.  A further meeting will take place before the end of this month.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the President&rsquo;s award scheme briefly.  Initial discussions have taken place between officials from the office of the President and from my Department.  Further discussions will take place on issues such as the selection process and criteria for the awards over the coming months.  I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of those meetings but they are being actively pursued.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I come from a very strong community development and youth work background.  I have seen many community development projects being set up.  Some have ceased to operate voluntarily because they have decided their remit no longer exists or that there are other community needs to be met.  That is the essence of the community development process.  Something which suits today and is fit for today&rsquo;s purpose will almost certainly have to be modified and adapted for the future. That is what we have been trying to do with the partnerships and the community development projects.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, many Members of this House were very persistent in asking that something be done about them. Of the intermediary bodies between the Department and the projects on the grounds, some were worthwhile whereas many were past their sell by dates, although they did good work when they were first set up.  I am long enough in this business and can see some people present who were directly or indirectly involved during the days in which these projects were set up under the Combat Poverty pilot projects.  A colleague of Labour Party Members, their late leader, Frank Cluskey, was instrumental in setting them up in 1973 or 1974.  They have developed over the years.  The model that works in Tallaght will not always work in Tubbercurry.  The one that works in Finglas might not work in, for example, Falcarragh. </P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>When Muintir na T&iacute;re was the leading community development organisation and Macra na Feirme and so forth were funded by the Kellogg Foundation, the Nuffield Foundation and others, those projects were always in experimental mode.  Through a variety of project types, we have come a long way in refining and improving outcomes that make life better for every<Col N="701"/>one, not just those in disadvantaged communities.  It has always bothered me that community development projects tend to be linked with disadvantage.  The process of community development is as valid in an upper middle class area as in an area of high unemployment.  Consolidation, redevelopment and restructuring of community development projects give us one part of that.  What the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, and the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, are doing in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs fits this objective perfectly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>How many volunteer centres are there, where are they located and what are they doing?  A pilot project in which schools would be used by communities after hours was mentioned.  Will the Minister of State provide Deputies with a list of where those schools are and what is the situation?  Has the report on the implementation of the steering group&rsquo;s work been published?  It was promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>

	<P>It was on the use of schools after hours and when the report will be implemented or published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the use of schools, discussions between management bodies and the Department of Education and Science are ongoing.  It is an area in which there has been some progress, but not enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any list?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is outrageous.  Good buildings are being closed after 3 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Through the Chair, I agree with Deputy Barrett.  For a long time, organisations have been working to try to ensure a greater use.  The Catholic archdiocese of Dublin <Col N="702"/>has developed a model in which schools are being used to a greater extent than previously.  I am trying to put my hands on the figure for the number of volunteer centres.  I have it, but I will supply it as soon as I put my finger on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State can send it to us tomorrow. What we are discussing is the task force on active citizenship.  It was the brainchild of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who decided a task force should be established in Ireland on having read a book on the subject by some American guru.  There was a report in 2007.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his verbose answers.  He has used more than the time allowed for nearly all the questions, without giving us any information at all.  He spoke about other Departments and not about the subject.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008, &euro;200,000 was provided for the task force but it did not spend any money at all.  I therefore presume it did nothing.  This year, the Government, recognising the fact that it was doing nothing, reduced the allocation to &euro;56,000, which is not a huge sum.  I do not know whether the task force has done anything at all yet this year.  An bord snip cast its eye on it and decided it should be abolished.  I am partly of the view that an bord snip might be right.  The Minister of State obviously believes it is right because he is now trying to hive off all the responsibility for the task force to every Department in the State except his own.  The section in his own Department will no longer exist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have had a talking shop task force with no money.  Perhaps that is why the Minister of State got into the habit of doing so much talking.  Maybe he had been listening to the taskforce, which did nothing at all except talking.  All the good phenomena to which the Minister referred, including volunteerism, existed before the task force was conceived.  It has grown in the face of the recession.  The volunteers I know who are working in the community, including on community development projects, do not even know the task force exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Do they know about <i>Bowling Alone</i>?  Did they read that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Bowling together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State has been talking about many issues but he gave one very good example of Fianna F&aacute;il preparation for the axe when referring to community development projects.  He stated how they have to evolve and that sometimes evolution includes disappearance off the face of the earth.  The latter is the case because the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department will not provide organisations with the required money.  It is all about money but the Minister of State did not provide any money for the taskforce.  None of the recreational facilities was provided through the task force.  It was through other agencies and local campaigns therefor.  There is no sign of citizenship awards, as proposed by Deputy Durkan.  Perhaps the Minister gave a few bob out of the &euro;56,000 to prepare the report in that regard.  I suppose that is what that money was for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister may be correct in stating the task force is a waste of money and time, and that he has dispensed with it and scattered whatever is left of it around the other Departments.  Will he confirm it is dead so we will not have to spend another three quarters of an hour in six months repeating the same questions?</P>

	<P>On the basis of my having read the record from the last time I had to answer these questions, Deputy Stagg is at least consistent.  His questions are very much the <Col N="703"/>same.  The Deputy&rsquo;s views are typical of Labour Party policy.  When we save money we are criticised for it and when we spend it we are criticised for it. </P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer that in a second.</P>
        <P>Funding of specific activities will be made by other Departments where the activities are relevant to them.  Otherwise, I am confident the corporate sector will continue to give extensive support to projects, as it does at present.  I am certain that Deputy Stagg has read page 74 and previous pages, including the material on the plan for the way forward.  Having done so, he will know how active the corporate sector is in that area.</P>

	<P>I have no doubt the Deputy did.  I hope he did not smoke too many of the usuals.  I appreciate we are in a difficult economic climate but the ethos of corporate social responsibility is strongly embedded in our corporate sector.  Long may it continue.  Deputy Stanton should note that there are 21 volunteer centres located throughout the country, five of which are based in Dublin, namely, the south Dublin county, Dublin city south, Dublin city north, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown and Fingal centres.  They provide a very important service and the audit which the volunteer centres of Ireland has carried out shows the level of volunteering has increased very significantly in the past year or 18 months.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that if there were a proper local government system there would be no need for all these different groups, bodies, offices and everything else?  Would he consider discussing with his colleagues in Government the restructuring of the whole local government system and incorporating all of these volunteers, who have vast experience, into that system?</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy when he suggests that what may be suitable in one area may not be suitable in others.  A danger is that when this is administered on a national basis everyone gets the same, whereas if there were a local government system each local government could decide what is suitable for its particular area.  The sooner we get down to examining local government, extending its powers and incorporating much of the good work of these organisations into a properly funded local government system, the better for everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett comes from a local authority background as do I.  During the past year I have been following the work of both the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy John Curran, and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv.  Throughout the country there is an increasing level of integration of these initiatives which are a spin off of local authorities &mdash; there is no doubt about that.  They are being brought closer to the centre of local authorities.  There is an issue or debate concerning the powers which local authorities ought to be given <Col N="704"/>and I believe many of these issues will form part of the debate on the Green Paper which has been issued by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and I have no doubt they will be developed further in the White Paper on the future of local government.  We look forward to a debate, whether it is under this area of questions or wherever, and it would be worthwhile to have this debate nationally.</P>

        <Quest>  the number of prisoner places available in each prison here; the number of prisoners currently in each prison; and his plans to address overcrowding in prisons in the short, medium and long term.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that as of 17 September 2009 there were 3,947 permanent beds available in the prison system.  On the same day there were 3,904 prisoners in custody.  This represented an occupancy level of 99%.  The table circulated with this reply provides a breakdown of the population of each prison and place of detention.  There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in recent years.  This situation has been particularly apparent in the past 12 months during which the total number in custody has increased by 306.  This represents an 8.5% rise in the number in custody.</P>
        <P>There are a number of reasons for this increase.  With the extra resources provided by this Government, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been increasingly successful in prosecuting criminals and extra court sittings have resulted in higher committal rates.  The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure.  This has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997, in excess of 1,400 additional spaces have been introduced in the prison system including a new accommodation block for 100 prisoners recently opened at Castlerea Prison.  Furthermore, current projects will also provide the potential for an additional 450 prison spaces during 2009 by means of a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners; a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will also have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners; and opening the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison which will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the longer term, the Government recently reaffirmed its commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, and approved the launching of a new tendering process for the construction of a more affordable and better value prison campus at Thornton.  The revised plans for the new prison complex aim to provide good quality, regime focused accommodation with appropriate support and rehabilitation facilities to prepare prisoners for reintegration back into society.  The new facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a range of security settings.  There are also long-term plans to replace Cork prison with a new prison at Kilworth.</P>
        <P>The design, tendering for and construction of a large prison complex is a lengthy process.  It will be two to three years after signing a contract before Thornton Hall would be available. <Col N="705"/> Consideration is being given to expanding capacity at the Midlands prison if further spaces are required before Thornton Hall enters into operation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures given to the House by the Minister have been well massaged and cooked either by himself or somebody close to him.  He is complicit in massaging the figures, which do not show the true picture.  There are 3,947 prison spaces in the country currently and he has conveniently said that 3,904 are occupied.</P>
        <P>The Minister also conveniently neglected to inform the House that over 600 people sentenced to prison by the courts independently of the Minister&rsquo;s office are on temporary release.  The number of prisoners on temporary release runs at three times the average for the past number of years at this time.  People are being released from prison without having served their sentence because the Minister has failed in his duty to provide appropriate prison spaces for those persons convicted of serious charges and sent to prison by order of the court.</P>
        <P>The Minister has repeatedly made promises to the Houses regarding sufficient prison spaces.  I welcome what has been done in Castlerea, which formed part of a four-pronged commitment given to the House earlier this year, three parts of which remain unfulfilled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no massaging of figures and I get a daily update of numbers, which I ask for, from officials.  As of 22 September, the occupancy rate is 99% and the figure for those on temporary release is 545.  That is in the region of 12% or 13%.  There is a difficulty in our prisons and that is one of the reasons I have moved very rapidly to ensure we get as many prison spaces as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Law Reform Commission report today on debtors and currently there are no debtors in our prisons.  All of us would welcome that and I want to ensure the position continues.  I look forward to bringing forward legislative proposals in that regard.  Equally, the fines Bill is nearing fruition and I will propose to the Oireachtas in that Bill that we have a number of options before the issue of imprisonment as a result of fines occurs.  I want to reach a <Col N="706"/>position where nobody will be imprisoned because of debt or fines.  We must consider new and imaginative ways of collecting fines.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has correctly raised the issue of bench warrants from time to time.  Many of these relate to a case where a conviction and fine have been levelled at somebody and the judge would make an order regarding three months in default of payment of the fine, for example.  I am looking at new ways and we are looking to bring out a debt collection agency; a procurement for the collection of fines.  We are also considering giving the Judiciary a better option for community service, as there is quite significant capacity in the probation service.  We are looking to insist that before somebody is sent to prison for non-payment of a fine, in particular, all options would be used.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I want our prison spaces to be used purely and simply for those who deserve to be imprisoned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow a brief supplementary from Deputy Flanagan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Temporary release has always been part of sentence management in the Prison Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The time allowed for the answer has elapsed.  I will allow a brief supplementary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot hear what the Chair is saying because the Minister is continuing to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should allow the Deputy to ask a brief supplementary.  We are well over time on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment that there are no persons in prison today for the non-payment of debts.  How many deportees are currently in prison?</P>
        <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Judge Michael Reilly, which paints a most grim and bleak picture of our prisons?  In the course of his report, Judge Reilly refers to the fact that the extent of overcrowding in our prisons is far worse than the indication provided by the prison authorities.  Has the Minister considered providing a response to Judge Reilly&rsquo;s quite damning report?  Would it be possible to make time available so that the House might give consideration to the comments of Judge Reilly, who has, in an unprecedented way, painted a rather shocking picture of Irish prisons in 2009?  The report to which I refer will surely spur the Minister into taking the long-promised action of replacing Mountjoy Prison and other Dickensian institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ironic that in the past I was berated for trying to promote the building of a prison at Thornton Hall.  I am glad, however, that the Deputy now appears to accept the need to replace Mountjoy with a prison at that location.  I had been under the impression that he and Fine Gael were opposed to the building of a prison at Thornton Hall.</P>
        <P>I deserve at least some credit for the fact that between now and the end of the year 450 additional prison spaces will be made available.  I have always stated that the project at Thornton Hall is long term in nature.  As indicated in my initial reply, I have already asked my officials to see if some additional capacity can be put in place at the Midlands Prison.</P><Col N="707"/>
        <P>I met Judge Reilly on two occasions last week.  We met at Castlerea and then at my Department, for a lengthy discussion on various issues including that to which the Deputy refers.  I make no attempt to hide the fact that a difficulty exists in our prisons.  As I have often stated on Question Time, we are the victims of our own success.  In view of the additional garda&iacute;, judges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>And the fact that there is more crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and court hearings, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of prisoners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In the number of criminals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This is due to the success of our law enforcement agencies.  Ultimately, we must respond to this development.  I accept that the practice of imprisoning people for the non-payment of fines should end.  In effect, many of those individuals are brought to Mountjoy or elsewhere, a great deal of paperwork is done and they are released within 24 hours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must proceed to the next question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not acceptable and I have informed my officials of that fact.  I want us to reach a situation where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those people are not among the 600 individuals who are currently at large.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>They are and a number of them would be included in the overall figures.  It is important that the House should send out a strong signal that it does not want people to be imprisoned for the non-payment of fines.  We must consider other ways of collecting fines.</P>

        <Quest>  if all sections of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, have been brought into operation; the number of occasions on which the powers contained in the Act have been used since its enactment; the number of prosecutions transferred to the Special Criminal Court under the provisions of section 8 of the Act; the number of charges that have proffered under the powers contained in the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31683/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>All sections of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 are in operation.  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that compiling statistics in respect of Part 4 of the Act, which deals with detentions and arrest, would require an examination of manual records and thus require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that, prior to a renewal of the provisions dealing with the use of the Special Criminal Court, a report must be laid before the Oireachtas and said report will, in due course, contain all relevant information in this regard.  However, the legislation in question was only signed into law on 23 July and it would be completely unrealistic to expect that by this stage people would have been charged, tried and convicted under it.  It was precisely because there is an inevitable timelag between legislation coming into force and its yielding results that I was so anxious to have the legislation, together with that relating to surveillance, <Col N="708"/>enacted before the summer recess.  If this had not been done, in the past couple of months, the Garda would have been deprived of the opportunity to take action designed to lead to convictions under both items of legislation.  That is exactly what the Garda has been doing.</P>
        <P>Against the background of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, the Garda has launched a series of operations designed to disrupt the activities of gangs and gather evidence for use under the new legislative measures.  Information relating to some of those operations, which involved raids and searches, are in the public domain.  However, it would clearly be counterproductive to give details in respect of surveillance operations.  The House will understand that it is not helpful to offer a running detailed public commentary on action that the Garda is taking against specific gangs.  What I can say publicly is that I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to use to the full the measures, which the Oireachtas passed just prior to the summer recess, to support it in its efforts to counteract the activities of these gangs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no reference to a timelag in any of the newspaper cuttings from the period prior to the summer recess.  All I can see are headlines inspired by the Minister to the effect that 300 crime bosses were to be rounded up and that crime bosses would flee to the &ldquo;costa del crime&rdquo;.  There are several references to the fact that as soon as the President had signed the legislation into law, these people would have been rounded up.  I have only one brief question to put to the Minister.  Will he indicate to the House the number of referrals there have been to the Special Criminal Court since the legislation was enacted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am of the view that the Deputy may, perhaps, suffer from a misapprehension with regard to how legislation is enacted.  The legislation in question was only brought into force on 23 July.  The Deputy and others said that we should not pass this legislation and that there should be further analysis and discussion in respect of it.  He stated that the courts would not be sitting in July and August and that there would be ample time in which to debate the legislation further.  However, the reality is that criminal law legislation cannot be enforced retrospectively.  It was my intention, therefore, to bring this law into force as soon as possible following its passage through the Houses so the Garda could apprehend and investigate people.</P>
        <P>The Deputy does me a disservice when he states that various articles appeared in the newspapers at my instigation.  The latter is most certainly not the case.  From discussions with the Garda Commissioner and other senior officers, I am aware that the force has been extremely active in respect of the implementation and use of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act.  In light of the fact that these items of legislation, particularly the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, relate to significantly new legal terrain, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was obliged to ensure that its officers received the best legal training and advice in respect of these two Acts, under which they will be obliged to prosecute individuals in the future.  Work has been ongoing in this regard since the Acts came into force.</P>
        <P>As recent media reports indicated, a major conference on Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na activity relating to these two items of legislation &mdash; at which senior members of Garda management were present &mdash; took place in Templemore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must take a brief supplementary from Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is doing the House a disservice because he is well aware of the answer to his question, namely, that there have been no prosecutions to date under the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, which only came into force on 23 July.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="709"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe I am doing the House a disservice at all.  The Minister did it a disservice when he engaged in what was a political stunt designed to lead unfortunate victims of crime to believe that if the law were passed and if referrals were made to the Special Criminal Court under its provisions, the crime bosses responsible for directing criminal activity in this country would be locked up.  However, he has now informed the House that no one has been locked up.  The Minister would not facilitate the Bill being referred to the relevant committee during the summer recess so that some of the nuances and detail relating to it might have been dealt with at length.  I am, therefore, under no misapprehension with regard to this matter.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposition that the Minister did not inspire the headlines to which I refer is certainly not believed by me.  He is no mean hand at garnering headlines.  Someone drew my attention to a headline in last weekend&rsquo;s <i>Irish Mail on Sunday</i> which clearly indicates that the succession race is under way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have now established that no crime bosses have been put behind bars as a result of this mechanism for referrals to the Special Criminal Court.  Will the Minister indicate what he means when he states that elements of the Act are being used by the Garda to prepare cases?  A couple of very important convictions have taken place since the House rose for the summer recess, but these were secured under the normal system of criminal justice.  Is it not the case that the evidence which must be adduced in normal criminal courts must also be adduced in the Special Criminal Court and that it is in respect of this area that a difficulty arises in the context of putting certain crime overlords into prison?</P>
        <P>When Members return for the Minister&rsquo;s next Question Time, he should be able to show them some progress on foot of the brouhaha and the storm he kicked up about the necessity to put the normal criminal justice system into suspension and to invoke the powers of the Special Criminal Court.  He should be able to show some progress as a result because none has been evident thus far.</P>

For someone who is a spokesperson on justice and who should have some experience on how court cases are managed and Garda files are put together, the Deputy shows total ignorance as to how a court action is prepared.  The Deputy must be doing so tongue in cheek because he is well aware that within a month or two of the passage of legislation, particularly of this magnitude and import, it is completely unreasonable to expect the Garda to have brought a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions pertaining to it.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Charles Flanagan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the number of community garda&iacute; assigned to each county that borders Northern Ireland; his views on whether an absence of community garda&iacute; may be creating space for vigilantes to operate; and the steps he proposes to take to address vigilante activity in Border areas.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31686/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there currently is no evidence of vigilante activity in any of the Garda divisions on the Border with Northern Ireland.  The Deputy may be referring to a newspaper report from earlier this year relating to local concern in a part of County Donegal about burglaries but local garda&iacute; have worked with the community to ensure an effective and proper response to that particular pattern of burglaries and they have since ceased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy asked about the number of community garda&iacute; currently assigned to each of the Garda divisions and I am informed there are nine garda&iacute; in Cavan-Monaghan, three sergeants and 32 garda&iacute; in Donegal, two sergeants and ten garda&iacute; in Louth and two sergeants and 18 garda&iacute; in Sligo-Leitrim.  This makes a total of 76 garda&iacute; who are currently dedicated to community policing in these divisions.  These garda&iacute; play an important part in combating crime in local communities and the role generally of community garda&iacute; is to be considerably enhanced by the Garda Commissioner under a new national model of community policing.  However, policing in local communities and combating crime in particular is a matter for all garda&iacute; and not simply those assigned to the roles of community policing, which is a point highlighted in a recent report of the Garda Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>In the case of the areas mentioned by the Deputy, a crime management team has been appointed in each of the Garda divisions to analyse headline crime in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service.  Funding received from the Operation Anvil budget also has been utilised to introduce specific operations to counteract criminal activity in the region.  Co-ordinated checkpoints are conducted utilising traffic garda&iacute;, the detective branch and regular uniformed garda&iacute;.  A number of community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes are in existence and mountain bike units have been established in each division.</P>
        <P>It also is the case that a significant level of cross-Border co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland takes place.  There are regular cross-Border crime meetings and at station level, there is daily communication regarding individual crimes and criminals.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that in the event of anyone attempting any type of vigilante activity, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take strong and effective action in response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to ensure that such action will be both strong and effective and that he might visit this issue with the Garda Commissioner at the earliest opportunity.  Lest the Minister is under the impression that there is no vigilante activity along the Border, I put to him the direct link between such vigilante activity, that is, people taking the law into their own hands, and an upsurge of dissident republican activity along the Border.  There was an improvised bomb in County Donegal on 10 September that was made safe by Army bomb disposal experts.  The Real IRA planted two pipe bombs in Derry on 11 September.  &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann was behind a 600 lbs bomb that was defused at Forkhill, County Armagh on 8 September, the command wire of which was located in this jurisdiction.  There have been other unsettling developments in recent times, including reports that the dissident republican 32 County Sovereignty Movement has been active in counties Cavan, Fermanagh and Donegal and most recently in County Cork.  Is the Minister aware of Internet <Col N="712"/>chat forums of a horrendous nature that seek to recruit young people into the 32 County Sovereignty Movement?  The Minister should have his officials examine these Internet film clips, which show the most disgusting, horrendous and outrageous violent activities to have taken place in Ireland over the past 30 years.  This is a real and serious issue that is directly linked to the vigilante activity whereby leaflets have been distributed in Border counties and as recently as last week in County Cork.  The Minister should take this matter seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While we are dealing with two different issues, I do not underestimate the issue of dissident activity, either in Border areas or further afield.  There is no doubt that this is the case.  However, a general point regarding Border areas is there has been a 10% decrease in crime between 2008 and the first two quarters of 2009, from 14,774 to 13,430 occurrences.  Moreover, there has been a realignment of divisional areas whereby all Border areas now are under the aegis of a single assistant commissioner, whose headquarters is based in County Cavan.  Deputy McHugh of Fine Gael acknowledged in this House last week that while there was a problem in County Donegal, due to the excellent work of the Garda with the local community, this now has ceased.</P>
        <P>As for the other issues to which the Deputy referred, of course the Garda and I are aware of them.  However, I strongly suggest the Deputy should be careful not to publicise the issue of dissident activity, because they undoubtedly constitute a serious threat to our society on both sides of the Border.  However, I caution that the Deputy should be careful about giving undue attention to this issue.  While I do not suggest he is doing so on purpose, this tends to publicise their activities rather than trying to contain them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a daily basis, one hears from the Garda top brass of the effect that enforced Garda retirements arising from Government policy is having within the higher echelons of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister should assure the House there will be no switching of personnel who are involved in intelligence gathering from Border areas and that any retirements will be filled immediately to prevent dissident republican groups from engaging in the type of activity now suggested by anecdotal evidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deployment is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management.  However, I am assured by the Commissioner that there has been no diminution of activity by the Garda in Border areas, despite the relative peace that has obtained in the area.  The Garda and the PSNI are conscious of the increased activity of the dissidents in those areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has activity increased?  The Minister has told the House that it has not or that if it has, he does not wish Members to speak about it or acknowledge it.  Has there been such an increase?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Governments have acknowledged there has been an increase and that there is an increased threat in respect of dissident activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>What specific measures has the Minister introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the reason that in the North in particular, the threat level in respect of the potential to create damage has been raised to &ldquo;severe&rdquo;.  This is the reason the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is highly active in Border areas in particular to ensure such activities do not take place.  This has been acknowledged by the former PSNI commissioner, Mr. Hugh Orde.</P><Col N="713"/>
        <P>At the end of this year the number of garda&iacute; will reach an all-time high, some 14,800, with another 400 or 500 to be attested in the following year.  It is accepted that there were a significant number of retirements but one must give credit to the significant increase in the number of garda&iacute;.  Despite suggestions that we should take away large numbers of garda&iacute; from the Border Garda stations, there has been a significant increase in the number of garda&iacute; in Border areas.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Charles Flanagan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the reason suspects subject to European arrest warrants were released in 2008 due to processing delays; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31688/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The three cases referred to by the Deputy were reported by Ireland in response to an EU questionnaire on the operation of the European arrest warrant.  In two of the cases, the subjects were released in 2008 and the third subject was released in March 2009.  The three subjects were released because the issuing authority in the country that sought the extradition failed, in each case, to collect the subjects within the statutory time limit.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended, a person whose surrender has been ordered by the High Court must be surrendered to the requesting state within ten days from the date the order takes effect.  The Act provides for an extension of the time limit in circumstances where a date is agreed between the issuing authority and the Irish central authority for the European arrest warrant.  The courts in this jurisdiction have ruled that applications for such extensions must be made to the courts and that the issuing authorities must show good reason why it was not possible to collect the subject within the time limit.  If no extension is sought or, if sought, the extension is refused, the subject must be released on expiration of the order.  In each of the three cases in question, the Irish central authority notified the issuing authorities of the order for surrender and the time limit in accordance with standard procedures.  In each case, the issuing authority was unable to collect the subject within the statutory time limit.</P>
        <P>Following legal proceedings in two of the cases, the courts ordered release of the subjects on the grounds that the reasons advanced by the issuing authorities for failure to collect within the time-limit were not sufficient.  The courts are, subject to the law and the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their functions and it is not open to me to make any comment on these proceedings.  In the third case, the subject was released on legal advice after the issuing authority failed to respond to the Irish central authority.</P>
        <P>In a response to the Deputy last week in this matter, I stated that the courts had ordered release in all three cases.  I am now advised, however, that legal proceedings seeking an extension were not, in fact, commenced in the third case as the issuing authority failed to provide any response to the central authority&rsquo;s notification and, therefore, there was no need to bring the matter before the courts as the issue of an extension did not arise.  I regret this error but it does not change the substance of my reply.  Since the European Arrest Warrant Act came into force, Ireland has surrendered 234 persons on foot of warrants.</P>
        <P>The central authority has raised the issue of non-collection with the authorities of a particular member state.  In response, the authorities in the state concerned have assured the Irish authorities that subjects will be collected on time.  The central authority will continue to monitor the situation and take action as appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Council of Europe report recently singled out this country as being somewhat less than vigilant in dealing with these issues.  Of all countries in the EU, only <Col N="714"/>Slovenia, Poland, Sweden on one occasion and Ireland attracted criticism.  What is the reason for this?  Why does the report pick Ireland out as the country with the worst record in processing?  Is this a resource issue and why is there a delay?  If matters are such that there is no culpability on the part of Ireland, why has the Council of Europe not been so informed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see difficulties in respect of Ireland.  Everything is subject to the adjudication of the courts in respect of this and people are entitled to take cases.  We may have a different system to some of the comparative countries in Europe.  Unlike a number of member states, Ireland can provide required information more quickly.  Regarding the portent of this question, it was a failure of another member state to collect the people involved within the time limit specified.  One country has accepted that it must endeavour to produce the information required within the time limit.  When people challenge the European arrest warrant it must go to the court, which makes an adjudication in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A review of the current framework for the acquisition of Irish citizenship is under way in my Department.  Statutory provisions for the acquisition of Irish citizenship are contained in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  While the provisions of that Act have been amended on a number of occasions, in 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004, to take account of significant policy developments in the State, it is now timely to look again at those provisions having regard to our recent immigration experience. </P>
        <P>The review will consider a wide range of issues relating to the current statutory framework as well as other administrative arrangements in the granting of citizenship.  Among the issues to be considered are eligibility periods for naturalisation, appropriate language and integration tests, proposals for a citizenship ceremony, as well as methods by which the current application procedures can be improved.  Many countries have adopted integration, culture and language tests along with a number of other concepts such as earned citizenship in conjunction with longer residency requirements.</P>
        <P>The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, which is currently before the House, contains significant proposals that will overhaul our immigration legislation.   It will therefore be necessary to ensure that any new proposals on citizenship link with the policies outlined in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>The review is currently under way in my Department and will be progressed in consultation with the office of the Minister with responsibility for integration.  I expect to publish the review in 2010 and the review will be subject to public consultation before final proposals are pub<Col N="715"/>lished.  In conducting a review of our citizenship requirements it must be remembered that the granting of an Irish citizenship application by the State is a privilege for its recipient, not an entitlement.  It cannot be regarded as being automatically awarded to applicants who have simply been lawfully resident in the State for a specified length of time.  On the contrary, naturalisation should be seen as a major and mutual commitment by the prospective citizen and the State.  It is entirely appropriate in those circumstances that the State should require that the applicant demonstrates a real commitment to the nation.  It is with this overarching principle in mind that the review is being conducted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments and I am glad that some progress is being made.  Everyone accepts that the 1956 legislation is completely outdated.  There is nothing to prohibit someone who does not have a word of English and no understanding of Irish culture, society or the voting system being granted citizenship in this country.  The changes taking place in respect of residency are creating anomalies.  The changes to the residency fees made this summer mean that the only difference between long-term residency and citizenship in this country is &euro;450 and a one month waiting period.  This means that citizenship is a meaningless system in this country.  In light of the changes proposed in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill it will be more difficult to get long-term residency than citizenship.  What is the timeline for delivering these reforms?  What should be the timeline for the processing of citizenship and residency applications?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The timeline for the publication of the review is 2010 and it will be subject to consultation thereafter.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act dates from 1956 but it was amended in 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004.  We are considering the possibility of amending it further based on recent trends.  I accept that anyone who wants to become an Irish citizen must have a period of residency.  The conditions under the legislation are comprehensive and that is as it should be.</P>
        <P>We examined the issue of fees and the equivalent fee for citizenship in the UK is &pound;820 and while there was no fee for long-term residency here in the UK it was approximately &pound;800.  I felt that given the significant level of paperwork on behalf of the State for these applications and that a long-term residency application is the final step on the way to becoming an Irish citizen, it was only right and proper that the taxpayer should get some recompense for it and some payment be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Long-term residency is not related to the citizenship law as it stands at present and that is part of the anomaly.  I accept the point made by the Minister on the cost of processing these applications but if people are paying &euro;500 for long-term residency applications and &euro;900 for citizenship applications surely they should have an indication of the timeline for the completion of the application process?  Does the Minister believe it is acceptable that people must wait 24 months for the processing of those applications?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the benefits of the decentralisation of the citizenship application process to Tipperary is that there has been a reduction in the overall time by approximately six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This year and probably next year there will be a considerable spike in the number of applications for citizenship because people will qualify under the residency conditions.  We will deal with that and we have a new computerised system in Tipperary which turns around cases much quicker than heretofore.  However, there will be a delay.  This is not something that one can just buy; it is a privilege and these decisions are not taken lightly.  For the information of the House, in the nine months to the end of August 8,162 cases were dealt with and of those 5,250 were approved, 671 were refused and 2,241 were ineligible.  That is an increase on previous years.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the progress made by the casino gaming control section of his Department in its review of gambling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31473/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I have initiated a wide-ranging review of gambling, the objective of which is to provide Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing the gambling architecture in the State.  The casino gaming control section of my Department will be responsible for bringing forward proposals, including a draft Bill for a revised gambling code.</P>
        <P>Consultation is an essential part of the review currently under way.   The control section of my Department, through a public information notice in daily newspapers and on my Department&rsquo;s website, invited submissions from interested parties and members of the public.  The closing date for the receipt of submissions is 30 September.</P>
        <P>The gaming control section is, as a consequence, consulting widely with stakeholders &mdash; statutory, NGO and the private sector &mdash; and with the community at large before bringing forward any proposals.  My Department will, with the benefit of the consultation process and on the receipt of submissions, develop legislative proposals based on three important considerations which are the hallmark of most well regulated gambling codes.  These are that young people and the vulnerable are protected; that gambling should in all respects be fairly and openly conducted; and that gambling is kept free of crime.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that developing a revised gambling code that is capable of generating broad public support is a complex task.  Notwithstanding that, I have instructed the control section in my Department to make every effort to provide me with policy options for a new gambling architecture by the end of the year which will include proposals for a draft Bill on the subject.  Ultimately, it will be for Government to decide the policy approach to be legislated for in this area.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in tandem with the review of gambling, I decided that the private members&rsquo; clubs at which gambling activities are carried on will have to comply with relevant anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation.  On 28 July, I published the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Bill 2009 which will transpose the third EU money laundering directive into Irish Law.  I expect that the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Bill 2009 will be considered by the Oireachtas as a priority this session.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have shirked their responsibility on this issue.  The Minister has taken up the baton and is driving it on, in fairness to him.  What protections does the Minister envisage for young people and for those with gambling problems in the forthcoming legislation?  What other measures does the Minister envisage to remove criminal elements from the use of casinos?  Will the Minister comment on an industry report which concluded that &euro;280 million will be generated for the economy as a result of regulation of casinos?  That report also stated that 13,000 jobs would be created by 2020.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that Fianna F&aacute;il has shirked its responsibility.  Previously in the House I stated that all political parties, whenever they were in Government, veered away from this area because of the difficulties from a legislative point of view.  People in this country are operating under very old legislation, which is out of date.  It behoves us to move forward.  The Deputy may be aware that we tried to have all-party agreement on how to proceed on this but unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Has that been scrapped?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, because the Deputy&rsquo;s party leader would not participate and neither would the Labour Party in what was originally an understanding under my predecessor.  I have asked my officials to proceed and the public has shown a significant level of interest in the consultation process which we advertised.  I have asked my officials to bring forward policy options by the end of the year and I hope to bring a draft Bill to the Government following that.</P>

	<P>Is it not the case and does the Minister not understand well that the reason the all-party committee did not get off the ground was because there was an attempt by his predecessor, in conjunction with the then Minister for Finance, to use an all-party committee as a cover to introduce fixed odds betting terminals, FOBTs, into bookies&rsquo; shops in the Republic of Ireland?  If the Minister understands that, and I think he does, I offer my congratulations to him for being persuaded of the campaign that I ran in this House and outside it against the introduction of FOBTs into bookies&rsquo; shops because of the damage they do to feckless young people.  Does the Minister understand that the purpose of that campaign was not to thwart or delay legislation to regulate the casino sector?  Responsible law-abiding people in the casino sector want to be regulated and cannot understand why it is taking so long.  Will the Minister tell them when, approximately, we are likely to see the publication of such a Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>For the second time today, Deputy Rabbitte has done a disservice to the two people he mentioned, namely, Deputy Brian Lenihan and the Taoiseach.  To the best of my knowledge at no stage were they interested in any shape or form in FOBTs and any reasonable person would be against FOBTs, as I stated clearly when I eventually understood what they were about.</P>
    
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister and I agree.  That is the important thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>What I had a difficulty with was the way in which the Deputy laid down preconditions in regard to the all-party examination of this issue.  Given that this was considered in the casino report, it was important that entire report, warts and all &mdash; there were warts in it &mdash; would be looked at by the all-party committee but be that as it may, we have now moved on.</P><Col N="718"/>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that nobody in this Government, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, has at any stage exhorted me, in any way, to proceed with the implementation of legislation involving FOBTs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has the Minister changed from the course of action contemplated by his predecessor who stated that the publication of any report would be accompanied by recommendations on the part of Government.  I have not seen any recommendations on the part of the Minister.  When will we see them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, when I came into this job, I was confronted by what I understood to be an understanding between the Deputy&rsquo;s party, my party and the other main Opposition parties that there would be an effort to look at this area on an all-party basis.  That was not possible because the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the status of the Thornton Hall prison project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31461/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In May of this year negotiations with the preferred bidder for the construction of a prison complex at Thornton Hall were broken off as its final offer, which was significantly higher than the original price tendered, was determined to be unaffordable.  The original tender competition, which was initiated by the issue of formal invitations to tender in late 2007, was then abandoned as it did not offer the opportunity to obtain the best value for money for the taxpayer in the light of the changed circumstances.</P>
        <P>In June of this year the Government reaffirmed its commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall and approved the launching of a new tendering process for the construction of a more affordable and better value prison campus at Thornton.  The aim is to provide good quality, regime focused accommodation with appropriate support and rehabilitation facilities to prepare prisoners for reintegration back into society.  The new facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a range of security settings.</P>
        <P>The development will now proceed on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential basic preliminary works required for the development including the construction of the access route and perimeter wall.  It is intended that this work will proceed in the short term on the basis of separate contracts.  The tender documentation and scope of works are currently being drafted.  It is anticipated that work on phase one will commence towards the end of this year or early next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While phase one work is in progress the procurement process for the buildings and other facilities that will make up the new prison campus will be examined and finalised in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines for capital projects.  The objective is to complete the design and procurement process for the main prison complex while the construction of the phase one work is under way.  While the original design has been prepared, work is ongoing on more detailed design plans which are required for the tendering process.  The two phase approach means that once a contract is signed for phase two &mdash; the main prison development &mdash; the fact that the preliminary works envisaged by phase one will already have been completed <Col N="720"/>will allow for construction to commence immediately on the main prison buildings within a secured perimeter.</P>
        <P>The development of the new prison campus at Thornton is a complex project which is governed by Department of Finance and EU procurement guidelines.  The guidelines set out a range of actions that must take place prior to inviting tenders for the project.  The Irish Prison Service is being assisted in this work by the National Development Finance Agency.  It is intended to invite tenders for the construction of the phase 2 &mdash; the main prison development &mdash; next year.   I expect the new prison to be operational within three years of the signing of a contract for phase 2.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two brief questions because we referred to this issue earlier in the course of Priority Questions.  In regard to the phased development, will the Minister indicate clearly the timeframe for the coming on stream of the places or the cells?  We know about the access route, the acquisition of land and the roads but we need to know about the newly arrived at format for the provision of beds and what the Minister&rsquo;s definitive plan is in that regard?</P>
        <P>I understand maintenance charges for the vacant building site that is Thornton Hall &mdash; the greenfield site &mdash; are in excess of &euro;120,000 per annum.  On what basis are maintenance and security charges being expended when there is nothing on site to be secured?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the last question.  The Deputy will understand the State must protect its property.  This is a very significant piece of property so there are ongoing security issues in regard to it given that it will be a sensitive site when it is built on.</P>
        <P>In regard to the timelines, as I said, it will be two to three years after the signing of the phase two contract.  We hope phase one will start towards the end of this year or early next year.  If one looks at that timeline, one is talking about 2013.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, 2014.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps 2014.  While I accept we will produce 450 new spaces before the end of 2009, I have asked my officials to consider the building of a new block in the Midlands Prison complex, where there is plenty of scope for building, as an interim measure.  Given the prognosis for prison population growth, I accept there will be a need at the end of this year for another block despite the implementation of 450 spaces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Deputies are offering.  I will try to facilitate them if the Minister will bear with me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify his statement about maintenance and security fees?  Generally, it is not necessary to protect farmland in Ireland.  Why is it necessary to protect this farm and spend in excess of &euro;100,000 doing so?  Perhaps there is an explanation; I do not know.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Minister about answers he gave to the House previously which allowed the inference to be drawn that this prison will cost hundreds of millions.  The collapse of the deal with Bernard McNamara offers the opportunity to rethink the whole thing.  The Minister will shortly be able to get an inner city site from the National Asset Management Agency for a fraction of the folly that was committed at Kilsallaghan, if the Government is successful in enacting the legislation.  The Kilsallaghan site is entirely unsuitable.</P><Col N="721"/>
        <P>Is there not a strong argument from people involved in penal reform and penal policy that building a gargantuan prison such as this is the wrong thing to do?  If the Minister adds to the Midlands Prison and if he has the prospect of acquiring a site for a fraction of Kilsallaghan in the inner city, which would be much more convenient for people, he should rethink the entire project because one would have to take with a grain of salt his statement that phase two will start next year.   Having already spent &euro;40 million on the project, why should we spend more taxpayers&rsquo; money for a site on a farm in north Dublin which is not suitable for this purpose and may never be realised in the Minister&rsquo;s, or my, political lifetime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing to repeat on the security issue of the site.  It is only right and proper that the State would protect its interest in this particular site.</P>

	<P>I do not accept Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s premise that it is an unacceptable site.  It is a very central site, close to Dublin city and provision will be made for bus access, etc.  I do not agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s premise that we should build another prison in the inner city.  I am surprised a Deputy who represents an urban area would make such a suggestion.  It is only right and proper that a prison is located in an open area in which there would not be a possibility of drugs being thrown over its walls, etc.  Unfortunately, no matter what we do in Mountjoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>How much of the ongoing site maintenance costs are for the pruning of the shrubs and trees planted on a substantial acreage of the site?  Is it still planned to go ahead with accommodation on the site for deportees and those who have committed immigration law offences?  How many of these are currently in the prison system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister make a clear statement to the House on the relocation of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution?  There were reports it would be relocated at the Thornton Hall site on an interim basis.  There is also a proposal for the development of a new facility at Lusk, County Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>A year ago the House convened specially to deal with specific legislation on the matter of Thornton Hall.  Can I take it now that the Minister has abandoned the original plans and that the House will have to revisit the legislation?  Will new legislation be required for the delayed project?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The project at Oberstown is currently at design stage.  The expected tendering process for construction should take place in 2010.  Construction is expected to be undertaken in phases with the first phase scheduled to be completed by 2012.</P>
        <P>If the new proposals for Thornton Hall are more or less along the lines of the existing plans, we believe new legislation would not be required.  There may, however, be a requirement to come back to the House to pass legislation on the re-design.  We have a lesser design which takes out some of the ancillary facilities.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Today, the Central Statistics Office released figures which show emigration is a feature again in Ireland for the first time since 1996 and that we have also lost 174,000 jobs in the year to March.  The House should really focus on the priority of a stimulus package to protect and create jobs and get the country back to work.</P>
        <P>Among the population the general understanding is that the Government&rsquo;s proposal for NAMA will allocate &euro;30 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  This will not result in a single person being taken off any dole queue anywhere.  The Government has defended NAMA on the basis that the &euro;51 billion plus in taxpayers&rsquo; guaranteed bonds used to acquire toxic assets will leverage money from the European Central Bank, which, in the words of the Minister for Finance, will be allowed to flow back as credit to help struggling businesses and families.  Given that this is the main justification for the bailout of the banks and the protection of developers, there are several questions I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>First, when will lending conditions be eased as a consequence of NAMA?  Last week, when asked this question, the T&aacute;naiste said she was not in a position to answer.  I am anxious to know if she has made inquiries since then and what answer she has been given.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, 40% of the total NAMA bonds will be used to buy toxic loans from Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Both are institutions which will never make another loan in the normal sense.  In fact, in the case of Anglo Irish Bank the only loan it is interested in is that from a zombie bank to an insolvent developer for a headquarters that is not required.  The remaining bonds, some &euro;30 billion, will go to solvent institutions.  In turn, this could leverage 80% from the European Central Bank, amounting to &euro;25 billion.  Given that 40% of the bonds will be used to acquire toxic loans from Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, how much extra lending does the Government estimate will be generated by NAMA?</P>
        <P>The four clearing banks &mdash; mainly Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks &mdash; are servicing loans from other foreign and Irish banks of approximately &euro;140 billion.  They are very eager to pay down these debts.  For them, the overriding strategic position is to improve their capital positions and lower their overstretched loan-to-deposit ratios.  NAMA will not achieve this. <Col N="724"/> For this reason both the new Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan and the economist, Colm McCarthy, said that there are serious doubts about whether these banks will lend on the extra moneys they get for credit and business here.  It is not contained in the legislation.  What guarantees have these banks given the Government that the extra money they receive will be lent to small businesses and struggling families across the country?</P>
        <P>My three questions are, when will lending conditions be eased as a result of NAMA?  How much extra lending does the Government estimate will be generated here?  What specific commitments have the banks given the Government that they will lend the extra money to business, as credit is badly needed now because people are losing jobs by the minute?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s initial comment arose from the quarterly national survey.  While it was not a surprise it is a reminder of the major challenge we face to sustain employment and create new opportunities here.  The Government is taking several initiatives to address many of those issues, for example, concern about access to credit for business has been raised in this House over a considerable period.  Some have severely criticised NAMA but it is the most appropriate way for us to ensure that there will be a credit supply to business, and stability in the banking system.  </P>
        <P>As a consequence of NAMA, banks will receive funds cheaper at 1.5% from the European Central Bank, ECB, which will entice them to lend.  We have set up a credit  clearing group in which we have worked on the Mazars report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is misleading. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I brought together the banks, all the representatives of the small and medium sized enterprise sector, the foreign direct investment sector, and we have worked progressively on many of the issues raised by many sectors.  Most particularly, we have been addressing people on both sides of the argument and familiarising them with the challenges within the banking and business sectors.  For example, I have appointed, through Enterprise Ireland, a senior person to the banks and <i>vice versa</i> and we are working with a second bank in order to ensure that the business acumen which is necessary to this economy will be made available to people who wish to make applications to the banks.</P>
        <P>When I was asked could I give a definite day or date when this would happen I said we have been progressively working with the banks to make sure that those viable businesses in need of support are supported to the best of our ability.  I have provided a framework within which that will happen through the clearing group.  People can bring their difficulties to the website that has been set up where we can deal with them on an almost one-to-one basis.</P>
        <P>There is a stabilisation fund through which a considerable number of viable yet vulnerable businesses have received support.  The employment subsidy scheme which sustains people in employment is as important as the creation of new employment.  Although we continue to have many challenges to employment we are redoubling our efforts on the national employment action plan with my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, targeting training opportunities and convergence courses through which we take on people with skills and move them into new skills.  We have a graduate placement programme to prevent our losing the skills that we already have.</P>
        <P>We will continue to be vociferous in working with the banks to ensure that credit is made available as quickly as possible to the viable businesses that need to move forward.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="725"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When the Minister for Finance spoke on the legislation dealing with the guarantees on deposits he said we are deeply &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; in the banking sector.  Now the T&aacute;naiste tells me that the Government will continue to be &ldquo;vociferous&rdquo;.  I asked her three questions.  I did not ask for a specific day or date.  When does the Government calculate that lending restrictions will be eased for small businesses throughout the country?  How much does the Government calculate will be made available in extra lending capacity as a result of NAMA, given what I said earlier?  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell the House, as she continues to be &ldquo;vociferous&rdquo; with the banks and as the committee is doing its work, or at least monitoring if not solving problems, what specific commitments have the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks given the Government that they will use the extra moneys they receive through NAMA to lend on to small business and struggling families across the country?</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has not answered any of those questions and I have a further question.  The Government says, through the Minister for Finance, that the NAMA bonds will pay a premium of 0.5% above the main ECB rate and it claims that NAMA can cover its own costs at the introductory rate of 1.5% on the bonds issued to the banks and the big fees to be paid to bankers, lawyers and valuers.  On this basis it says that NAMA can break even if the value of the assets purchased rises by 10% over ten years.  Has the Government considered what will happen if interest rates rise?  The financial markets are pencilling in not just a rise in rates but a quadrupling of the ECB base rate over the next ten years to an average of 3.8%.  That would add &euro;1.5 billion extra per year to NAMA&rsquo;s operating costs which over ten years amounts to &euro;15 billion.</P>
        <P>That does not take into account the very likely escalation in non-performing loans and the decline in rents expected on the NAMA portfolio.  That is a &euro;15 billion black hole in the Government&rsquo;s figures.  I have asked four questions, on a day when the Central Statistics Office announced that emigration is back as part of the fabric of this society, and when we know that in the year to March 174,000 people lost their jobs.  It is fine to be &ldquo;vociferous&rdquo; about the banks and to talk about &ldquo;convergence&rdquo; and all these wonderful schemes but can the T&aacute;naiste explain how &euro;30 billion going into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide will take one person off any of the dole queues around the country which have been created by the incompetence of this Government?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of the recapitalisation of the banks there was a tie-in on a code of conduct of business.  The banks set down a special fund for green energy and a seed capital fund.  The ECB also provided finance to the banks on the basis of new businesses being set up and a considerable sum of money has been drawn down from those schemes.  The issue pertinent to many people is not necessarily the creation of new jobs and employment but rather the fate of those in very vulnerable sectors in this country, namely, the tourism, construction and the retail sectors.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there has been a greater understanding.

As a consequence, a considerable number of difficulties have been addressed. Some credit has been made available.  </P>

	<P>I appreciate that Opposition Deputies do not accept NAMA  and that is fair enough.  People are entitled to their opinions in this House.  However, there is an enormous risk if we do nothing.  Our view on this side of the House is that the introduction of NAMA is the best way to get liquidity into the banks and get them back to function, to do what they should be doing, namely, lending to businesses and mortgage-holders.</P>
        <P>Concerning the view expressed that the risk is so adverse that it will cost the taxpayer, on this side of the House we are very cognisant of the need to protect the taxpayer.  That is why due diligence has been done by the professionals on our behalf to assure people that the best decisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste describes today&rsquo;s CSO figures, which show jobs are disappearing and emigration has started again, as a &ldquo;challenge&rdquo;.  The people who are challenged are those who have lost their jobs, for whom the challenge is how they will pay their bills.  The people who are challenged are those whose businesses are in trouble and for whom the challenge is how to get credit to keep going and stay in business.  The people who are challenged are those who are still at work who are worried now about how much more bad news the T&aacute;naiste and the Government have for them in increased taxation or even pay cuts.  At the heart of the challenge, and its cause, was what happened in the banking system, particularly what happened in Anglo Irish Bank.  That was the rotten bank at the heart of the whole toxic problem that caused the collapse in our economy.</P>
        <P>I have some questions to ask the T&aacute;naiste about Anglo Irish Bank.  Last December, we first heard of the practices and scandalous goings on in that bank.  Directors paid themselves huge bonuses and organised back-to-back loans that shifted money from one institution to another.  Around the same time, Bernie Madoff was arrested in New York.  Since then he has been tried, convicted and jailed for 150 years.  Unfortunately, since then we have heard very little about anybody being called to book regarding what happened in Anglo Irish Bank.  The only thing we heard was that there was a high profile Garda raid last February about which we have heard nothing since.  Yesterday we were told about eight directors who have &euro;22 million in loans between them.  Over the weekend we also heard speculation that additional money is to be put directly into the bank.  I am not talking about NAMA but about recapitalisation money being put into Anglo Irish Bank.  This bank has been in State ownership since January.</P>
        <P>I wish to know two facts.  First, when will we see somebody brought to book for what happened in Anglo Irish Bank?  What is happening to the investigations we were told were taking place?  When the Labour Party proposed that an inspector be appointed to examine what went on in Anglo Irish Bank the Government rejected this and stated that the matter would be investigated by the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda.  What has happened?  Where is the report?</P><Col N="728"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Second, how much additional money will the Government put into Anglo Irish Bank?  It was mentioned in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i> over the weekend that the figure of &euro;3.8 billion already put in was to be increased to approximately &euro;10 billion.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell the House how much more of the taxpayers&rsquo; money, which is needed for our schools and hospitals and the services which the public consumes, will be put into Anglo Irish Bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ongoing investigations by the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Ahern, has provided additional resources for that investigation as have I to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  This House facilitated additional legislative measures in order for that matter to proceed.</P>
        <P>I appreciate, and I believe we all share, the frustrations concerning these investigations but unfortunately, unlike some others, the Government cannot be populist about this matter.  In no way can we infringe on the current investigation which is very wide ranging.  A considerable number of reports and interviews are taking place.  The option is available to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, if he sees fit, to have an inspector appointed.  We do not direct him.  He is independent and has access to the courts if it is his considered view that an inspector should be appointed.</P>
        <P>Our system of justice is not similar to that of the United States of America.  We must deal with the legislative measures which we have at present.  It would be imprudent of me or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to direct anybody whose function is independent of Government with respect to this investigation.  What we can ensure, and assure people of, is an ongoing investigation and that the requisite resources required by the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement are being made available.  We hope this matter will be brought to finality as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Regarding Anglo Irish Bank, I have heard comments by many people that the bank is not systemic.  I do not feel it is appropriate that we should have a situation whereby we would allow this bank to collapse.  That is why the decision was made to nationalise the bank.  There are still business transactions there, though not as many as heretofore.  There are still depositors in the bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>These are just roll-over transactions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Those depositors are very important and are guaranteed by the State.  I believe it is appropriate that we continue to support those people.  I appreciate very much the Deputy&rsquo;s view with regard to Anglo Irish Bank but it is the considered view of the Government thus far that in NAMA it will deal with many issues appertaining to Anglo Irish Bank.  The Minister for Finance alluded to this in his speech last week.  Moreover, the Government will consider whatever capital injection is necessary to the banks in order that they can continue and revert back to their most important function, which, as I said to the Leader of the Opposition, is to get credit back to business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste is right in one thing she said.  Our system of justice, certainly as it pertains to corporate crime, is not the same as that of the United States.  In that country they treat corporate wrongdoing somewhat more seriously than we do apparently.  The public is not reassured that the investigation is ongoing.  That is what worries the public and we have not seen any results from it yet.  The T&aacute;naiste has not been able to tell the House as to when it will be concluded and when we will see some accountability for it.  This is an investigation into matters which took place in what is now a State owned bank.  Meanwhile, all we are getting is the l&aacute;mh amach from the banks, and in particular from Anglo Irish Bank.</P><Col N="729"/>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The T&aacute;naiste told us that the Government will consider whatever capital is necessary for Anglo Irish Bank.  People who make up the statistics in today&rsquo;s CSO report, people who have lost their jobs, people whose businesses are in trouble, and people who are facing possible pay cuts and tax increases, are in this position due to the carry on of Anglo Irish Bank in particular.  It was not the only bank, but it was the worst offender by far that was reflected in the figures provided by the Minister for Finance last week, when he stated that &euro;28 billion of the toxic loans associated with that bank.  We have to fork out for it and on top of that, the bank is now looking for more money to recapitalise.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell us if the figure that Anglo Irish Bank will require is as high as the &euro;10 billion that was reported in one of the newspapers last Sunday?</P>
        <P>She has stated that the Government will consider whatever capital is necessary, but we do not get the same approach from the Government at all.  She is not telling the hospitals, the schools or any area of public life in this country that they will get whatever money is necessary.  She is not telling people who need to get back into employment that the Government is going to provide whatever money is necessary in order to get them back to work, yet she is telling us that the Government will provide whatever capital is necessary to keep Anglo Irish Bank alive.  How much is that?  It has got &euro;3.8 billion of our money already.  How much more will the bank get?</P>

	<P>The Deputy would rightly criticise us if we interfered in due process, and I do not think he is asking us to do so.  It is a matter for this House to determine the laws of the land under our Constitution.  We are proceeding as quickly as possible with regard to the investigation on the basis that it is independent of the political process.  If we do not want it to be independent of the political process, then we will have to change it.  However, I am sure that if there was political interference, the Deputy would be the first man in the House to give <Col N="730"/>out about it and say that it was not the right thing to do.  People should take on board the fact that within the realms of possibility, this matter will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 13, motion re: referral to Select Committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the Convention on the European Forest Institute; No. 2, National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 13 shall be decided without debate; Private Members&rsquo; Business shall be No. 33, Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2009 &mdash; Second Stage, and the proceedings on the Second Stage thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 23 September, 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.  The Order Paper contains two proposals, but it further facilitates the continuing debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies are not prepared to support the adoption of the Order Paper today.  We have obtained, even since last week, information about the suggested cost to the public purse that was not before us then, such as information on contracts that have been concluded with Arthur Cox Solicitors, who are to give advice on NAMA for the future.  This is a firm that has already been paid &euro;3.7 million on advice to the Government about the banks.  Consultants are also involved at a cost of &euro;2,000 per day.  This is a continuation of the very culture that has given rise to what has gone wrong with the economy of this State over the past few years.</P>
        <P>We have not been advised on the many more millions of euro that Arthur Cox Solicitors have been granted for the tender to give legal advice on NAMA in the future.  These are very important questions that need to be addressed in this House.  The information needs to be transparent before the Members in this Chamber.  As it is not so, we cannot agree to the Order Paper, which facilitates a continuing Second Stage debate on NAMA.  This legislation should be withdrawn because it is fundamentally flawed and will not address the issues with which we must immediately and urgently grapple.</P>

	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that there will be no guillotine on Second Stage and Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill?  Can she confirm that Committee Stage of the Bill will be taken in the House?</P>
        <P>Has the Government fixed a date for the budget?  If so, what is that date?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have travelled around the country in the past number of weeks seeking a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon referendum.  We have produced almost a million pieces of literature for this campaign and I expect to cover more than 3,000 km.  Some sectors are very concerned at the way we have transposed European directives into Irish law.  Currently, the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, under the chairmanship of Deputy John Perry, does not have the authority to look at the way we have transposed a number of those directives.  I am not talking about losing the impact of a directive but about the degree of flexibility and common sense that applies in <Col N="732"/>a number of these cases.  For example, the T&aacute;naiste is well aware of the nitrates directive from her period as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It directed that the last date for spreading slurry was 31 August but because of our weather conditions, the Minister has extended that period to 15 October.  I could say the T&aacute;naiste got inside that deadline herself the other day when talking about Lisbon, but I will not say it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is the Government considering allowing the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny to look at a number of directives, which I could point out to the T&aacute;naiste, where there is clearly a degree of frustration in different sectors, whether business, the agri-economy or other areas, because of the extent of administrative bureaucracy and red tape that we ourselves have applied to the transposition of directives into Irish law?  This would be in the interest of different sectors which would at least know the Government was listening to their complaints.  This issue should be referred to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  When the Lisbon treaty is, hopefully, approved there will be far greater access and opportunity for committees to look at proposals which come from the Commission.</P>
        <P>For now, a number of directives which have already been transposed into Irish law are causing frustration and anxiety.  This could be eased by a common sense approach by Government.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some experience of the nitrates directive, which took ten years.  We had a considerable time for scrutiny and discussion.  I appreciate what Deputy Kenny is saying.  As a former Minister, he knows that when a political decision is made by the Council of Ministers the legal interpretation of that decision is the first hurdle, not to mention the transposition of a directive in each member state and the various interpretations of it.</P>
        <P>I do not see an issue with Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s proposal.  Directives and their transposition can take considerable time.  A number of EU directives remain to be finalised.  I do not see why Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s proposal could not be facilitated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will refer to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office a number of directives which have caused considerable difficulty for different sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a few of my own which he would be welcome to.</P>
        <P>The Whips will determine how the Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill will be dealt with.  No date has been set for the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government survive to bring in a budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We will.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised to hear the T&aacute;naiste say that no date has been set for the budget.  This time last year when, arguably, the economy was not <i>in extremis </i>to the extent that it is now, the Government thought it necessary to bring forward the date of the budget with a big announcement.  We are almost at the end of September and most people anticipate that the budget will be presented at the end of November or beginning of December.  There are not many options regarding dates.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the budget will be presented this side of Christmas?  If so, can we expect it on approximately the same date as previously, which is the first week in December?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Kenny sought the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s commitment on two matters regarding the NAMA legislation.  First, that Second Stage will not be guillotined.  That is not a decision for the Whips but for Government.  I would like an assurance that the debate will not be guillotined.  Second, <Col N="733"/>Deputy Kenny sought, as I did last week, a commitment that Committee Stage of the Bill will be taken on the floor of the House, given its importance.  I asked the Taoiseach about this last week.  Has the Government considered that suggestion and what is its response to it?</P>
        <P>The labour services (amendment) Bill, which is in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own portfolio, is promised to restructure the board of F&Aacute;S and, as stated in the document circulated by the Chief Whip, &ldquo;to strengthen the accountability of the director general of F&Aacute;S&rdquo;.  When will that Bill be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot make up the date of the budget.  It has not been decided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Has it even been discussed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision as to the date of the budget has not been made. With regard to Committee Stage, I have a personal view that one does better work if a Bill is scrutinised, line by line, by a select committee.  Nevertheless, there has been no determination as to which process will be used for Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill.  There is no proposal to guillotine or prevent discussion on Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the question.  Will there be a guillotine?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the intention of the Government to curtail the Second Stage debate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The new legislation on F&Aacute;S was accepted by the Government today.  There are a number of technical amendments which I must complete with the Attorney General.  It is my intention to publish the Bill at the beginning of next week, at the latest, and possibly at the end of this week.  I hope the House can facilitate the passage of the legislation as quickly as possible.  It will allow for the new format in which the board will be appointed, the accountability of the director general and a number of recommendations put forward by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised to hear the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply about the date of the budget.  Given the report of the Commission on Taxation, the McCarthy report and other issues that have stacked up in terms of decisions that must be made on public finances, it is extraordinary that the Government has not yet decided a date for the budget, a deadline that Departments and everyone involved must meet.  Is there a problem in setting the date?</P>
        <P>I heard the T&aacute;naiste state that Second Stage would not be guillotined.  This is important legislation and many Deputies would like to participate in the debate on Committee Stage.  There is a world of difference between Committee Stage held in a committee room in the bowels of the building and Committee Stage held in the House.  I would like the Government to agree to holding Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill on the floor of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing wrong with the fact that we have not decided on what date the budget will be.</P>

	<P>It is all wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be in or around the Christmas period, the end of November or the beginning of December.  The process was initiated in August.  We are back earlier than we would have been heretofore and, therefore, the decision on a date has not been made, particularly given the NAMA and Lisbon treaty issues.</P><Col N="734"/>
        <P>Committee Stage will be a matter for discussion among the Whips.  If held in plenary session, the debate could be shortened because other legislation must also pass through the House as quickly as possible.</P>

Can the Bill be introduced or are we afraid to touch that group?</P>
        <P>For years, a health information Bill has been promised to show us the truth of what is occurring in that area, but nothing has been introduced.</P>
        <P>Many nurses and midwives in Monaghan General Hospital and elsewhere who are normally busy no longer know what their futures hold.

As far as I can see, the Bill has been around the Houses for the past two or three years.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

This legislation is found in section C, Bills in respect of which heads are yet to be approved by the Government, <Col N="736"/>and will not be published until 2010.  This will not give much time in the run up to the legislation.  Is there a timescale for the Bill&rsquo;s publication?</P>
        <P>The Minister also spoke at length about the various changes required in planning law, but none of them is evident on any list of planning Bills.  Does this matter have greater priority than the control of dogs (amendment) Bill, which is on the section A list?</P>

	<P>When will the Government publish the new programme for Government currently under review and will it be introduced in the House for full debate, recognising that whatever will be in it will have a significant impact in terms of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme and policy objectives?  At what point is the review and when will that process conclude?</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Law Reform Commission recommended amendments to the law to prevent people from being imprisoned as a result of their inability to repay loans to financial institutions.  As a D&aacute;il representative who has witnessed this dreadful measure employed against a number of my constituents who, through no fault of their own, were unable to meet the demands placed upon them, I ask, given that we will undoubtedly face a significant increase in such measures through the courts on foot of the economic difficulties ahead of us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about two matters.  On the day the NAMA details were announced, we also received details of a proposed extension of the bank guarantee scheme for five-year periods indefinitely.  This scheme, which the Minister for Finance has put before the House, is momentous.  Does the Government intend to allow for a separate debate on the proposed extension of the scheme, particularly on the inclusion in the proposed scheme of the guarantee for the dated subordinated debt?  I was astonished to find the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is hard to believe what has happened to our economy since the last election.  All who sat here on the first day of the new D&aacute;il could not have imagined what would happen over the next two years.  I include the members of the Labour Party who were critics of the way things were and those of us who had alternative perspectives on housing and other issues.  Who would have thought that capitalism and free-marketeerism, as practised in this and other countries, would actually fail?</P>
        <P>Land speculation has brought this country to its knees and has brought the economy toppling around us.  We have found that our economy was built on a house of cards.  I watched Pat Kenny&rsquo;s new programme last night and there was a gentleman on it who said every family in Ireland has been affected.  He was correct.  Irrespective of our socioeconomic backgrounds, everybody in Ireland has been affected by the economic crisis, to varying degrees.  None of us can assume what we used to assume.  This applies to how we live our lives and to what we expect in our local communities.  Nobody knows when school buildings that were campaigned for will be developed.  When will we ever see the promised Luas and metro lines and other infrastructural developments?</P>
        <P>Plans we have for our children are now in question.  My daughter started primary school just a couple of weeks ago.  Circumstances are now very different for parents and we cannot make the same type of assumptions about children&rsquo;s prospects in terms of third level education, for example.  There are unfinished developments and empty buildings, including in areas such as Lucan, which I and the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, represent.  We had great hopes for such areas.  In places such as Adamstown, development has been very good to date but the building works have basically stalled.  People do not know when Adamstown will be developed.</P>
        <P>It is difficult for everyone in this country at present.  It is a difficult time for politicians of any hue, both in Government and Opposition, even though it might seem like an opportunity for the latter.  The economic prospects are as scary to the Opposition as they are to the Government.  How can one promise a better future, better education system, better health system and better local government and be credible in light of the current economic circumstances?</P>
        <P>The most galling figure for me is that &euro;28 billion is apparently to be spent by the Government on buying out a bank which, to be honest, I never heard of until relatively recently.  I speak for most of the population in this regard.  As we know, one could not enter an Anglo Irish Bank branch in any town or village around the country; it was just not a bank with which most of us dealt.  It is the bank that is to be bailed out the most under the bank guarantee scheme and NAMA.  What is really surreal for me is that despite all that has taken place and despite everything being thrown into question in terms of the economic philosophy that underpinned <Col N="741"/>the actions of our Government and governments in other countries, the same assumptions about how our economy should be organised prevail and NAMA is a part of those assumptions.  The assumption of many commentators in the media is that we can go back to business as usual.  It is unfortunate that the predominant voices in the media basically make the same assumptions we had in the past.</P>
        <P>Let us consider some of the developments in recent months, including the report of the Commission on Taxation.  There is a lot of jargon in the report and the idea that tax can somehow be revenue-neutral is a nonsense and is nothing more than Orwellian speak.  The report addressed the need to limit tax on labour, which is income tax.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has used the same language and spoken of the need to limit tax on labour, in other words, that there is a need to reduce income tax, the fairest form of tax.  This is the predominant view now about taxation.  I was amazed there was not more comment on the fact that the one proposal of the report of the Commission on Taxation concerning income tax cuts proposes that the top rate be reduced by five points and the lower rate be reduced by two points.  This is exactly the taxation policy that was in place when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government with the Progressive Democrats during the past ten or 12 years.  When there were income tax cuts they always benefited the most well off.  They were regressive tax cuts and other stealth taxes were introduced which have also been proposed by the Commission on Taxation which would hit middle and lower income people most.  I will refer to the matter of taxing or means testing child benefit later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The McCarthy report is concerned with rolling back the State and suggests that the State and the public sector are the problem.  This is despite the OECD study from the year before last which found that Ireland&rsquo;s public sector was not too large but modest compared to other countries.  The McCarthy report recommends cutting 17,000 public sector jobs despite the fact that we need jobs now more than ever in our economy and it is very difficult for the private sector to provide such jobs.  Under the McCarthy report there would be more people on the dole and out of work.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report makes many suggestions concerned with reversing social progress such as reintroducing third level tuition fees and cutting 2,000 special needs assistant posts.  It is very much a return to the old slash and burn approach of the 1980s which decimated our health system.  There are alternatives to the slash and burn approach to which I will refer later.  However, there is a view that in a time of plenty one should save money for a rainy day &mdash; something of which the Government did not do enough; it cut taxes when it did not need to do so and in an unfair way.  One should spend in a time of recession.  Many countries which have done this are showing a turnaround not apparent in this country.</P>
        <P>The NAMA proposal is based on the assumption that we can go back to a property bubble; that is what NAMA is about.  The Green Party is making hay of the fact that it will introduce a windfall tax.  I will believe it when I see it but that is another point.  The fact is one must rezone land to get money from a windfall tax and there is no way such a tax could be retrospective on land already rezoned and for which planning permission has already been granted.  It is a return to the old thinking of raising property values and rezoning land.  I presume from the statements made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that some of the land NAMA will own is not rezoned.  Will there be pressure now under NAMA from the different interested parties to have such land rezoned so that more money can be made out of it in the long term?  Despite numerous announcements by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, that he will reform the planning laws and stop unsustainable planning, there is no sign of this happening.  I tabled a question last week about that Bill but it is not on the list of Bills for the next legislative season; as far as I can see the Government list <Col N="742"/>of Bills extends to 2010 but there is no reference to this type of planning Bill.  When I put a question on the matter to the Taoiseach he did not have much to say about any such Bill.</P>
        <P>It is also disappointing that the majority of the media seems to be totally buying the same economic philosophy that we have had in this country, including that we must have NAMA, we must have the Commission on Taxation report implemented and that we must have the McCarthy cuts implemented.  That is what I interpreted from <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial which suggested the Government is lily livered if it does not implement the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  It refers to the Commission on Taxation being established to spread the burden of tax and to make taxation fairer.  In no way will the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation make our taxation system fairer; they would do the reverse, make it more unfair and undo much of the social progress we have made in recent years.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the media &mdash; in the broadest sense of the term &mdash; is representative, although I recognise there are different voices.  However, the predominant voices in the media and in the editorials of such newspapers as <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i> are out of step with the public.  The people I meet in my day-to-day work as a public representative question the way things were and the way our society was organised during the era of the Celtic tiger.  In on-line debates about our economy and NAMA there is a good deal more diversity of voice in terms of political blogs and so on in which young people question the way things were and believe things can be different.</P>
        <P>If everything we did brought us to where we are it is time to start to consider doing things differently.  There are alternatives and there is a different way of approaching recessions, depressions, good times and economic growth.  Such an approach is being implemented in other countries throughout the world.  The IMF has said one of the reasons France has been cushioned against the recession is because of its large public sector.  Having a reduced public sector may not help a country but having a large public sector may help because the public sector provides jobs and necessary public services.  It has educated our children and looked after our sick people and so on.</P>
        <P>I refer to fiscal stimulus such as those proposed by the Labour Party.  We propose building schools.  I have tabled parliamentary questions about school buildings that are badly needed in my area and which are so rated by the Department of Education and Science but I have ascertained from the replies that nothing is happening and that there are no plans for building such schools.  If we built schools we would put people back to work and they would pay taxes which would return to the Exchequer.  These people would buy goods in shops, make the economy more confident and get it moving again.  This is the type of approach which has been implemented in other countries, such as in the United States of America by President Obama.  This approach was also implemented by Franklin D. Roosevelt during the &ldquo;New Deal&rdquo;.  Not only did this approach help the economy, but it helped to address a hardship in society by ensuring as many people as possible had jobs and it did as much as possible to protect people in terms of work and income.  It seems the opposite approach has been taken and will be taken here by the Government.</P>
        <P>There have been alternatives all along including those proposed by the Labour Party.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently pointed out it is not true to suggest everyone was cheerleading the Celtic tiger.  There were people who proposed alternatives about how to provide homes for young people.  Deputy Eamon Gilmore, the Labour Party leader, led a commission on housing in 1999 which recommended taking the decisions about where housing should go, namely out of the hands of developers and into the hands of the State, local authorities and local communities.</P><Col N="743"/>
        <P>Let us consider new Labour in Britain.  Where new Labour in Britain went wrong &mdash; if it did &mdash; was buying into the idea that the market is supreme.  We must decide that in future there are areas in our lives where the market has no place.  That can be done as much in bad times as in good.</P>
        <P>The NHS was established in Britain after the Second World War, and the French also brought in their health service, a universal state system found by the World Health Organisation to be one of the best in the world.  In Ireland, children&rsquo;s allowance was introduced in 1944 at two shillings and six pence for each third and subsequent child under 16.  It was not means-tested and it helped 320,000 children at the time.  It was extended to the second child in 1952 and all children in 1963.  Having experienced great wealth, we find bankers are now being bailed out and &euro;28 billion is going to Anglo Irish Bank but we are talking about taking away children&rsquo;s allowance from some.  Unfortunately, the media is a cheerleader for that.  Despite children being our future, we are talking about taking away something we introduced in the 1940s when food was rationed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an alternative to NAMA.  If the State and taxpayers are handing over an amount of money which could easily buy those banks, we should own them.  That has been done in many other countries.  If we go back to normal we will have the banks go off into the sunset, leaving taxpayers burdened and resulting in the loss of social progress made since the State&rsquo;s foundation.  We can act differently by nationalising the banks and setting out to create genuinely a much fairer and more sustainable society from the current economic recession.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In the 1970s I worked as a financial controller in a large building firm in Cork.  At that time the country was in the throes of an economic crisis not much different, and possibly worse, than that being experienced today.  I know first hand the problems facing small, medium and large firms.  At that time the unemployment rate was greater, emigration was rife, inflation was high and interest rates were at their peak.</P>
        <P>There is one difference between now and then; at that stage there was agreement across the board that we had to work together to get the country out of its problems.  The types of innuendo, half-truths, rumours and allegations being floated around these days by the usual suspects outside the political field and by some senior members of the Opposition, who know better, were absent.</P>
        <P>The Opposition has a duty to ask the hard questions but it is clear it is not interested in the answers.  It is doing a great disservice to the nation in this approach.  The continual emphasis in its approach to NAMA that the agency is out to save the bankers and developers is cynical and untrue.  People in glasshouses should not throw stones.  The implication is that bankers, including the CEOs and chairmen, are friends of Fianna F&aacute;il but one only has to look at the party affiliations of some senior board members of the main banks to see that such an argument does not hold water.</P>
        <P>To suggest that all builders and developers are Fianna F&aacute;il supporters is to ignore the facts.  It is time to stop this nonsense and focus on the real issues facing the economy.  As an accountant for many years I have had dealings with financial institutions on behalf of clients and I understand the need to acquire cash and credit to run businesses.  The Government recognises that what is now required in this economy is a healthy and working banking system.</P>
        <P>The course of action being taken by the Government in establishing NAMA is based on advice it has received domestically, the advice of institutions such as the IMF and also the example of other countries taking similar steps.  There is much praise from Europe for the action being taken.  Jean-Claude Juncker, the Prime Minister and Finance Minister for Luxembourg stated that he thought &ldquo;the Irish Government, with great courage and a deep sense of <Col N="744"/>responsibility, is on the way to taking the right step in a very difficult situation&rdquo;.  Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB President, stated &ldquo;In these circumstances, what impressed me the most in Ireland was the level of national unity I perceived&rdquo;.  He also stated that NAMA was very well oriented.</P>
        <P>The ESRI has backed the measure and Mr. John Fitzgerald has said that the Government had got it right with the supplementary budget and the country was on the right track.  Mr. Peter Sutherland said &ldquo;What we are not recognising is that we have great strengths and the position is not quite as bad as is being painted.  Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s has backed NAMA, indicating that it thinks &ldquo;the plan could achieve the Government&rsquo;s stated objectives of putting the banks on a stronger footing, restoring investor confidence in them and improving both their liquidity and their capacity to lend to credit-worthy Irish borrowers&rdquo;.  Maarit Lindstrom, chief economist of the Finnish Chamber of Commerce, stated that the creation of a bad bank to relieve lenders of toxic assets had proved to be a positive experience in Finland in the 1990s, and the Irish Government needs to intervene to relieve the banking sector of bad assets in order to create trust and so forth.</P>
        <P>We need to know that when we put money into a bank it will remain secure.  We need an efficient system of payments in the economy and if we allow banks to fail, it will leave businesses and individuals at a loss of their savings, undermine confidence in the banking system in general and cause serious damage to the economy, which would require even greater State intervention to fix.</P>
        <P>The problem with Ireland&rsquo;s banks that hinders them in functioning properly is a lack of adequate capital, which would give them a buffer to absorb losses if and when they occur while keeping depositors&rsquo; funds.  Adequate cash resources are needed to allow banks to repay depositors and lenders and make new loans available.  A lack of long-term profitability will be an obstacle to building up capital to allow banks to offer greater lending and buffers against losses.</P>
        <P>For the Irish banks, capital and liquidity have been much more difficult to access at the very time they are needed most.  In order to protect savers and the economy, the Government introduced the deposit guarantee scheme, injected capital into the banking system and nationalised Anglo Irish Bank.  The Government interventions to date have been bold and aggressive, and together with the support of the European Central Bank they have succeeded in protecting the banking system.  However, the problems arising from the banks&rsquo; exposure to risky loans, especially with regard to property, cannot be allowed to continue as the banks cannot return to normal banking unless the problem is addressed.</P>
        <P>NAMA will tackle the problems of the banking system by stripping their most difficult classes of property loans as well as performing loans.  The banks will take losses on many of those loans now rather than over time, leaving them cleaned up and better able to get on with normal banking business.  The banks will be in a better position to raise funds for lending in the economy to small and medium businesses as well as the public.</P>
        <P>The transfer of bonds from the State to the banks in payment for the loans transferred will give the banks greater access to cash through world markets and the European Central Bank.  It is important to emphasise &mdash; in response to so much mischievous misinformation &mdash; that borrowers will owe NAMA the same amount as they owed to the banks concerned.  Borrowers will be expected to pay the full amount owed by them in exactly the same way as they are obliged to pay their bank at present.  With borrowers who will not or cannot repay their loans, NAMA will pursue them to ensure maximum return.  Borrowers in most cases have lost sub<Col N="745"/>stantial sums with the large fall in property prices, and where loans are not being repaid, borrowers face further losses as NAMA takes control of the underlying assets and collateral.</P>
        <P>Many people are concerned that the assets, loans and property held by NAMA will not perform well enough to recoup its costs, including payments to banks.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The estimate is that 40% of these loans are cash-flow producing.  The cash flow produced will be sufficient to cover interest payments on the NAMA bonds and operating costs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In respect of the assertion that taxpayers will lose out, the Minister emphatically stated that the Bill provides for part of the consideration for the assets transferred to be in the form of subordinated bonds.  If NAMA were to lose money, this would put the banks at risk without giving them an upside in respect of its gains.  The Minister also stated, &ldquo;If, on the winding up of NAMA, there is a deficit, the Government may impose a levy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>As is acknowledged by people on all sides in the House and those further afield, the banking system has let us down.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister to the effect that existing structures cannot remain as they are at present.  There have already been changes at chairman and CEO level in the financial institutions.  There will be further changes at board level in the near future.  The Minister said that any institution participating in NAMA will be required to restructure its operations and that he will  insist that this will be a real process leading to a reformed and reinvigorated banking system.</P>
        <P>In July, Mr. Bo Lundgren, the director of Sweden&rsquo;s National Debt Office, who was Minister for Fiscal and Financial Affairs during the Swedish bank sector collapse, which lasted from mid-1991 to 1996, met the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  Mr. Lundgren has been quoted on numerous occasions as favouring nationalisation of the banks.  A number, but not all, of the banks in Sweden were nationalised during the period to which I refer.  When asked how long Ireland might need to get back to a solid banking system, he said it was difficult to judge and the timeframe would differ from country to country.  However, he said that as Ireland&rsquo;s property market had probably bottomed out, the banking system should be in order within a year or two.  He said that Ireland is roughly now where Sweden was in 1993.  By that stage, Sweden was nearing the end of its financial crisis.</P>
        <P>Mr. Lundgren further stated that the main challenges to meet to minimise a credit crunch emerging from a banking crisis are the maintenance of liquidity and the restoration of confidence both in investors and bank management.  He added that restoring a capital base to what is needed at the time, even though it might not be to original levels, is vital.  He said that a lack of credit flow is the main reason for any government to be involved.</P>
        <P>Sweden&rsquo;s banking sector collapse &mdash; which lasted from 1991 to the middle of 1996 &mdash; although smaller than what Ireland has been experiencing, resulted in a mix of mergers between banks, nationalisations, liquidations and the establishment of two bad banks.  The end result, however, was that most of the value of lost loans was recovered.  In that context, Mr. Lundgren said that bad banks &mdash; such as the proposed National Asset Management Agency &mdash; should not be closed as soon as the sector recovers but should be kept in place for a few years to attempt to recover as many bad assets as possible.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael wants this country to follow the example of the Lehman Brothers default-on-your-debt model and also wants to establish a new &ldquo;magic&rdquo; bank.  Its plan does not even have the support of some of its former leaders.  Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s new magic wholesale bank will supposedly obtain &euro;2 billion in capital from the State and will be able to borrow &euro;40 billion from the ECB.  This is nonsense, particularly as the latter demands that collateral be provided.  The magic <Col N="746"/>bank would be obliged to raise deposits and these would almost certainly come in the form of funds withdrawn from the existing banks.  Alternatively, the State would have to provide the magic bank with &euro;50 million to &euro;60 billion in bonds.  There would be no benefit to the economy from this, particularly given that the banks already have access to the ECB.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael also wants to establish legacy banks to force losses on holders of bonds.  The bulk of bonds issued by Irish banks are ordinary senior bonds such as, for example, certificates of deposits.  Senior bonds are: part of the banks&rsquo; funding, not part of their risk capital; owned by pension funds, insurance companies and other long-term providers of debt, that is, the same investors who purchase Government debt; covered by the bank guarantee; and legally entitled to the same treatment as deposits.  Defaulting on senior bonds would lead to funding for the banks and the State drying up.</P>
        <P>Holders of subordinated debt &mdash; which forms part of the banks&rsquo; risk capital &mdash; have suffered large losses as a result of debt buy-backs at deep discounts.  The international experience is that the consequences of the failure of a bank would be to leave businesses and individuals at the loss of their savings, undermine confidence in the banking system in general and cause serious damage to an entire economy, which, if it were to be repaired, would require even greater state intervention.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal copies the Government&rsquo;s plan in that it suggests the establishment of an asset management agency similar to NAMA but with a different name.  Labour wants to impose a 50% discount on the loans being transferred to NAMA.  It has chosen this number because a discount of this magnitude would wipe out the capital base of the entire banking system and the State would then be obliged to recapitalise the banks in full.  This would achieve Labour&rsquo;s ideologically-driven goal of a fully State-owned banking system.</P>
        <P>Labour&rsquo;s approach is in violation of EU Commission rules.  The Commission insists that valuations must be determined following a due diligence examination of each loan.  Under NAMA, loans will be valued individually.  The EU Commission does not allow a flat discount across all loans as proposed by the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>NAMA has the support of the IMF, the OECD and the ECB.  The backing of the latter is crucial because it has agreed to exchange the NAMA bonds issued to the banks for cash.  The ECB would not back Labour&rsquo;s proposal as it is in violation of EU Commission rules.  The ECB also indicated that it is opposed to full nationalisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has ruled out the full nationalisation of AIB and the Bank of Ireland on the basis of due diligence exercises undertaken in March and other information on expected future bank losses which indicates that full nationalisation is not necessary.  Once an institution is completely nationalised, the State must sustain it.  Anglo Irish Bank is a case in point.  The State is obliged to ensure that the minimum capital is maintained in such an institution.  If that is not done, the institution ceases to be a bank and all its liabilities become an immediate charge on the State and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>If AIB and Bank of Ireland were fully nationalised, shareholders would have to be compensated with cash from the State.  At current share prices, this could mean a &euro;5 billion cash payout.  From where does Labour propose that the State should obtain this money?  Such money would have to be found before a single cent of new capital were injected.  New injections of State capital would have to be borrowed on world markets at interest rates of at least 5%.  NAMA bonds pay a much lower interest rate.</P>
        <P>Full nationalisation of AIB and the Bank of Ireland would impact negatively on the ability of the banks to attract funding and the cost of sovereign funding.  Anglo Irish Bank lost &euro;15 <Col N="747"/>billion in deposits following its nationalisation in January and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland has been obliged to make up the majority of the difference through a special liquidity facility of &euro;10 billion.  This is because providers of funds &mdash; insurance companies, pension funds, and so on &mdash; have credit limits for each borrower to avoid excess exposure to one customer.  Since Irish banks, if nationalised, would be regarded as part of the State, the individual credit limits for all of them and the State would be merged.</P>
        <P>Full nationalisation would inevitably result in Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign credit rating being downgraded and the State would be obliged to pay higher interest rates on its borrowings.  Moody&rsquo;s rating agency warned in recent days that the Government would have to deliver on NAMA or the country could face further cuts in its credit rating.</P>
        <P>Under Labour&rsquo;s plan, banks would be delisted from the stock market.  How does Labour propose that the State should sell off its stakes in the banks over time?  When should these stakes be sold off?  How would fully nationalised banks perform in the interim?  Political interference in lending policy has a disastrous history worldwide.</P>
        <P>Full nationalisation is the nuclear option and the only country that has fully nationalised its banks in the present crisis is Iceland.  Did Iceland get it right and every other country in the world get it wrong?  The NAMA proposal makes the Government responsible for providing funds to meet the banks&rsquo; capital requirements.  Nationalisation would require the Government to meet both the banks&rsquo; capital requirements and their funding requirements.  The Labour Party cannot cost its proposal and once the State was to assume complete responsibility for the financial sector, the cost could be endless.  It is a high-risk strategy that inevitably would end up costing taxpayers even more and would undermine confidence in the banking system and the country as a whole.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I believe that what is needed is to get credit flowing for ordinary businesses and families, to create and protect jobs and businesses and to safeguard business systems rather than individuals.  Moreover, the legislation for another regulatory system must be brought forward as soon as possible.  I believe NAMA is the way forward and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>This time last year, the event that normally is taken to be the starting date of the international banking crisis took place, namely, the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  A fortnight previously, the then regulator and Governor of the Central Bank appeared before a joint committee of the Oireachtas and assured its members there was no problem with Irish banking, that they had stress-tested the loan books and that there was absolutely no problem.  A fortnight later, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach attended an all-night meeting that ended with a decision to provide a guarantee to the banks in case they all went bust.  Shortly afterwards, Anglo Irish Bank had to be nationalised.  As these were the events of just 12 months ago, matters have moved on rapidly since.</P>
        <P>The biggest problem I perceive concerns the tardiness of Government decision-making.  Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the authorities in the United States have intervened and have rescued the banks they wished to rescue to the degree that the latter now are trading profitably <Col N="748"/>and have paid back much of the money they received from the authorities.  In addition, it is worth noting that while 42 bankers have been put in jail in the United States within the past 12 months, we still are wondering what to do resolve the banking crisis, which is an absolute prerequisite to resolving the economic crisis.  However, the slowness of the decision-making process in both the Government and the public service is one of the major problems this country faces.  It presents a credibility issue as to whether the individuals involved from the political world and the public service are up to it.  I will leave that question hanging in the air because many people would suggest the tardiness of the decision-making demonstrates they are not.</P>
        <P>The second problem I discern is that NAMA is being introduced by a Minister who is relying on information provided by the banks and the regulatory authorities.  There is no other source of information and without putting a tooth in it, the banks have misled this House, the Irish public, their shareholders, the Minister and the Government over an 18-month period.  How many times did senior bankers assert there was no problem in the Irish banks, that they had no toxic or bad loans, that they did not seek or need private equity and required no new capital?  If one goes back over the quotations during the last 12 months, such assurances have been given by the banks time after time.  Were lying an Olympic sport, we could put out a team of bankers who would win gold for Ireland.  However, we now are relying on the same group of people to provide information, which presents the Minister with a fairly significant credibility problem.  Nevertheless, we must do our best under present circumstances.  The Minister has made the wrong decision and the model proposed by Deputy Bruton on behalf of Fine Gael was better.  However, as it appears the Minister&rsquo;s proposal will be carried on Second Stage, Members must evaluate whether the situation can be improved.</P>
        <P>In that context, what concerns me most is the possible exposure of the Irish taxpayer.  The Minister, relying on information from the banks, essentially is taking the value of the loan books and discounting them by 47% to get market value, which actually turns out to be &euro;47 billion.  He then intends to add another &euro;7 billion for medium-term economic value or whatever.  While that looks like a minor addition, the real issue is that if he has got his sums wrong in calculating market value, the gap then is much more significant and wide and the exposure of the taxpayer is far more serious.  The surveys suggest that to date, the value of all property has fallen by 45% since the peak in 2007.  As the Minister has taken a figure of 47%, he has opted for a figure that is two points higher than that.  However, the issue is whether property values are still falling.  Where is the evidence that we have hit the bottom?  I cannot discern any such evidence from what is published in the newspapers or from the small number of property transactions that are taking place nationwide.  It appears as though values are still falling and may continue to so do.</P>
        <P>Valuing property and estimating market value in the depths of the recession is extremely difficult.  The information pack produced by the Oireachtas Library &amp; Research Service on NAMA has been excellent and it also produced a supplementary paper on how to value property.  It is possible to value it on rental yield on the basis that such a yield normally should be approximately 5%.  In 2009 however, both Morgan Kelly and Ronan Lyons estimated that values must fall by 60%.  In other words, if one uses that method of valuing property, there is another 13% to go beyond the Minister&rsquo;s calculations.  According to the aforementioned paper, a second way to value property is on the basis of affordability.  Since the mid-1970s and until the madness set in over the last four or five years, affordability for a residential property was taken to be four times the average industrial wage.  On that basis, the discount again must be 60%, not 47%, to bring down residential property prices to their current real market value.  These are the best estimates and this is what professional valuers do.</P><Col N="749"/>
        <P>The Minister comes out looking somewhat better using two other measures.  If one considers what happened elsewhere during major property busts worldwide, the average discount works out at approximately 30%.  However, such busts tended to last for four and a half years in the residential market.  This suggests that while the discount was not as big, the trough lasted for a significantly long time and that there will be no lift in Ireland&rsquo;s residential market for another two to two and a half years, during which it will be crawling along the bottom.  The fourth method to evaluate property is on the basis of long-term trends.  The Minister has used this method, took a base year of 1975 or thereabouts and worked therefrom.  One can vary this and one will get very different answers depending on whether one decides to finish it in June 2009, June 2008 and so on.  Consequently, this method is highly susceptible to the period of time over which one measures long-term trends or what is one&rsquo;s base year and finishing year.  On that basis, the paper suggests while commercial property is at or close to its long-term average at present, residential property has some further way yet to fall.  The burden of the evidence suggests that the figure of 47% is highly optimistic and that the real fall will be approximately 60%.  If this is the case, the Minister&rsquo;s starting point will add on approximately &euro;20 billion and not &euro;7 billion.  On that basis, the exposure of the taxpayer will be significantly higher than is argued by the Minister.  The Minister might answer a number of questions when he winds up.  The idea that builders and developers put up 25% of the cost in private equity has disappeared from the Minister&rsquo;s script.  Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea seemed to suggest that it has disappeared from the calculations as well.  The 25% of so-called private equity was borrowed elsewhere and was not really private equity.  If that is the case, we need that on the record.  The Minister was very strong on that a couple of weeks ago, saying that the real model was 25% of private equity and 75% borrowed.  That has now disappeared from the calculations.</P>
     
        <P>What about loans under &euro;5 million?  We do not have that many multimillionaires in my constituency but many are stuck with assets below the &euro;5 million mark.  I understand that NAMA is no longer taking on any loans under &euro;5 million.  What will happen to these?  Will they be at the tender mercies of bank receivers?  Will it be open season on the small fellows while the big fellows will be protected?  There is a suspicion that the banks will really go after the smaller guys now and tidy up their balance sheets on that basis, while NAMA has an umbrella over the big developers.</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt this is the biggest gamble ever taken by an Irish Government and I have been struck in recent weeks by the Fianna F&aacute;il grassroots line, echoed by the T&aacute;naiste in reply to Deputy Kenny, to the effect that something has to be done.  Something must be done but the right thing needs to be done.  The right thing is not that which sees taxpayers foot the Bill for the greed and folly of a small number of people.  The right thing is what sees taxpayers protected in so far as possible, although I understand this cannot be 100%, and those responsible for this situation take the greatest proportion of the burden.  Having read the comments of the Taoiseach last week, there might be an inability to see what is best for the country and best for the citizens of the country.  They ranked only second and third to the Taoiseach.  Judging by the silence of the parliamentary party on this issue, we can assume the same principles apply to it.  The Irish public cannot be blamed for being sceptical about what, rightly or wrongly, they feel is a bailout for bankers and developers when they realise that loyalty to Fianna F&aacute;il is the guiding light of our Taoiseach and his Government.</P>
        <P>Deputy Michael Ahern seems to know the party affiliations of all senior bankers, including CEOs.  Is this because he asked to see their card on the way into the Galway tent?  Obviously he is very close to them if he knows their party affiliations.  It is important to dispel the myth the Minister for Finance tried to create last week in suggesting Fine Gael did not engage with <Col N="750"/>the NAMA issue over the summer or by saying that Fine Gael did not take up the Government&rsquo;s invitation to discussions behind closed doors.  I can understand the temptation to discuss this issue behind closed doors.  One of the biggest concerns the public has with this legislation is the fact that it appears shrouded in secrecy.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael engaged with the Government during the summer and set out its detailed concerns in writing to the Minister for Finance about NAMA as well as the Fine Gael alternative.  We also suggested through our party leader and our spokesperson on finance that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service should hear testimony from international and domestic experts on the positives and negatives of NAMA and the alternative viewpoints put forward by parties and other experts.  We set out nine specific issues on which we wanted further detail from the Minister.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton outlined clearly that our concerns arose from the potentially colossal cost of NAMA promising uncertain benefits and from the evident unfairness of asking taxpayers to take responsibility for the reckless behaviour of developers and banks.  We remain concerned about the clear possibility of overpayment by Irish taxpayers to bank shareholders and bondholders for toxic bank assets with a highly uncertain value.  The valuations provided by the Minister last week are short on specifics and short on certainty as to just how the figures were produced.  Effectively, the Minister has made a series of assumptions on the value of property today and the potential value of property in the future.  He has also made assumptions on how much property prices have fallen on the projects that are to be supported.  Adding all these up he arrives at the figure of &euro;54 billion, which is still highly questionable.  Mr. Richard Curran undertook an interesting analysis of this at the weekend.  Other property price reviews have shown different figures, some of which were mentioned by Deputy Noonan, and mostly larger figures for falling property prices.  Indeed, many companies and brokers have written down the value of assets by significantly more than the figure the Minister is using in the supporting documentation supplied to us last week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s assumption that NAMA will break even if property prices recover by only 1% per year is seriously questionable and is dependent on him being correct in his figures that property prices have fallen by 47% on projects.  The Minister has little or nothing to back this up, except an 11 page report, the totality of which we are not allowed to see.  We would need a far more startling recovery for NAMA to break even at any time in the next decade, possibly up to 50%, thus leaving the taxpayer dangerously exposed.  The notion that there will be a 10% uplift in prices in a decade providing a break even position is nonsense.  Fine Gael is also concerned and questions the impact NAMA will have on the current lack of bank credit for businesses and households.  There is no doubt that this is one of the over-riding concerns of the public at this point in time.</P>
        <P>In our day-to-day constituency work, particularly over the past few months, we have been struck by the massively growing number of people in dire financial straits.  Every single clinic I have held across Laois and Offaly has had people come in who simply cannot afford to keep up repayments on their home.  Many of these have applied for and have been refused help from the State to assist them.</P>
        <P>The Government is able to refuse mortgage interest supplement to families on the verge of having their homes repossessed on the basis of the fact that they believe the person could never afford the mortgage in the first place or should not have taken the mortgage out in the first place.   How does the Government set that beside what it is proposing to do here?  How does the Government propose to explain to mothers and fathers facing home repossessions that the financial institutions cannot possibly be allowed to fail yet we are quite happy to let the finan<Col N="751"/>cial institutions repossess homes and, no, the Government will not give any support to try to assist in paying the mortgage and staying in one&rsquo;s home?</P>
        <P>I am currently compiling a report for the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, with Deputy Thomas Byrne, on the high levels of indebtedness in Irish society.  We have held hearings with many experts in the area.  Mortgage borrowing in this country doubled since October 2004, with annual rates of increase of nearly 30%.  Despite low interest rates, the High Court has seen a 100% increase in the seeking of repossession orders last year and is expecting an avalanche in the months to come, in the words of the master of the court.  Luckily, according to Central Bank statistics, approximately 80% of our mortgage borrowing in Ireland is benefiting from the European Central Bank reduction in interest rates.  The real concern this is masking is what will happen if the ECB rates start to increase or if, as the EBS warned last week, financial institutions start to increase their interest rates as a result of the cost of being involved in NAMA.  We will then have an even greater number of people seeking relief, an even greater number being refused and an even greater number questioning why we are saving those who gave out these loans yet we are making no attempt to salvage the situation for individual home owners.</P>
        <P>I welcome the one ray of hope that the code of conduct for mortgage arrears represents.  Unfortunately, the Government omitted sub-prime lenders.  This code has not addressed reckless lending by financial institutions.  It is exactly this reckless lending that has led us to where we are with this legislation.  It is ironic that we are going to support the financial institutions and the developers engaged in this level of reckless lending when the Government has no clear plan, if any plan at all, to support people who were offered loans on family homes that have proven unaffordable.  They are just told that it is tough and that they should not have taken it out in the first place.  We are not even resourcing organisations like MABS or the Legal Aid Board to ensure that people are able to get expert financial advice when they find themselves in this situation.  MABS is doing good work but is neither staffed with enough people nor with people with the necessary expertise in this area to go up against the might of those in financial institutions whose job is to try to get as much money in as they possibly can from the small man.  According to the Free Legal Aid Centres, the Legal Aid Board only took on four debt cases last year yet 276 people were jailed under the heading of offences relating to debt in the same period.</P>
        <P>Unlike the Government, which is obsessed with the propaganda that there is only one solution, Fine Gael is not obsessed by this dogma.  Fine Gael is guided by a set of core principles that this legislation does not address.  We want to see legislation that protects the taxpayers from massive and unmanageable risks, that minimises and ensures a much fairer distribution of the losses associated with reckless lending by banks and reckless investments by developers, and with improving the financial stability and credit availability for businesses and families who are struggling at the moment.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a businessman last week who runs a tight business that employs a small number of people and works extremely hard.  His account was overdrawn by &euro;56 recently and he was told by the bank that it was going to bounce his cheques.  This is part of the reason we are seeing so many small businesses fold in the current climate.  I know of other instances where banks have approached small businesses and have asked spouses to assign the family home in order to guarantee the loans the business had taken out.  Surely this is a direct contradiction of what was achieved with the introduction of the Family Home Protection Act after the Bank of Ireland <i>v</i>. Smyth case in the 1990s, when the family home was finally secured.  Obviously the banks will tell us that they will tell people to get legal advice but getting legal advice does not alleviate the emotional pressure on those running a family business if a spouse is asked to <Col N="752"/>assign the home to try to help the business to survive.  These are bullying tactics being adopted by institutions that we are now guaranteeing to support for generations to come.</P>
        <P>The real concern I have about NAMA is the overexposure of the taxpayer to the risk.  Everyone has a certain sympathy for shareholders, many of whom themselves were misled by the bankers.  However, this does not change the fact that by its very nature investing in shares is a risk.  The solution is not to transfer all of this risk to the taxpayers, the majority of whom did not invest in these institutions.  We must adopt a model to see greater risk being retained by the bank and its investors.</P>
        <P>An interesting aspect of NAMA is that it remains secretive even though it is funded by the taxpayer.  As drafted, it will remain that way and the names of between 1,500 and 2,000 of the most powerful business people in this country will remain secret.  The real difficulty with this is that we will not be told who they are or what sums relate to them and people are angry about this point.  Virtually every sector that receives funding from the State, be it ourselves, doctors, pharmacists, solicitors or farmers through REPS and single farm payments have this information published and available.  However, this will not happen in NAMA, which is unfair and a mistake.</P>
        <P>The Government has made much of the fact that our economy cannot recover without a functioning banking system but it does not seem to place the same emphasis on how businesses and householders will have access to credit.  In the Minister&rsquo;s speech last week, he stated that specific credit supply measures were incorporated into the Government&rsquo;s recapitalisation packages for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The T&aacute;naiste could not answer questions on this today.  However, 40% of the &euro;54 billion to be spent on this will go into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide and I do not believe there is any chance that either of these institutions will kick-start lending in the economy.  Having listened to the T&aacute;naiste today, I do not believe that people on the other side of the House believe that those two institutions will do so either.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the fact that the Minister quoted President Obama on several occasions last week.  Deputy Noonan was correct when he spoke about the tardiness of the Government on this matter.  It makes the Minister&rsquo;s last quote from President Obama particularly interesting.  This was on the need for nations to take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again.  This shows the Minister&rsquo;s thinking on this issue because there is nothing early about his action and while it may appear aggressive it will not achieve what he wants it to.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak.  I speak for every Member of this House when I state that the proposed legislation to establish NAMA is one of the most important and complex Bills to come before the House for debate.  Rightly, the discussion surrounding these proposals has been vigorous and intense, with every person on the island wanting to ensure that stability is restored to our banking sector, and the wider economy.</P>
        <P>In the past year, Ireland has been at the centre of one of the worst international economic storms ever witnessed.  This week, the G20 summit meets to discuss reform of the global financial sector, which has been rocked by banking scandals.  I know that people are angry and worried, just as Members on both sides of the Chamber are, and they have every right to be.  Action must be taken now if Ireland is to recover from this recession.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance and his Department has examined in detail every possible option available to them.  NAMA is generally accepted &mdash; not by everybody but rarely will we have <Col N="753"/>unanimity on such complex legislation &mdash; as the best solution to restore our banking sector to a position of strength and it has received the support of the IMF and the ECB, with the ECB stating that measures in the legislation should restore confidence to the banking system.</P>
        <P>A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that NAMA was set to shift wealth to lenders and developers.  I certainly do not believe that and if I thought for one minute that anybody felt that would be the outcome I would not support the Bill.  NAMA is not, as has been suggested by some commentators, a &ldquo;get out of jail card&rdquo; for bankers and developers.  Though many of us would like nothing better than to punish the banks by not assisting them, it would simply be a case of cutting off one&rsquo;s nose to spite one&rsquo;s face.  Quite simply, without NAMA the Irish banking system would crumble, shortly and swiftly followed by the Irish economy and the many small and medium enterprises throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The banking system is the heart of the economy.  At present, it is not working at full capacity and is not pumping much needed finance and cash into the economy, which it needs to stay healthy.  What do we do?  Do we simply allow it to fail, or do we perform an operation such as NAMA which may not be 100% risk free, but which will restore the banking system and the economy to full working order?</P>
        <P>Without a functioning banking system, the economy will not survive.  Families will struggle and businesses will fail.  The previous speaker spoke about a bank seeking &euro;56 from a person.  This is the very reason we need NAMA; we need to be able to ensure that the banks can extend a certain degree of flexibility in loans.  There is nothing surer than that NAMA is the only option to restore stability to our banking sector.  The proposals for NAMA centre on two key points: buying bad loans at a discount and injecting capital into lenders with the aim of restoring solvency into the banking sector.  This will allow banks to once more free up lending to Irish businesses currently deprived of working capital.</P>
        <P>Over the summer I met representative bodies of a number of business associations to discuss the main challenges facing their members.  Repeatedly, access to credit was listed as the main concern for Irish SMEs.  NAMA will, by cleansing the banks&rsquo; balance sheets, allow the banks to access cash to lend to businesses.  However, I know that there is deep concern that banks will simply sit on these funds and not pass the finance on.  Over the past five to seven years they borrowed heavily from foreign investors to help fund loans to property portfolios and there is concern that the money will be used to repay these foreign investors prior to being lent to the economy.  This concern has been highlighted by the ECB, which stated that the banks involved in the scheme must be monitored to &ldquo;ensure that their self-interest does not cause them to focus on preserving and rebuilding their own equity, instead of lending into the economy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In his address to the D&aacute;il last week, the Minister for Finance highlighted the commitment in the NAMA Bill that banks will increase their capacity for lending to the SME sector by 10%.  When amendments are being considered I ask that this commitment be clarified.  Unfortunately, although the same commitment was given when the banks received the Government guarantee last year, the experience of SMEs would tell a different story.  Though no one would suggest that a business that is not viable should be given funding simply because it seeks it, good businesses in operation today are being denied the credit they need.  We must ensure the banks do not pay off their foreign investors first but that a percentage of the money coming from the ECB goes to the economy.  From experience, we cannot trust the banks to deliver.  There must be a mechanism and, as the Minister stated, there must be reform of the culture in the banking system.  The Minister has provided this by cleansing the boards and this must continue.  That cultural change will ensure that the money goes to people and to small and medium enterprises.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>Earlier this summer I voiced my support for the Mazars proposal that a risk-sharing scheme be established for SMEs and I again propose that this be considered. Furthermore, I note with interest a proposal by the CPA that a condition be placed on the banks to ensure at least 25% of the &euro;7 billion premium due to be paid for NAMA loans in accordance with long-term economic value will be allocated to new working capital credit facilities for viable SME businesses.  I suggest this proposal be given serious consideration when reviewing the legislation and that it be tied into it on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>Ireland faces unprecedented economic challenges on a scale never before experienced and this Government has chosen a course of action to meet these challenges, which I fully support.  The Opposition has a duty and a right to question the Government on its decision-making process, however the time for proposing alternatives has passed.  Its duty to the people now is to work constructively with the Government parties to ensure the best legislation possible is passed.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not exist in a vacuum unseen by the rest of the world &mdash; a fact the Opposition seems to forget.  The international financial community is watching Ireland closely and it is critical that political point scoring is cast aside and that we work collectively to steer the country through this economic storm and these exceptionally difficult times.</P>
        <P>There is a phrase that familiarity breeds contempt; there should also be a phrase that pessimism breeds pessimism.  I do not for one second underestimate the seriousness of the situation we face.  However, it is paramount that Ireland Inc. send a strong and united message to potential investors that we can and will get through this and that Ireland is open and very much ready for business.  The very nature of our economy and our small size means that we are heavily reliant on international investment and a united, clear and decisive plan is the best way to reassure potential investors that Ireland is a safe place to invest.</P>
        <P>Any idea that builders will escape the consequences of their defaulted loans is a fantasy propagated by the Opposition to garner easy headlines.  A borrower who owes &euro;1 million to a bank before the loan is transferred to NAMA will still owe &euro;1 million to NAMA after it is transferred.  The Minister for Finance has assured this House that they will be pursued for every cent.  Any idea that borrowers will escape their obligations solely by having their loan transferred to NAMA is simply false.</P>
        <P>This Government has chosen a course of action.  It is a daunting task but our resolve to restore the Irish economy will not be shaken.  Every effort to protect the taxpayers and future generations has been taken and now the plan must be put into action.  Ireland can, and will, recover and NAMA is the first step on this road.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BobbyAylward"><NameTxt>Deputy Bobby Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the NAMA legislation.  I wish to set out why I support the concept of NAMA and explore some of the ridiculous myths which have been peddled about the NAMA project during the course of the frenzied public debate over the summer.</P>
        <P>It is high time for us to address the grave difficulties besetting the banks.  We must address them with an air of plain realism, unpalatable and all as that reality may be.  There is no instant panacea for this crisis.  We must adopt a practical, structured and workable approach which pays proper regard to the context in which we find ourselves from the points of view of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the international financial markets.  We are only deluding ourselves if we believe we can operate in a vacuum on this.  All our actions to do with the banks and how we propose to clean them up will have knock-on consequences in the markets and we must be constantly mindful of that fact and of the profound <Col N="755"/>long-term effect all our policy decisions will have.  The key issue is to repair the banking system and to maintain international confidence in investing in this country while ensuring the taxpayer is not unduly exposed.</P>
        <P>Whether we like it or not, we all need banks.  They are a fact of life.  Banks which function properly are critical to a vibrant economy and represent its beating heart.  Credit is the lifeblood which maintains every facet of the economy.  It enables business, it facilitates enterprise and it keeps the household going.  Now that we have experienced a banking crisis and the near collapse of the entire system, we know what it is like when credit dries up and most of us know that it is a very uncomfortable and debilitating situation.</P>
        <P>The former beating hearts, which are the banks, are now going through a type of cardiac arrest and business is withering because it cannot get access to vital credit.  Enterprise is nearing stagnation, farmers cannot get loans, young people find it difficult to get mortgages, households are unable to get loans for purchases or improvements and individuals cannot get personal loans or overdraft facilities.  The banks simply cannot lend because they do not have the money to do so.  There is an acute shortage of cash and people are losing jobs at an alarming rate.</P>
        <P>That situation is intolerable and dangerous and cannot be allowed to go on much longer.  There is a dire urgency about this.  The banks are paralysed because they are seriously choked up with all these toxic loans so we must take corrective action.  I am afraid we do not have the luxury of choice or time.  It is my firm and honest view that an asset management agency represents the best formula to tackle this problem in a comprehensive way.  We must restore a functioning banking system which will ensure a flow of credit into the real economy.  If they are to survive and do the job they are supposed to do, the banks must get a clean bill of health, their balance sheets must be strengthened and all the uncertainty surrounding bad debts must be reduced.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is to be complimented on the model he is recommending.  It is worth reminding people that this model is not unique.  Around the globe, similar models have been adopted to deal with distressed loans in banks and the Minister has availed of the very best international and domestic advice and expertise in formulating the NAMA proposal.  NAMA has received the very important blessings of the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the OECD and the International Monetary Fund.  In formulating the best vehicle to resolve our problems, the Minister has adopted a measured and considered approach, based on the principles of best international practice.</P>
        <P>NAMA has enormous merit in that it addresses the two most critical issues confronting the banks at present, namely, solvency and liquidity.  Throughout this process, we must achieve the orderly disposition of assets and ensure the various developments in question continue to earn economic value over time.  It is without doubt the best and most workable solution we have and it has a proven track record of success internationally.  Around the world, it is consistently recommended by banking experts and economists as the most effective method of managing distressed assets and troubled loans in a fragile banking system.</P>
        <P>A number of schools of thought emerged over the summer about how we should clean up the balance sheets.  Much of what passed for honest debate only served to confuse the public and that opportunity was used very cynically to distort the truth about NAMA, what it seeks to achieve and how it will set about its business of cleaning up the banks.</P>
        <P>First and foremost, NAMA will acquire all the loans secured on properties and other assets.  It is not only buying the bad or non-performing loans.  Furthermore, we must bear in mind that 40% of these loans are good loans, that is, the borrowers continue to service these loans and <Col N="756"/>they are not impaired.  That fact has been lost or ignored in much of the controversy which has been generated by academics and the like.</P>
        <P>I am disgusted that NAMA has been deliberately depicted as a bailout for builders and developers.  It is nothing of the sort.  To suggest otherwise is to fail completely to understand NAMA and how it will work in principle and in practice.  The legal obligations of borrowers do not change in any way simply because the loans are transferred to NAMA.  It is NAMA&rsquo;s clear objective and duty to continue to manage these loans and to ensure that all the obligations of the borrowers are met in full.  Indeed, the Minister has said on several occasions that NAMA will be ruthless and relentless and will pursue every borrower, builder and developer alike, for every last cent they owe.  All borrowers will continue to owe what they owe until their debts are discharged in full and that is the way it should be.</P>
        <P>This Government is most certainly not in the business of rewarding failure or reckless borrowing and nobody but nobody will escape their legal and moral duties to the State.  They will continue to be liable for the entire face value of their loans and I heard the Minister state that he will consider pretty far-reaching penalties against any builders or developers who might default on these loans.  I hope the Minister will pursue this and that, if it is lawful, he will consider measures to curtail their future involvement in the building industry.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s attitude in his preparation of this legislation has been commendable and mature.  He has shown himself at all times to be amenable to proposals and possible amendments from the public and parties in this House.  He has engaged in a constructive process of consultation and dialogue with all interested people which is a very enlightened and pragmatic approach to such a fundamentally serious issue.  I hope the Opposition parties will respond and avail of the opportunity when this Bill reaches Committee State to put forward meaningful and concrete proposals to improve on the structure and the process which the Minister seeks to adopt in the nation&rsquo;s interest.</P>
        <P>In this respect, I welcome the proposal to introduce a substantial element of risk-sharing into the legislation.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P FLI="0">It is entirely fair and reasonable to apportion risk to the banks and to avoid any possibility of enriching shareholders.  After all, it is the banks&rsquo; shameful and naked avarice which has visited so many problems upon this nation and the ordinary taxpayer.  The banks engaged in a wild orgy of irresponsible and unscrupulous lending in the past several years.  Their behaviour and singular lack of any ethical standards are despicable and have served to compound many of the problems this recession has brought.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Not alone do I support the notion of risk-sharing for the banks if NAMA does not succeed fully, but I am also anxious to ensure the full rigours of the law are applied to all of those bankers who are found to be in breach of their duties.  I hope the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will be able to bring successful prosecutions through the courts against all of those who have violated the law in pursuit of profit, satisfying their naked greed without any regard to the catastrophic consequences of their willful deeds.  In a nutshell, I want to see them serving severe jail sentences where necessary.  We are all suffering the hangover which their scandalous orgy of greed has inflicted.  Risk-sharing is appropriate for the banks and custodial sentences are appropriate for those proved to have been engaged in criminal or fraudulent activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome that the Government is still considering the option of applying a levy on future profits of the banking industry to make up any shortfall if NAMA fails to break even over its lifetime.  We need a strong element of justice and fair play for the taxpayer in this entire process.</P><Col N="757"/>
        <P Just="Left">I have been disappointed by the tenor of the NAMA debate and the lack of any viable alternative being put forward.  There has been too much heat and not enough light in this discussion.  Ideas have been high on aspiration but sketchy on cost and detail.  In typical fashion, the Opposition has a problem for every solution.  It is noteworthy that a former Fine Gael Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and former party leader, Mr. Alan Dukes, have come forward in favour of NAMA, as has Mr. Ray MacSharry and many other prominent and respected business leaders, economists and commentators.</P>
        <P>The <i>Financial Times</i> is well-disposed to NAMA.  The current edition of <i>The Economist</i> describes the NAMA plan as seeming, &ldquo;like an advance over those in some countries&mdash;at least it gets something done.  America&rsquo;s scheme to buy toxic assets never got off the ground, while Germany&rsquo;s bad bank is so punitive that most banks would rather stop lending than turn to it for help.&rdquo;</P>

It is a harsh fact that our economy will not recover until the problems preventing the banks from lending money are resolved.  NAMA is our best option.  It will get credit flowing again in a way which will minimise the risks to the taxpayer and to the economy in general.</P>

	<P>Put simply, the NAMA figures do not stack up.  The first question to be addressed is whether this is a good deal for the taxpayer.  The best independent advice that I tend to rely on is from <i>The Economist</i>, already quoted by Deputy Aylward, which has a record of serious warnings over many years about the dangers of the Irish property bubble.  On the NAMA plan it recently stated, &ldquo;the Government seems to have erred on the side of favouring shareholders, largely to minimise the amount of capital it would have to inject into the banks&rdquo; and &ldquo;NAMA will still pay about &euro;7 billion more than the assets are actually worth.&rdquo;  It seems clear the taxpayer is expected to carry far too much of a burden for this bank rescue operation.</P>
        <P>I question the estimated current market value of the assets being acquired by NAMA at &euro;47 billion.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to the accompanying documentation, the Green Book, to see how this figure was calculated.  I do not have much faith in the valuation methodology.  What is clear, however, is that the proposed valuations are largely based on commercial property yields whereas a significant amount of the property is development land that may never yield anything other than if it reverts to agricultural use.  In the end it will be a matter of judgment for the valuers which will decide the figure for each asset.</P>
        <P>I well recall the controversy several years ago when I seriously questioned and strongly objected to what was presented by the then Government as the market value of the property being acquired at Thornton Hall.  A figure of &euro;200,000 an acre was paid for a property which I, and many people whose opinion I respect, valued at &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000 an acre.  This involved the taxpayer funding a purchase by the Government at a figure of &euro;30 million of a property which was probably worth no more than &euro;5 million.  Taking into account this record on valuation, there will have to be a hard cold appraisal with total transparency on the valuation process.</P><Col N="758"/>
        <P>The concept of long-term economic value is something I never encountered in many years of practical experience of dealing with property.  Market value has always been the price agreed between a willing seller and a willing buyer.  In that equation, likely future trends are factored in by both seller and buyer.  Beyond that the Government is talking of over-the-rainbow values.  It suggests the annual average increase provided for is modest enough but who knows whether current values are at their lowest and what will happen in the years ahead.  Neither has any account been taken of the cost of financing in the meantime, inevitable substantial interest rate increases or of the cost of maintaining property.</P>
        <P>If there were gold at the end of this over-the-rainbow approach, the taxpayer should now be making an advance payment against that possibility.  The Minister for Finance claims he is providing for the banks to take part of the payment by way of &euro;2.75 billion of subordinated debt.  Is there any reason, in fairness to the taxpayer, the banks should not carry the entire &euro;7 billion uplift from market to long-term economic value by way of subordinated debt?</P>
        <P>The Minister has argued such an approach could result in a greater capital requirement for the banks.  In an unscripted comment when he spoke on the Bill he said,&ldquo;The capital would require to be provided and have to be borrowed on world markets at current rates of 4%, far in excess of the 1.5% with which this paper can be traded in world markets&rdquo;.  However, he seems to have been comparing financial apples and oranges since the 1.5% money is short term for three to six months money whereas the 4% relates to three to five year money.</P>
        <P>An alternative approach might be for the State to underwrite a substantial rights issues by the banks but only at approximately 50 cent per share.  Bank shareholders would not be too pleased with such an approach but, at the same time, such a rights issue would have a substantial uptake.  The banks&rsquo; share prices would subsequently appreciate substantially in time giving rise to major gains for the taxpayer in respect of any portion of the share issue taken up by the State.</P>
        <P>I very much question the dependency created by NAMA being a continuing subsidiary of the National Treasury Management Agency.  These are clear grounds for conflict.  If NAMA is to proceed it may need to make unattractive decisions affecting lenders to the banks.  The National Treasury Management Agency may be conflicted by virtue of its continuing relationships with lenders to the State and agents of lenders to the State.</P>
        <P>If NAMA is to proceed, the language under section 2(b)(<i>i</i>), &ldquo;to facilitate the availability of credit in the financial markets in the State&rdquo;, should be amended to &ldquo;facilitate and direct in NAMA, or through participating institutions, new credit to high-quality persons and SME borrowers through the establishment of a department of NAMA devoted to such cause.&rdquo;  This would go some way towards achieving the objectives behind such proposals in the absence of the national recovery bank as proposed by Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>Many issues will arise on the legislation itself but one in particular stands out on its constitutionality, or lack thereof.  According to the Bill as drafted, if NAMA wants an acquired property sold on and wants to add in or create rights over adjoining land, it has the power to do so even though the owner of the adjoining land has no borrowing on it and is not involved with any bank or NAMA.  I foresee such an owner who objects to such a takeover going all the way to the Supreme Court on the issue and the protection of his rights which should not be affected.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has provided for an extraordinary range of powers for himself under this Bill.  Under 50 of the sections, nearly a quarter of the total, the Bill provides for different powers to be exercised by the Minister.  Many of these powers are appropriate for the <Col N="759"/>Minister while many are not.  This situation reinforces the case for an independent oversight body.  I have long held the view that there should be a separate Oireachtas committee with powers at least equivalent to those of the Committee of Public Accounts, preferably even stronger, and similarly chaired by the Opposition to oversee banking matters.  If the Government proceeds with NAMA it reinforces the case for such an approach.</P>
        <P>NAMA is like the emperor without clothes or at least with clothes that are not made to measure.  The NAMA figures do not stack up.  The prospective cost is too high for the taxpayer.  There should be a rational, balanced debate on this Bill.  Our aim should be to ensure that the exposure of the taxpayer is the minimum amount to get the banking system working again.  That will require a balanced approach with bank investors taking the main losses.  That is fundamental to the Fine Gael approach in this Bill.  If that approach is followed the exposure of the taxpayer will be minimised.  There must be some exposure but we want to ensure that it is minimised.  This Bill does not achieve that objective or the balanced approach I have outlined.  That is why I cannot support the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe for sharing time with me.  Over the past seven years many prominent economists, financial commentators and my colleague Deputy Richard Bruton repeatedly issued warnings about the property bubble which went unheeded and were even derided.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and other Ministers have regularly reminded us that &ldquo;we are where we are&rdquo;.  We must not forget, however, that the current proposers of NAMA put us where we are today, and claim that they can get us out of the mess they created.  Successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments worked hard to get us exactly where we are and to put the economy into its present mess.</P>
        <P>Now the Government proposes that the taxpayer take on all the liability of correcting the wrongs of successive Fianna F&aacute;il led Government and out-of-control and unregulated bankers.  The Minister has made two arguments for this Bill, that we cannot renege on the subordinated bond holders and that NAMA will get capital flowing in our economy.  These subordinated bond holders are in the main hedge fund managers who run high risk-high return funds.  They gambled on the Irish economy, and now that they have lost, the Government wants us, the taxpayers, to refund their bet.  That is what this Bill asks us to do.</P>
        <P>The other stated objective and main goal of NAMA is to get capital flowing into the economy.  It will not succeed in that.  The proposals that Fine Gael has put forward to establish a good wholesale bank will achieve that objective.  It will be at least the middle of 2010 before the acquisition of the assets by NAMA will have any impact on the lending capacity of the banks.  There is no guarantee that these funds will flow into the economy and support existing employment or create new jobs.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance claimed here last week that the 1.5% interest rate will force banks to lend.  He has failed, however, to acknowledge that he has already lent money to the banks through preference shares, through recapitalisation funds at 8%, with warrants giving the Government the right to convert these to ordinary shares if the banks do not redeem them in accordance with the terms and conditions as stated.  There is nothing in this legislation to prevent the banks from using the NAMA cash to redeem the preference shares, thus avoiding the payment of the 8% annual interest rate and ensuring that they make a tidy profit of 6.5% per annum.  The incentive is built in to redeem those preference shares the Government has already taken.</P><Col N="760"/>
        <P>As numerous speakers on all sides of the House have stated there is nothing in the legislation to stop the banks redeeming other longer-dated loans or more expensive financing already on their books.  There is no guarantee that this money will make capital flow.</P>
        <P>One of the most galling provisions in the Bill is that NAMA, and as a result the taxpayer, is taking over the cost of the repulsive bonuses and pensions paid to the directors of the banks who placed this country on the cusp of insolvency.  In normal circumstances, when a bank sells a loan asset, or a participation in a part of a transaction on its books, to another bank, the buyer, NAMA in this case, would look for and expect to receive a portion of the original arrangement or up-front fees charged to the borrower for putting the facility in place.  I have no doubt that with regard to all of the large facilities now up for transfer the original lenders had charged high up-front or arrangement fees which would have gone straight to the banks&rsquo; profit and loss accounts.  In the good times the banks would have generated large income from these fees and at least some of this was paid out in bonuses to senior management and directors of the banks.  The Minister and NAMA must at the very least take such fees into account in pricing the assets and make an appropriate deduction from the price.</P>
        <P>I understand the total cost of various fees, expenses of various kinds with the drawdown of the loans capitalised at time of drawdown, could be anywhere from &euro;0.5 billion or more.  That is a substantial sum in fees charged on these loans.  To compound that insult for which the taxpayer must foot the bill the NAMA legislation provides for the payment of bank fees for managing those toxic loans to the banks which made them.  The bankers will receive bonuses for managing those toxic loans so they will be paid on the double, having got their bonuses when they made the loans to developers.  They knew at the time that they were risky loans and now we will give them additional fees and bonuses to manage those bad debts.</P>
        <P>The biggest flaw in the Bill, from the point of view of the taxpayer, must be the omission of any provision to deal with the steps taken by developers to avoid their obligations given to the credit institutions by way of guarantee.  We have all read in the newspapers over recent months about certain developers or their corporate entities transferring properties which were held in their sole names, or were perhaps jointly held with their spouses, to the sole names of the spouses.  This has been brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance and his officials.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the Companies Act 1963 there is specific provision for the transfer of assets prior to the liquidation of a company.  This can go back to the preceding six months and covers any assets disposed of preferentially or any other assets that may have been available to the company.  There is no provision in this legislation for the disposal of such assets.  On 7 April the Minister announced his plan to introduce NAMA.  Since then he has made no attempt to close off that loophole.  Since 7 April, developers were given fair warning to transfer the assets out of their names, namely, those guaranteed assets that were given to the banks to ensure that they are not available to NAMA.  They can then draw upon them when the liability arises at some future date.  It is vitally important that changes are made to this legislation similar to those provisions made to the Companies Act 1963 to ensure these assets can be clawed back for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>My final point relates to the issue of risk sharing.  The Green Party claims that the provisions which were made regarding the new subordinated bonds will ensure that the banks will take part of the risk if the loan portfolio does not work out and if NAMA ends up losing out, as I believe it will.  What really frustrates me is that the structure proposed in the legislation means that participating banks, some of which have good loans included with the bad, and responsible banks that have ended up in difficulties regarding some of their loans which are now to be put into NAMA, will be lumped in with the likes of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  These had extremely dodgy loans.  The subordinated debt is structured in such a way that it is the <Col N="761"/>overall performance of the total NAMA portfolio, not the performance of the individual proportions of that portfolio that have been handed or sold to NAMA by the participating banks, which will define the redeeming value of those subordinated bonds.  It will cover up the bill for the likes of Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Banks whose bad loans must now be footed by each bank, even those that have been responsible.  Surely a better way to ensure that the taxpayer is protected would be for the taxpayer to take out ordinary shares in the banks.  If these then increase in value at least we will get some benefit from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sharing time with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Billy Kelleher, who will take over the debate tomorrow.  I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  I commend the Minister on publishing draft legislation as far back as 30 July, since there has been a very good debate, on the airwaves, in the print media and at the very long committee meeting some weeks ago during which the Minister gave details and answered many questions on the draft legislation.  It is fair to say that since then there has been much discussion on the legislation in every part of the country.</P>
        <P>I was glad about one thing the Minister did at the outset of these difficulties.  He introduced a State guarantee to the banking system which will be there until September 2012 and this got the support of many Deputies in the House.  Many of my constituents and others throughout the country were very concerned that there would not be a guarantee, especially for those who had savings in the financial institutions.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the greed that existed has led to many difficulties.   There was greed in the banking sector and among developers who believed that prices would continue to increase forever.  I did not know much about this and was not one of those who made prophecies about it.  Some years ago when I could see that powers were being taken away from the traditional bank manager&rsquo;s role I made a suggestion.  I spoke about rural Ireland in particular, where it seemed that the authority to sanction loans was taken away.  I saw many branches of the financial institutions closing down.  They were not closed because they were losing money but they were not making enough money to suit the CEOs and the people in the board rooms.  I offer the example of a modest service which closed down, the mobile Bank of Ireland in Connemara.  The Bank of Ireland in Glenamaddy closed and people were told to go to another county, Roscommon.  Allied Irish Bank in Mountbellew was closed.  It is very difficult to say to people that we want the banks to do business, to lend and have credit flowing when at the same time we see branches closing down and the whole banking structure moving farther and farther away from people.</P>
        <P>Not long afterwards the Permanent TSB announced that it too was doing away with its agencies, some 48 nationwide, eight of which were in County Galway.  We now have three left in the city and every other town and small village has lost the agency for Permanent TSB.  The ACC acted similarly and 16 jobs were lost in Tuam.  At a time when we are trying to hold on to jobs it is really disgraceful to have job losses in a situation whereby the ACC moved its business to Galway city.  It is sad that the city has to gain so much at the expense of the smaller towns.  If we talk about getting the entire banking system moving again we should look to hold on to these branches and agencies.  I praise the credit union movement which seems to increase its branches and its numbers.  The credit union is certainly more accessible for people who want to do business with it and long may that continue.  The credit union movement has the flexibility to open at times our banking branches are not open.</P>
        <P>I was glad to hear the Minister state that we are trying to get the banking system moving again.  He talked about how the recapitalisation of the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank went ahead and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank took place.  We needed to do this <Col N="762"/>because banks must have the funds to lend.  NAMA will be able to attract more funds from markets and we will be able help funding, which is a serious issue at the moment.  Any uncertainty about the banks&rsquo; balance sheets will be dealt with under this legislation.</P>
        <P>We received support from the European Central Bank.  Banks receive bonds that can be cashed at the ECB or on the world markets.  At a time when we are told we are borrowing &euro;400 billion a week, or &euro;57 million a day, to keep the country going, it is important that we have the facility to be able to deal with the European Central Bank.  That should be borne in mind by people who are thinking about which way they will vote in the second Lisbon referendum on 2 October because we must ensure we will be able to get those loans at a very good interest rate.</P>
        <P>When we spoke about having a banking system that is moving farther away from people, I thought of the rural transport scheme we have been discussing in our constituencies in recent times.  For many years people got free travel and did not use it because they were not able to avail of the services.  However, when the service comes under threat thanks to the McCarthy report people say, &ldquo;My God, are we going to lose something that we are just beginning to get used to?&rdquo;  I hope that will not be the situation with regard to the smaller branches of these banks, building societies and other financial institutions.</P>
       <P>The Minister spoke of the need for stimulus in the economy via the banking system.  NAMA will deliver that stimulus.  It is not bailing out the banks but is buying loans at a discount, as the Minister explained.  The banks and their shareholders will have to accept losses.  We should also say that NAMA is not bailing out builders.  It will move against any borrower who will not or cannot repay loans.  Borrowers will owe NAMA the same amount of money they would have owed the banks.   The Minister for Finance has kept a very cool head during this debate.  It has been a very difficult time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2009 to the House in my name and that of my Fine Gael colleagues.  If passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and enacted into law, it will bring about a radical reform in the way public bodies are governed and how they are held accountable to the representatives of the people.  In the past 12 years, there has been a massive proliferation in public bodies &mdash; agencies, boards, authorities, partnerships, commissions, regulators, quangos &mdash; whatever one wants to call them.  They exist at national, regional and local level.  Some bodies, such as the HSE and F&Aacute;S, control budgets of more than &euro;1 billion.  Many others such as Enterprise Ireland have budgets of more than &euro;100 million. There are more than 1,000 bodies and they account for almost half of all Government spending.  This Bill specifically applies to State agencies with budgets of more than &euro;1 million.</P><Col N="763"/>
        <P Just="Left">There are even sub-agencies of Government agencies.  Mr. Colm McCarthy claimed to have found &ldquo;agencies hiding behind other agencies&rdquo; or as Fine Gael described it in our Streamling Government paper, &ldquo;sons of quangos&rdquo;.  It still has not been possible for us to get a complete list of all Government bodies operating in the State.  At local level, many public bodies may have several funding sources, receiving money from one Department under one heading and another Department under another heading.  This is a corporate governance nightmare.</P>
        <P>Many public bodies do very valuable work.  For example, all of us will agree that F&Aacute;S does excellent work in running high quality apprenticeships and by providing supported employment in thousands of local communities through the community employment schemes.  No one disputes that.  Even the HSE, though much maligned, gets it right some of the time.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has reduced the cost of insurance and IDA Ireland has brought foreign direct investment into the State. The ongoing revelations about waste, mismanagement and profligate spending at F&Aacute;S, however,  have brought into sharp focus the need to do much more to hold to account public bodies.  It is clear that the board of F&Aacute;S did not do its job.  Board members were more concerned with representing their own sectoral interests than they were about ensuring the public interest and principles of good governance were served.  The F&Aacute;S executives who are most responsible for the money wasted and the damage done to F&Aacute;S as an organisation still have not been held to account.  The director general resigned but kept his pension and was given a golden handshake by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance on his way out the door.  Other F&Aacute;S executives also retired with their pensions and lump sum intact or still hold their positions.</P>
        <P>Public bodies like F&Aacute;S and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority might well be the worst examples of the public sector gone wrong.  They might be outliers, but they also might be the tip of the iceberg.  Either way, the time has come to embark on a programme of deep and meaningful reform.  This must involve three pillars.  The first is to rationalise and reduce the number of public bodies.  The second is to reform the structure of the boards so that appointments are vetted and scrutinised by the Oireachtas.  The third pillar is to make sure that public bodies are fully accountable to the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Government has, at long last, begun the process of rationalising and reducing the number of State agencies and public bodies.  This is welcome.  Its programme, however, is limited and lacks ambition.  Progress has been slow.  Less than half of the decisions announced by the Minister for Finance during the emergency budget speech have been acted on.  The Government is in the process of establishing a new quango, NAMA, and we have already seen mission creep set in with NAMA.  Initially, it was supposed to be an asset management agency, but now we are talking about giving it additional roles in social housing and so on.  The legislative programme contains proposals for new quangos including, for example, a new State agency to manage the Curragh of Kildare, but not the military aspects of it.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Government has yet to respond to the recommendations of the McCarthy report with regard to further rationalisation.  In our published policy papers, Streamlining Government and Power to the People, Fine Gael has outlined a far-reaching plan to cull, merge and rationalise more than 70 public bodies at national level.  We have also proposed bringing hundreds of local agencies, boards, committees and partnerships back under the remit of local government, where they belong.  Fine Gael believes in local government.  We want more local democracy with a wider remit and its own revenue raising powers.  We stand in opposition to the approach of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, who have consistently sought to bypass local authorities and to denude them of their powers.</P>
        <P>Ministers hold in their hands the power to appoint 6,000 people to positions on State boards.  Many of the people appointed to State boards are people of quality and calibre and they <Col N="764"/>deserve our thanks.  Some are associated with a particular political party.  I have no problem with this.  People should be rewarded for participating in the political process and it would be wrong to place a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around them to exclude them.  Of course, they must be qualified for the job.  Political affiliation should not be considered a qualification in itself, nor should the fact that one is a friend of the Taoiseach, as a former Taoiseach told us.  These 6,000 appointments are made in secret, without the involvement of the Oireachtas.  The Public Appointment Transparency Bill 2009 will change this.</P>
        <P>The Bill requires that the names and qualifications of appointees to the boards of public bodies must be laid before the D&aacute;il.  This will ensure that appointees are suitably qualified and that anyone nominated to the chair of a State board must first appear before the relevant Oireachtas committee, which will have the power to hold up the appointment if it is inappropriate.  This vetting process will enable members to question the new chairperson about his or her qualifications, experience and plans for the job.  This process is common in many other democracies, most notably, the US.  Furthermore, I propose that committees be restricted to asking questions that are relevant to the position, to avoid the prurient trawl of the personal lives of nominees which occurs in the US Senate.  We do not want that to happen here.</P>
        <P>The Bill enabling the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland contains one measure to allow Oireachtas committees to have some input into appointing half the members of that authority.  This is a welcome departure, but it is not enough.  It is only one agency out of 1,000, it represents only half the positions, and expecting a committee to come up with names is much more complex than asking the Minister to do so and leaving it to the committee to vet them.</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2009 also requires that all members of State boards should be given a letter of appointment clearly stating their responsibilities. It is extraordinary that people can be still appointed to positions of responsibility without being given clear terms of reference.  To quote a well known RTE television programme, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t learn the rules and you can&rsquo;t be accused.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2009 also improves the capacity of the Oireachtas and its committees to hold State agencies to account on a regular basis.  It gives committees the power to summon chairpersons of State boards to give evidence and requires that they appear before Oireachtas committees to present their annual report and annual accounts.  The Bill provides for real powers of scrutiny, the kind currently exercised only by the Public Accounts Committee.  It gives our parliamentary committees teeth and allows us to do the job the public expects us to do, but which has not been done in the past 12 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The economic crisis should cause us all to question the old certainties and long-held beliefs.  I firmly believe that if our political process and Parliament had functioned more effectively in the past we would not face today a deficit so large, a banking system so broken or a public sector so difficult to reform.  We should use this crisis as an opportunity to change the way politics and public administration function.  We should use it to restore public confidence in Parliament, in politics and in Government.  We should bring about a democratic revolution involving fundamental reforms to the way the D&aacute;il and Seanad work and are elected, the way political parties are funded, the way local government raises its revenue and exercises its powers, and the way public officials are held to account.  The Public Appointment Transparency Bill 2009 forms just one part of that democratic revolution and I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this proposal.  For far too long, we have people on boards not just due to political persuasion, but also due to favours that have been done.  In Fine Gael, we believe people who are competent and qualified for the task should be appointed to boards.</P><Col N="765"/>
        <P>Millions of euro are expended by the National Roads Authority but it is answerable to no one.  If I ask a Parliamentary Question about a by-pass or a road I am told it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Transport but of the National Roads Authority, the board of which is appointed.  Who are these appointees?  Vacancies on boards should be advertised in local and national newspapers and on the Government website.  People of competence, regardless of their political affiliations, should be appointed to such boards.  It is galling that although the Minister has no responsibility for the National Roads Authority, he is the first man on the scene, with his cronies, to cut the tape at the opening of a new road.  That is wrong.  Such bodies should be accountable to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food gives millions of euro to Teagasc.  Last week, I asked a question about the future of the Boyle Teagasc office.  I was told that was not the responsibility of the Minister and advised to contact Teagasc.  This is not good enough.  There are more than 600 boards and quangos.  I accept that we need some boards and that some board members are qualified and have given great service to the State.  We must be, however, open and transparent.  Appointments should not be political gestures or gifts, and that is what they are.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people want more local involvement in State boards.  They want board members to have the required skills and independent assessment.  A board should be established to assess the make-up of State boards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the United Kingdom there is a code of practice for ministerial appointments to public bodies.  It analyses the potential for conflict of interest which may arise from making appointments.  The code identifies the five issues most frequently encountered.  One is relationships and associations, including friendships, and the potential for such to influence actions or to be perceived as doing so.  Other disqualifying grounds include the potential perception of the appointment as a reward for past or future contributions or favours in circumstances where an awareness of pending Government policy arising from a board position could represent an unfair advantage for those with related business interests.</P>
        <P>We are very close to a one-party state.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been in power for 23 of the past 25 years.  They have used boards to exert much influence.  Some 600 boards and between 6,000 and 7,000 members are appointed to public bodies.  This is undermining our constitutional democracy.</P>
        <P>The Government must accept this very important proposal.  By looking into their souls, they will see that the people want transparency and openness.  The people cannot know what is going on when bodies are run by ministerial appointees.  Before the last Taoiseach left office many dozens of  people were appointed to various boards.  Some of these appointments have not been a great success and have done the country a great disservice.</P>
        <P>Former members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la were re-appointed as outside nominees.  Does this mean the board will continue unchanged forever?  If rules are undermined and individuals can change rules to suit themselves, a board will never change.  Boards are like football teams.  They need young new talent, regardless of political persuasion.  I do not mind if someone is a supporter of the Government as long as he or she is open, transparent and qualified to do the job on behalf of the people.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy Varadkar on bringing this Bill before the D&aacute;il.  We have seen boards which were rubber stamps for Government policy.  They hid the fact that Ministers should have been responsible for certain areas.  Matters were passed to boards which should have been decided by the Government or the Oireachtas.  That is not government.  Deputies are elected by the people and ministers are appointed to make decisions.  They cannot hide behind boards <Col N="766"/>whose members are political supporters and unqualified and who are expected to take the flak when times are difficult.</P>
        <P>The same is true of the Health Service Executive.  If one writes to the HSE with a query about a hospital or similar matter one must wait three weeks for a reply.</P>
        <P>It worries me that if one wants something done in Ireland one has to ask a member of a board.  Although these members are not elected by the people they are the people who have the power.  The Government has given power to unelected people who are faceless and not answerable to anybody.  Unless that perception changes the majority of good honourable, hard working and qualified board members will all be tarred with the same brush.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is said there are the appointed and the elected and the only people whom the public get a chance to punish are the elected.  This is something we all know because we confront it every time we go before the people.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy Varadkar on bringing this Bill before the House.  The former Taoiseach defended appointments he made by saying the appointees were not people who gave his party money but were friends of his.  It says much that this was regarded as the lesser of two evils.  The first requirement of any appointee is that he or she is qualified and able to do the job, whatever it is.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the history is written of how successful Fianna F&aacute;il has been in staying in power it will consider how the party manipulated the appointments of people to State boards.  There was a continuous stream of appointments.  There are approximately 7,000 Government appointed members of State boards earning between &euro;9,000 and &euro;19,000.  If they were all doing their jobs and were seen to be qualified for those jobs that would not be an issue.  The big issue is that these appointments are being used to control a networking system right down to ground.  A follow-on from this has been the way partnership has been manipulated.  It was set up in the late 1980s as part of the road map for recovery.  Unfortunately, it became the road map for survival for the Government parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The days of jobs for the boys and girls, especially if they have given money to the main political party, must end.  We have a political establishment which is probably at an all-time low in the opinion of the public.  We cannot allow this carry-on to continue.  It does not help the work of public representatives or of State boards to read of what has happened in agencies such as F&Aacute;S and the Office of the Financial Regulator.  Even the Health Service Executive now wishes to centralise everything.  Medical cards are now administered centrally in Finglas while the former Minister for Finance decided that everything should be decentralised.</P>
        <P>There is a contradiction in the way in which we have tried to run our administration.  In particular, front line services have been removed from the people.  I am unsure about by whom the public accountability agenda has been written, but that accountability has been removed from front line services.  This has been evident in the health services, where there has been a deterioration in how they are being run and in the ability to put vital local services on the ground.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposal is similar to that of the Green Party except that it puts the onus of approving appointments on the relevant Oireachtas committee, not an all-party committee.  It is not a major change, but I hear that the Green Party will state that we are not going far enough.  No one else seems to be going anywhere with it currently.  By its name, this Bill makes the point that we are trying to ensure that every appointment stands up to scrutiny.  There can be no hiding ground for the cronies of whoever of us is in power.  It is not too much to ask that they have the relevant aptitude for the job.</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>I do not know what excuse will be tabled to amend the Bill and weasel out of it.  I do not see where is the wriggle room.  Last week, the home defence Bill was knocked on its head and had holes picked in it.  It could have been amended, as there were no serious problems.  Unfortunately, last night saw the high-profile and tragic death of a burglary victim.  Perhaps high profile cases are necessary.</P>
        <P>The Government is sending the wrong signals.  It must listen to what is being said.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal is a commonsensical Bill intended to restore confidence in the system.  This is all that we are asking.  Fault cannot be found with anything in the Bill, but I would be interested in seeing how the Government will amend it.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Government accept the Bill, which was tabled in good faith.  Time and again, the Opposition is told to be more productive and progressive.  When we try to do that, it is like hitting a brick wall.

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are sent by the people as representatives to do a number of jobs, one of the most important being to represent the citizen, namely, Mrs. Murphy down the road or the man up the road who has a problem with bureaucracy or the State and who needs help.  We are also sent to the House to legislate and to hold the Government of the day to account.  This responsibility rests on the shoulder of every Deputy, no matter on which side of the House he or she sits.  The structures and procedures of the House are so archaic that they prevent Members from doing this constitutional job.</P>
        <P>Ministers are powerful and have been given authority and responsibility, but with that comes accountability.  In recent years, Governments and Departments have been establishing quangos that are not directly accountable to the House, particularly through the parliamentary question system.  Today, I submitted a written question to the Minister for Education and Science on behalf of a child with special needs who has no school place.  I was told to write to the agency, as the Minister had no responsibility for the matter.  This is not good enough.  We could go on about those times when the Ceann Comhairle returns our requests and we are told that a Minister has no responsibility for a matter and that it is now the responsibility of the HSE, National Roads Authority, F&Aacute;S and so on.  These quangos are responsible for spending millions, if not billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money, but we, the people&rsquo;s representatives, cannot get answers about their operations via parliamentary questions.</P>
        <P>Since entering the House, I have asked that this system be changed.  At least Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke tried when she was a Minister.  While she would tell the House that she was not responsible for the day-to-day operation of some agency, she would give the information that the Deputy wanted and it was put on the record.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The establishment of the HSE has meant that we cannot directly represent citizens through parliamentary questions.  As my colleagues have pointed out, that agency shields the Minister for Health and Children.  She tells us that it, rather than she, is responsible.  The agency writes to us privately after, as my colleague mentioned, three or four weeks or, in some cases, 18 weeks.  The real trick is that the response does not go on the public record.  We are supposed to be a republic, but the information is a secret, if one likes, between the agency and the Deputy, if he or she even gets a response.  Our friends in the Fourth Estate and the public are denied the information.  Doing this is dangerous.</P><Col N="768"/>
        <P>A part of the reason for our current economic mess is the fact that Deputies were not allowed to do their jobs because of the manner in which procedures have been allowed to develop.  It is important that we shake up the political and democratic systems so as that we can ask questions of Ministers and get responses in the House.  A Department&rsquo;s first reaction seems to be to determine how not to answer a question or how to give the least amount of information.  This culture must change.  It is not good enough in our democracy.  If we are a democracy, we must allow information to flow.</P>
        <P>The NRA takes land from people via compulsory purchase orders.  They wait and wait to get paid.  When we write to the NRA, the letters in reply tell us that these matters are being considered and that responses will issue in due course.  When we ask a Minister a question, it will not even get to him or her.  This is not good enough, but it goes on in most of the agencies in question.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill.  It is a start, but much more needs to be done.  We must move away from appointing people to State boards because they are friends of the Minister of the day.  We must know their qualifications.  They must do their jobs and be accountable to the House.  Ministers must do their jobs because they have the authority to tell agencies to give them the information for which they have been asked and to provide it in the D&aacute;il.  If Ministers are afraid to do this, they should resign their positions, since this is their ultimate responsibility to the State&rsquo;s citizens.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, for presenting this important Bill to the House.  The incredible position that pertained in respect of the F&Aacute;S board and the paralysis of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in taking action have been the most recent of a litany of cronyism, abuse of expenses and incompetence on State boards, matters addressed in detail by previous speakers.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most divisive and contentious board in the history of the State has been the HSE, which has acted as a buffer for the Department of Health and Children, effectively causing important issues to fall between two stools and blocking Members&rsquo; queries.  With money being poured into an excessively top heavy organisation and promised reductions in administrative staff failing to be carried through, the concerns of patients are being pushed to one side.  I am outraged that hospital consultants, for example, have received an increase of &euro;25,000 on salaries of &euro;225,000 while services at the Midland Regional Hospital in my area and other health facilities countrywide have been cut at great risk to patients&rsquo; lives.  This wonderful top-up is costing the taxpayer &euro;140 million.</P>
        <P>Talk of hospital consultants reminds me of a telephone call I received this morning from a person complaining about the HSE and the matter of the ghost consultant in the midlands.  It appears that Mullingar Regional Hospital, sanctioned either by the Minister for Health and Children or the HSE, is making appointments with a dermatology consultant that are cancelled at the last minute.  The hospital has no such position.  What sort of board stands over such playing with people&rsquo;s lives?  How can a patient be strung along while his or her life is being endangered?  On having been approached on the matter, the hospital spokesperson said she was &ldquo;acting in good faith&rdquo;.  However, she refused to say who had sanctioned such a scam or how the misleading of vulnerable patients can be regarded as acting in &ldquo;good faith&rdquo;.  On being approached by my caller, neither the HSE nor the Minister&rsquo;s office replied to the query.  This is what parliamentarians in this House are up against.  With the public being held to ransom by the shady actions of the HSE, questions need to be asked.  Legislation such as this Bill is urgently needed to sort out such abuses.</P><Col N="769"/>
        <P>While reining in the directors of State bodies, legislation is needed to ensure that cronyism becomes a thing of the past.  This is what the public is crying out for.  Appointees to boards must be qualified to deliver a service to the public that is above reproach.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s democracy is under threat from the growing concentration of power vested in spin doctors surrounding the Taoiseach and Ministers and the rise in the number of highly influential political staffers and quangos.  The influence of Deputies in daily decision making and policy making has diminished significantly as quangos are taking over their duties.  There has been a huge increase in the number of political staffers in this House, even in the past five or six years.  This trend really arose when Deputy Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach.  He employed staff of all kinds.  There was not even accommodation in this House for many of the staff and advisers brought in under his reign.  This trend has continued under the present Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, despite the recession.  This is removing power from the politicians in this House, who are elected by and for the people.</P>
        <P>It should be remembered that spin doctors, political advisers and quangos are not elected.  They are not subject to any rules of law of which I am aware and, more important, they do not answer to the electorate.  When something goes wrong &mdash; such as the cancer care crisis in the health service, the dreadful wastage associated with the electronic vote management system and PPARS or the fiasco associated with the driver testing regulations &mdash; nobody is held responsible.  The taxpayer must bear the brunt and pay for the mistakes the Government has made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This trend, which has accelerated over the past ten years, is now posing a danger to Ireland&rsquo;s democracy.  It leaves the door open to nod-and-wink style political interference in the day-to-day administration of Government programmes.  It brings about circumstances involving jobs for the boys, which circumstances are all too prevalent.  In the case of the National Consumer Association, it brings about controversial jobs for the girls or, rather, girl.  Such scandals, which are brought about by Fianna F&aacute;il and which are rampant, are destroying elements of society.  My views are based on public opinion as well as cross-constituency and cross-county conversations with representatives from the private and public sectors, in addition to the public, that is, our electorate.</P>
        <P>The appalling state of affairs associated with the running of and appointment to public bodies calls into question the Standards in Public Office Commission, and the implementation of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 in so far as they apply to the officeholders in prescribed State bodies.</P>
        <P>It is alarming to hear of some of the big builders whom the State has bailed out making statements in the D&aacute;il bar and elsewhere that they have more influence on taoisigh than Ministers.  What sort of country have we when we allow this to develop?  This has been well documented in the media.  We have all heard of similar cases.</P>
        <P>It is undoubtedly true that under the protected tenure of the current Government, cronyism has led to abuses in the appointments and actions of board members.  In many ways they have been above regulation, thus making the Bill before us one of the most important to be before the Oireachtas in recent years.</P>
        <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on having put great thought and energy into this Bill over the summer months.  I hope common sense will prevail in this Chamber over the next two days and that the Bill will be placed on the Statute Book as practical law that will deal with the cronyism that was started 20 years ago when Fianna F&aacute;il took over.  Fianna F&aacute;il is guilty and its members should hang their heads in shame for the way they have lowered the status of this Parliament and for the way they have behaved to the citizens of this State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, Michael Ahern, Se&aacute;n Ardagh and Mattie McGrath.</P>
        <P>While I would like to compliment Deputy Leo Varadkar on his initiative in drafting and tabling a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, and on the discussion to which it gives rise, I will be opposing it on behalf of the Government.  I have listened carefully to the contribution of the Deputy to this important policy debate.  We all want to promote the public interest.  Our respective views of how best to do this may differ.</P>
        <P>There are undoubtedly diverging views on the relationship and role of the executive arm of the State and the Legislature.  There are those who take the view that State appointments belong to the powers of the Executive, as the Constitution suggests, and those who believe that the Houses should play a determining part in this.  It is not always easy to reconcile these views.  It would be interesting to see whether the same position would still be adopted by the Deputy&rsquo;s party were it to find itself on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House proposes that Oireachtas committees scrutinise all ministerial nominees to the positions of chairman and chief executive of statutory agencies and public bodies, as defined, that receive more than &euro;1 million in public funding.</P>
        <P>There are a number of concerns regarding the Bill.  It involves the Oireachtas taking executive functions onto itself in vetting and confirming appointments to State boards and it cuts across the normal corporate governance arrangements for boards to appoint chief executive officers.</P>
        <P>The normal process is for Ministers to propose appointments to the boards of State bodies, which often proceed by way of memorandum to Government and are discussed before decisions are made.  Obviously Ministers can be questioned and held responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas to justify their appointments.</P>
        <P>In making board appointments, Ministers seek to ensure the people appointed bring a diverse range of relevant skills and experiences to the body.  These decisions are normally approached in a conscientious manner, following consultation, and usually take time.  The ministerial freedom to make appointments is not unfettered.  Ministers must take account of any specific legislative requirements that exist, such as requirements to appoint worker directors or representatives of nominating bodies, equality legislative provisions, and relevant Government policies, such as the policy on gender balance on State boards.  Increasingly, the governing legislation prescribes the desirable attributes for board members.</P>
        <P>Many appointees are people not primarily political at all, but who have specific expertise in the field in question.  Sometimes figures associated with Opposition parties are appointed, such as a former Fine Gael leader of the Seanad chosen as first head of the Irish Human Rights Commission.  We have also recently seen cross-party appointees to banks and financial institutions.  We seek and need the brightest and the best on such bodies at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many fine and public-spirited citizens who have contributed to State boards and who continue to do so under the current allegedly flawed system.  In the past, the system may not always have been as focused on professional capacity as it has become now.  However, there has been a necessary improvement in the calibre of appointees in the recent past.  From the point of view of the nominees, given the level of public scrutiny today and the onerous responsibilities of directors, acceptance of a position as a chairman or board member is not to be entered into lightly.  Nominees need to be confident of their professional capacity to serve.</P><Col N="771"/>
        <P>A particular aspect of this proposal that could cause concern is the number of perfectly acceptable candidates who otherwise may have considered accepting an appointment to a board but who may be discouraged by the prospect of presenting his or her credentials in a public forum before an Oireachtas committee.</P>

	<P>Go on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We may not be pleased with this argument but we must weigh the risk.  We should be careful about what process is most conducive to getting the sort of people we seek to serve on State boards in the public interest.  In this regard, the House will be aware of the measures which it recently passed for board appointments to public broadcasting corporations in the recently enacted Broadcasting Act.  Under these provisions, the joint Oireachtas committee will be able to recommend up to one third of the candidates for membership of the RTE board.  These arrangements were well debated in the House and a balance was struck in the final provisions of the Act, which does not involve the vetting process for nominees proposed in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of chief executive officers the board involved makes the selection, a normal corporate governance arrangement.  The appointment is usually advertised.  The board may choose to use the services of a senior executive recruitment agency, especially in the case of a large organisation operating in a complex environment.  In fact, the Public Appointments Service recruits to senior positions in the HSE, the HIQA, local authorities and the vocational educational committees.  Recent appointments include the national director of human resources in the HSE, the chief executive of the Dublin Transportation Authority, the director of the EPA and director general of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>State boards are accountable to the Minister and the Departments they serve.  The annual reports and, where applicable, statements of strategy of such bodies are first examined by the parent Department involved and then presented to Government before publication.  Salient issues are brought to the attention of Government in the memorandum submitting the accounts.  In this way, the responsible Minister may give an account to his or her colleagues of the bodies under the aegis of his or her Department.  The annual reports and accounts of State bodies are then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>If State bodies are companies, they are subject to the corporate governance provisions of the Companies Acts, which have been greatly expanded in the past 20 years.  All State bodies must have regard to the corporate governance guidelines set out in the <i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies</i> promulgated by the Minister for Finance, the most recent version of which is dated May 2009.  This comprehensive code reinforces the requirement for high standards of corporate governance in all State agencies, whether in the commercial or non-commercial sphere.  State bodies and their subsidiaries are required to confirm to the relevant Minister that they comply with the up-to-date requirements of the code in their governance practices and procedures.  The latest version includes proposals made by the Public Accounts Committee in its report on F&Aacute;S earlier this year.  This shows that the system is responsive to the concerns of the Oireachtas and that it can take speedy action to absorb Members&rsquo; recommendations designed to improve the standards of governance of State bodies.</P>
        <P>There are myriad State bodies identified in the Deputy&rsquo;s publication of 2008, in which he proposes a wholesale culling of State bodies.  While he may, rightly, take the view that there are too many such bodies, he cannot seriously put the view that many or most of such bodies are unreformed or lack probity in how they carry out their tasks.  The terminology referring to State boards in the Bill can cover areas such as local authorities, harbour authorities, hospitals, universities, industrial development and non-commercial State bodies.  I envisage a total over<Col N="772"/>load for Oireachtas committees dealing with all these, and issues arising concerning independence and academic freedom in some cases.  Must we go to all these lengths and to risk unnecessarily politicising every State appointment for years to come?</P>
        <P>The impact on the conduct of Oireachtas business by taking on executive functions in addition to its legislative and parliamentary scrutiny obligations would be vast, not least given the number of such State bodies and agencies.  It is laudable to seek transparency and balance in the matter of public appointments, but it is questionable whether the proposed system would be workable.  It is also questionable whether it would deliver the right candidates to the State boards or guarantee that the boards involved would perform better than those currently in place.</P>
        <P>It is now common practice to prescribe in the legislation for a State agency that the chief executive will be the accountable person to the Committee of Public Accounts in its examination of reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is an important component in enhancing standards of corporate governance and exposing lapses to the full glare of publicity and probing questioning.  Examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General may be scrutiny after the event, but it has a demonstration effect and underlines the public accountability attaching to these bodies.  No doubt others will proceed with caution, when they witness State bodies being brought to account where there have been weak controls or mismanagement of resources.</P>
        <P>With reference to performance matters, irrespective of the manner of appointment of its members, the board ultimately reports to the relevant Minister and to his or her Department.  This is an area of oversight that deserves attention and strengthening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The call by the OECD for improved governance arrangements for the public service is supported by the Government.  In this regard, it is not merely the manner of appointments that matters but the quality of the framework in place for governance and reporting.  The follow-up Report of the Task Force on the Public Service was published last November.  The report built on the findings of the OECD review, while at the same time taking account of the new economic circumstances.  It set out a three-year framework, which the Government has adopted, for what amounts to a radical transformation of the public service.  In the case of State bodies, it is proposed that Ministers will be required to demonstrate a clear business case for any incremental resources associated with the creation of a new agency or the conferring of new functions on an existing agency and, in particular, why an existing agency or Department cannot take on a given task with existing resources.  All agencies will be required to publish output statements relating to the resources allocated along with target achievements.  Departments will put in place, with those agencies involved in service provision, service level agreements which commit agencies to delivering agreed volumes and standards to the public.  All this means more supervision, more accountability and more transparency.  In this light, it is not clear that it is necessary to add the extra layers of oversight proposed in the Bill.  The current arrangements, which follow the practice of previous Governments, have generally worked well, and the State benefits from people with skill and experience serving on State boards.</P>
        <P>Earlier, I referred to the change made by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the role of the Oireachtas relating to RTE, which seeks to strike a balance between the interests of the executive and legislative branches of the State.  In another sector, the Minister for Transport has invited expressions of interest from suitable candidates for appointment to the new Dublin Transportation Authority.  For reasons of sound public interest, the Government is therefore opposing this Bill.</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>In response to the remarks of Deputy Bannon, and as a former spin doctor and adviser but one who is now an accountable Minister of State, the system of policy advisers was introduced by a former leader of the Deputy&rsquo;s party, namely, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  I am proud to have contributed in that capacity as part of a longer period of public service, although I never regarded myself as a spin doctor.  However, they have a role to play and they will have a role to play in any Government of which the Deputy may be part.</P>

However, I do not know if this is the case everywhere else.  In his day, Deputy Mansergh was a wonderful adjunct to several prime ministers and taoisigh of various persuasions.

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;such work may not have been able to be fulfilled.  Be that as it may, Deputy Varadkar is to be commended on introducing this legislation.  It had its genesis in an all-party Seanad report from 2004.  Deputy Brian Hayes, who was then a Senator, was involved, along with Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, me and former Senator John Dardis.  We had a Labour representative but as the debate went on he decided not to continue, which was his prerogative.</P>
        <P>We brought forward a very well-thought out and well-focused Seanad report, of which we have heard no more but within that report Deputy Brian Hayes put forward a motion somewhat similar to what has been put forward here by Deputy Varadkar.  There is much good in it.  As Deputy Mansergh said, in the intervening time changes have been made to the appointments system which allow much greater transparency and accountability.  I was glad to hear that the present Minister for Transport has sought expressions of interest from people willing and wishing to serve on the Dublin Transport Authority, which is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I remember when I was involved in the Department dealing with public enterprise and the board of the ESB was due to be renewed or replaced.  All of the people on the board approached me and there was a very fine woman member who was affiliated to the Labour Party.  That was well known and she had been appointed by the previous Minister, a member of the Labour Party.  I was quite happy to renew her membership, although sadly she passed away some time after that while in her prime.  She was a very fine person and I knew her to be a very good appointee to the board.  There was no reason for her not to remain on it.</P>
        <P>Such a situation often occurs.  I listened to Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s contribution from my office and thought him to be very measured in his comments.  I thought the Opposition indicated that if only it could get into power, it would put all kinds of fine people on boards.  There is no doubt about that.</P><Col N="774"/>
        <P>I have several demands for this legislation.  Any person to be appointed should be qualified, capable, adaptable and intelligent, which is not too much to ask.  The qualification should be relevant to the sphere of activity where the person is asked to serve.  The person should be accountable to the chairman and the Minister of the day.  That is recognised and would be applauded.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is responsible to the D&aacute;il.  The appointment of CEOs should be a matter for the board.  For members of a board it would be better if the system was more open and accountable and members should have expertise particular to the work of the board to which they are being appointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to the key provisions of Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill, placing in the public domain names of ministerial nominees to statutory agencies would not be a problem because they are public anyway.  I have experience of appointing people to boards over the past 28 years and in considering the plethora appointed, particularly to senior positions, it is clear they are highly-qualified people.  In many cases they were not members of my party or Fine Gael when it was in government.  People with necessary qualifications got the important job of chairman or chief executive.</P>
        <P>The Bill takes no account of the substantial differences between the processes of appointment of the chairman and CEO.  Under legislation the appointment of the chairman is the prerogative of the Minister of the day and it is the responsibility of the Government to appoint a chairman.  The appointment of the CEOs and senior executives is a specialised task usually reserved for the board and undertaken in conformity with corporate best practice.  As we all know this is done via open competition in most cases or through the use of professional recruitment agencies or the Public Appointments Service.  As the Minister of State mentioned, recent appointments such as the director general of F&Aacute;S, the CEO of the Dublin Transport Authority and the director of the Environmental Protection Agency were carried out according to those rules and regulations.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the distribution of the powers and responsibilities under the Irish Constitution, it does not appear appropriate that functions such as those described which are appropriate to the Executive should be assumed by the Legislature.  There may also be significant impacts on the conduct of Oireachtas business arising from the D&aacute;il taking on these functions in addition to its other legislative and parliamentary scrutiny obligations.  There is no doubt that there would be plenty of discussions on political appointments and so on if that system was in operation.</P>
        <P>The model in the United States, where nominees for appointments to senior positions in agencies are confirmed after hearings at the relevant committee in Congress, has been cited as a model to follow.  From the experience in the US, many desirable candidates are reluctant to subject themselves to the scrutiny of a parliamentary committee and the uncertainty of a protracted public confirmation process.</P>
        <P>The changes recently introduced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the system of appointments to certain bodies under the auspices of his Department already represent a middle way between the traditional methods of filling positions on the boards of State agencies and demand for greater transparency and an increased role for the legislature in such appointments.  The Minister for Transport also advertised generally for <Col N="775"/>expressions of interest from suitable candidates when filling vacancies on the board of the Dublin Transport Authority earlier this year.</P>
        <P>The review by the OECD of the Irish public service published in 2008 recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, strengthening of the governance framework between Ministers and State bodies.  A task force established by the Taoiseach on foot of the review set out a three-year framework which the Government has adopted for transformation of the public service.  The Department of Finance will lead the development of models of performance in governance frameworks, covering the issues raised by the OECD, including the role and function of the boards of State bodies.  It is premature to make further changes to the system of appointment of the chairpersons and CEOs of statutory agencies in advance of and without reference to this work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be able to contribute to the Second Reading of Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill, which he initially introduced last year.  It is barely a year in the House.  I notice from the Deputy&rsquo;s speech today that he has matured a bit politically over the past year, and it is a steep learning curve in this House.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Deputy stated that people in the political process deserve to be rewarded for their participation if qualified and able for the job.  On the issue of whether a person should be examined before a committee, I agree with his statement that there should not be a prurient trawl through the personal life of an applicant.  In the past year the Deputy has learned that these processes are easier said than done.  I doubt that the same Bill would be produced today as would have been produced a year ago.  With regard to his statement on whether people deserve to be rewarded for their participation, does the proposer of the Bill perceive that in the future he may be in a position to favour certain political associates?</P>
        <P>The point relating to subjecting an applicant to a prurient trawl in respect of his or her personal life is extremely important.  There is no way people will come before D&aacute;il committees and subject their personal lives to scrutiny under the political microscope.  This is particularly true when one considers how political parties currently operate.  It was interesting to watch the confirmation proceedings relating to the appointment of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the US Supreme Court.  During those proceedings, the Republicans and Democrats were openly at war in respect of her appointment.  The Republicans sought information in respect of Judge Sotomayor&rsquo;s views on race, immigration, gun law, etc., while the Democrats sought to give her credit and applaud her for her efforts in the past.</P>
        <P>People who come before committees receive training from communications companies in respect of what not to say and the questions they should avoid answering.  In addition, these individuals are also studying the areas that are of interest to committee members in order that they might anticipate the type of questions that might arise.  For example, if a member might supports Israel or Palestine in the Middle East crisis, those being questioned will seek evidence of his or her views to anticipate how a discussion might develop.  It is not a matter of members asking questions and obtaining information, instead it is a matter of a person seeking to be, for example, confirmed for a position trying to minimise the impact the proceedings will have on him or her.</P>
        <P>Adopting good corporate governance is of the utmost importance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, referred to last year&rsquo;s report from the OECD and the effect it is having on the Government.  The latter should set a minimum standard in respect of the qualifications and ability &mdash; in respect of a person&rsquo;s level of corporate expertise, his or her leadership qualities and his or her knowledge of good corporate governance &mdash; it expects from those nominated to serve as chairpersons or board members.  I commend the Ministers for Communications, <Col N="776"/>Energy and Natural Resources and Transport, Deputies Ryan and Dempsey, on the initiatives they have taken in this regard.</P>
        <P>There must be good governance at the top because this will filter down through the management systems and make a body effective and efficient.  As far as customers and clients are concerned, good value must be provided.  Those who are chosen to serve as chairpersons and chief executives must adopt the high standards relating to good corporate governance.</P>
        <P>I strongly agree with the principle behind section 5(1) of the Bill.  When the Government and the Departments have had the opportunity to examine the annual accounts, reports and programmes put forward by State bodies, these documents should be laid before the relevant Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate Deputy Varadkar on introducing the Bill at this opportune time.  The Green Party is currently involved in discussions with Fianna F&aacute;il on the new plans for Government and has already raised the issue of public appointments.  Deputy Varadkar has jumped on the bandwagon in that regard and more power to him.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I also compliment Deputy Varadkar on his initiative in bringing forward this legislation.  I wish to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, a colleague of mine in the South Tipperary constituency, on the role he played as an adviser to many former taoisigh and various Departments before becoming a Member of the Houses.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that Oireachtas committees should scrutinise all ministerial nominees for the positions of chairman and chief executive of statutory agencies and public bodies which receive more than &euro;1 million &mdash; a considerable amount of money &mdash; in public funding.  A number of concerns arise in respect of the Bill, which involves the Oireachtas taking executive functions onto itself in vetting and confirming appointments to State boards and cuts across the normal corporate governance arrangements for such boards in respect of the appointment of chief executive officers.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, as everyone is aware, we have been let down by a few individuals.  There are many hundreds of decent and honourable people who serve on State boards, who give freely of their time and expertise and who bring to those boards a broad range of diverse ideas.  The normal process is for Ministers to propose appointments to the boards of State bodies.  These appointments often proceed by way of memoranda to Government and are discussed before decisions are made.  Ministers can be questioned and held accountable by the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of such appointments and can be asked to justify them.</P>
        <P>In making appointments to boards, Ministers seek to ensure that those who are nominated to serve bring with them the best range of relevant skills and experience required by a particular body.  These decisions are normally approached in a conscientious manner, following consultation, and usually take time to complete.</P>
        <P>Ministers are not completely unfettered in the context of making appointments.  They must take account of any specific legislative requirements that exist.  I refer here to requirements relating to the appointment of worker directors or representatives of nominating bodies, the provisions contained in the equality legislation and relevant Government policies, such as those relating to the need for gender balance on State boards.  Increasingly, governing legislation prescribes desirable attributes in respect of prospective board members.</P>
        <P>As already stated, there are many fine and public-spirited citizens who contributed to State boards in the past and who continue to do so under the current, allegedly flawed, system.  In the past, that system may not always have been as focused on professional capacity as is the <Col N="777"/>case at present.  However, the necessary improvement in the calibre of appointees has taken place in the recent past.</P>
        <P>In light of the level of public scrutiny and the quite onerous responsibilities of directors, a decision to accept a position as a chairperson or board member is not to be entered into lightly.  Nominees must be confident of their professional capacity to serve.  I would not like all of the criticism being levelled to be reserved for those on this side of the House.  In the past, a few people who were appointed to particular positions by Fine Gael-led Governments were involved with failed institutions.  The making of questionable appointments is not the preserve of any one party.  It is time this matter was examined.</P>
        <P>In light of the existence of so many quangos, it is important that legislation such as that before us be considered.  I have been in the House for only a short period and the learning curve has been steep.  I discovered, for example, that when Members table questions to Ministers in respect of the HSE, the NRA, the RSE, the EPA and countless other quangos, they do not receive proper replies.  Our questions are forwarded to the agencies to which I refer, which is extremely unsatisfactory.  Ministers must be held accountable in respect of the boards for which they are responsible.</P>
        <P>We should look to the example provided by the boards of organisations which operate in the voluntary sector.  These boards provide exemplary leadership in the communities they represent.</P>

	<P>I join the general commendation to Deputy Varadkar on introducing this Bill, which attempts to commence the reform of the process relating to public appointments and to introduce a measure of transparency.  The Government should accept the suggestion to the effect that there should be a greater level of transparency.  If it has its own proposals in this regard, it should bring them forward.</P>
        <P>A person offers an immense gift to the public &mdash; in an intergenerational sense &mdash; when he or she decides to serve on a public body.  Many individuals have served in the capacity to which I refer.  This generosity of spirit and practice has been recognised by all speakers.  However, when one looks at the boards of State bodies, there are a number of characteristics to which I will turn, but one issue on which Members must be clear is that the single biggest failure has been in respect of ethics in the private sector.  As Members will have an opportunity to note while discussing the NAMA legislation, the entire country is absolutely appalled at the breaches in regulation and the failure in basic standards of those who served on boards in the banking sector, which constituted an outrageous abandonment of public responsibility.</P>
        <P>Members are reluctant to comment in the House on the ease with which people in highly distinguished professions moved onto the boards of such banks to serve as chairpersons or non-executive directors.  Moreover, it was accepted that this was their normal transition.  For example, Members should consider how it could be accepted that senior members of the legal profession automatically make non-executive directors <i>par excellence</i>.  They did not; they let down the country and this should be printed across the front pages of all the newspapers.  If one moves to consider other aspects, one can note that such persons are not only automatically deemed to be good appointments but that they should be on several boards.  As it would be a reflection on their excellence were they merely to be on one board, they should be on several.  Therefore, being on the board of one bank means one automatically should be on four or five more.  Moreover, if one has served as chairman for a period, on stepping down why not go on <Col N="778"/>another board as one&rsquo;s friend steps in?  If one considers the network of directors across the financial services and banking sectors, it is a rather small and relatively limited number of people.</P>
        <P>I move to the other side to find, for example, the ease with which former county and city managers automatically find that their excellent competence regarding matters pertaining to building development automatically qualifies them for property development companies.  There are a number of examples in this regard.  I do not for one second suggest they are guilty of the slightest of improprieties.  However, I have been shocked by how few city and county managers have been moved to utter a single word of criticism, not to speak of condemnation, against the one of their number who came before the courts and was sent to prison.  Therefore, as background to my support on behalf of the Labour Party for Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s initiative, I am not fooled for one second by suggestions there are behaviours, practices or ethics in the private sector that could be transferred to the public sector.  My comments stand as a condemnation of a terrible derogation of duty.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, as a former Minister who is strongly in favour of the public service, I also wonder whether it is fair that former Secretaries General of Departments, who are mostly male, should have moved into directorships in so many semi-State and private companies.  There should be a long period during which they disqualify themselves from such appointments.  While engaging in this fit of honesty and candour, I have noticed a significant shift regarding the migration of such persons from the time of T. K. Whitaker and his successors.  Prior to and during his time, it would have been highly unusual for people to move from the public sector, in which they would have had access to much information, to private sector companies.  I will add for good measure that there have been some fine examples in which it has been singularly inappropriate.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the current position and the future.  Deputy Varadkar is suggesting a method of transparency and scrutiny by which one would examine people.  As a Minister, I appointed people without ever knowing their political affiliations, some of whom were more controversial than others.  I did not ask what were the political party preferences of Niall Stokes or Lelia Doolan.  Equally, I have served with both main parties in government and when boards were being filled, the different parties had a certain quota to fill.  Everyone in both Governments was in favour of improving the gender balance to a ratio of, say, 60:40.  However, I support Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s desire to move away from all this, which is a good idea.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, when considering boards in the public realm, I find it difficult to understand the reason the universe was so limited.  Some people are on four, five or six boards.  Moreover, some people were so important they never could leave.  They did not leave after serving one term but were reappointed repeatedly.  I know of some persons who have spent nearly all their lives on State boards.  As it happens and in order that they will not be too embarrassed, they have not delivered successes in such a significant sequence as to make them indispensable.  Moreover, some are in the transport area.  It is good to have reforming Ministers in the broadcasting and transport sectors, about which people should not be too upset.  Others move from one board to another as such boards have a habit of spawning like fish and consequently one has sub-boards, agencies and so forth.  The same people are in control to such an extent that they find they must chair such bodies also.  Before one knows where one is, one has a plethora of boards on which the same few worthy but unselected individuals serve.</P>
        <P>Other issues arise and I can discern matters regarding the implementation of reforming legislation.  For example, I will take a board like one for which I had responsibility, namely, An Chomhairle Eala&iacute;on or the Arts Council.  I had two criteria when appointing members to <Col N="779"/>that board.  One was that, as Minister, I should be at arm&rsquo;s length from the operation of any board for which I had responsibility, be it the RTE Authority as it then was or the Arts Council.  The other was that those appointed to the board would not be simply representative of interests as one would be obliged to ask them to take decisions beyond their own qualification or interest.  One must be careful in this regard.  For example, an appointee who is familiar with music also will be obliged to take decisions on the Arts Council that go beyond music and include dance, the visual arts, the future of education, access to artistic activities and so on.  Consequently, one must find people who are both qualified in a particular interest and who are able to perceive a more general interest.  However, the great value of having people who would come through a process such as that suggested by Deputy Varadkar or an amended version, were the Government willing to do this, is that they are not bound by time.</P>
        <P>As any Member who has been a Minister is aware, on taking office one has four years &mdash; five at the most &mdash; to implement one&rsquo;s policy.  Consequently, there is a very good reason to appoint, for example, a programme manager or an adviser and such individuals have been scandalously misrepresented.  If one is to achieve one&rsquo;s programme, one really needs someone to move it along and a highly unfair opposition to that practice was generated.  Equally, however, a person who is appointed to a board must take account of what will happen beyond the Government&rsquo;s term.  One must think of the public interest as it extends over time.  The great value of having someone who would be interviewed is that they would not be limited to the particular programme of a particular Government but genuinely would represent the public interest as they would construe it in the long term.  Moreover, although it was ridiculous in many ways, it always was the case in a public service that was patriarchal, hierarchical and structured in Weberian terms that when they had all retired, they automatically found themselves on all-male boards.  There was an under-representation of women, an under-representation by age and so forth.  If one wants to understand how the old system does not work, one simply should ask oneself how many Secretaries&rsquo; General of Departments are women, how many women are city and county managers and so forth.  If the Government does not want to support Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill, let it come forward with its own but let it not suggest that everything is fine or that this is an interference with the balance between executive and representative Government.  We urgently need ethics in the private sector, which is in a morass, and we need it in the public sector.  This Bill is a very good beginning and I support the initiative.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Higgins and the Labour Party for sharing time.  When I find myself agreeing with Deputy Varadkar, I must examine the matter very carefully.  I have done so on this occasion and found that, notwithstanding the reservations that I understand to be mutual, I wholeheartedly support this Bill.  The title, Public Appointments Transparency Bill, is brilliant.  I also agree with a number of points made by Deputy Higgins.</P>
        <P>Let us not cod ourselves about political cronyism.  It does not just apply to the current Government.  Deputy Higgins made the point but it is worth repeating.  The political cronyism in respect of appointees has existed for decades and possibly since the establishment of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps it did not apply to those at the very beginning because there were people of major political conviction.  I am not sure that the House has been peppered with similar sentiments since then but perhaps they were well-intentioned.  I refer to political cronyism not just in respect of appointments to boards and public bodies but also judges.  I understand there have been some honourable exceptions in the case of judges.  I hope that is the case.  One of the difficulties when people are appointed to boards is that they forget their function.  Their first obligation is not to the politician who appointed them but to the Irish people.  We hear talk of patriotism from a Minister, referring to someone not shopping in Newry, and it shows <Col N="780"/>how mistaken these Ministers are.  Patriotism is about working honestly and openly for the people of one&rsquo;s country.  We have not seen too much of that.</P>
        <P>A few years ago a man from Sligo was appointed to a public body in Louth.  During a tea break at one of the meetings, a colleague of mine asked how it came to be that a man from Sligo was appointed to a body based in Louth.  Without any sense of irony, the man replied that he had gone to school with a Minister, whom he named.  Apparently, this was laudable qualification to be appointed to the board.  Perhaps the expenses for coming such a significant distance and the overnight stays were an attraction.  It shows how casually these matters are taken.  In some cases people appointed in the fashion I have described take it casually.</P>
        <P>D&aacute;il accountability has been referred to and it is particularly important.  We submit parliamentary questions and are told that the Minister for Health and Children has no responsibility to the D&aacute;il for the HSE.  It is a similar situation with the NRA and the Department of Transport.  Accountability and transparency in respect of these bodies is not being brought back to the anchor, with Ministers responsible to this House.  We also see this in social partnership, which I am not against even though I have problems with some of the framework of the current model.  Deals are done in Government Buildings and it is a done deal when legislation is published to implement the deal.  The voices in this House carry almost no value.</P>
        <P>Everyone agrees that more transparency and accountability is needed; but where is the action?  The Government has the apparatus to influence and effect legislation and put this accountability in place.  The Government chooses to ignore this opportunity, which would go a long way to begin this process to ensure some type of accountability.</P>
        <P>I was working in my office a few moments ago and I thought I heard the Minister of State, replying for the Government, say there was a swift and speedy response to the F&Aacute;S carry-on a few weeks ago.  For goodness sake, Mr. Peter McLoone said he considered offering his resignation to the Government but was told by the T&aacute;naiste to remain in position and continue working.  How ridiculous is that?  I can appreciate that there are situations where it is better to leave a board in place rather than create a void but matters should have been speeded up to ensure legislation was passed to replace the board and ensure proper strands of accountability.  This does not just apply to boards.</P>
        <P>With public contracts, we see that the Dublin Port tunnel began as a &euro;22 million project in 2000 and ended as a &euro;580 million project in 2006.  Who sanctioned these increases and what measurements were brought to bear on how the taxpayer was being ripped off?  The M50 widening project began at &euro;190 million and ended up costing &euro;562 million.  Apparently, taxpayers&rsquo; money has very little value in the eyes of this Government and the previous Government.  That is grossly unacceptable.  The Luas began as a &euro;290 million project and ended up costing the taxpayer &euro;750 million.</P>
        <P>The previous speaker referred to the example of county managers.  After having been elected a county councillor in Louth, I tried to be punctual for my first meeting and was there 15 minutes early.  The second person to arrive was the then county manager.  He offered his hand and I shook hands with him.  He welcomed me to the best club in Ireland.  I immediately responded to tell him that I was not part of any club but was there to represent the people who had elected me and those in the constituency.  Thanks but no thanks to club membership, I will carry on my function as best I can.</P>
        <P>Some of the carry-on that emerged from the F&Aacute;S debacle beggars belief.  There was a culture of malpractice within the hierarchy of F&Aacute;S.  One can compare and contrast the activities of a small number of executives and the people they were supposed to serve, those who had been made unemployed and who were doing their best to be retrained so that they could get back <Col N="781"/>into employment.  It could not be more black and white yet this was allowed to go on for many years.  The F&Aacute;S bosses breached their financial procedures but did so at great cost to the taxpayer.  This was grossly unfair.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for selecting this item concerning the future of the job initiative scheme, which has less than 1,450 participants throughout the country.  I was directly associated with the creation of the scheme in 1996.  In 2004, the then Minister decided that no new entrants should be admitted to the scheme from that date.  However, the economic environment has changed completely since 2004.  The scheme, as we devised it in 1996, was designed to provide full-time employment for people aged 35 or over and who had been unemployed for five years or more.</P>
        <P>In the approximately 12 years the job initiative programme has been in existence, it has provided meaningful work for a few thousand people who otherwise might have been left on the dole queues.  More importantly, these people have done immensely valuable work in their own communities that might otherwise have not been done.  If the T&aacute;naiste was now to dismantle the scheme, she would be dismantling the essential infrastructure that supports the community sector in dozens of locations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In my constituency there are six job initiative projects, providing full-time employment to 103 people.  These people are involved in a myriad of services essential to the community, for example after-school care, breakfast clubs, homework clubs and gardening and security services.  The job initiative projects provide jobs in the social economy in administration and maintenance.  The areas supported by these workers are community centres, creches, enterprise centres and parish properties.  Imagine the damage that would be done to the social fabric of a struggling community if the Minister was to pull the plug on these projects.</P>
        <P>These workers have now acquired rights.  The communities they serve have grown to rely on the services they provide.  Together they have made a world of difference in their own communities.  I am not sure the powers that be have much of an appreciation of the nature of community development or community action.  I do not believe that top-level decision makers generally appreciate the value of the work done in such communities nor have they attempted a cost benefit analysis of such services compared to the cost to the Exchequer if these services were not provided in the community by the community.</P>
        <P>I cannot claim that the job initiative scheme has evolved exactly as was envisaged when we launched it in 1996.  However, one of the most gratifying things for me is to observe how the programme has enabled participants who otherwise would have no opportunity to become involved in education to achieve diplomas, degrees, FETAC qualifications and certificates.  It would be folly for the Government to butcher the job initiative scheme.  In the medium term it will cost the Exchequer more to cope with the fallout if the good work undertaken by these projects is undermined.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will be able to assure participants that their jobs are secure and that she will be able to assure the communities reliant on the job initiative scheme that they will not be deprived of the valuable services that they enjoy as a result of the scheme.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta as ucht an cheist seo anocht.  F&Aacute;S employment services comprise the community employment and job initiative programmes.  As Deputy Rabbitte outlined, the job initiative programme was launched by him in July 1996 and continues to provide full-time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for five years or more, and in receipt of social welfare payments over that period.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S, as an agency of my Department, operates the job initiative programme with a dedicated budget of &euro;39 million for 2009.  There are 1,444 participants, with this number decreasing annually due to retirement and other reasons.  The main purpose of the programme, as outlined by Deputy Rabbitte, is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.  F&Aacute;S provides financial support to assist with the job initiative programme, for example, participant wages.  Also, while on the programme participants can retain entitlements such as medical cards or child dependent allowance, and be eligible for others such as revenue job assist.</P>
        <P>Following changes introduced on 10 November 2004 by the then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in response to labour market conditions at the time, no new entrants have been admitted onto job initiative schemes.  However, contracts for existing participants are renewed, allowing them the option to continue until they are 65 years of age.  In order to support the service being provided, community employment scheme participants replace participants who leave the job initiative programme voluntarily or through retirement.</P>
        <P>In addition, the community employment programme is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged people with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The purpose of the community employment programme is to help the unemployed to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The current eligibility criteria are well known to Members of the House and I want to draw attention to a number of changes that have been made to cater for older workers in particular.  In 2004, the standard three year community employment programme cap was revised to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a six-year period on the community employment programme based on participation since 3 April 2000.  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for the community employment programme based on a social welfare disability linked payment, including those under 55, was increased by one year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.  I should also point out that the community services programme, operated by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, offers many of the same services and is providing many of the same opportunities as the job initiative scheme.</P>
        <P>Funding for community employment in 2009 was &euro;380 million and at present there are more than 22,000 people participating on community employment schemes.  An additional &euro;6.6 million was provided to F&Aacute;S for the provision of an additional 400 community employment places in 2009.  In delivering these places, F&Aacute;S operates flexibly in the management of this allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.  This provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional F&Aacute;S offices and local sponsor and community organisations and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.  However, it should be <Col N="783"/>remembered that, in so far as participants remain on community employment programmes, they preclude someone else from benefiting from the programme.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.  The Government will continue to support the positive role of F&Aacute;S employment schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed people at this difficult time.  I will be happy to sit down with Deputy Rabbitte, given his experience from previous times, to share ideas with him on redesigning the existing schemes.</P>

	<P>It is with a certain level of regret that I raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  In February, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, gave a commitment that construction of a new primary school at Star of the Sea in Passage West would go ahead.  We are now three months from the end of the year and given a number of factors it seems a sod will not be turned in the Passage West area and that it will be business as usual for teachers, school staff, pupils and parents over the next school year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is unfortunate that the Minister has not come to the Chamber given his familiarity with the issue having represented the Cork South Central area in the past, and particularly so given that a series of promises was made relating to the school, which coincided with every general election and local election over the past ten years; if one was to track the dates of press statements from the Government and the dates of general elections one would see they are almost placed on top of one another.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has not come to the Chamber this evening.  However, I hope that some comfort for the local community in Passage West can be drawn from what the Minister of State has to say in his response.</P>
        <P>I would not like to hear the Government hiding behind some current economic situation given that it is ten years since the first promise was made that a new school would be built in the Passage West area.  Given that the local community has been waiting very patiently for this, it would be unfair for the Minister to push the patience of the local community any further.</P>
        <P>On the first day of school this September, we witnessed 400 children being dropped off at a school built for 150 pupils &mdash; more than twice the capacity for which it was originally designed.  The car park and play area no longer exist because they are full of prefabs.  The over-congestion in the school makes day-to-day services and extracurricular activities, which operate outside the classroom, impossible for the school to provide.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that the school will commence this year?  Seven weeks ago, Cork County Council asked for further information in regard to the design brought forward by the Minister and his Department.  I cannot figure out why it has taken almost two months for the Department to respond.  I hope the Minister will indicate that the architect will be given a deadline to ensure the drawings are issued to Cork County Council, that the planning process will continue and that a decision will be made on the application in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister acknowledge the local community, which deserves any credit on this issue?  It took its campaign to the streets of Cork city and the national and local media which eventually resulted in progress.  It belies the notion that Fianna F&aacute;il in government is not good for one&rsquo;s community.  The local community was told by Ministers for Education and Science to leave the issue with them and that they would get back to it but it was only when the community stopped playing that game and went public that real action was taken and the Department started to issue it with meaningful responses.</P><Col N="784"/>
        <P>I would like to know if the Department has issued the further information and drawings to Cork County Council.  I would also like the Minister to give an assurance that construction will begin on Star of the Sea primary school before the end of the year and that funding for the school will not be lost as the Department prepares for the Estimates for the 2010 school year.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising the issue and sympathise with him on last weekend&rsquo;s all-Ireland result.  I share his pain.  The Minister for Education and Science could not come to the House and asked me to take this matter for him.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth such as that referred to by the Deputy is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  The original criteria were revised and refined in 2004.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project &mdash; in other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P>There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places while a band four project makes provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>The proposed new school building for Star of the Sea primary school has been assigned a band one rating.  As the Deputy will be aware, in February, the Minister for Education and Science announced details of 43 major building projects to proceed to tender and construction in which the Star of the Sea primary school was included.</P>
        <P>All major projects on the Department&rsquo;s capital programme progress through the same structured process of architectural planning which is divided into clearly defined stages.  The stages of architectural planning are set out in the Department&rsquo;s design team procedures and are necessary to comply with Department of Finance guidelines which require that capital projects be fully designed prior to going to tender.  They also ensure proper cost management of capital projects and facilitate compliance with statutory and public procurement requirements.</P>
        <P>At present, there are five stages involved in the progression of major school projects through architectural planning.  This project is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning and a stage 2b submission is expected shortly from the design team.</P>
        <P>The brief for this project is to provide a new 16 classroom generic repeat design, GRD, school building, including a general purpose hall and ancillary accommodation, on a greenfield site.  An application has been made for planning permission and a decision is awaited.  An application for a fire safety certificate has also been made.  I will ask the Minister to respond directly to the delay in providing extra information.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is almost &euro;614 million which represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme at a time of huge pressure on public finances is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and will revert to him with specific details on the current situation.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, has come to respond.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State will be aware, it is proposed to close the Castleknock gate of the Phoenix Park for six weeks starting next week.  My constituency has only three routes into the city centre &mdash; the N3, which is currently being dug up for the M50 upgrade, Chapelizod and the Phoenix Park.  It would appear that for at least the next six weeks the Castleknock gate of the Phoenix Park will be closed, essentially closing off two of the three routes into the city centre.  It may not be of much concern to Members opposite that I will not be able to join them for approximately six weeks but this will also apply to the Minister for Finance who may find he has great difficulty coming to the House.  The closure of this route will cause significant traffic chaos around the Castleknock area as people try to divert to other routes, including Blackhorse Avenue, Chapelizod, etc.</P>
        <P>Why was there no consultation with local Deputies or councillors?  The first knowledge we had of this was, in typical OPW fashion, signs put up on the gates informing us that it would be closed for six weeks.  This has happened on a few occasions.  It happened in regard to proposals to introduce a one-way system at Ashtown gate and Cabra gate which had to be abandoned because the OPW failed to consult people at the time.</P>
        <P>Why could this work not have been done during the summer when there was relatively little traffic?  It will now be done in October which is the peak traffic period in Dublin.  Can this be deferred until next year?  It is only for the construction of a roundabout.  A temporary roundabout has been in place for the best part of two years which works well.  Is it not possible to defer these works until next summer?</P>
        <P>What arrangements will be made to organise traffic in the area during the period of the works, in particular at Farmleigh?  Will White&rsquo;s gate be opened for six weeks?  If not, what other arrangements will be made to ensure we are not all trapped in our homes for the next six weeks?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Varadkar for raising this issue and I appreciate the inconvenience such works can cause to those who may live in their vicinity.</P>
        <P>The closure of Castleknock Gate from Monday, 28 September for a maximum of nine weeks is necessitated by essential works that are required to be carried out at the Mountjoy Cross junction in the Phoenix Park.  The works will require the junction to be cordoned off.  It will not, therefore, be possible for vehicular traffic to cross it.  There will be no disruption to people on foot or on bicycles who will be able to use the Castleknock Gate as usual.</P>
        <P>The Mountjoy Cross junction had one of the highest accident rates in Dublin city for several years.  To alleviate the dangers at the junction, a temporary roundabout was installed in 2007. <Col N="786"/> This proved to be an immediate success by reducing the number of accidents considerably.  However, with the increased volume of traffic using this junction, it remains dangerous.  It is now proposed to replace the current temporary roundabout with a permanent structure, with the primary focus for carrying out this work being the safety of all users who use this junction, as well as considerably improving the appearance of Chesterfield Avenue at this high profile location.</P>
        <P>The Mountjoy Cross junction has been flooded on several occasions resulting in the closure of the junction, for four days on the last occasion.  Major remedial works on the drainage system at Mountjoy also need to be carried out and are being included as part of this contract to ensure minimum disruption to users of the park.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above major construction projects, the Office of Public Works has ensured a further two projects that would also have necessitated the closure of the Castleknock Gate will be carried out while the main construction work is taking place.  These are the Bord G&aacute;is replacement of damaged pipes along Chesterfield Avenue and through the Castleknock Gate.  This is necessary on safety grounds as the current pipe network is antiquated and suffering from major leaks of gas.  There will also be repairs to the Castleknock Gate as a result of damage caused by a large truck.</P>
        <P>A traffic management plan covering the period of the works has been drawn up in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the highest level and Fingal County Council.  Several options were considered including night-time working and one-way, stop-go options.  These were rejected on grounds of cost, that they would prolong the works into the Operation Freeflow period and the inevitable noise and inconvenience to residents of night-time working.</P>
        <P>The plan adopted allows for the re-opening of certain closed roads in the Park to vehicular traffic, the creation of one-way traffic movement inward only at the Ashtown Gate and outward only at the Cabra Gate.  The Odd Lamp Road will be re-opened to take traffic in both directions from the Phoenix Monument towards the Back Road.  The Furze Road will be re-opened to take traffic to and from the main road towards the Knockmaroon Gate and the Ordnance Survey Road.  Entrance to Farmleigh and the Ordnance Survey complex will be from the Ordnance Survey Road.</P>
        <P>The advice to the Office of Public Works is that these temporary measures provide the best prospect of balancing the need to get the works completed in a timely and cost effective manner and the interests of the motorist.  Extensive signage is already in place throughout the park to alert users to the new arrangements.  The plans will also be widely advertised on AA Roadwatch, on the Office of Public Works, Phoenix Park and Garda websites.  Extra garda&iacute; will be on duty to help direct traffic on the first days of the closure, as well as the contractor&rsquo;s own staff.  A study has been carried out which indicates that commuters using the alternative arrangements put in place will suffer delays of no more than 40 minutes during the first day of the gate closure and no more than 20 minutes thereafter.</P>
        <P>The proposed roundabout was one element of a much larger scheme for the entire Chesterfield Avenue.  The scheme was submitted for planning permission earlier this year, but was rejected in August on foot of an objection by An Taisce for plans for a bus lane in the park.  Once the planning situation had been clarified, there was a narrow window of opportunity to complete the roundabout works, which are permitted under planning laws, before Garda restrictions on roadworks come into effect at the end of November as part of Operation Freeflow.  That is why the works were not carried out during the summer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The situation will be monitored closely over the period of the contract.  Any opportunity that presents itself to expedite the works will be taken.  While we regret any inconvenience caused <Col N="787"/>to the public, we consider these works are of the highest priority for improving the safety of both motorists, pedestrians and cyclists at the Mountjoy Cross junction, as well as addressing the other long-term problems at this location.  When the works are completed, the public welfare will have been improved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important and urgent issue for all senior citizens in Kildare and west Wicklow in receipt of care at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Athy, County Kildare.  The closure of a ward in any hospital due to cutbacks in hospital budgets creates problems for its community, hospital personnel, patients and their families.  When the closure affects a hospital that cares for senior citizens, such as St. Vincent&rsquo;s, it creates a larger problem as all the patients affected tend to be long-stay and very accustomed to their surroundings.</P>
        <P>I have first-hand knowledge of the care and attention given at St. Vincent&rsquo;s as my mother is a long-term patient there.  I acknowledge and appreciate the wonderful care given to the patients and attention to their families by the staff of the facility.  Since my mother became a patient there, I have seen the advances made in the provision of extra facilities and care.  Many of the facilities have been provided by the dedicated fund-raising works of the director and assistant director of nursing with voluntary groups.  Gardens and walks have been created with many internal building improvement works to the benefit of the patients and their families.  All are to be congratulated on this work.</P>
        <P>The HSE, however, has determined the closure of wards in the hospital system is the answer to its financial woes.  Places of excellence, such as St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, will suffer and many senior citizens will not be able to avail of respite care.  Is the HSE aware that reducing facilities or closing wards will deprive those who built this nation of their God-given right to care in their old age?  The answer is patently clear.  It is a book-keeping exercise where money counts and lives do not matter.</P>
        <P>If a patient seeks palliative, respite or long-term care in St. Vincent&rsquo;s through the HSE application system or a GP, will they be refused the request by hospital management because of a decision by the HSE?  What logic can be applied to the actions of the HSE in this regard?</P>
        <P>The old adage, why change it if it works well, is very appropriate to this case.  The hospital works well in the Kildare and west Wicklow health system.  It is recognised by everyone in and outside of its catchment area as an excellent brand product that could evolve to even greater services by advancing all of its sectors, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s, long-term and respite care.  However, the HSE stymies progress, frustrates staff, worries patients and their families all for the reduction of the HSE financial budget.</P>
        <P>The care of our loved ones should be beyond such budgets.  The care and attention given in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital is for what we pay our taxes.  The HSE at executive level has no feel for the St. Vincent&rsquo;s of this world.  In reality, it would rather see them closed and the service privatised than having the initiative to develop such facilities further as could easily be done at the St. Vincent&rsquo;s campus in Athy.  The Minister for Health and Children has no other objective than privatisation as can be seen in many of the proposals that come from her Department.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, speak to the Minister for Health and Children on this matter?  I note she again is absent from the Chamber.  She never attends Adjournment debate matters on health services.  That is not meant to be a reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  I want the Minister of State to seek an assurance from the Minister that St. Vincent&rsquo;s will retain all of its facilities and that the closed ward will be re-opened to facilitate <Col N="788"/>the many senior citizens from the catchment area who seek a place there.  Anything else is unacceptable and the anger this closure has created will be noted when the people of South Kildare march in protest this Saturday.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I present the apologies of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who has asked me to take this debate. </P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue.  I had the pleasure of being in his town today and I congratulate everybody involved in the very successful National Ploughing Championships.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Athy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>St. Vincent&rsquo;s is a 199 bed long-stay unit in the Kildare-west Wicklow community care area.  Staff shortages, due to recruitment issues and maternity, sick and annual leave, have put continuing pressure on supporting beds at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  HSE senior management, in consultation with local senior staff decided, in the interest of the residents and overall service integrity to introduce service consolidation arrangements.  This consolidation required the relocation of patients from one unit, St. Camillus ward, to existing vacancies in a number of other units within St. Vincent&rsquo;s.  This is to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all patients in a safe and secure environment.  I believe the House will agree that the safety and care of the residents is our first concern.  Most importantly we must consider what is in their best interests.  Each hospital, local health office, manager, clinician and other people working in the health services has a responsibility to provide the best possible service to patients, their families and other clients of the health services.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed that it is taking steps to ensure that the closure of this ward will not result in a reduction in the number of beds available in the region.  It has arranged to make additional private nursing home beds available to both community and hospital patients in order to minimise the impact of the planned changes.  In addition the executive has confirmed that the hospital has catered for all scheduled respite services.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act was signed into law on 1 July 2009.  Certain sections of the Act have been commenced to enable the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to immediately begin price negotiations with private nursing homes.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to commence the scheme for the public in the final quarter of the year.</P>
        <P>The scheme will equalise State support for individuals in public, voluntary and private long-term nursing home care.  This will meet one of the objectives of Towards 2016, namely, that State support should be indifferent as to whether a person is in public or private care.  Individuals will contribute to their care based on their income and the value of their assets.  No-one will pay more than the cost of his or her care.  There are approximately 20 private nursing homes with more than 1,000 beds spread across the Kildare-west Wicklow region.  The introduction of the scheme should eliminate the financial need for people to seek public nursing home care.  This will allow older people to choose to receive residential care in a wider range of centres, including those which would be closer to their homes and families.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if he will report on allegations that solicitors are acting as criminal intelligence officers for criminal gangs; if criminal investigations are taking place in respect of the alleged misconduct; the action he proposes to take to address such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it what the Deputy has in mind in referring to solicitors acting as &lsquo;criminal intelligence officers&rsquo; for criminal gangs are any instances where solicitors may improperly pass information to their clients who are members of gangs.</P>
        <P>I should stress, initially, that I am satisfied that the vast majority of solicitors behave with the utmost propriety in their dealings with clients.  That said, I am aware of suggestions that a tiny minority of solicitors have been behaving improperly in the context outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is because the numbers involved would be so small that I am constrained in what I can say to the House about particular investigations which may be under way at this time.  Any such information might tend to lead to the indentification of the suspects concerned.  I can, in any event, assure the House that I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that instances where it is believed that solicitors have been involved in criminal activity have been, and will continue to be, fully investigated by the Garda&iacute; and files submitted to the Director of Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt either that the regulatory body for solicitors, the Law Society, would treat with great seriousness any evidence of such improper activity on the part of its members.</P><Col N="790"/>
        <P>For my own part, the House will be aware that I took certain measures in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, 2009 to counteract this problem through providing, in strictly defined circumstances, for particular evidence relating to an ongoing investigation to be heard in private.  During the course of the passage of the legislation in the House I expressed the view that the exclusion of legal representatives was necessary, not just to deal with the activities of a very small number of solicitors who might behave improperly, but to avoid a situation where legal representatives, if they were allowed to remain, could come under extreme pressure from their clients to disclose certain matters to them.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the indoor firearms training range at Garda Headquarters was closed in December 2005 on a precautionary basis due to health and safety issues. </P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Garda authorities that a feasibility study into the measures required to bring the indoor firearms range located at Garda Headquarters up to the highest international standard was carried out in 2007 and the estimated cost is approximately &euro;2.6 million. The recommendations in this study will be considered having regard to the Garda authorities identified future training requirements and the availability of capital funding.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable investment in the provision of firearms training facilities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the past number of years including the provision of two Prefabricated Modular Firearms ranges, one at the Garda College and one in the Dublin Metropolitan region.  These prefabricated ranges are designed to facilitate live fire shooting for up to four persons in a carefully contained environment which adheres to all range safety requirements.</P>
        <P>In addition, three Firearms Automated Training System (FATS) units were purchased by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in January 2006, at a cost of just over &euro;0.5m.  This has proved to be a very successful initiative and has allowed the development of judgmental firearms training as well as traditional marksmanship training in a non-live fire environment.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are sufficient resources and infrastructure currently in place to provide training for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are authorised to carry Firearms Authorisation Cards.</P>

Consultations on the proposed Bill have, as is usual in the development of any legislative proposals, taken place with the <Col N="791"/>Office of the Attorney General.  It was also considered prudent, given the nature of the subject, to consult with the Chief Justice.  Following initial contacts with the Chief Justice on the proposals for a Judicial Council, a working group has been established to advance the Bill establishing the Council.  The Chief Justice is in consultation with his fellow members of the judiciary on the details of the proposals and his response, taking into account that consultation, is in the process of being finalised.  On receipt of the relevant documentation from the Chief Justice, I intend to seek Government approval as quickly as possible for drafting of the Bill.<b></b></P>

Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options.  These may include stabilisation on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.  Prisoners who on committal are engaged in a methadone substitution programme in the community will, in the main, have their methadone substitution treatment continued while in custody.  In Mountjoy, in excess of 220 prisoners are currently on methadone substitution treatment.</P>
        <P>The Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison has 9 spaces specifically allocated for a therapeutic drug free programme.  There is capacity for approximately 70 prisoners a year on the programme.  This programme is 6 weeks in duration and includes involvement from both prison based staff and external community agencies.  Its aim is to assist prisoners in achieving drug free status.  However, that is not to say that this is the only detox programme available in the prison system.  Up to the end of July this year, 1200 prisoners have undergone other detox programmes.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the Irish Prison Service strive to ensure that the provision of healthcare to prisoners is of a standard consistent with that which applies in the general community.  Given the large number of prisoners requiring drug treatment services, the Prison Service endeavours to provide a comprehensive range of such services in all closed prisons not just Mountjoy.</P>
        <P>Overall the programmes in place in our Prisons seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the system through education, treatment, rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include, inter alia, the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.  The Prison Service has committed significant investment in recent years in responding to addiction issues in the prison system.</P><Col N="792"/>
        <P>These programmes continue to be expanded and enhanced, in partnership with community based services, notwithstanding the current difficult economic climate.  In consultation with the HSE community addiction services, the Irish Prison Service makes every effort to ensure that prisoners engaged in treatment programmes are linked to community addiction services on their release.</P>
        <P>A very significant development has been the awarding of a contract for the provision of Addiction Counselling Services to Merchants Quay Ireland.  The Addiction Counselling Service is, in conjunction with other developments, now delivering nearly 1000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling across the prison system.</P>
        <P>The allocation of additional Nurse Officers and Prison Officers to Dedicated Drug Treatment Teams in prisons with significant needs has improved the service quality in prisons.  The provision of additional specialist sessions in addiction psychiatry, is also significantly improving the quality, coordination and availability of drug treatment in prisons.</P>
        <P>Methadone substitution treatment is provided in eight of the 14 prisons (accommodating over 80% of the prison population).  2,014 prisoners were in receipt of methadone maintenance during 2008.  The comparable figure for 2007 was 1,840.</P>
        <P>Prisoners have access to a range of medical and rehabilitative services such as psychosocial services and &lsquo;work and training&rsquo; options which assist in addressing substance misuse issues.  The Irish Prison Service is seeking to enhance and expand specialist treatment at all prisons where demand is high for drug treatment services.  (It is intended to expand drug treatment services in Castlerea, Portlaoise and Midlands in the coming months.)</P>
        <P>As previously stated the priority of my Department and the Irish Prison Service is, notwithstanding present resource difficulties, to ensure that an appropriate range of treatment services is available to all prisoners requiring same.</P>

        <P>In summary, the total amount paid out in court awards, legal costs and out of court settlements amounted to approximately &euro;939,000 in 2004, &euro;4.9 million in 2005, &euro;2 million in 2006, &euro;14 million in 2007, &euro;7 million in 2008 and &euro;3 million so far this year. The sharp spike in damages in 2007 and to a lesser extent in 2008 can be substantially attributed to Donegal-related cases, which have so far cost the State around &euro;10 million, with 20 cases still on hand.</P><Col N="793"/>

	<P>Under the law as it stands &mdash; section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987 &mdash; an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access.  In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply <Col N="794"/>to the court for orders on custody and access.  Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
        <P>Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child&rsquo;s wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In addition, the law now places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her father and mother: Section 11D of the 1964 Act (inserted by the Children Act 1997) obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child&rsquo;s best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>These legislative provisions are comprehensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child&rsquo;s care and upbringing having regard to the child&rsquo;s best interests.</P>
        <P>As part of its Third Programme of Law Reform 2008-2014, the Law Reform Commission recently published a consultation paper &lsquo;Legal Aspects of Family Relationships&rsquo;, in which it makes provisional recommendations on the rights and duties of fathers in relation to guardianship, custody and access to their children. The Commission has invited submissions on its provisional recommendations as part of the consultation process. I look forward to examining the Commission&rsquo;s final report in due course.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of applications from members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to voluntarily retire received so far in 2009, and the number who voluntarily retired in each year from 2002 to 2008, is as set out in the table.  I should explain that practically all Garda retirements, whether they occur early or late in a member&rsquo;s career, are in a technical sense voluntary, in the sense that they do not occur on the last day of potential service.  Only an exceptionally small number choose to serve until the day upon which they must retire compulsorily on age grounds.</P>
        <P>In summary, the figures show that the number of such voluntary retirements was 234 in 2002, 252 in 2003, 323 in 2004, 284 in 2005, 238 in 2006, 177 in 2007, 243 in 2008, with 579 applications so far in 2009.</P>
        <P>Clearly the current rate of retirements has increased appreciably compared to previous years. It must be remembered of course that the retirement age for the ranks of Garda, Sergeant and Inspector was increased in 2006 by 3 years to 60, so that we may now, 3 years on, be seeing an element of deferred retirements.  Significantly however, even with this trend of increased retirements, 2009 will see an overall increase in the number of Garda&iacute;, and by that I mean attested Garda&iacute; with full police powers.  This is because some 900 members will become attested this year, a number which significantly exceeds any anticipated rate of retirement.</P>
        <P>To elaborate on the figures, the personnel strength of attested members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on the latest date for which figures are readily available,  was 14,516.  This figure includes 831 probationer Garda&iacute; who have been attested but have not yet graduated.  It is anticipated the majority of these probationers will complete their training in 2009.  On that date there were also an additional 600 unattested students in training.  To repeat the main point, however, around 900 student Garda&iacute; will have become attested to the force throughout the course of this year, which will put Garda strength at an historic high going into 2010.</P>
        <P>A total of 200 students were inducted into the Garda College in 2009, 100 in February and 100 in May.  The moratorium on Public Service recruitment now applies to Garda recruitment, but I intend to review the position during the course of 2010 in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that on 17 September, 2009 there were 223 young offenders in custody in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. Of these 223 persons, 62 were under 18 years of age with the remaining 161 aged between 18 and 21 years of age. </P>
        <P>An accurate breakdown of statistics as requested by the Deputy is not available without the manual examination of a considerable amount of records going back over a considerable time period. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>
        <P>In March 2008, the Government approved the development of new national children detention facilities on the Oberstown campus near Lusk, Co. Dublin, which will accommodate all under 18 year olds who have been ordered to be detained by the Courts.</P>
        <P>The project is currently at the design stage and it is expected that the tendering process for construction should take place in 2010. Construction is expected to be undertaken in phases with the first phase scheduled to be completed by 2012.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that tendering for the construction of the new facilities will be subject to Government approval and to the necessary funding being made available.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the Law Reform Commission, in its Consultation Paper on Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, to be published later today provisionally recommends that a licensing system should be introduced for the debt collection industry. Moreover, the theme of the Annual <Col N="797"/>Conference of the Commission to be held in November will also be the subject of debt management and enforcement. This work of the Commission is timely and its final recommendations based on necessary consultations will be carefully examined in the relevant Departments including my own with a view to their early implementation. </P>
        <P>I am of course aware of the media reports which allege intimidation of persons owing money in various circumstances. Intimidation and threatening behaviour of debt collectors, no more than such behaviour by any person, comes within the scope of the provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Any person who is threatened or intimidated by debt collectors should, therefore, report the incident to the Garda&iacute; who will, based on the evidence, take appropriate action.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the code of criminal law as it stands has the necessary strength to be applied to cases of intimidation by debt collectors. However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to review the operation of the law in this specific area in consultation with other Departments, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and relevant interests. I would not hesitate to take further action if I thought it was necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should also like to point out that the current legal framework has been recently reformed to provide support to persons who are in debt and have difficulties. Government policy, by way of improved systems for the management of personal debt collection, is reflected in the following measures:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a Code of Conduct for mortgage arrears issued by the Financial Regulator which came into force in February of this year and which applies to principal private residences,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />new procedures to ensure that all repossession or sale proceedings on housing loan mortgages must be taken locally in the Circuit Court rather than in the High Court. This will reduce the cost and inconvenience involved in making a court appearance and, thereby, encourage borrowers who are in arrears to enter a defence in such proceedings,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />new powers to allow registrars of Circuit Courts to deal with applications for repossession orders. County Registrars&rsquo; hearings are likely to be less costly and intimidating than a judicial hearing. Where a case is being defended, the County Registrar will be able to give directions to enable the case to be fully prepared for trial before it comes before a judge. The County Registrar may also approve a settlement of the case between the parties,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 provides a process under which the court is required to satisfy itself that the debtor is unable to pay and that all other means possible have been taken to recover the debt,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />debtors are supported by the welfare services through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and other agencies.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Study Group on Pre-Nuptial Agreements examined the operation of the law since the introduction of divorce <Col N="798"/>in 1996 with respect to pre-nuptial agreements, having regard to the provisions in the Constitution on the protection of marriage and the requirement that proper provision be made for each party in divorce proceedings. </P>
        <P>The Report of the Study Group recommended that provision be made in both the Family Law Act 1995 and Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 to provide only that the courts be required to have regard to existing pre-nuptial agreements when making ancillary relief orders in judicial separation and divorce proceedings. The Group in making this limited recommendation recognised that the court under our Constitution must on granting a decree of divorce be satisfied that proper provision is made for a spouse and children. The effect is that the court must be in a position to look at all the circumstances of a case not just circumstances, for example, that might arise on the basis of a legal separation or some other form of consensual agreement.</P>
        <P>The report made recommendations on the formalities necessary for the proper making of pre-nuptial agreements so that parties making such agreements would be both fully informed and protected. The report also recommended the introduction of a statutory basis upon which a court may make financial provision for a surviving spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial agreement on the death of the other spouse through changes in circumstances since the agreement was concluded, e.g. as a result of the passage of time or other intervening events.</P>
        <P>These recommendations are being considered for inclusion in the Family Law Bill referred to in the Government Legislation Programme announced on 16 September 2009.</P>

	<P>My Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General, are considering proposals for a new system which would allow the taking of contemporaneous written notes to cease where interviews are electronically recorded.</P>
        <P>There is a complex range of training, technological, financial and legal issues to be addressed before the changeover to a new system could take place.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are at an advanced stage in developing proposals for the operational aspects of a new system.  Because of the complexities involved, it is likely that any new system would initially be introduced on a pilot basis to allow all the operational and legal aspects to be fully tested and evaluated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to financial assistance which was until recently provided by the Remembrance Commission under the ambit of the Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance for Victims in this Jurisdiction of the Conflict in Northern Ireland.  </P>
        <P>In relation to the long-term medical expenses of survivors of incidents in this jurisdiction arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland, I can confirm, again, that these will continue to be provided for by my Department. Accordingly I have made provision that these will continue to be met by the Victims of Crime Office, which can be contacted at Pinebrook House, 71-74 Harcourt Street, Dublin 2.</P>
        <P>The Remembrance Commission was established in 2003 for an initial period of 3 years. The Commission&rsquo;s term of appointment was subsequently extended on two further occasions to give more time to those persons eligible for payments under the Scheme to make applications to the Commission. The Commission undertook extensive advertising campaigns to ensure the widest possible awareness of its role and of the categories of payments which could be made.  The Commission&rsquo;s term of office came to an end on 31 October 2008 and no further payments under the Scheme can therefore be made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the Scheme, payments could be made to individuals under various categories, such as acknowledgement payments, economic hardship payments and medical expenses payments. The Scheme also contained a provision to enable payments to be paid to groups offering support services to victims of the conflict. Under this element of the scheme payments were made to the victim support group Justice for the Forgotten for the purpose of meeting the counselling and other needs of victims or their family members. Although the Remembrance Commission&rsquo;s term of office has ended and funding under the Scheme is no longer available, I made arrangements to provide &euro;190,000 to Justice for the Forgotten out of my Department&rsquo;s vote for 2009 to enable it to continue to operate for a further period.  I understand that this funding will be sufficient to allow the group to continue to operate well into next year.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to a tabular statement setting out the information sought by him on handguns licensed and handguns stolen for the years 2004, when handguns began to be licensed again, to date.  The figures show that 52 firearms classified as handguns were stolen in the period in question while the current number of handguns currently licensed is approximately 1,900.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously in the D&aacute;il I am advised by the Garda Authorities that stolen firearms do subsequently get used in the commission of other criminal offences.  Not all stolen firearms used in the commission of these offences are recovered so it is not possible to say precisely how many formerly legally held handguns were used in the commission of criminal offences.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Assets Bureau operates under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005 (as amended).</P>
        <P>Under this legislation, monies or property frozen pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 of the Act remain frozen for a period of at least seven years. The only exception to this minimum seven year waiting period is in circumstances whereby all relevant parties agree to the application of a Section 4a order which allows for a disposal order to be made by the High Court within the seven year period. This application is made with the consent of all parties.</P>
        <P>The consent provisions were introduced in 2005 under the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act of that year.</P>
        <P>The issue of the standard minimum seven year waiting period being reduced to a minimum three year period was considered by the Oireachtas during its examination and discussion of the 2005 Amendment Act.</P>
        <P>Taking account of the introduction of the new consent provisions, the approach taken in the legislation was to retain the standard minimum seven year waiting period primarily on the basis that a reduction of the period between the interlocutory order and the disposal order to three years might render the legislation more open to challenge in terms of due process.</P>
        <P>I have asked my officials to review the legislation pertaining to the length of time an asset must be held before it can be disposed of.  I have also asked my officials to examine this possibility with a view to ensuring that certain types of assets may be disposed of before they depreciate significantly.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983 provides that a Court may make a Community Service Order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the Order being made.</P>
        <P>The Probation Service  has responsibility for the supervision and management of Community Service Orders. A Community Service Order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months. The aim of a Community Service Order is to rehabilitate the offender and make meaningful reparation to the community for his or her crime.</P>
        <P>A Community Pay Back Scheme which is provided for in the Programme for Government will build on the Community Service Scheme which is currently the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review by an independent evaluator. The Review, which will be published shortly, will influence how best to progress this aspect of the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for a number of measures in relation to parental responsibility in respect of children involved in anti-social behaviour and children found guilty of offences.  These include parental supervision and compensation orders.  The imposition of any particular sanction provided for by the Act on parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the courts.  The National Youth Justice Strategy 2008 &mdash; 2010 provides for the monitoring of the use of the anti-social behaviour measures in the Act.  This is being progressed during the term of the Strategy in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Public order is one of my priorities for the Garda&iacute; in 2009 and is one of the 6 strategic goals in the Garda Policing Plan 2009.   The commitments relating to anti-social  behaviour in the Programme for Government are being implemented in co-operation with other Departments and agencies as necessary, in the context of the resources available.  Section 22 and Schedule 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 provide for increases in the level of fines under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  The fine for supplying alcohol to under 18s was increased from &euro;1,500 to &euro;5,000 by Section 17 and Schedule 1 of the 2008 Act. The Deputy will be aware, in particular, that the Garda&iacute;  launched a new National Model of Community Policing in January 2009.  One of its strategic objectives is to use problem sharing initiatives in  partnership with communities and local agencies to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour.</P>

	<P>In May of this year, negotiations with the preferred bidder for the construction of a prison complex at Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan, County Dublin were broken off as their final offer, which was significantly higher than the original price tendered, was determined to be unaffordable.  The original tender competition, which was initiated by the issue of formal invitations to tender in late 2007, was then abandoned as it did not offer the opportunity to obtain the best value for money for the tax payer in the light of the changed circumstances. </P>
        <P>In June of this year the Government re-affirmed its commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan, County Dublin and approved the launching of a new tendering process for the construction of a more affordable and better value prison campus at Thornton. The aim is to provide good quality, regime focussed accommodation with appropriate support and rehabilitation facilities to prepare prisoners for re-integration back into society. The new facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a range of security settings.</P>
        <P>The development will now proceed on a phased basis with Phase one comprising essential basic preliminary works required for the development including the construction of the access route and perimeter wall.  It is intended that this work will proceed in the short term on the basis of separate contracts. The tender documentation and scope of works are currently being drafted.  It is anticipated that work on Phase one will commence towards the end of this year or early next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While Phase one work is in progress the procurement process for the buildings and other facilities that will make up the new prison campus will be examined and finalised in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines for capital projects.  The objective is to complete the design and procurement process for the main prison complex while the construction of the phase one work is underway. While an outline design plan has been prepared, work is ongoing on more detailed design plans which are required for the tendering process. The two phase approach means that once a contract is signed for Phase two the main prison development, the fact that the preliminary works envisaged by Phase one will have already have been completed  will allow for construction to commence immediately on the main prison buildings within a secured perimeter.</P>
        <P>The development of the new prison campus at Thornton Hall is a complex project which is governed by Department of Finance and EU procurement guidelines.  The guidelines set out a range of actions that must take place prior to inviting tenders for the project. The Irish Prison Service is being assisted in this work by the National Development Finance Agency. It is intended to invite tenders for the construction of the Phase 2 &mdash; the main prison development next year.  I would expect the new prison to be operational within 3 years of the signing of a contract for Phase 2.</P>
        <P>In relation to expenditure on the project, the cost of the acquisition of the site for the prison development at Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan, County Dublin was &euro;29.9 million. The cost of the site was largely offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin. An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired at a cost of &euro;1.3m to provide a dedicated access route to the main prison site. This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;41.8m, including the site acquisition costs above, has been expended to end August 2009 on professional fees, site preparation and engineering surveys, landscaping and security work. As is the case with all major infrastructure projects a comprehensive set of geological, engineering and archaeological surveys were conducted at the site. These essential <Col N="804"/>preliminary site surveys will help to reduce the overall construction programme once a contract is signed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 2009 (to 10 September) there have been 142 incidents involving suspected grenades, pipe-bombs or other improvised devices, nationwide at which a Defence Forces Explosive Ordnance Device team has attended, with 180 such incidents recorded in 2008 and 98 incidents in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that in respect of the incidents that occurred in 2008 and 2009, up to 10 September, there have been a total of 86 arrests.  There have been four convictions and in another 54 cases the matters are currently before the courts or files are with the DPP.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is in the nature of proceedings for criminal offences that there may be a time period for the investigation, charge, prosecution and eventual conviction or acquittal, and the figures given may, therefore, be subject to change.  A detailed breakdown of the figures for 2007 is not readily available.</P>
        <P>Investigations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into certain recent incidents involving the use of pipe bomb attacks in the greater Dublin area indicate links between members of a republican group and organised criminal elements.</P>
        <P>Garda strategies in counteracting these activities are firmly focused on disrupting these organised criminal groups and where sufficient evidence is adduced, proffering charges and bringing such persons before the Courts.  The Garda&iacute; will continue to take vigorous action in counteracting the threat posed by these gangs.  One of the priorities I have set for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2009 is the targeting of serious crime, in particular organised, gun and drug related crime.  The Garda Policing Plan for 2009 contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in criminality.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil is an important nationwide operation to deal with serious crime, including murder and other violent crime.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which became law on 23 July, further strengthens the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations.  As a result, all organised crime offences will be tried in the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP directs otherwise.  This is being done to prevent intimidation of juries in those cases where such measures are necessary.  A new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation has been created, <Col N="805"/>which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime has been increased from 5 years to 15 years imprisonment.  Expert Garda opinion evidence on the existence and operations of criminal gangs is now admissible in evidence.  Furthermore, there are significant new provisions relating to bail, sentencing, drawing of inferences by the courts, intimidation of witnesses and jurors and a simplification of the procedures relating to the extension of time for questioning.</P>
        <P>Other significant pieces of legislation introduced to target organised crime include the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, which provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which further tightens the legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons.</P>

	<P>The issue of tackling serious crime remains of the highest priority.  I am happy that recent legislation I brought before this House to help combat this issue was enacted by way of the Criminal Justice Amendment Act 2009.  This legislation was brought into effect on 23 July this year.</P>
        <P>This Act is wide ranging and seeks, among other things, to remove the effects of jury intimidation.  It also provides for the use of the Special Criminal Court in trials involving the most serious of crimes.</P>
        <P>Provision has been made in the legislation for increasing the powers of detention available to Gardai and a new offence, that of directing a criminal organisation, has been created which can attract a sentence of up to life in prison if proven guilty.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 is a very new piece of legislation.  While the Garda authorities are already making use of its provisions, it will take some time before they are in a position to bring criminals before the Courts.</P>
        <P>This legislation is aimed at tackling very serious crimes and I am sure that the Deputy would not welcome Gardai rushing investigations with the possibility of failing to provide anything other than comprehensive evidence of criminality to the Courts in very serious cases.  A major conference of senior Garda&iacute;, chaired by the Garda Commissioner, took place in the Garda Training College, Templemore last week to coordinate the efforts of those involved in investigating serious crime.  I have no doubt that the effects of Garda ongoing activities will be demonstrated in a very positive way with cases being brought before the Courts in due course.</P>
        <P>I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close liaison with law enforcement agencies throughout Europe and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence on Irish criminals living abroad.  This ongoing liaison has led to a number of successful joint operations, targeting attempted importations of drugs and firearms, resulting in a number of significant arrests here and in other Jurisdictions.  Where intelligence, supported by evidence, is available law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions put operations in place, as appropriate, to prevent and detect such criminality.</P><Col N="806"/>
        <P>Where information exists that a person, who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction is living abroad, and where the particular legal requirements apply, extradition is sought or a European Arrest Warrant is applied for.  In addition, Ireland is a party to various International Conventions which provide for assistance in criminal matters between jurisdictions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 66 together.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive and robust legal framework is now in place in this area including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.  The Garda Commissioner last year made recommendations to me in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was enacted, further strengthening the law and responding to Garda concerns about knife crime.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords have generally been banned from importation and sale.</P>
        <P>Last February, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a Knife Awareness Campaign by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform and educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives and with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime.  Young people, mainly in their 20s, make up approximately one third of knife crime offenders.  The campaign is therefore targeting a young male audience with messages about the dangers of knives and knife crime delivered through role models in both the sporting and media world.  The campaign is featuring twelve road show meetings during 2009 which are complemented by targeted online advertising.</P>
        <P>The roll out of the local road show meetings is supported by print and broadcast media initiatives that are designed to be specific to the locality of the meeting.  The campaign is supported online by a dedicated website and a presence on social networking websites, as well as uploaded videos and a viral video.  This will help deliver the campaign message through media that its target audience find accessible and feel comfortable with.  Information leaflets on the campaign will also be made available to young people and their parents.</P>
        <P>The campaign is linked with programmes which support youth workers on youth diversion projects, thereby enabling the campaign message to reach at-risk young people.  This work is further strengthened by community Garda&iacute; who, as part of their functions, visit schools to cover a number of topics such as underage drinking, drugs and bullying.  These community Garda&iacute; have been supplied with the necessary tools to bring the key messages of the campaign into schools around the country.</P><Col N="807"/>
        <P>More generally, all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime.  Areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.  Almost 575,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter, which was commenced by the then Commissioner in February, 2002 to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour against the local and business communities.</P>
        <P>Statistics show that nearly one third of knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges of policing and enforcement.</P>
        <P>The whole area of knives and knife crime is kept under constant review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 46 together.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau includes a number of Social Welfare inspectors who are appointed as Bureau Officers and who are actively engaged in identifying and targeting funds accumulated by criminals.  Where such assets are identified they are seized in order to deprive criminals of the opportunity of benefitting from the use of those assets.</P>
        <P>Social Welfare inspectors attached to the Bureau also investigate and determine social welfare entitlements of persons who are suspected of deriving assets from criminal activity.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Regional Director&rsquo;s Office of the Department of Social and Family Affairs fully cooperates with all requests in relation to cases of interest to Bureau Officers and also refers Departmental cases deemed suitable for consideration of investigation and determination by the Bureau.</P>
        <P>The effectiveness of this approach can be seen from the fact that in the period since its inception up to the end of 2007, CAB made savings of over &euro;3.5m and recovered &euro;2.5m in relation to social welfare payments.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the average length of a life sentence in Irish prisons; and if, in view of the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the matter of mandatory prison sentences, he will elaborate further on comments he made recently on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31438/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A person subject to a life sentence remains the subject to that sentence for life.  A life sentence is mandatory in a limited number of cases most importantly in the case of a conviction for murder.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Houses of the Oireachtas in enacting the Criminal Justice Act 1960 and the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provided a framework whereby the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may release prisoners for such period and subject to such conditions as may be specified.  Temporary release may be granted on a number of grounds including humanitarian grounds or where the Minister is of the opinion that the person has been rehabilitated and would upon being released be capable of reintegrating into society.  Before making a decision regard has to be had to a number of factors including the nature and gravity of the offence, the period of imprisonment served and the potential threat to the safety and security of the public.</P>
        <P>A person who has been sentenced to a life sentence and continues to remain a threat will serve his or her life sentence in custody.  Five life sentenced prisoners have died in custody since 1997 and a number of current life sentenced prisoners have served more than 30 years in custody.</P>
        <P>However when a prisoner has served a lengthy period of imprisonment and has been rehabilitated, consideration is given to granting extended periods of temporary release to such a person.  Those life sentenced prisoners on temporary release remain subject to their sentence and if they breach any conditions they will be returned to custody.</P>
        <P>The average time spent in custody by life sentenced prisoners given extended periods of temporary release over the last five years is 16 years.  The comparable figure for the period 1975 to 1984 was 7 to 8 years.</P>

        <P>Clearly there are different circumstances which must be taken into account in each tragedy which attracts a mandatory life sentence.  Consequently to impose a mandatory period of a specific duration which must be served in custody without any prospect of temporary release <Col N="810"/>would not, in my view, be the correct way to proceed.  Our current system provides that all prisoners who are serving a life sentence are eligible to have their cases reviewed by the Parole Board when they have served seven years in custody.  The Board makes recommendations to me as Minister on how such life sentences should be managed.  Generally speaking &mdash; as the average sentence length suggests &mdash; life sentenced prisoners are reviewed on a number of occasions before any substantial recommendations are made that might eventually lead to the release of the prisoner into the community to continue to serve his/her sentence, subject to strict conditions.  The Parole Board process has, I believe, served us well and I do not propose to alter the current practice.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Bernard Allen</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the reason suspects subject to European arrest warrants were released in 2008 due to processing delays; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31433/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The three cases referred to by the Deputy were reported by Ireland in response to an EU questionnaire on the operation of the European Arrest Warrant. In two of the cases, the subjects were released in 2008 and the third subject was released in March 2009. The three subjects were released because the issuing authority failed, in each case, to collect the subjects within the statutory time limit. </P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended, a person, whose surrender has been ordered by the High Court, must be surrendered to the requesting state within 10 days from the date the Order takes effect. The Act provides for an extension of the time limit in circumstances where a date is agreed between the issuing authority and the Irish Central Authority for the European Arrest Warrant . The courts in this jurisdiction have ruled that applications for such extensions must be made to the courts and that the issuing authorities must show good reason why it was not possible to collect the subject within the time limit. If no extension is sought or, if sought, the extension is refused, the subject must be released on expiration of the Order. In each of the three cases in question, the Irish Central Authority notified the issuing authorities of the Order for surrender and the time limit in accordance with standard procedures. In each case, the issuing authority was unable to collect the subject within the statutory time limit.</P>
        <P>Following legal proceedings in two of the cases, the courts ordered release of the subjects on the grounds that the reasons advanced by the issuing authorities for failure to collect within the time-limit were not sufficient. As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are, subject to the law and the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their functions and it is not open to me to make any comment in relation to these proceedings.  In the third case, the subject was released on legal advice after the issuing authority failed to respond to the Irish Central Authority.</P>
        <P>Since the European Arrest Warrant Act came into force, Ireland has surrendered 234 persons on foot of warrants.</P>
        <P>Finally, I should add that the Central Authority has raised the issue of non-collection with the authorities of a particular Member State. In response, the authorities in the state concerned have assured the Irish authorities that subjects will be collected on time. The Central Authority will continue to monitor the situation and take action as appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>At 31 July 2009, there were 407 attested Reserve Garda&iacute; and 151 Reserve trainees.  Details of the stations to which the Reserve members were assigned are set out in the table below.</P>
        <P>The Agreed Programme for Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full-time strength of the force.  As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner is continuing to make every effort to reach the recruitment target.  In that context, I would point out that the moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve, as members are volunteers and do not draw a salary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recruitment is ongoing and the Public Appointments Service has received over 1,700 expressions of interest to join the Reserve in 2009.  The PAS holds interviews on a rolling basis at a range of locations around the country.  The ongoing public information campaign to recruit members to the Garda Reserve includes indoor and outdoor awareness raising campaigns and radio and TV promotional interviews nationally and locally.</P>
        <P>The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the recommendation contained in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes that responsibility for the operation of immigration control at the point of entry should be transferred to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Decisions on all of the issues arising from this Report will be a matter for Government. It is important to recognise that immigration controls at ports of entry are the first line in maintaining the integrity of the State&rsquo;s immigration system and are critical to the security of the State.  Dublin Airport is by far the State&rsquo;s largest port of entry accounting for over 20m passenger journeys each year.  It is essential therefore that any proposed change to the existing system of immigration controls is carefully considered.</P>
        <P>The most effective approach to maintaining the integrity and security of the states borders is currently being reviewed at a senior level within the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the Garda National Immigration Bureau and this review will take in the elements which can contribute to maximising the effectiveness and delivery of that function and, will of course, take on board the relevant comments and recommendations in this respect contained in the Special Group Report.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table contains the number of cases of murder in which a firearm was used, proceedings commenced and convictions secured from 1998 to 2008 and in 2009 up to 10 September.  Of these murders, nineteen took place in 2009.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, these statistics, by their nature, carry a significant health warning.  The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.</P><Col N="817"/>
        <P>All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will continue to be so.</P>
        <P>While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, there can be considerable difficulties for them in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities.  It has to be accepted that the reality is that associates of a victim of a gangland killing who would have information of value to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na often do not cooperate with Garda investigations.  Indeed, they frequently fail to cooperate even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  A number of changes to the law on evidence have been made to address this.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.</P>
        <P>Our criminal law has been significantly strengthened in recent years.  Many of these changes are targeted at fighting gangland crime.  The Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide ranging reforms to strengthen the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle serious crime.  One of the most far reaching has been the introduction of seven day detention for offences connected with organised crime such as murder or kidnapping involving the use of a firearm.  The bail laws have been strengthened to allow the prosecution mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  For example, applicants for bail can be required to provide a statement of their means so that the prosecution can highlight any divergence between their lifestyles and their stated means as evidence of their involvement in gangland activity.  The circumstances in which inferences may be drawn at trial from a suspect&rsquo;s silence in response to Garda questioning have also been expanded.</P>
        <P>A significant further strengthening of the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations took place with the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which became law on 23 July.  As a result, all organised crime offences will be tried in the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP directs otherwise.  This is being done to prevent intimidation of juries in those cases where such measures are necessary.  A new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation has been created, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime has been increased from 5 years to 15 years imprisonment.  Expert Garda opinion evidence on the existence and operations of criminal gangs is now admissible in evidence.  Furthermore, there are significant new provisions relating to bail, sentencing, drawing of inferences by the courts, intimidation of witnesses and jurors and a simplification of the procedures relating to the extension of time for questioning.</P>
        <P>Other significant pieces of legislation introduced to target organised crime include the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, which provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which further tightens the legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons.</P>
        <P>A further important development is the publication of the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 which gives effect to the measures contained in the Justice for Victims Initiative.  The Bill provides for reform of the law on victim impact statements and proposes to end the ban on retrying people who have been acquitted in specified circumstances.</P>
        <P>I expect that the Criminal Justice (Forensic Sampling and Evidence) Bill, which will provide for the establishment and operation of a DNA database, will be published in this session.</P><Col N="818"/>
        <P>One of the priorities I have set for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2009 is the targeting of serious crime, in particular organised, gun and drug related crime.  The Garda Policing Plan for 2009 contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in criminality.</P>
        <P>Operations against organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are undertaken on an ongoing basis.  The members of such gangs and their operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are the subject of such operations, which are primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>In particular, Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 to deal with serious crime, including murder and other violent crime, and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</P>
        <P>Under Operation Anvil, up to 6 September, 2009, over 2,700 firearms have been recovered.  There have also been over 8,200 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, serious assault, robbery and burglary in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and over 79,700 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to address the issue of illegal guns relentlessly through Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>I am determined that the highest priority will continue to be given to frontline policing.  In addition to Operation Anvil, other key operations will be maintained through 2009, and I am determined that any savings that will have to be made will not be allowed to diminish frontline policing.</P>

	<P>A significant number of prisoners go to Loughan House on the first day of their sentence or soon after being admitted into the prison system.  Accordingly, testing positive for drugs on arrival in Loughan is not an indication that a prisoner has consumed drugs while in the prison. </P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that drugs present a major challenge to the Irish Prison Service and in this context, the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy, entitled <i>Keeping Drugs out of Prison </i>was launched in May 2006<i>.</i>  The implementation of this Policy &amp; Strategy has seen an intensification of efforts in the prison system to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons including:</P><Col N="819"/>

That said, the Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement its Drugs Policy and Strategy, which also includes continued investment in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners&rsquo; treatment and rehabilitative needs.</P>

        <Quest> if his <Col N="821"/>attention has been drawn to the hardship being imposed on migrants who are granted long-term residency here arising from the recent imposition, with little notice, of a &euro;500 fee; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should be aware that Ireland is virtually alone among E.U. member States in not hitherto charging a fee for long term residency status.  The fee now imposed is not considered excessive and compares favourably with that charged by the U.K. immigration authorities, for example, where a fee of &euro;950 is levied for conveying a similar status. </P>
        <P>Long term residency is an administrative scheme operated by my Department since 2004.  It enables individuals who have been legally resident in the State on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions to apply for the status of long term resident thus allowing them to engage in employment without the need for a work permit/work authorisation and negating the need for them to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau on an annual basis.  A long term residency permission is valid for a period of five years and on its expiry, the individual may apply to have same renewed.</P>
        <P>The procedures involved in processing applications for long term residency are very similar to those applicable to applications for naturalisation i.e. the individual in question must be legally resident in the State for a specific period, he or she must be financially self-sufficient, be of good character, etc.  The processes used to determine eligibility have been developed and refined since the scheme was introduced and, as is the case with naturalisation, are necessary to maintain the integrity of the process.  Depending on the complexity of any given case, these processes can necessarily take some time to complete and involve a substantial burden on State resources.  It is entirely appropriate that the State should seek to recover some of these costs.  It should be noted that the fee involved does not fully meet the cost of processing the application.</P>
        <P>The fee of &euro;500 applies to all applicants on the initial grant of a long term residency status on or after 7 September, 2009.  This status shall be valid for a period of five years at which time, the person concerned will be required to re-apply for long term residency.  No fee will be payable to renew such a permission other than the existing registration fee payable to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (G.N.I.B.).  Accordingly, it is worth noting that the overall cost to the applicant of long term residency, even with the fee, is less than he/she would incur by registering annually with G.N.I.B. during the currency of the long term residency permission.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The mission of the Irish Prison Service is to provide safe, secure and humane custody for people who are sent to prison.  The Service is committed to managing custodial sentences in a way which encourages and supports prisoners in their endeavouring to live law abiding and purposeful lives as valued members of society. </P>
        <P>Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multi-dimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and in-reaching statutory and non-statutory services.  Amongst these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive <Col N="822"/>personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is also engaged in introducing an enhanced model of sentence management for prisoners (Integrated Sentence Management &mdash; ISM).  ISM will involve a new emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result will be a prisoner-centred approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.  The development and roll-out of this model is planned to take place on a phased basis with the new system currently being piloted in two Dublin prisons.</P>
        <P>In addition the Probation Service also has an active role during the course of the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging prisoners to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes.  The Service also provides supervision in certain cases under temporary release provisions.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the Government recently re-affirmed its commitment to developing new prison facilities at Thornton Hall to replace the outdated prison facilities at Mountjoy Prison.  The current lack of space, the poor physical infrastructure in Mountjoy Prison severely impacts on the ability of the Irish Prison Service and other agencies to provide the range of work training, education, and other rehabilitation programmes expected of a modern prison system.</P>
        <P>Building a new prison on a green field site will open up new opportunities for the development of progressive regime facilities that will support the rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoners on completion of their sentence.  In developing a design concept for Thornton Hall, the Irish Prison Service will deliver a modern and operationally efficient prison facility which is regime led and which provides safe and secure custody.</P>
        <P>A two phase approach is being adopted for the development of the new prison. The first phase involves essential basic work required for the development, including the construction of a dedicated access route and a perimeter wall.  This work will proceed in the short term on the basis of separate contracts.  It is intended to complete the procurement process for the main prison development while the construction of phase one work is underway.  Once a contract is signed for the main prison complex, it will allow for construction to commence immediately.</P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that severe mental illness is more significant in the prisoner population compared to the general population.  Under current arrangements the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) provides twenty-one Consultant led in-reach forensic mental health sessions weekly to Arbour Hill, Cloverhill, Wheatfield, Mountjoy, the D&oacute;chas Centre, Training Unit, St. Patrick&rsquo;s, Portlaoise and the Midlands Prisons.  In Cork, Limerick and Castlerea, specialist in-reach services are in place for Consultant led mental health sessions.  Clinicians in other prisons (outside the CMH catchment prisons) arrange transfers to CMH services &mdash; mainly in Cloverhill &mdash; for assessment or admission to the CMH. Earlier this year, 10 additional beds were made available by the CMH.  My officials will continue to keep this issue under review.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to reduce, as far as possible, a dependence on imprisonment for default on payment of fines.  While very few persons are in prison at any one time solely for non-payment of a fine, I am determined to reduce those numbers further.<b>  </b>The Fines Bill 2009 is currently before the House and awaiting Committee Stage.  Section 14 of the Bill allows for application to be made to a court to have a fine paid by instalments.  The Bill also allows the courts <Col N="823"/>to impose a community service order on a person who has not paid a fine by the due date for payment.</P>
        <P>As you will be aware I have also set up a Project Board to examine the whole area of Electronic Monitoring.  The final report from that Group is due shortly and that will inform the decision(s) to be made on using EM here for a pilot period as a management tool to support the work of the Garda&iacute; and the Probation Service.</P>

	<P>The recommendation contained in the McCarthy Report that disability functions in my Department be transferred to the Department of Health and Children is the subject of consideration by the two Departments with a view to identifying efficiencies and overall savings as well as ensuring that policy in support of equality for people with disabilities is maintained.</P>
        <P>Given their representative character, the concerns expressed by this Group will be carefully taken into account in the deliberations on this matter.  The Group&rsquo;s contention is that the role in co-ordinating overall policy among Departments under the National Disability Strategy and of promoting equality under that strategy should remain in my Department.  The Group also suggests that the McCarthy recommendations appear to assume that my Department&rsquo;s functions involve the delivery of services whereas those functions centre instead around the promotion of the policy of equality.  The question, ultimately for consideration by the Government in the context of the Estimates process, is whether the system of government in relation to disability equality matters can be better organised and improved at less cost.  I can assure the Deputy that any decision that is made will be in the best interests of persons with disabilities.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the warning contained in the annual report of the Inspector of Prisons that overcrowding in some prisons is so acute that it is in danger of causing serious injury or loss of life; the steps being taken to address this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Inspector of Prisons Annual Report 2008 stated that overcrowding in prisons is an international problem, not unique to Ireland. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and do not have the option of refusing committals.  It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 306.  This represents an 8.5% rise in the number in custody.</P>
        <P>On 17 September, 2009, there were 3,904 prisoners in custody as compared to a bed capacity of 3,947.  This represents an occupancy level of 99%.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons&rsquo; infrastructure.  This has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the <Col N="824"/>provision of extra prison spaces.  There are contingency plans in place in all of our prisons to deal with peak population numbers. Since 1997, in excess of 1,400 additional spaces have been introduced in the prison system including a new accommodation block for 100 prisoners recently opened at Castlerea Prison.  Furthermore, current projects will also provide the potential for an additional 450 prison spaces during 2009 by means of:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will also have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />opening the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison which will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Despite this significant investment, it is quite clear that in some of our prisons we are operating in excess of our bed capacity at this time.  In the longer term, the Government remains firmly committed to replacing the prisons on the Mountjoy complex with modern prison accommodation at Thornton Hall.  Building new prison facilities at Thornton Hall on a green field site will open up new opportunities for the development of structured regime activities that support rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoners.  In developing its design concept for Thornton Hall the Irish Prison Service sought and continues to seek to deliver a modern, operationally efficient and cost effective facility which will provide decent living conditions for prisoners with appropriate support programmes including the provision of  modern facilities for prison staff.</P>
        <P>The mission of the Irish Prison Service is to provide safe, secure and humane custody for those placed into custody.  This is one of the main reasons for the introduction of recent security initiatives, such as airport style security screening including x-ray machines and scanning equipment, the establishment of the Operational Support Group, the establishment of the Drug Detection Dog Service within the Irish Prison Service, the segregation of a number of serious drug and criminal gang members in a high security unit in Cloverhill Prison and the use of phone detectors and phased installation of telephone blocking technology.</P>
        <P>No level of inter prisoner violence is acceptable.  Every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  While the prison regime is designed to limit the scope of acts of violence, it is not possible to completely eliminate the possibility of such acts in prisons holding a high proportion of violent offenders without introducing a regime that would be unacceptable.  When you consider that in 2008 the Irish Prison Service provided almost 1.3 million bed nights to predominantly young males, the number of assaults on prisoners, particularly those using a weapon, was comparatively low.  There were a total of 759 incidents of violence among prisoners during the year of which less than 7% included the use of a weapon.  This amounts to an average of 2 incidents per day among a population of more than 3,500.  Moreover, prisoner on prisoner attacks are very rarely random acts of violence. They are invariably related to matters such as drug debts and gang rivalries, all of which have their origins outside the prison setting.</P>

	<P>I have requested details from the Garda Authorities in relation to the amount spent on renovating Templemore Garda College and I will be in contact with the Deputy when the information is to hand.<b></b></P>
        <P>The Garda Training College continues to provide an excellent and essential service to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will do so into the future.</P>
        <P>There are currently a total of 600 Garda students in training and approximately 900 student Garda&iacute; will have become attested to the force throughout the course of 2009.  The Public Service recruitment moratorium does not apply to the Garda Reserve and recruitment to the Reserve is ongoing.  There are currently 151 reserve members at various stages of training and these trainees attend the Garda Training College as part of their training programme.</P>
        <P>In the past few years the accelerated recruitment campaign resulted in additional demands on the capacity of the training college.  In response to on-going training requirements, some in-service Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Courses for full-time members of the Force were transferred to an outsourced centre at the Abbey Court Hotel, Nenagh in 2005.  This allowed the Garda College to concentrate on recruitment training. In recent months the outsourcing has discontinued and CPD training is now taking place in the Garda College with a consequent reduction in associated training costs.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can avail of CPD courses in areas such as Crime Prevention, Tactical Training, Forensic Collision and Cultural Diversity issues.</P>

	<P>Ireland is one of a number of EU Member States with a national resettlement programme.  Since 2000, Ireland <Col N="826"/>has accepted over 900 persons for resettlement from over 20 countries.  Under the applicable Government Decision, the annual resettlement quota under the UNHCR Resettlement Programme is currently 200 persons to be admitted as programme refugees.</P>
        <P>On 2 September 2009, the European Commission adopted a Communication on the establishment of a Joint EU Resettlement Programme which would be a new element of the Common European Asylum System.  The Commission proposes that the Joint Programme would have the following added value compared to the existing national programmes of some of the Member States:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />increased humanitarian impact through greater and better targeted support to the international protection of refugees through resettlement.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />enhanced strategic use of resettlement by ensuring that it is properly integrated into the Union&rsquo;s external and humanitarian policies generally.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />streamlining the Union&rsquo;s resettlement efforts delivering benefits in the most cost-effective manner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Commission proposal is based on the following guiding principles:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />participation by Member States in resettlement should remain voluntary.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the scope of resettlement activity in the EU should be widened.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the mechanism for setting resettlement priorities annually should be adaptable.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />actors other than Member States should participate, including UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The resettlement activities of EU Member States are eligible for financial support from the European Refugee Fund (ERF) which was established for the period 2008 to 2013 by Decision No 573/2007/EC.  The Commission proposes that the ERF Decision be amended to provide the mechanism for setting common EU resettlement priorities for the following year through a Decision to be taken by the Commission.  Following the adoption of the Commission Decision, the Member States will provide pledges of numbers of persons whom they will resettle according to the common EU annual priorities.  On the basis of these pledges Member States will receive financial assistance of &euro;4,000 per person to be resettled.</P>
        <P>The Commission proposal for an amendment to the 2007 ERF Decision is subject to the co-decision procedure involving the European Parliament and the Council. Detailed work on the proposal by the preparatory bodies of the Council has yet to commence.  However, as this work proceeds my Department will be concerned to ensure that the advantages of a Joint EU Programme which are suggested by the Commission are in fact achievable and that the positive elements of the national resettlement programmes are not lost with the establishment of a Joint EU Programme.</P>

        <Quest> the quantity and value of seizures of heroin, cocaine, cannabis, and of other drugs here during 2007, 2008 and to date in 2009; the proportion of the overall flow of drugs into Ireland which is believed to be represented by these seizures; the new initiatives he plans to control the flow of illegal drugs into Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The following tabular statement gives the latest available information in relation to drug seizures for 2007, 2008 and this year to date.  </P>
        <P>This statement shows seizures of a total value of over &euro;168m being made in 2007 and just over &euro;200m in 2008.</P>
        <P>Because of the covert nature of the activity, it is simply not possible to give a reliable estimate of the proportion of drugs coming into the country that these figures represent.</P>
        <P>While it is true that some international studies attempt to estimate the proportion of overall drugs seized to production, this is not a reliable guide to the situation in any particular country.  In particular, such figures cannot reflect increased enforcement levels in a country.</P>
        <P>Through ongoing specific initiatives and intelligence-led operations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to seize substantial quantities of illegal drugs and identify those involved in the importation, distribution, sale and supply of illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>In addition to the officers of the Force specifically assigned to the drugs issue who are attached to the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional Drug Units, officers from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau all assist in our overall law enforcement response to drug trafficking and drug dealing.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Garda&iacute; work closely with Customs and the Naval Service under the umbrella of the Joint Task Force on Drugs as well as with their international colleagues in tackling the problem.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that, in addition to the considerable volume of drugs seized to date in 2009, a significant impact continues to be made by the arrest and prosecution of a number of major players involved in drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>Recent and ongoing initiatives include</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the operation of the Organised Crime Unit on a permanent capacity,</P><Col N="828"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ongoing Irish involvement in the work of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre in Lisbon,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />strengthened provisions in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the ringfencing of resources  this year for Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am also confident that the recent legislation that I introduced dealing with surveillance coupled with the further measures put in place to tackle organised crime through the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act will be of particular value in tackling drugs gangs.</P>
        <P>Finally, it is clear that we cannot tackle the problem of drug misuse through law enforcement measures alone.  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s recently launched new National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009 to 2016, we need to address the problem in a co-ordinated way across the pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</P>
        <P>In this context, I can assure the House that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, are fully committed to this approach and to the implementation of the Strategy.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities advise that the following tables show the quantities of drugs seized in 2007, 2008 and up to and including 11 September, 2009, on the basis of cases already reported to the Forensic Science Laboratory.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the reason the creation of 900 civilian posts within the garda&iacute; has resulted in the release of only 144 garda personnel for frontline policing duties, as highlighted in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32619/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>An effective police civilianisation programme does not always invoke pure &ldquo;one for one&rdquo; replacement of individual Garda&iacute; with civilians &mdash; it can take a number of forms.  Firstly, of course there is the replacement of sworn members, who are engaged in exclusively clerical, administrative or technical duties, with civilian staff.  Secondly, and very importantly there is the use of civilian support which allows sworn members who would otherwise have to devote a significant part of their working day to performing some administrative duties to focus exclusively on front-line policing duties.  Thirdly, there is the recruitment of civilians to perform completely new or expanded administrative, managerial and professional support roles in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example as crime analysts or IT specialists.</P>
        <P>On this account, and because of the significant restructuring of roles, functions and business areas that has taken place at all levels of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years, it is very difficult to quantify the exact number of posts which were occupied by sworn members but which today are held by civilians.  I can however confirm that since 2003 the number of civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has more than doubled to approximately 2,130 whole time equivalents.  Civilian staff are now involved in the provision of vital support services in a wide range of administrative, professional, technical and industrial areas, including Human Resources, Training &amp; Development, IT and Telecommunications, Finance and Procurement, Internal Audit, Communications, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services.  In addition, a number of essential operational support areas are either wholly or largely staffed by civilian staff, such as the Central Vetting Unit, the Garda Information Services Centre, and the Fixed Charge Processing Office.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, to which I referred earlier, is staffed by qualified and highly trained civilian analysts and civilian Telecommunications Technicians provide front-line support to the whole of the Garda organisation across a range of technologies and services.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004 define a Stateless person as being &lsquo;within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of the 28th day of September, 1954&rsquo;.  The definition of a &lsquo;Stateless Person&rsquo; as outlined under this Convention is <i>&rsquo;a person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of it&rsquo;s law&rsquo;</i>.  Every application for a certificate of naturalisation is dealt with on an individual basis, if the applicant claims to be stateless then the citizenship laws of the country of origin, country of birth and any other country that may be involved are examined to determine whether the applicant is entitled to citizenship.  It is only after these checks are completed will a determination on the nationality of the applicant be made.</P>
        <P>The number of applications in the last five years from persons who have presented as being Stateless is twenty three.  Eleven of these applications are pending a decision, while three have been refused and four were ineligible.  Five applications have been approved.  Of these one had their status confirmed as Stateless, two were found to have nationality of another country and two are currently being examined to determine if they have an entitlement to nationality of another country.</P>
        <P>In the overall context the proportion of applicants presenting as Stateless is very low at 1 in every 2,000 applications.  Some people may consider themselves to be Stateless for example due to their ethnic origins but nonetheless have entitlement to nationality of their country of birth or nationality of another country through descent.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the incident to which the Deputy refers remains the subject of an active and ongoing investigation.  A number of persons have been charged and are currently before the Courts in connection with the incident.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate for me to go into any further details about the matter, including the amount of money recovered to date.</P>
        <P>As I stated in the immediate aftermath of this robbery, I spoke to the Chief Executive of the institution and expressed my concern that such a large sum of money could be removed from the bank in this manner.  Several meetings have also taken place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives from the financial institutions to discuss issues relating to their security arrangements, including the issue of so-called &lsquo;tiger&rsquo; kidnappings.  There are agreed response procedures, which are detailed and all-encompassing, between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the financial institutions to deal with situations where members of staff or their families are taken hostage in order to facilitate robberies of such institutions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does <Col N="831"/>not, for obvious security reasons, disclose information relating to such procedures and protocols.</P>
        <P>I know that the members of this House will agree with me that it is vitally important that financial institutions follow the robust procedures and protocols that are in place to prevent robberies.  These are there, first and foremost, to protect employees.  It is important to recognise that it is only by rendering so-called &lsquo;tiger&rsquo; kidnapping attempts unsuccessful that we will stop them happening, and thereby protect innocent employees from being caught up in them in the future.</P>

	<P>The matter to which the Deputy refers concerns the alleged leaking of official material from Garda sources to the media relating to a deceased person.  An investigation under section 98 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 into the matter was carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the full text of that report is available on its website. </P>
        <P>The Ombudsman Commission report recommends to the Garda Commissioner that supervisory ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should regularly monitor the use of PULSE to ensure that members adhere to their legal and disciplinary obligations with regard to its proper use.  The report also recommends that suitable measures be put in place by the Garda authorities to ensure audit trails of the usage of PULSE and any other official information systems can always be accurate and verifiable.</P>
        <P>With regard to PULSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have detailed procedures and instructions in place on the operation of the PULSE system.  The PULSE system incorporates an accurate audit system which records all record creations and updates made on the system.  The audit record includes the date and time when the update on the system took place and contains details of the user signed onto the system at that time.  Audit-trails also record all inquires made on the core items of interest on the PULSE system including Person and Vehicle.  Audit records are written at the time the associated transaction took place.  These audit records can only be accessed centrally and are not available or visible to the users.</P>
        <P>In response to the report, a review to consider the matters raised and identify options for enhanced usage of the PULSE Audit data in respect of the monitoring of data access has been conducted by the Garda&iacute;.  Specific proposals in this regard have been formulated and are presently under consideration by senior Garda management.  Under these proposals an &lsquo;Exceptional activity level report&rsquo; and related business process has been advanced which will highlight to Garda Management specific PULSE records which are subject to a high level of data access activity occurring within a defined period.  This new functionality will be included in the next major release of PULSE.</P>

	<P>I understand that an ad-hoc group of non-governmental organisations has made a complaint to the European Commission about the level of Government funding for the Equality Authority.</P>
        <P>The Commission has a mechanism for considering complaints from the general public of failure by a Member State to fulfil an obligation under Community law.  It is a matter for the Commission in its own discretion to decide to commence proceedings on foot of a complaint.  The individual complainant has no say in determining whether or not the Commission actually initiates proceedings against a Member State.</P>
        <P>It would be inappropriate therefore for me to comment further at this stage, before the Commission has had an opportunity to consider the merits of the complaint.</P>

	<P>The Garda Commissioner has accepted the findings of the Monageer Inquiry and is committed to ensuring that the safety and protection of children is a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The Children First guidelines provide the essential framework for the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive in dealing with the sensitive area of child safety.  The guidelines, as the national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children, together with the relevant legislation, in particular the Child Care Act 1991 as amended, are being fully applied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The recommendations of the Inquiry are being utilised to refine the practices and procedures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that they complement the guidelines.</P>
        <P>On 5 June 2009, the Health Service Executive, in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, established an out of hours emergency place of safety service, which is being provided by a private operator as agent of the HSE, for children found to be at risk (outside the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow catchment area for which provision had already been made).  These arrangements have been brought to the attention of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

In relation to statistics for drug driving prosecutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Overall the statistics on recorded crime in the second quarter of 2009 published by the Central Statistics Office show a continuation of the encouraging trends of the previous quarter which is very welcome.</P>
        <P>As I said at the time of the release of the statistics it is heartening that of the 14 crime groups for which statistics are given, 11 show reductions, including public order, weapons and explosives and sexual offences and I am encouraged by positive trends which these statistics reveal.</P>
        <P>That is not to ignore the fact that the statistics also reveal some matters of particular concern to which the Government is vigorously responding.</P>
        <P>For example, while the number of homicides overall show a decrease of 20.8% (due to reduced numbers of cases of manslaughter and cases of dangerous driving leading to death) there has been an increase in the number of murders, from eight in the second quarter of 2008 to 15 in the equivalent period for 2009.</P>
        <P>Many of these were gangland related, and it was partly to combat this trend that I piloted significant legislation through the Oireachtas in the past number of months, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act.</P>
        <P>In terms of drugs offences, Garda operations have contributed to the significant increase of 54.8% in the number of detections of cultivation or manufacture of drugs.</P>
        <P>This, allied with decreases in the possession of drugs for sale or supply (- 4.3%) and for personal use (- 0.8%), is the result of the priority given by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to intercepting the supply of drugs.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware from media reports and elsewhere of the ongoing action being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in pursuing the activities of drugs gangs and the ongoing considerable success they are having in making major seizures and arrests.</P>
        <P>Indeed I warmly commend our law enforcement agencies, specifically our Customs Service and An Garda Siochana on their recent high profile successful operations in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is no room for complacency and this work is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Finally , it is clear that we cannot tackle the problem of drug misuse through law enforcement measures alone.  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s new National Drugs Strategy for the period  2009 to 2016, we need to address the problem in a co-ordinated way across the pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</P>
        <P>In this context, I can assure the House that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, are fully committed to this approach and to the implementation of the Strategy.</P>

	<P>Statistical information as sought by the Deputy is not collected through my Department.  Responsibility for statistical information rests with the Central Statistics office (CSO).  The CSO have provided the information as set out in the table.  The information relates to 2007 and is based on information coming from the CSO Business Demography 2007 report. This figure is taken from the CSO Business Register and includes enterprises that were active at some stage during the year 2007.</P>
        <P>The CSO figures above do not include some NACE Code sectors that are not yet covered reliably on the Business Register. The current CSO figures are different from some of the figures previously quoted (i.e. 233,200) in the supporting material to the Report of the Small Business Forum (SBF). The numbers of enterprises that are not included in the CSO figures above but which are included in the supporting material to the Report of the Small Business Forum (SBF) amount to an overall total of approximately 45,400.  The sectors and numbers involved are J &mdash; Financial Services (8,100), M &mdash; Education (4,700), N &mdash; Health (11,100) and O &mdash; Other Services (21,500). In addition the CSO figures only include businesses which are active on Revenue records.  The two main Revenue sources used are VAT payments and employer registrations.  Businesses are included in the population of active enterprises for the year 2007 if they pay VAT to Revenue or are registered as an employer with Revenue. So enterprises that have no employees, and are either below the VAT threshold or exempt from VAT, would have been included in the earlier SBF figures but are excluded from the CSO Business Demography report.</P>
        <P>Since the CSO figure includes enterprises that were active at any stage during the year 2007, these figures are not affected by the economic downturn.</P>
        <P>CSO is continuing to improve and expand its Business Register in order to collect and publish more extensive information.</P>

	<P>The Supreme Court judgment of 30th April 2009 allowed the report of the inspector to be circulated to certain bodies. These certain bodies are those as listed in the interlocutory order made by the High Court on 22 April 2005 and are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>(i) <Miles com="ix" />the Garda National Immigration Bureau</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p2- ?>(ii) <Miles com="ix" />the Competition Authority</P>

<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>(v)  <Miles com="ix" />the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">All of the parties already listed above have been made aware of the Supreme Court judgement and all have copies of the report. </P>
        <P>The final step in the legal process following on the Supreme Court judgement delivered on 30th April 2009 is the granting of a final perfected order by the Court. This order will be consistent with the Judgement delivered. The Supreme Court has asked that the Minister have an order drafted that will  include a list identifying those entities to whom the Report should be circulated. This draft has already been made up and sent to counsel for advice and presentation to the Supreme Court. The draft will be pleaded before the Supreme Court by both sides and a perfected final order will then be granted by the Supreme Court. As regards the investigation of any body following on information contained in this report it is the case that until such time as the perfected final order of this judgement has been granted by the Supreme Court no action relating to the report may be taken by any of the bodies in possession of the report.</P>
        <P>Great difficulties have been experienced in ascertaining whether and what payments were eventually made to the GAMA workers involved. Awards of &euro;8,000 each in lieu of overtime were made at an early stage through LRC/Labour Court adjudication to a number of the protesting GAMA workers and others. It was difficult from the information supplied to confirm for certain whether all of the Irish Gama workers had received full value for the amounts transferred to them by payments made to them through their personal Finansbank and Isbank accounts. It will be open to the various agencies of the State to consider what further action may be possible when the final order is granted by the Supreme Court.</P>

An application which was received in late 2008 has been authorised and payment will issue shortly.  The second application received from the company in June 2009 awaits processing.</P>
        <P>Due to the unprecedented increase in the volume of claims on hand, claims completed manually, submitted by post and received in January and claims submitted online (to www.entemp.ie) received in February are currently being processed.

	<P>Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market (&ldquo;Services Directive&rdquo;) was agreed at European level by way of a co-decision by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in December 2006. </P>
        <P>The negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Directive was lengthy and complex and involved extensive consultation with all key national stakeholders.  The draft Directive was the subject of debates in the Dail on 25th and 26th of January 2006 and in the Seanad (on employment issues) on 25th January 2006.  Ireland supports the Directive, as adopted, as a good basis for creation of a single market in services that will benefit both Irish service providers and Irish consumers.</P>
        <P>The work being done now is largely technical, in terms of how to give effect in Irish law to what was agreed in 2006. The Directive must be brought into force by 28th December of this year.</P>
        <P>I propose to bring the Directive into effect by way of statutory instrument, under the European Communities Act 1972. This is the approach used for the majority of EU Directives and, in this case, will facilitate the transposition of the Directive by the due date. Work on the transposition of the Directive is well advanced and my Department has continued to consult widely.  The Directive is unusual in that the transposition process involves a great deal of administrative work as well as legal drafting. The legal aspect of the transposition process will mainly involve ensuring that the provisions of the Directive are reflected in the transposing instrument. This work is detailed and technical and involves a great deal of co-operation with other Departments (which has been ongoing since the Directive was first proposed in 2004). The transposing legislation will faithfully reflect what is set out in the Directive.</P>

	<P>Access to finance and credit for SMEs has been a prime focus of Government initiatives.  Central to our efforts has been the restoration of a properly functioning banking system to support our wider economy and to facilitate our enterprise sector to deal with the current economic situation and to be prepared to benefit from any upturn in the global economy.</P>
        <P>Government action has included the bank guarantee scheme, the Banks&rsquo; Recapitalisation Scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the publication of the National Assets Management Agency Bill.  SMEs are benefiting from the following initiatives:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the banks&rsquo; Recapitalisation Package, the recapitalised banks are committed to increase their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A &euro;100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund has been  established by each bank as well as a further &euro;15m each to new or existing seed capital funds.  Much of the funding is flowing to small and medium enterprises.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />SMEs are now covered by the Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs.  This will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks and should facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank are providing funding for SMEs on foot of &euro;300m facilities provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing SMEs.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Minister for Finance and I established a Credit Supply Clearing Group last May with bank, business (including ISME and SFA) and State representation.  This Group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Minister for Finance has published the Review of Bank Lending to SMEs (Mazars Report) which looked at credit availability and recommended appropriate action. Follow-up work on implementing the recommendations in the Mazars Report is currently ongoing.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To assist and complement the work of the Credit Supply Clearing Group, Billy Kelleher, T.D., the Minister for Trade and Commerce at my Department held eight regional meetings over a two-week period during June and July to discuss with representatives of business, banks and the State sector, their experience of gaining access to bank credit at local and regional level.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As part of the ongoing work of the Government&rsquo;s Credit Supply Clearing Group, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment launched an email link on 28 August last calling for submission from viable businesses that have been refused credit by banks.  Such businesses, where the flow of credit appears to be blocked, can now send their details to a dedicated email contact point at the Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Apart from initiatives in the banking sector, Government has taken other actions additional to the range of assistance already provided by the enterprise support agencies, to directly assist SMEs getting access to financing.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Government has provided &euro;100m for an Enterprise Stabilisation Fund. Under the scheme, Enterprise Ireland can give up to &euro;500,000 to viable companies with robust <Col N="839"/>business models that are facing difficulties as a result of the current economic environment.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />I have also announced a &euro;250m Scheme to protect up to 27,400 vulnerable jobs in the productive sector of the economy. The Temporary Employment Subsidy Scheme will provide a subsidy of &euro;9,100 per employee over fifteen months to qualifying exporting enterprises in the manufacturing and/or internationally traded services sectors.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">With effect from 15 June last all Government Departments are required to pay suppliers and contractors within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  Responsibility for implementing the terms of the Government Decision rests with each individual Department. Suppliers pursuing payments should contact the relevant Departmental section with which the contract was arranged.  As part of the new arrangements, Departments will be required to report quarterly to my Department on the manner in which they have complied with the Government commitment.  These first reports are due to be submitted by 15 October.  Departments will also include information on the implementation of the measures in their subsequent Annual Reports.</P>
        <P>As a result of this measure, Departments are required to give greater priority to making timely payments and to ensure that suppliers themselves are aware of how they can assist the process by meeting the requirements of Departments in relation to the submission of invoices.</P>
        <P>On a more specific level, options for various supply chain finance systems have been brought to the attention of different Departments and Agencies, including my own Department.  Promoters of supply chain finance systems have made representations in the context of explaining their proposed systems and outlining opportunities for suppliers and buyers.</P>
        <P>Supply Chain Finance involves systems under which payments to suppliers are organised through a financing entity on behalf of a significant buyer or buyers in accordance with the payment terms under the supply contract.  Systems can facilitate both private sector and public sector buyers.  Within the system the capacity exists for the payment of suppliers by the financing entity earlier than provided for in the supply contract.  Such earlier payments would be at a discounted rate on the original invoice.  In most supply chain finance systems, the authorisation of the invoice for payment by the buyer is required before the financing entity makes payments to the supplier.  Under the arrangement, buyers are required to commit to paying the financing entity in respect of all invoices authorised for payment, within the period of the supply contract.</P>
        <P>Supply Chain Finance systems usually require a critical mass of suppliers and buyers, significant initial funds to meet earlier payments and appropriate IT platforms to administer the arrangements and to interface with relevant buyers and suppliers. Apart from these considerations, the Government&rsquo;s commitment mentioned above, for central Departments to pay suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice lessens the impact of such supply chain finance systems.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to keep under review access to finance and credit for SMEs and will consider what additional initiatives can be taken to improve the situation.</P>

	<P>Under EU Cohesion Policy 2007-13, the European Commission has a number of joint initiatives with the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund aimed at improving access to finance using financing engineering instruments.</P>
        <P>One of these instruments is JASMINE (Joint Action to support microfinance institutions in Europe), a pilot initiative by the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund.</P>
        <P>When Ireland&rsquo;s ERDF Structural Programmes 2007-13 were being developed, the instruments were examined by the Department of Finance, in consultation with representatives of my Department, Enterprise Ireland, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly and Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly in the context of the existing arrangements in place to assist SMEs in accessing appropriate financial support.</P>
        <P>Given the nature and structure of the financial instruments, particularly in terms of the scale of operations that would be required to secure EIF participation, it was not considered suited to our Structural Funds Programmes.</P>
        <P>Following the change in economic circumstances, the EU Commission launched the European Recovery Plan in November 2008. In this context, the Irish Authorities are considering if participation in the various financial instruments are appropriate having regard to the ERDF Programmes and the potential benefits to Irish Businesses.</P>
        <P>Access to finance and credit for SMEs has been a prime focus of Government initiatives.

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory lump sum application from the individual concerned on 17 June 2009.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the onus is on the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. In this case further information has to be requested from the employee to establish whether the employer has since provided the statutory payment. This is causing a further delay in processing the claim, in addition to the delays being experienced arising from the unprecedented high volume of claims on hand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The position in relation to the person mentioned has not changed since the Deputy raised the issue on 5th February, 5th March and 6th of May, 2009, and for ease of reference the relevant details previously mentioned are outlined as follows.</P>
        <P>As there are no records of a claim relating to this person either on the Redundancy Payments System or, I am informed, on the Employment Appeals Tribunal database, it would be prudent at this stage for the individual concerned to bring an appeal for a determination in favour of his claim to a redundancy payment directly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT). An <Col N="843"/>employee must make application for a redundancy payment or seek a determination from the EAT within twelve months of ceasing his employment, though the EAT has the power to extend the lump sum deadline from 52 weeks to 104 weeks. The 52 week deadline applies both to the making of a claim to the employer (Form 77) and to the making of a claim to the EAT in a situation where the employer disputes payment of redundancy.</P>

        <P>A claim can be made to the EAT by submitting a form called a T1-A directly to the Tribunal.  These forms can be obtained from the EAT website http://www.eatribunal.ie.</P>
        <P>As I previously indicated under the Redundancy Payments Scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer.  In general, a redundancy situation exists where an employee&rsquo;s job no longer exists.  It is up to the employer concerned to determine whether or not there is in fact a redundancy situation.  Disputes in this regard can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.  It should be noted that time limits exist as explained in above.</P>
        <P>This individual may be entitled to claim a redundancy lump sum in the event of lay off.  A lay off situation is intended to cover temporary situations where the services of an employee are not required because of lack of work and the employer gives notice that the break in employment is of a temporary nature.  If the lay-off continues, the question arises as to whether it is in fact a temporary measure or could potentially be a redundancy rather than a lay-off situation.  It is the employer who initially decides whether or not there is a redundancy situation but in the case of a dispute, the matter should be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a decision.</P>
        <P>The employee is entitled, after a period of lay-off of four consecutive weeks or a broken series of six weeks within a 13-week period, and, subject to meeting the normal eligibility criteria for redundancy, to seek statutory redundancy.  The employee can, by serving written notice (Form RP 9) on the employer claim redundancy because of the lay-off situation.  Notice must be submitted not later than four weeks after the lay-off ceases.  A copy of the RP 9 form may be had from my Department or may be downloaded from the Department&rsquo;s website at www.entemp.ie.</P>
        <P>In this situation, an employer has a period of 7 days within which to provide a counter-notice to the employee saying that within 4 weeks of the date of the claim for redundancy, it will be possible to offer not less than 13 weeks work without lay off.</P>

	<P>F&Aacute;S Job Clubs were introduced in 1999 to assist people who were actively seeking employment by providing support for the job search process and an environment in which it could be carried out.  Independent Sponsor Groups are contracted by F&Aacute;S on a year to year basis to run the programme.</P>
        <P>Job Clubs are seen as an important resource and intervention for those who have recently completed training programmes or have recently become unemployed.  They provide both a formal and structured input as well as a drop-in resource facility.  They also help the individual in overcoming the personal effects of unemployment by providing a mutual support forum from people in a similar situation.</P><Col N="844"/>

All retained firefighters appointed since 2008 are also given this option. Retained firefighters who had already retired in 2008 were also offered the option of joining the LGSS on the understanding that they repaid their gratuity and paid contributions on all reckonable service.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
        <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to work carried out in relation to the enforcement of Vehicle Registration Tax Regulations.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue enforcement officers, who are based at numerous locations around the country, carry out regular and on-going checks to identify and deal with breaches of the VRT Regulations. This applies particularly in relation to the permanent retention of unregistered vehicles in the State or in the possession of State residents. Co-ordinated national enforcement campaigns also take place in order to detect infringements in this area.</P><Col N="846"/>
        <P>Between 1 January and 31 August 2009, Revenue enforcement officials challenged a total of 15,161 vehicles. Of these vehicles challenged, written warnings were issued in 1,832 cases, which resulted in the collection of &euro;2,539,194 in VRT and a further 1,433 vehicles were seized for breaches of VRT legislation. Court convictions have been obtained in 10 cases with fines totalling &euro;20,162 imposed. Several other cases are due before the Courts or are under consideration for proceedings. The above figures include the results of a VRT blitz conducted during March and April this year in which 3,256 vehicles were challenged that resulted in the collection of &euro;548,000 in VRT.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue officers regularly conduct informal discussions with Northern Ireland customs officials on vehicle registration matters. While no formal forum exists, discussions on vehicle registration matters are normally specific enquiries in relation to individual vehicles which have been presented for registration, or in relation to specific investigation being conducted, usually involving multiple vehicles, associated with cross border VAT fraud.</P>

	<P>The flow of credit is essential to the proper functioning of the economy.  All of the Government&rsquo;s actions to stabilise the financial system have been undertaken in order to ensure that the banks continue to fulfil their essential function in providing credit for individuals and businesses which includes the farming community. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that much has been done to ensure the provision and monitor the flow of credit to viable businesses. These measures include specific commitments attaching to the State&rsquo;s recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  A Credit Clearing Group has also been established, involving business groups including the Irish Farmer&rsquo;s Association, banks, State agencies and Departments which is examining cases of credit refusal referred to it.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of NAMA is to cleanse the balance sheets of participating banks ensuring they are in a position to lend to the economy.  The Government continues to examine potential options in relation to specific credit supply measures attaching to NAMA.</P>

        <P>At end 2008, the national debt stood at &euro;50.4 billion and at end-August 2009 it stood at &euro;69.3 billion. The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) have advised that the main factor influencing the projected increase in the national debt out to 2013 is the planned Exchequer deficit for each of these years. In addition, there may also, in any given year, be some non-cash adjustments related to factors such as premiums and discounts on the issue of new bonds &mdash; in 2008, these amounted to &euro;124 million.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In respect of 2009, the Supplementary Budget forecast an Exchequer deficit of &euro;20.35 billion. Since then a capital injection of &euro;4 billion has been agreed for Anglo Irish Bank, of which &euro;3.8 billion had been paid at end-August 2009. This increases the forecast Exchequer deficit by this amount but does not impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) under EUROSTAT accounting rules.</P>
        <P>The General Government Debt is the standard measurement of gross indebtedness used for comparative purposes within the EU. It is a wider measure of debt than the national debt and includes the debt of the Exchequer, the extra-budgetary funds, the non-commercial state-sponsored bodies, as well as the debt of local authorities. As reported to EUROSTAT in the April EDP Maastricht returns, the General Government Debt stood at 43% of GDP at end-2008. Based on the forecasted position for the General Government Debt at Supplementary Budget time, the expected trajectory for the General Government Debt over the period to 2013 is outlined in the following Table 2.</P>

I indicated that while the banking system can be revived and serve the economy in a proper manner, the existing structures cannot remain the same. Already a number of banks are developing restructuring plans to meet EU requirements arising from recapitalisation. I am confident that this restructuring process will result in a reformed and reinvigorated banking system. While it is too early to define a definitive shape for this new banking system, it will be a focus of my work over the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products that their strategy for tackling this illicit trade is focussed both on intercepting and seizing illicit consignments at the point of importation and also on carrying out checks at retail outlets, markets and commercial premises etc.  This is achieved through a combination of freight intelligence, risk profiling and scanning in the case of smuggling in maritime freight. In the case of passengers arriving by air from high risk source countries where cheap cigarettes are freely available, targeting smugglers is carried out on the basis of risk profiling by Revenue Officers based at all the main airports. Where feasible, large consignments are placed under surveillance and allowed to proceed to their destination under a controlled delivery with a view to identifying those responsible for the importation. These operations are normally carried out on a multi-agency basis with the assistance of the Garda&iacute;.   </P><Col N="850"/>
        <P>Illicit cigarettes that escape detection at the point of importation are also seized inland in the course of intelligence- based checks carried out at retail outlets, markets, commercial premises etc. Follow-up investigations are also conducted both at home and abroad with a view to identifying those responsible and instituting criminal proceedings where the necessary evidence has been obtained.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s strategies in these areas are under continuous review. This includes the adequacy of existing staffing resources and equipment. In this regard, taking cognisance of the interception and seizure of a number of consignments of counterfeit cigarettes bearing bogus Irish tax stamps concealed in maritime freight imported from China, it is planned to introduce a new tobacco tax stamp with added security features shortly. In addition, the purchase of a second mobile container scanner has been approved with delivery due later this year.</P>
        <P>Revenue works closely with the individual tobacco manufacturers and the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee (ITMAC) with a view to identifying illicit cigarettes on sale in the State, current trends and trading patterns. There is also close co-operation and sharing of information between Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control (OTC).  In addition, on an EU wide basis, Revenue actively co-operates and shares information with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and with other Customs Administrations in the Member States. Furthermore, Ireland, along with the other Member States, has also ratified two international agreements concluded by OLAF with global cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, with a view to tackling the illicit trade in counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.</P>
        <P>As regards the estimated cost to the Exchequer mentioned, Revenue has previously acknowledged the difficulty in determining the potential tax loss as a result of the illicit tobacco trade because of the multiple factors that have to be taken into account. For instance, a drop in the overall tax take may be partly due to a decline in smoking levels as a result of the various anti-smoking campaigns. Increased legal purchase of duty paid cigarettes in other EU Member States for personal use is also a factor, particularly in the context of low cost air travel and more frequent foreign holidays. This, of course is perfectly legal in the context of the EU principle of freedom of movement. Consequently the reliable information available, which Revenue can analyse, is mainly the quantity of contraband cigarettes intercepted and seized by Customs, the revenue at risk on those cigarettes and the volumes of cigarettes on which duty is collected each year.</P>
     <P>Details of the above for each of the past three years are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">As regards the estimated cost to the Exchequer, Revenue very tentatively estimate that about 20% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland may be untaxed. This is in line with previous trade estimates, equating to a tax loss of approx. &euro;380m.  However, it should be noted that this estimate includes legal cross-border shopping purchases for personal consumption along with smuggled counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.</P>

	<P>Stamp duty exists on cheques in order to provide Exchequer revenue.  The stamp duty on cheques predates the founding of the State and it was a feature of the Stamp Act 1891 which consolidated all existing stamp duty provisions.  The yield from the duty on cheques, which also includes bills of exchange, promissory notes and drafts, in the 10 years 1999 to 2008 inclusive, was &euro;160.8 million. Figures for earlier years can be obtained if required.  However, the specific information is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted investigation of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; records.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office (CSO) prepared a report, at my request, on the Implications of Cross Border Shopping for the Irish Exchequer.  The report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 20 March 2009.  The report estimated the likely value of cross-border shopping in 2009 to be in the range of &euro;450m to &euro;700m, with a potential loss in Exchequer revenues arising from reduced VAT and excise yields of between &euro;72m and &euro;112m.  In addition, a possible corporation tax loss in the range of &euro;20m to &euro;31m is tentatively estimated.  It should, however, be noted that any estimate for corporation tax is provisional and should only be considered as indicative of the potential loss.</P>
        <P>The report noted that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic, are operating costs, profit margin (mark-up), taxes and the rapid depreciation of Sterling against the Euro.  While changes in the standard VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact however remains small compared to the size of the change in the exchange rate.</P>
        <P>The report also noted that there is rather limited availability of quantifiable data on cross border shopping, and with a view to improving the data available, Revenue and the CSO have worked on questions for inclusion in the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) that should facilitate a more detailed assessment of cross-border shopping in the future.  It is expected that the results of the QNHS Cross Border shopping module will be available by end October 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 to 113, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of vehicles seized by their enforcement staff are stored in the State Warehouse in Dublin.  This Warehouse was designed and constructed specifically with security as a prime consideration.  Seized vehicles are kept within a gated secure compound with 24 hour/7 day onsite security, including the use of CCTV surveillance.  Revenue operates a number of other small compounds around the country to facilitate the shorter-term storage of seized vehicles.  These include both walled and palisade compounds, as well as lock-up units.  Every effort is made to ensure that vehicles are safely stored.  Revenue is conscious of the need to safeguard all such vehicles.  For operational and security reasons, details of security measures cannot be divulged but they do include CCTV monitoring, alarm systems and mobile security checks.</P>
        <P>Since 1 January 2007, there has been only one incident of fire damage to seized vehicles.  This occurred at around 1.30 am on the night of Saturday 20th June 2009 when 4 vehicles were either completely destroyed or substantially damaged by fire in the Revenue vehicle compound attached to Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, Co Mayo.  The vehicles had previously been seized for VRT offences by Revenue&rsquo;s Anti Evasion Team.  Garda&iacute; investigating the incident are satisfied, having reviewed CCTV footage, that it represented an arson attack on the vehicles from outside the compound and that access wasn&rsquo;t gained to the compound itself.  Their investigations are ongoing.  Revenue has subsequently been in contact with the owners of the four vehicles and is corresponding with their legal representatives.</P>
        <P>Other than the above incident, there have been two compensation claims received since 1st January 2007 in respect of seized vehicles allegedly damaged while in the possession of the Revenue Commissioners.  In one case, the alleged incident occurred on 1st May 2007. The case was closed with no compensation paid.  In the second case, the alleged damage to the vehicle occurred on 21st September 2005 and a compensation claim was received on 19th July 2007.  The case is still open.  Neither of these two vehicles was destroyed.</P>

        <Quest> his position on the taxation of public sector retirement gratuities; his views on whether the imminent taxation of gratuities is driving experienced public sector workers into early retirement; his further views on whether these early retirements are removing vital local knowledge from our public services and resulting in a diminishing return; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the tax treatment of retirement gratuities for public servants, the position is that under statutory pension schemes and pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners there is no liability to income tax in respect of retirement gratuities or lump sums paid to members of such schemes on retirement.  In this regard, it should be noted that the tax arrangements for retirement lump sums apply in respect of pension schemes in both the public and private sectors. </P>
        <P>The Commission on Taxation has recommended changes to the tax treatment of retirement gratuities and this recommendation, together with the many other recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report, will be considered by me and my Government colleagues in due course.</P>
        <P>As regards the impact of early retirements on public services the position is that there is a constant turnover of experienced staff in all public service organisations and it is a matter for local management to ensure that systems and procedures, including succession planning, are in place to ensure that service delivery standards are protected as much as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together. </P>
        <P>On the 22nd July 2009 Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited launched a &euro;3.2 billion &ldquo;any and all&rdquo; fixed price cash tender offer for five Tier 1 securities, one Upper Tier 2 security and one lower Tier 2 security.  The purchase price paid for the Tier 1 securities was 27% of nominal value, for the Upper Tier 2 security was 37% of nominal value and for the lower Tier 2 security was 55% of nominal value. &euro;2.5 billion of securities were tendered by investors which corresponds to a weighted average success rate across all of the securities of 77%.  For information I attach a copy of the &ldquo;Market Notice regarding the Tender Offer Results&rdquo; which was issued by the Bank at the completion of the process. The profit arising from the buy back process was &euro;1.6bn.</P>
        <P>The transaction, along with the subsequent &euro;0.8 billion capital injection from the Government significantly bolstered the Bank&rsquo;s Core Tier 1 capital ratio and had only a marginal impact on the Total Capital ratio.  I do not have details of the counterparties concerned because of the nature of the trading and the fact that such information is commercially sensitive.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed a range of reforms of the regulatory structures for financial regulation.  A new single fully integrated regulatory institution, the Central Bank of Ireland, will be established, replacing the current two pillar structure under the existing Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The new structure will be responsible for both the supervision of individual firms and the stability of the financial system generally, combining micro-prudential and macro-prudential supervision in the one institution to achieve the highest performance standards for the new organisation. </P>
        <P>Within the new regulatory structures, the consumer information and education role, currently carried out within the Consumer Directorate in the Financial Regulator will be re-assigned to the National Consumer Agency (NCA) which is being amalgamated with the Competition Authority. Regulation for consumer protection, including the development and enforcement of codes of practice, remains within the new Commission as an integral part of conduct of business regulation.</P>
        <P>A high level group, chaired by my Department and including representatives of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, has been established to expedite the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s decision and undertake appropriate consultations.  As I indicated in my Second Stage speech on the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009, I expect draft legislation providing for these reforms of the regulatory structures for financial regulation to be published before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently announced that Professor Patrick Honohan will succeed Mr John Hurley as Governor later this month and a new Head of Supervision will be appointed shortly.  In addition supervisory capacity is being significantly enhanced through new resources and additional expert staff.</P>

	<P>The methodology for calculating the charge, which is paid on a quarterly basis is: </P>
        <P Just="Center">A   &times;   B   &times;   <u>1</u></P>
        <P Just="Center"><?oasys _is3p6- ?>4</P>
        <P el="5">where:</P>
        <P el="5">A = <Miles com="ix" />the Covered Liabilities for such Payment Quarter, being the average of the Covered Liabilities of the Covered Institution as of the last day of each of the three months preceding the first day of such Payment Quarter,</P>
        <P el="5">B = <Miles com="ix" />the Charge Factor.  The charge factor as set out in Section 16 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 incorporates an assessment of the risks attaching to each individual institution.  These are therefore, highly commercially sensitive, and will not be revealed.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The sum raised to date in 2009 for the provision of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 is &euro;261,159,734 which represents payments for three quarters.  In total, the sum raised for the provision of the guarantee (including accumulated interest) which is held in a mandated account in the Central Bank is &euro;371,227,020.  The Deputy will appreciate that the charge paid and the covered liabilities for each covered institution would allow the Charge Factor to be calculated.  Accordingly, only aggregate figures are being released.</P>
        <P>I have consistently stated that it is my firm intention that the sums raised for the provision of the guarantee should cover the long term cost to the State for providing it.  In the context of the six month review of the charge which was recently undertaken by my Department, and given the shortfall in moneys raised from the charge to date, the charge factor levied on each institution has been reviewed and new, higher rates will be charged for the remainder of the scheme.  The rates have been calculated so as to recover the estimated &euro;1billion cost of the scheme over its lifetime and to ensure that the taxpayer does not bear any unnecessary cost.</P>
        <P>In addition, the covered institutions are obliged to pay all administrative costs associated with the scheme.  The administrative costs are composed of staff costs as well as the costs for the provision of legal and financial advice to both myself and my Department.  In July, my Department billed the covered institutions &euro;2,495,449 for the period to end May 2009 which was received promptly.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the scheme, I recently published the average quarterly liabilities of the covered institutions in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  These are as follows:</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to put a State guarantee in place for the future issuance of debt securities with a maximum maturity of up to five years.  Access to longer-term funding in line with the mainstream approach in the EU is expected to contribute significantly to supporting the funding needs of the banks and to securing their continued stability. </P>
        <P>The enactment of the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act on 26 June 2009 has provided a power to extend the guarantee by order beyond its current expiry date of 29 September 2010. In this regard, work is continuing on the drafting of a scheme, the introduction of which requires EU State aid and Oireachtas approval.</P>
        <P>On 16 September last, I published an outline of the main elements of the proposed new guarantee scheme, called the draft Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme or ELG Scheme, which is available on the Department of Finance website.  The ELG scheme must be approved in accordance with EU State aid rules and discussions are continuing in this regard with the European Commission.  The new scheme will be somewhat more targeted, and in this regard dated subordinated debt or asset covered securities issued after the introduction of the ELG scheme will not be guaranteed either under the ELG scheme or under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) scheme.  A key feature of the ELG scheme will be the ability of covered institutions to access unguaranteed funding.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I have received advice on the banking crisis from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the NTMA.  The private consultancy firm which provided legal, regulatory or financial advice to me on the banking crisis since August 2008 is set out below.</P>
        <P>Arthur Cox solicitors have been engaged by my Department since September 2008 to provide advice in relation to general banking matters including the Bank Guarantee scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of AIB, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank.  The company was paid &euro;1,628,024 in 2008 and &euro;2,254,263 has been paid to date in 2009.  The sum of &euro;5.4 million has been allocated for legal advice for 2009 and an estimate of &euro;3 million has been set aside for legal advice in 2010.</P>
        <P>PriceWaterhouseCoopers was retained by the Financial Regulator in late 2008 to assist the Financial Regulator with a review of the financial and capital positions of Irish banks and to enable the Financial Regulator to advise the Government on what action needed to be taken.  The work undertaken involved an initial high level assessment of the capital and liquidity levels of the institutions, stress testing of the institution&rsquo;s loan portfolios over a three year period, and review the valuation of properties held as collateral against the main property loans.</P>
        <P>The total fees paid by the Financial Regulator to the company in respect of the work was &euro;3.8 million, which has been completed.  In addition, the Financial Regulator has paid &euro;0.84 million to Jones Lang La Salle for financial and property consultancy services in relation to the Bank Guarantee Scheme.</P>
        <P>The National Treasury Management Agency paid a total of &euro;7.3 million to Merrill Lynch for investment banking advice up to 30 June 2009.  Following a competitive tender process in July, Rothschild have now been awarded the contract for investment banking advice.  The NTMA has also retained an economist however the terms of his contract with the NTMA were agreed on a confidential basis.  In addition, following a competitive tender process, the NTMA engaged HSBC and Arthur Cox to provide advice in relation to NAMA.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the estimate provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his recent annual report that the total public sector pension liability is in the order of &euro;108 billion; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest estimate for the gross accrued liability for public service occupational pensions is &euro;108 billion as of December 2008.  This estimate is set out in the recent annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This accrued liability figure is a single monetary amount representing the present value of all expected future superannuation payments to current staff and their spouses in respect of service to date, plus the full liability for all future payments to current pensioners and to their spouses.  The large size of the figure is due to the fact that it represents a projection of aggregate pension payments that will be spread over perhaps 70 years into the future. </P><Col N="861"/>
        <P>The estimate of the accrued liability should not be confused with the actual cash funding that will be required in the future.  The more meaningful measure of public service pension costs is the actual annual gross outgo on pensions, which is expected to amount to 1.6% of GNP in 2009.  The latest forecast is for this outgo to rise to 2.4% of GNP by 2023.  The projected increase arises from the growth in public service employment in the past and from increasing longevity.</P>
        <P>The 2008 Finance Accounts, to be published shortly, will include the estimate of &euro;108 billion for the total liability of public service occupational pension schemes as at 31 December 2008.  The derivation of the accrued liability figure follows the approach set out in the new accounting standard issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board, IPSAS 25.</P>

	<P>For the purposes of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, Ireland is designated into two NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) II regions, namely the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) Region and the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) Region.  Under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective, Ireland has been allocated &euro;750 million of EU Structural Funds for the period 2007-13.  Of this &euro;458 million has been allocated to the BMW Region and &euro;292 million to the S&amp;E Region. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF), which sets out the strategy for using these Funds, was approved by the European Commission in July 2007.  The BMW, S&amp;E and Human Capital Investment Operational Programmes implementing the strategic priorities in the NSRF were approved by the European Commission in October and November 2007.  The annual allocations are set out in table 1, which follows, and reflect the full amount of Structural Funds available to Ireland over the 2007-2013 programming period.  Table 2 sets out the same information broken down by region.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;151 million has been allocated under ERDF for smaller Territorial Co-operation Operational Programmes, including the PEACE III Programme and the INTERREG Programmes for Ireland/Northern Ireland/Scotland and Ireland/Wales.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which Irish credit institutions have drawn down European Investment Bank funds for the purpose of on-lending to small and medium enterprises here; the efforts he has made to encourage these institutions to draw down these funds; the nature of the financial products being employed by the Irish credit institutions to support Irish SMEs with financial backing from the EIB; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32390/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Investment Bank announced on 3 October 2008 that it was increasing lending for European small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to help mitigate the effects of the current credit crisis.  This support is in the form of a &euro;30 billion facility to provide loans to commercial banks for onlending to SMEs to fund medium to long-term investment projects.</P>
        <P>Four banks operating in Ireland now have access to the EIB facility: Allied Irish Bank (AIB), Bank of Ireland (BoI) and Ulster Bank have access to &euro;100 million each and Bank of Scotland Ireland has access to &euro;50 million.</P>
        <P>The overall SME Facility is an important initiative from the EIB and I have strongly urged the Irish financial institutions to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding involved available to SMEs as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The allocation of the loans and the drawdown of the funds is a commercial matter for the banks.  The indications are that substantial amounts of lending under the facility have been approved across a wide range of sectors.  However, it is important to emphasise that the EIB makes funding available for onlending to SMEs as part of its mandate to assist the development of the SME sector.  As a result, commercial banks that borrow from the facility are required to ensure that the money is onlent to SMEs for investment and expansion of their activities.  Investment can include the purchase of tangible assets (other than land unless vital to the investment), spending on development, planning and financing costs during the construction phase of a project, spending on research and development and building up distribution networks.</P>
        <P>It follows that there are constraints on lending from the EIB scheme.  Borrowing for short-term working capital is generally not eligible, although a permanent increase in working capital required to develop an expanding SME would qualify.  Loans for cash flow or the refinancing of other debt and generally for the takeover of other businesses would not qualify.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the adequacy of access to finance and working capital for small and medium enterprises, particularly for micro-enterprises with fewer than ten staff; his views on the finding of the recent Mazars review of lending to SMEs; the actions he has taken on foot of this report; his plans to bring forward new proposals on foot of the recommendations contained in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is of major concern to the Government.  Making additional funds available for SME lending was a condition of the recapitalisation agreements with AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The banks report quarterly on their commitments under recapitalisation and the Supplementary Documentation (Green Book) issued by the Department of Finance last week contains details of SME lending by the two banks, based on those reports.  The figures show a significant flow of SME lending.  Bank of Ireland report drawdown of &euro;1.5 billion, while AIB report &euro;1.3 billion &ldquo;additional credit sanctions&rdquo; and &euro;859 million drawdown in the first half of <Col N="865"/>this year.  It is clear that credit drawdown/approvals are down on the same period last year, but the amounts are still substantial and represent a significant level of activity.</P>
        <P>The Mazars Review covered the supply and demand for credit by SMEs, using both bank data and a survey of SMEs.  It is clear from the review that demand for credit is at a much reduced level.  In addition, the survey shows that refusal rates also vary by sector from 6% to 48%.  Average refusal rates for Micro SMEs were 30%.  However, the consultants also examined a sample of files where credit was refused and found that, in general, refusal seemed reasonable in the context of normal commercial and business criteria.</P>
        <P>To help tackle credit problems, the Government has established the Credit Supply Clearing Group with bank, business and State representation.  This group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing work of the Government&rsquo;s Credit Supply Clearing Group, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment launched an email link on 28 August last calling for submissions from viable businesses that have been refused credit by banks.  Such businesses, where the flow of credit appears to be blocked, can now send their details to a dedicated email contact point at the Department, <i>creditsupplyclearinggroup@entemp.ie.</i></P>
        <P>As part of its support for SMEs the Government has also provided &euro;100 million for an Enterprise Stabilisation Fund.  Under the scheme, Enterprise Ireland can give up to &euro;500,000 to viable companies with robust business models that are facing difficulties as a result of the current economic environment.  In addition the Temporary Employment Subsidy Scheme will provide a subsidy of &euro;9,100 per employee over 15 months to qualifying exporting enterprises in the manufacturing and-or internationally traded services sectors.</P>

	<P>Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has responsibility for the negotiation of prices for the provision of long-term residential care services with private nursing home providers.  This negotiation is based on the definition of &ldquo;long-term residential care services&rdquo; as set out in the Act and on supplementary policy information provided by the Department.</P>
        <P>The Act defines &ldquo;long-term residential care services&rdquo; as maintenance, health and personal care services.  The Department has further clarified that this includes: bed and board, nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person, laundry service, and basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living.</P>
        <P>This information forms the basis for the NTPF to agree prices with private nursing homes.  These prices will be fixed for the term of the agreement.</P>
        <P>The NTPF&rsquo;s negotiating role under the scheme will be an ongoing one.  Re-negotiations will take place at regular intervals.  This will enable both parties to an agreement to take account of inflation and other developments on a periodic basis.  It will also enable new entrants to the nursing home sector to participate in the scheme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I visited the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in June/July last.  During the course of our discussions on the agreement, the situation of 20 applications on hand in Hanoi, which were due to be returned by the Department of International Adoptions in Viet<Col N="872"/>nam, was discussed.  The Vietnamese side agreed to process the 20 applications as a gesture of goodwill. </P>
        <P>I made this request having regard to the unique position of the 20 families in this category.  They were at a very advanced stage of the process and their applications were submitted to the Department of International Adoptions by the 1st April deadline although they had not received a referral before the expiry of the agreement on May 1st.</P>
        <P>The gesture by the Vietnamese Government reflects the good relationship between the two countries and the genuine desire of both sides to continue this relationship into the future.  I briefed the House in detail last week on the broader developments regarding the bi-lateral agreement over the period since then.  All applications currently being dealt with by the Vietnamese Government &mdash; including these 20 &mdash; will be processed to conclusion as part of transitional arrangements provided for by the Vietnamese side.</P>

	<P>Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE&rsquo;s) 32 local health areas.  However, under the HSE&rsquo;s 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the Executive&rsquo;s Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  The PCRS is committed to responding to all queries from Oireachtas members and the wider public.  Its phone number is 01-8647100.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised my Department that local health offices will continue to provide advice and necessary supports to people applying for medical cards.  They will also deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and, along with the HSE National Helpline (1850 24 1850) will handle enquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also advised that this measure, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided and when fully implemented will ensure: Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications; Equitable application of eligibility across the country; Consistency of service provision to customers; Clearer lines of governance and accountability; and Improved unified data.</P>
        <P>This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.</P>
        <P>I will convey the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion about the setting up of a dedicated phone line for medical card and GP visit card queries to the HSE for consideration.</P>

Firstly, in August, 2009, the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, with the technical assistance of UNICEF in that country, published a report entitled &ldquo;Creating a protective environment for children in Vietnam: An assessment of child protection laws and policies, especially children in special circumstances in Vietnam&rdquo; .</P>

As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries who continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care that cannot be provided domestically.  We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral inter-country adoption agreements with a small number of countries, including with the Russian Federation.</P>
        <P>Ireland has no official bilateral inter-country adoption agreement in place with the Russian Federation.  However, preparatory work to consider the contents of a draft agreement with the Russian authorities is currently being undertaken.  While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Russian Federation, it must be acknowledged that this matter will be determined to a considerable degree by the Government of the Russian Federation.</P>
        <P>I believe that it would be imprudent to indicate at this time as to whether or when an agreement can be reached with the Russian Federation.  However, I will continue to advance this matter with the assistance of my colleague Minister Martin and of his officials in both Dublin and Moscow.  Any applicant who is seeking to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague country, or from a country with which Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement, should have regard to the likelihood of the adoption being completed in advance of the Adoption Bill being commenced.</P>

	<P>Negotiations are ongoing between the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the private nursing home providers in respect of the maximum prices to be charged under the scheme. The HSE, as the scheme administrator, is also engaged in the finalisation of its procedures in respect of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Minister intends to commence the Nursing Homes Support Scheme once the negotiation process with private providers has concluded and the HSE has finalised its procedures. It is not possible to be more specific at this time, particularly as the stipulation of an exact date could undermine the negotiation work of the NTPF.</P>

	<P><i>&lsquo;Reach Out&rsquo;</i> &ndash;<i> A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention</i>, sets out a policy framework for suicide prevention. The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees implementation of the strategy.  </P>
        <P>Initiatives which have been progressed by the NOSP include developing and implementing national training programmes; the development of a training strategy under the direction of a Training and Development Officer; progressing the availability of self-harm services through Hospital Emergency departments; implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services; dedicated suicide resource officers; the provision of funding to the National Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF); supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention and  developing mental health awareness campaigns.</P>
        <P>In addition to the &euro;8m available to the HSE for suicide prevention initiatives, once-off funding of &euro;1m was provided in 2009 to further develop services for those bereaved by suicide and to develop an information and awareness campaign aimed at young people. Consultations with young people were arranged under the auspices of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to inform the campaign and a report on the outcome of this process &mdash; <i>&rsquo;Teenage Mental Health: What helps? and What hurts?&rsquo;</i> was launched on 15th June 2009. The campaign will be launched in October.</P>
        <P>A target to achieve a 10% reduction in suicide by 2010 has been agreed with the National Office for Suicide Prevention. Targets to reduce deliberate self-harm (DSH) have also been agreed. The aim is to reduce the incidence of repeated deliberate self-harm by 5% by 2010 and a further 5% by 2016.</P>
        <P>Data on mortality is compiled by the Central Statistics Office and published in the Annual and Quarterly Reports on Vital Statistics. The provisional figures for deaths by suicide for the years 2007 and 2008 are 460 and 424 respectively.  These figures are subject to revision as some undetermined deaths may be recorded as suicide following a coroner&rsquo;s inquest.  Figures for 2009 are not yet available.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 206 together.  </P>
        <P>As you are aware, the Minister for Finance, Mr Brian Lenihan T.D., established a Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, under the chairmanship of Mr Colm McCarthy, to examine the current expenditure programmes in each Government Department and to make recommendations for reducing public service numbers so as to ensure a return to sustainable public finances. In July 2009, the Minister for Finance received the Special Group&rsquo;s report and brought it to Government, and the Report was published in full. Among other things, the report recommends the abolition of the Rural Transport Programme.</P>
        <P>The Government will be reflecting on the Report&rsquo;s recommendations over the months ahead. Decisions on implementation will rest with the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, including in the context of preparing the Budget for 2010 and later years. The Government has referred the Report for analysis and comment by the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and General Affairs prior to the Budget in December.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In September, 2004 the Government confirmed the Office of Public Works (OPW) as the State&rsquo;s lead agency in flooding, to be tasked with delivering an integrated, multifaceted programme aimed at mitigating future flood risk and impact.</P>
        <P>As regards flooding of roads, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993, to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection of works to be funded from these grants is also a matter for the local authority.</P>
        <P>When road grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies.  Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Instead, the allocation made to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.  Mayo County Council submitted a report to my Department in relation to damage to roads caused by flooding in July this year.  This report is currently being considered by my Department. Consideration of any applications for financial assistance would, of course, have to take account of the current budgetary situation and the resources already allocated to the county.</P>

        <P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, including bridges, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</P>
        <P>New arrangements for the management and administration of regional and local road grants were introduced on 1st September 2009. These arrangements were put in place on foot of the existing statutory framework which places responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads with local authorities.</P>
        <P>From 1st September, last, the National Roads Authority agreed to undertake the management of the Regional and Local Roads Investment Programme on behalf of my Department.  The National Roads Authority will recommend grant allocations for regional and local roads for 2010 and subsequent years, which will be subject to final approval by the Minister for <Col N="901"/>Transport.  A circular was issued to all local authorities on 18 August last to advise them of the Department&rsquo;s agreement with the NRA. The authorities were further advised that all correspondence in relation to regional and local road grants, including correspondence in relation to individual projects and programmes should be addressed to the NRA from 1st September 2009.</P>
        <P>The handling of representations from public representatives in relation to the regional and local roads investment programme remains a function of my Department.  The 2010 grant allocations will be announced early in the New Year.</P>

	<P>Capital funding in my Department is generally dealt with under the Transport 21 investment framework.  In this context, an amount is allocated on an annual basis to the National Roads Authority (NRA) from my Department&rsquo;s overall Vote.  The NRA is responsible under the Roads Act 1993 (as amended) for the allocation of this funding to individual national road projects.  Similarly, an amount is allocated on an annual basis from my Department&rsquo;s overall Vote for regional and local roads.  From 2010 the NRA will administer the distribution of this funding to local authorities on my behalf. Previously my Department had carried out this administration work.  The present practice of having separate sub-heads within my Department&rsquo;s Vote for national and for local and regional roads will continue.</P>

	<P>Ireland is a party to the International Maritime Organisation&rsquo;s (IMO) Convention&rsquo; on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) and amongst its provisions is a requirement for parties to the Convention to communicate information to the IMO on the measures adopted to implement the Convention nationally. This information is subject to periodic scrutiny by the IMO.</P>
        <P>The relevant EU Directive requirements are transposed into Irish law by the Merchant Shipping (Training and Certification) Regulations 2007. In addition to the periodic auditing carried out by the IMO Ireland is also subject to inspection of its maritime education, training and certification system by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) on behalf of the European Commission (EC). It is, therefore, essential that the issue of STCW Certificates of Competency to seafarers by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) in my Department be carried out strictly in accordance with the STCW regulations. Otherwise Ireland could be subject to infringement proceedings by the EC.</P><Col N="902"/>
        <P>In order to assist Irish Naval Service personnel wishing to attain an STCW &mdash; Officer in Charge of a Navigational Watch Certificate of Competency (OOW), the MSO has a system in place that requires Naval Service Officers to complete six months merchant sea service and to complete an OOW course at the National Maritime College, Ringaskiddy.  This scheme is designed to satisfy the requirements of the Convention. It is not possible to exempt individual candidates for STCW certification from completing all the elements of this scheme as to do so could jeopardise Ireland&rsquo;s compliant status at the IMO and would have severe implications for holders of Irish Certificates of Competency.</P>

        <P>The cost effectiveness of the panel, in the context of the operation of the overall asylum process, was considered before the panel was established and it was decided that its establishment provided the most cost effective use of resources, particularly when account is taken of <Col N="904"/>the significant costs associated with maintaining asylum seekers while in Ireland, including in relation to the provision of accommodation and other support services.  As the work of the panel has not yet been completed, it is not proposed to discontinue its operation at the present time.</P>
        <P>The schedule of fees payable to the Panel at present, taking account of the 8% reduction in fees earlier this year arising from a Government decision in relation to professional fees, is as follows:</P>

        <P>With regard to the staffing issue raised by the Deputy, I would point out that staff allocations in the asylum and immigration areas are kept under review on an ongoing basis having regard to changing trends in asylum applications and demand for immigration services generally.  Over the past number of years, some 90 posts have been redeployed from ORAC mostly to meet increased demands for immigration related services.  Additional posts are in the process of being redeployed at the present time with the main priority being to reduce the number of cases on hand in other areas of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and increase the number of removals of persons who are found to have no protection needs or other grounds to remain in the State. This in turn will contribute to reducing overall asylum and immigration costs to the State.</P>

	<P>I wish to refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question number 641 that I answered on 16 September 2009.</P>
        <P>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service is unable to make a determination in this application for family reunification on the basis of the documentation submitted to date.  In this regard a letter was sent to the person concerned on 10 September 2009 requesting them to obtain a declaration from the Irish Courts under Section 29 of the Family Law Act, 1995 indicating that the marriage in question is a valid one.  In determining whether a foreign marriage is valid under the Family Law Act, 1995 it is a matter for the Courts to determine the formalities required by the law of the place or society in which the marriage was celebrated, and also to determine whether the marriage complied with those formalities. The onus is on the applicant to show that their marriage is valid and recognised for the purpose of Family Reunification.  As soon as the person concerned submits the necessary Court declaration, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service will finalise the application for Family Reunification.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in March 2006.</P>
        <P>The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.</P>
        <P>There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218, 219 and 231 together.</P>
        <P>There is no requirement for Reserve Garda&iacute; to resign before applying to join the force as a full-time member.  In actual fact membership of the Reserve potentially enhances an applicant&rsquo;s chances of securing a position as a full-time Garda.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 (SI 509 of 2006) provide that the Public Appointments Service, when interviewing applicants, must give &ldquo;due recognition to any satisfactory service by the person as a reserve member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If a Reserve Garda is successful in his or her application to join as a full-time member and is offered a place as a full-time trainee, he or she must then resign from their Reserve membership before taking up the place as a trainee as the two functions are wholly separate and distinct.  The Admissions and Appointments Regulations for full-time Garda&iacute; are predicated <Col N="907"/>on a trainee being a civilian who can only be appointed to membership of the force upon successful completion of his or her traineeship.</P>
        <P>Applications to become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are processed by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Admission to become a member is subject to the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointment) Regulations as amended, which include a provision covering minimum and maximum recruitment ages. Any applicant who does not meet the criteria as set out in the Regulations is not allowed progress through the competitive process.</P>
        <P>The specific information on the number of Garda reserve members who apply to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a full time basis and fail due to the age requirement or otherwise is not readily available.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 17 October 2001.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  He subsequently withdrew his appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 23 July 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him.</P>
        <P>The person concerned, separately, made an application for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements for non-EEA parents of children born in the State prior to 1 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme.  Following consideration of this application the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 16 November 2005, that the Minister had refused this application.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was again informed, by letter dated 31 January 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P><Col N="909"/>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

        <P>The specific information sought in relation to costs associated with trainee Garda&iacute; and Garda Reservists and their applications is not readily available and would involve the aggregation of costs from a wide variety of sources requiring a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources relative to the information sought.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 20 September 2006.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in Germany and, as such, a determination was made, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, that the person concerned should be transferred to Germany for the purposes of having his asylum application examined there.  This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P><Col N="911"/>
        <P>Arising from the Refugee Applications Commissioner&rsquo;s determination, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 22 November 2006.  This Order was served on the person concerned, by letter dated 23 November 2006, which placed a legal obligation on him to &lsquo;present&rsquo; himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Wednesday 29 November 2006, to make arrangements for his formal transfer to Germany.  The person concerned failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; on this occasion and was therefore classified as having evaded his transfer.  The person concerned became illegally resident in this State at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned continued to evade his transfer with the consequence that the Transfer Order ultimately expired leaving Ireland responsible for processing the asylum application of the person concerned.  At this point the case of the person concerned was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having his asylum claims investigated.  Subsequently, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status.  This recommendation was upheld on appeal to the Refugee Appeal Tribunal.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 26 September 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, then a minor, arrived in the State in the company of his mother on 23 October 1997. <Col N="912"/> His mother subsequently made an application for asylum which was refused.  The mother of the person concerned was subsequently granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a parent of an Irish citizen child, born before 1 January 2005, in accordance with the revised arrangements announced on 15 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme.  The person concerned was not included in his mother&rsquo;s permission to remain in the State at that time as he was an adult by then.</P>
        <P>In early 2008 the person concerned sought permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a family dependant of the parent of an Irish born child who had been granted permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 Scheme. By letter dated 18 March 2009 the person concerned was informed that he had failed to demonstrate current residency as a family dependant in the State and consequently his quest to remain in the State on that basis was refused.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 31 March 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

        <P>If the Commission returns a positive opinion on Iceland&rsquo;s state of preparedness, as would be expected, the Council would then consider whether to open accession negotiations on the 35 chapters of EU law.

        <Quest> the percentage of payments made by his Department since 19 May 2009 to suppliers and other contractors which were paid in full within 15 days, within 30 days and longer than 30 days; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Payment of invoices by this Department is governed by the provisions of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 as amended by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002. The Act, which came into force in January 1998, initially provided for the payment of interest on invoices which are unpaid after 45 days from date of receipt. In August 2002, the point at which interest becomes due was reduced to 30 days. As the Deputy will be aware, following a Government Decision in May of this year, Government Departments were asked, where possible, to make payments within a 15 day period. </P>
        <P>The payment procedures in place in my Department are designed to avoid undue delay in the processing and payment of valid invoices. Every effort is made to make payments as soon as possible and the Department is generally successful in making payments within the 30 day period.</P>
        <P>The number of late payments (i.e. paid after a 30 day period) in each year represents a very small part of the total number of payments made. For example, in 2008, my Department made over 11,000 payments in Ireland, of which only 18 were late payments under the terms of the Acts mentioned above, less than 0.2% of the total payments made.</P>
        <P>In regard to the data available concerning payments made within a 15 day payment period, all Government Departments are now required to submit quarterly reports to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with details about the length of time taken to make payments (i.e. within 15 days, within 30 days and after 30 days). The existing payments system is currently being modified so that the information needed for such reporting can be extracted. Data for the first such quarterly report, for the period ending 30 September, is currently being collated for submission by 15 October. I have arranged for a copy of the first quarterly report to be sent to the Deputy as soon as it is ready.</P>

	<P>All successful applicants under the Department&rsquo;s Sports Capital Programme are required to submit at least three comparable quotations to the Department for each aspect of the works being funded before an allocation is formally approved. In order to ensure value for money in the provision of facilities, the terms and conditions of the Programme specify that in each case, the contract/order should be placed with the contractor/supplier providing the most economically advantageous quotation.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s technical advisers, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has a monitoring role in relation to projects allocated more than &euro;150,000 in one or more rounds of the Programme.</P>
        <P>Of the allocations in question, records in my Department indicate that one was allocated on 2000 and paid in 2002.  Of the remainder, tenders have been submitted in respect of only one project and the tenders for that project indicate that the final cost will be lower than that estimated at the time of application. Support for projects under the Programme is typically capped at 70% of the final cost of the project.  Where an allocation exceeds that amount, the Department may consider a request for a change of purpose from the grantee or the surplus allocation may be withdrawn.</P>

        <P>In April 2007 an amount of &euro;32.4m was allocated to 67 projects under the ACCESS II (Arts &amp; Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme).

        <P>Athlone Town Council was one of the 13 additional projects and was allocated &euro;650,000 towards the development of a two part scheme &mdash; a contemporary Art Gallery and Artists&rsquo; Studios in Athlone.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 to 250, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show a reduction of 10.4% in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland for the first seven months of 2009 compared with the corresponding period of 2008.  While any reduction in the number of overseas visitors is disappointing, it must be seen in context.  Ireland enjoyed several years of successive growth in visitor numbers, reaching a record of just over 8 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the period to date in 2009 has been very difficult for tourism globally and this trend has been reflected in overseas visitor numbers to Ireland.  There have been significant declines in GDP, personal spending and consumer confidence across all our major source markets. Exchange rates, particularly the dollar and sterling, and reduced air access to the island of Ireland have also had a negative impact on the number of visits to Ireland.</P>
        <P>In this context, I am fully aware of the many issues affecting the hotel and catering industry, including the issues of costs and competitiveness. I keep in regular contact with the key industry representative groups, including the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland.  While the management and effectiveness of individual companies is a matter for those companies themselves F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a range of measures to help the tourism industry to address costs and competitiveness.  In particular, they have refocused their programmes to meet the enterprise support needs of businesses in the tourism sector in the current difficult climate.  In 2009 they will be investing almost &euro;6 million in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.</P>
        <P>The key elements of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s support package in 2009 include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new mentoring support service providing one-to-one advice,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new &ldquo;Biz-Check&rdquo; service is being rolled out designed to provide operators with on-site business diagnosis and solutions support, covering issues such as costs and margins, cost control, pricing and cash-flow management, which are crucial to effective management of businesses,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a further expansion of the &ldquo;e-Biz&rdquo; initiative to improve on-line marketing and e-business skills generally within the industry,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a significant investment in on-site training of industry employees in customer care and food preparation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The industry is responding well to the initiatives and the take up on the programmes is very positive.</P><Col N="932"/>
        <P>Furthermore, I am glad to see that the changes that I had called for in Sunday pay rates in the hotel and catering sectors are now taking place.  As a result, the cost in those sectors of labour on Sundays nationally will now be at time and a third as agreed through the JLC process.  Given the high labour input in the tourism industry these important changes should have a positive impact.</P>
        <P>As regards marketing, Tourism Ireland is keeping its marketing programmes for 2009 under constant review, to ensure necessary flexibility and responsiveness.  It front-loaded its campaigns across all markets to secure as much business as possible for the peak and shoulder season and has now intensified its tactical and cooperative marketing activity for the second half of the year with an &euro;18 million autumn campaign.</P>
        <P>On the domestic front, F&aacute;ilte Ireland committed to its largest ever campaign to promote home holidays in 2009, with in excess of &euro;3 million being invested in a year-round marketing programme promoting awareness of, and interest in, taking a home break.  The Autumn Initiative, co-ordinated and implemented by F&aacute;ilte Ireland with funding from members of the tourism industry, was launched last week by An Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen T.D., and is intended to boost business between now and the end of the year.</P>
        <P>While I know that our businesses and tourism agencies are responding positively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  Accordingly, I established the Tourism Renewal Group, which has been tasked with reviewing and, where appropriate, renewing the current tourism strategy to ensure that it is focused for the short term and, looking further ahead, that the tourist industry is well placed to benefit from the upturn when it comes.  I understand that the Group has now completed its deliberations and is currently finalising its report, which will contain recommendations in the form of a Framework for Action for the period to 2013.  I expect this report will be submitted to me very shortly.</P>
        <P>The industry deserves great credit for its commitment to quality in responding to the current challenging economic conditions through more flexible pricing and offering special value offers and packages.  I am confident that, with the support of the agencies, the tourism sector here has the capacity to manage the current cyclical slowdown and that, looking further ahead, the Renewal Group&rsquo;s Review will help the sector to return to sustainable growth in the medium term.</P>

        <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Sports Capital Programme and I will confine my reply to that Programme.  Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Since 1998, over &euro;725 million has been allocated to over 7,400 projects across the country.  &euro;56 million has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s vote in the 2009 Estimates to cover payments to be made from the C1 subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.  The corresponding figure for 2008 was &euro;58m.  Total payments of &euro;43m were made from this sub-head as at close of business on 17 September last.  The corresponding figure for 2008 was &euro;49m.  No allocations under the Sports Capital Programme have been made in 2009.</P>

The allocations under the 2008 programme were published at the end of July 2008 and a list of the grant allocations, including those to 21 clubs in Kildare for 2008 together with allocations to projects in County Kildare under previous years allocations, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/.  No round of the Sports Capital Programme has taken place to date in 2009 and accordingly no applications have been received in the Department this year from sporting, recreational or voluntary bodies in County Kildare.</P>

        <P>The person concerned sat the third year examinations of his course in May, 2003 but was not successful.  He is now re-commencing the third year of his course of study.  Consequently, a Deciding Officer has disallowed his back to education allowance claim from 7 September, 2009.  A letter informing him of this decision has been issued to him.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Department&rsquo;s records, the person referred to by the Deputy is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit since 4th November, 2008. He has not made an application under the back to education allowance scheme. On the basis of the information he supplied, he would not satisfy the qualifying criteria for receipt of the back to education allowance as the Master&rsquo;s course he is pursuing is not recognised for the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme. </P>
        <P>The objective of the back to education allowance scheme is to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market. The scheme covers courses of education from second level to Higher Diploma level in any discipline (level 8 in National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)) and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching, level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person&rsquo;s employability. Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) are not included.</P>
        <P>The possession of qualifications at level 9 or above in the NFQ is not regarded as a prerequisite to re-entering the workforce and at present there are no plans to extend the scheme to cover courses at this level. A small number of cases have arisen where a college has admitted a person who holds no third level qualification to a Master&rsquo;s course on the basis of relevant life experience and these cases have been allowed on an exceptional basis. However, the person concerned does not fall into this category as he already holds a primary degree.</P>
        <P>This current approach is considered appropriate in the context of targeting scarce resources at those in greatest need. The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstance in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.</P>

	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs. </P>
        <P>A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels. The income limits for the BSCFA scheme for 2009 are &euro; 560 for a couple with one child and &euro; 407 for a person with one child. The limit is increased by &euro;26 for each additional child.</P>
        <P>In line with other secondary payments, a means test is applied to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. In general, all household in come, including welfare payments such as carer&rsquo;s allowance, is assessable as means under the BSCFA scheme. The exceptions to these rules are that any income received in the form of Family Income Supplement (FIS), Higher Level Education grants or the first &euro;120 earnings from employment of a rehabilitative nature is disregarded for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme.</P>
        <P>Over &euro;58m has been paid to 120,600 claimants to date in 2009, in respect of the BSCFA scheme.  Any further improvements to the scheme, or amendments to the qualifying criteria, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</P>

        <P>This scheme is intended as an option of last resort and a social protection measure to assist pension schemes where the sponsoring employer is insolvent and the pension scheme is being wound up in deficit.

This scheme uses the definition of insolvency which applies to the insolvency payments scheme administered by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and as set out in the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act 1984.

        <P>The facilitator service is available locally to all social welfare recipients via the local network. Facilitators are assigned to cover a geographical area. They hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office, the employment support section or by other agencies. In addition, cases are selected and referred to facilitators by employment support section. An appointment can be made by contacting the facilitators directly or via the appropriate local office.</P>

        <Quest> the responsibilities and duties of facilitators working for her; the training funds, grants and so on under which these facilitators can allocate funding; the amount available under these funds and grants in 2008 and 2009; if an annual per person limit in accessing training or other employment supports and funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department&rsquo;s facilitators work with social welfare recipients of working age, including jobseekers, lone parents, people in receipt of disability welfare payments and people providing care, to enable them to participate fully in society. </P>
        <P>Facilitators work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance their skills and improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally. Facilitators, who are located throughout the country and are assigned to cover defined geographical areas, work with individuals to develop progression plans for them. They work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities.</P>
        <P>A facilitator deals with referrals from local offices, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and people in receipt of social welfare payments who may themselves decide to seek the service of a facilitator. The facilitator service may also be sought by someone who has a business idea, who wishes to avail of the back to work enterprise allowance or by someone who intends to return to education under the back to education programme. In addition, one of the roles of the Department&rsquo;s facilitators is to engage with other agencies to enhance local working relationships and to ensure that agencies work together to provide services to customers in receipt of welfare payments. Facilitators are also engaged in extensive information provision to individuals, organisations and communities, about the services of the Department.</P>
        <P>In addition to the local referral system, a formal targeted programme of activation was introduced under the NDP. Under this programme, the Department actively selects cases for referral to facilitators. The current economic climate has determined that a large part of a facilitator&rsquo;s work at present is with people on the live register.</P>
        <P>Facilitators have two funding streams available to them: the Activation and Family Support Programme (AFSP) and the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme (TATS).</P>
        <P>The purpose of the AFSP is to enable the Department to assist local organisations and agencies to implement projects addressing the disadvantaged personal, social and economic circumstances of recipients of welfare payments and their families. Projects are usually co-funded by the AFSP and funds from other agencies or organisations.</P>
        <P>The AFSP is designed to fund once-off projects to support and test the effectiveness of the projects it funds. In this regard, the AFSP is not designed to be a source of on-going funding. The application of the funds is largely responsive in that, as needs are identified by local organisations and agencies, applications for funding can be made to the AFSP <i>via</i> the local Facilitators. The AFSP h as a budget of &euro;6 million annually for 2008 and 2009 and it is not allocated on the basis of a per person limit.</P>
        <P>Under the technical assistance and training scheme (TATS), a welfare recipient may qualify for a grant up to a maximum of &euro;1,000. The grant i s mainly targeted towards certain business start-up expenses of clients in receipt of the back to work enterprise allowance scheme. This fund is designed to enhance the person&rsquo;s prospects of succeeding in becoming independent of the social welfare system through support for training in the areas of starting a business, book-keeping/accounts, preparation of business plans, marketing, literacy and computer training or assistance with the purchase of small items of equipment. It is administered through the Department&rsquo;s facilitator network based in social welfare local offices.</P>
        <P>The maximum amount of TAT available to an individual is &euro;1,000. The TATS has a budget of &euro;3 million annually for 2008 and 2009.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Rural Environment Protection Scheme, REPS 4, was closed to new entrants in July of this year. However, under the Rural Development Programme a new agri-environment measure will be introduced and individuals who have been affected by the closure of REPS 4 can apply for this new scheme. On this basis, estimation of the number of farmers who may apply to social welfare schemes as a result of the REPS 4 closure or any associated costs arising is not possible at this time. </P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides support for farmers on low incomes through the Farm Assist scheme which is a means-tested payment broadly similar to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme. It features a more generous means test, which takes account of the specific nature of farming and, unlike jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farmers claiming this payment do not need to be available for work outside of the farm in order to qualify.</P>
        <P>In recent years changes have been made to Farm Assist which means that it is now easier for low income farmers to qualify for support under the scheme. For instance, in January of this year the rates of payment for the scheme were increased. Improvements in the method of assessing earnings from insurable employment were also introduced in September 2007 which provides further gains for families claiming farm assist, where either spouse is also in insurable employment.</P>

	<P>The objective of the back to education allowance scheme is to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market.  The scheme covers courses of education from second level to Higher Diploma level in any discipline (level 8 in National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)) and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching, level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person&rsquo;s employability.  Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) are not included. </P>
        <P>The possession of qualifications at level 9 or above in the NFQ is not regarded as a prerequisite to re-entering the workforce and at present there are no plans to extend the scheme to cover courses at this level.  A small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master&rsquo;s course on the basis of relevant life experience.  In the context of the ongoing review of the operation of the scheme, it has been decided to extend entitlement to BTEA in these instances on an exceptional basis.</P><Col N="948"/>
        <P>The focus of the back to education allowance is on providing assistance to the highest possible number of those in greatest need in terms of meeting the requirements of a modern labour market.  People in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects.  At present there are no plans to extend the scheme to cover Master&rsquo;s courses in general.  The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstance in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.</P>

	<P>A review of the operation of the habitual residency condition (HRC) was published by the Department in February 2007.  I have no plans to further review the application of the habitual residence condition at this time.</P>
        <P>All applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of nationality, are required to be habitually resident in the State in order to qualify.  This is in line with other social assistance payments.  The question of what is a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the criteria to be applied in determining whether or not a person is habitually resident.  Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  The habitual residence condition helps protect Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system, while at the same time ensuring that those whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>The Department has an extensive legal structure to support the sharing of data with other Government Departments and specified bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;ochana for the purpose of combating social welfare fraud.  Data matching is a very effective method of identifying high risk social welfare claims for review.</P>
        <P>The main example of on-going co-operation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is data matching with the Irish Prison Service who supply the Department with lists of prison inmates on a regular basis.  The lists are cross-checked to identify possible &ldquo;live&rdquo; social welfare claims.  In such cases, the claim is terminated where it has been established that the claimant is the person who is in prison.  In addition, a number of social welfare inspectors are seconded to the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  The officers in CAB are actively engaged in identifying and targeting funds accumulated by criminals.  They also investigate and review social welfare entitlements of people who are suspected of deriving assets from criminal activity.</P>
        <P>The social welfare inspectors who are seconded on a permanent basis to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) assist both agencies in the pursuit of their respective statutory remits with a particular emphasis on welfare fraud and breaches of immigration legislation.  There is close co-operation between the Department and An Garda S&iacute;ochana on the ground in relation to the multi-agency vehicle checkpoints and personation cases.  The multi-agency checkpoints are set-up by the gardai and planned in consultation with other participating agencies.  At the checkpoints, Garda&iacute; stop the vehicles and refer certain vehicles to individual agencies where the occupants are interviewed.  Staff participating in the checkpoints from the Department are drawn from the Special Investigation Unit, whose main duty is the detection and prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  Cases of personation are referred by the Department to the garda&iacute; for follow-up investigation and possible prosecution the Department&rsquo;s Central Control Division also deal with individual enquiries from members of the force.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;24 per week, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  A non-dependent adult household member is also required to contribute a minimum of &euro;24 per week towards the mortgage payment.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that it refused payment of a mortgage interest supplement to the person concerned, on the grounds that the household income is sufficient to meet the mortgage interest repayment when account is taken of the minimum contribution payable by the person concerned and the non-dependent household member, towards the mortgage repayment.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision of the Executive, it is open for him to appeal to a HSE Appeals Officer and thereafter to the Chief Appeals Officer of the Department.</P>

	<P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides supports designed to assist and encourage unemployed people, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force.  It operates a number of schemes designed to assist unemployed people who wish to take up self employment.  The short term enterprise allowance (STEA), introduced from 1 May 2009, provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit.</P>
        <P>The back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are longer term dependant on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits, over two years; 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  The qualifying <Col N="951"/>period required for access to back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is 12 months provided a person has an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  A person in receipt of a social welfare payment who decides to set up as a self- employed taxi operator may be eligible to apply for the STEA or the BTWEA back to work enterprise allowance.  However, one of the important steps under both schemes is that those taking up self-employment must first have their business venture approved as viable and sustainable.</P>
        <P>In the context of the STEA and BTWEA schemes, the department operates a technical assistance and training scheme (TATS) under which a participant may qualify for a grant up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 towards certain business start-up expenses.  This fund is designed to enhance the person&rsquo;s prospect s of succeeding in becoming independent of the social welfare system through support for training in the areas of starting a business, book-keeping/accounts, preparation of business plans, marketing, literacy and computer training or assistance with the purchase of small items of equipment.  It is administered through the Department&rsquo;s facilitator network based in social welfare local offices. Facilitator are aware of the difficulties in the taxi industry and are not providing assistance under the technical assistance and training scheme to new taxi businesses.</P>

	<P>Under the shared ownership scheme houses are acquired by a local authority and leased to the shared owner, who purchases at least 40% of the value of the house and rents the remaining equity from the local authority. The shared owner must purchase full ownership outright within 30 years.  </P>
        <P>For transactions commenced on or after 1 January 2003, the annual rent is calculated at 4.3% of the value of the local authority equity and, thereafter, is increased by a fixed 4.5% on 1 July each year.  The rent is used to repay the interest element of the borrowings on the local authority&rsquo;s equity.  Any excess or shortfall in rent collected, using this formula in comparison to using the prevailing interest rates, is offset against the outstanding equity each year.</P>
        <P>For transactions entered into between 1 May 1998 up to 31 December 2002, rent is calculated at 4&frac12;% (5% before 1 May 1998) of the value of the local authority share updated annually on the 1 July by reference to the most recently published CPI.</P>
        <P>Local authorities advise all potential applicants on the operation of the scheme including the calculation of the rental element and I am satisfied that it operates in an open and transparent manner.</P>

	<P>The objective of the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters) Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters from pollution caused by nutrients from agricultural sources.  The regulations apply to fertilisers containing nitrogen or phosphorus and do not control the use of potassium (potash).</P>
        <P>The permitted fertilisation rates of phosphorus are based on an index system linked to soil fertility.  Where soil test analysis indicates low phosphorus levels, phosphorus may be applied in accordance with crop requirements while ensuring that the maximum fertilisation rates set out in the regulations are not exceeded.</P>
        <P>Open and closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers are set in order to ensure the protection of waters.  The dates for these periods are specified in the regulations thereby providing clarity for both farmers and the enforcement agencies.  It is not proposed to amend the regulations in this regard.  In recognition of the poor weather conditions this year approaching the end of the closed period, an extension to the latest date for applying chemical fertiliser, up to the 28 September, was granted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Enforcement of waste legislation, including actions against illegal activity, is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement. Data from the OEE shows that in 2008, 2034 inspections were carried out under the packaging regulations by the local authorities. While the OEE compiles statistics on the total number of prosecutions taken under the Waste Management Act, data are not collected specifically with regard to packaging. </P><Col N="958"/>
        <P>I believe that enforcement of waste legislation is essential and I am providing &euro;7.4m grant assistance from the Environment Fund to local authorities this year to support continuing waste enforcement. Some 120 local authority waste enforcement staff are funded under this grant scheme. In July 2008 I issued a policy direction under section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996 to local authorities and the EPA to prepare, and publish, an Enforcement Policy in respect of Unauthorised Waste Activities and each authority completed this task by the end of 2008. The funding allocated will enable local authorities to implement their plans and carry out a detailed programme of enforcement during 2009.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of the Packaging Regulations is a matter for each local authority within its functional area and my Department continues to be actively engaged with industry and the competent authorities to explore all methods to drive compliance with the Packaging Regulations.  Packaging inspection planning is subject to the EU Recommendation for Minimum Criteria for Environmental Inspections in Member States (2001/331/EC) (RMCEI). This means that inspection plans and enforcement policies provide a basis for assigning priority based on risk and allocating available resources accordingly and allowing for consistent enforcement of environmental legislation (including Packaging Regulations) by local authorities. Inspection plans are subject to auditing by the EPA.  These inspection plans provide the platform for a national systematic approach to inspection and enforcement and the OEE, through its Environmental Enforcement Network, has guided the development and implementation of local authority inspection plans under RMCEI since 2006.</P>

        <P>As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each planning authority.</P>
        <P>Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area.  Development contribution schemes are drawn up by each planning authority and approved by the elected members following a public consultation process.  It is a matter for the members of the planning authority to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.</P>
        <P>Details of individual development contribution schemes are available directly from each planning authority. Each planning authority is also required to include details of contributions received and contributions owing to it, together with information on how the contributions have been expended, in the statutory annual report of the authority. The collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for each planning authority. Where any <Col N="959"/>payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt.</P>

        <P>The provision of water services infrastructure is funded by my Department through the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes.  It is open to local authorities to seek my Department&rsquo;s approval for borrowing to meet costs arising on capital programmes which are not met from their own resources or from the Exchequer through schemes of grant assistance.  Draw downs on foot of borrowing amounting to a maximum of &euro;215 million have been approved for water services projects in 2009.  Applications for loans and overdrafts are considered by my Department on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>The information in respect of Part V housing is not held in my Department.</P>
        <P>In 2009 local authorities have budgeted to spend some &euro;11 billion in total between current and capital programmes.  Debt finance is one of the sources of funding available to local authorities in the normal course of business to finance this expenditure.  Other sources of funding include current and capital income, grants and subsidies.</P>

	<P>The Government decided to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on all non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at &euro;200 per dwelling and payment must be made by 30 September 2009.</P>
        <P>The most important exemption under the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 is for principal private residences.  If a person owns a property other than one that they reside in as their principal private residence, then it may be liable for the charge.</P>
        <P>Further exemptions provide, for example, for buildings that are newly constructed but unsold and form part of the trading stock of a business; with heritage merit; let directly or indirectly by local authorities for social housing; let by voluntary housing bodies; the subject of a shared ownership arrangement with local authorities; and buildings for which commercial rates are paid.  In addition exemptions apply where a person purchases a property for use as a principal private residence provided they dispose of their existing property within 6 months; a charity owns the property; and where a spouse or ex spouse has an interest in a property after a divorce or separation agreement but does not reside there.  Granny flats and principal private residences that have to be vacated due to long term illness are also exempt if certain criteria are fulfilled.</P>
        <P>The fact that a house is not used or lived in does not of itself remove the liability of an owner to the charge.  The definition of a &lsquo;dwelling&rsquo; in the legislation is relevant when considering whether a residential property that is not used or lived in is liable to the charge.  My Department has issued guidelines to local authorities which includes suggested indicators as to what makes a house suitable for use as a dwelling for the purposes of determining any liability to the charge.  These indicators include the structure of the house, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities including a water closet and water supply.</P>

	<P>Payments under the Single Payment Scheme may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them; details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System <Col N="964"/>(LPIS). Details of the use and area claimed for each of some one million parcels on the LPIS system are registered and continually monitored by the Department. </P>
        <P>Each year in advance of the closing date for the Single Payment Scheme (15th May), the Department sends pre-printed application forms (which include a list of parcels declared by the applicant in question the previous year) to each applicant. It is the responsibility of all applicants to ensure that the details in each year&rsquo;s application are accurate. Therefore, applicants are advised of the need to confirm their right to declare such parcels and to make the appropriate deductions to the area of eligible parcels as necessary, for example, where a house or other building has been constructed, and to submit maps with their applications to allow accurate deductions to be made. It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub. Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc.</P>
        <P>Following a recent review of the land parcels declared by the person named, it appeared that the person named had made insufficient allowance for ineligible areas, as a result of which it appeared that the person named had been overpaid. This finding is in addition to the finding in respect of the over-claim under the 2008 Scheme, which was identified at a ground inspection. However, I am now arranging for an official of my Department to contact the person named directly, following which there will be a full review of the of the case.</P>

	<P>Payments under the Single Payment Scheme may be made only in respect of eligible land.  Applicants under the scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them.  Details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System.  Details of the use and area claimed for each of some one million parcels on the system are registered and continually monitored by the Department.  Each year, in advance of the closing date for the Single Payment Scheme, 15 May, the Department sends pre-printed application forms, which include a list of parcels declared by the applicant in question the previous year, to each applicant.  It is the responsibility of all applicants to ensure that the details in each year&rsquo;s application are accurate.  Therefore, applicants are advised of the need to confirm their right to declare such parcels and to make the appropriate deductions to the area of eligible parcels as necessary, for example, where a house or other building has been constructed, and to submit maps with their applications to allow accurate deductions to be made.  It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub.  Therefore, the Land Parcel Identification System database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc.  Following a recent review of the land parcels declared by the person named, it appeared that the person named had made insufficient allowance for ineligible areas, as a result of which it appeared that the person named had been overpaid.  However, following a written appeal, an official of my Department was in direct contact with the person named and, following clarification and information received, a further review now shows that sufficient deductions in respect of ineligible areas were made.  Therefore, the question of overpayment does not arise.  The person named is being formally advised, in writing, of the successful outcome of his appeal.</P>

	<P>Beef production is an extremely valuable component of the Irish economy.  It had an export value of &euro;1.69 billion in 2008, representing 20% of total Irish food and drink exports.  Some 90% of Irish beef production is exported, which makes Ireland the largest net beef exporter in the northern hemisphere and the fourth largest in the world.  In common with all agricultural commodities, beef production is a function of market conditions and has remained relatively stable in recent years.  During 2009, beef production has fallen in the majority of EU member states, with an overall decline of some 6%, largely as a consequence of challenging economic times.  Ireland is no exception to this, with volumes down almost 8%.  An important factor in influencing the numbers available for production is live exports.  They continue to be an important outlet for our cattle, providing an essential element of competition with the beef trade.  In recent years, the vast majority of Ireland&rsquo;s live beef trade has been with other EU member states.  In 2009 to date, the live trade to the UK has increased by almost 250%, while shipments to other EU member states have doubled.  While Ireland remains one of the foremost suppliers of beef into the European market, it is evident that, as a result of the downturn, import requirements in our main markets have declined somewhat.  Sales in retail and food service outlets, both of which remain extremely important to Irish exporters, have fallen and are expected to remain weaker than their long-term trend for the foreseeable future.  In common with much of the EU, prices have come under downward pressure this year.  This is largely due to the economic downturn and the subsequent decline in demand for beef in particular and meat in general.  It must be remembered that prices increased considerably in recent years and prices are still above 2007 levels.  The anticipated tightening in supplies in the EU, coupled with lower imports from South America during the rest of 2009, is expected to alleviate some of the pressures being experienced, although the extent of this remains unclear.</P>

	<P>An application under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 11 May 2009.  The Terms and Conditions governing the scheme require, <i>inter alia</i>, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.  However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.  The person named was written to on 3 September 2009 and invited to submit appropriate evidence of the numbers of livestock maintained on his farm, as departmental <Col N="967"/>records do not show the person as having yet achieved the minimum stocking density.  On receipt of a satisfactory response from the person named, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible <Col N="969"/>for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.  A service may be established where a sufficient number of eligible pupils,  within an area, apply for transport to the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they live.</P>
        <P>In a case where there are not enough eligible pupils residing in an area to warrant the establishment of a service, a transport grant may be paid by the Department to the parent/guardian of the eligible pupils concerned.  The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &mdash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.  In general, catchment boundary tickets are issued on a first come, first served basis.</P>
        <P>The Transport Liaison Officer for Waterford City has advised that the pupils in question reside in the Tramore catchment area and therefore may only apply for catchment boundary school transport to Waterford City Post-Primary Centre subject to the terms outlined above.</P>

However, floor layout plans and other drawing data gathered during the course of the pilot inventory are still largely relevant and continue to be used by the Department&rsquo;s Technical staff as appropriate.  As the Deputy will be aware from a response to a previous PQ, arrangements are being made to conduct a survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary level which will establish the position relating to the extent of all accommodation.  The specifications for this inventory are being finalised with a view to commencing the work at an early date.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the first phase of a new post-primary school building with accommodation for up to 350 pupils has been completed and is in operation.  The building&rsquo;s flexible design allowed for the opportunity to provide sufficient accommodation for a new start-up primary school as part of the first phase.  This accommodation is available for use as a new primary school in 2010 if the demand is there.  The design allows for the accommodation to revert for post-primary use in the future, as required.</P>
        <P>With regard to the remaining seven primary schools I can confirm the following: four schools have been completed and handed over to the relevant school authorities; one school has been partially handed over with the remaining accommodation to be handed over next month; one school is due to be handed over in October and the final school is currently out to tender and is expected to be on site in the fourth quarter of 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 356 together.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s unified data model is based on three core entities, namely Educational Organisation, Pupil and Staff Member.  The Educational Organisation aspect of the model has been implemented and went live in February, 2007.  Essentially, the implementation facilitates the recording and maintenance of school details, such as address, in a central location.</P>
        <P>Work on planning the development of an Inventory of School Accommodation to be compiled during the 2009/10 school year has been ongoing since early this year and is now well advanced.  The detailed functional specification for the Inventory of School Accommodation has now been completed and work is currently underway on the development phase of the project with a view to completion of the implementation phase.  The Inventory of School Accommodation, when completed, will provide key data and statistics on the existing school building stock throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The methodology currently being developed for the compilation of the Inventory comprises a form to be completed online in respect of each school during the 2009/10 school year.  The Inventory form will be appended to the schools&rsquo; Esinet portal platform.  This is a platform for interactive communication between the Department of Education and Science and its partners, customer and clients, including schools.  The Inventory of School Accommodation project which will provide schools with the facility to electronically transmit details of their school building stock, to the Department, will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs in addition to recent schools&rsquo; enrolment data. </P>
        <P>The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.</P>
        <P>Consistent with the primacy of the role of the Patron under the Education Act, 1998, this information has been circulated in writing to all existing school Patrons as part of the process of determining where existing schools should be expanded and new schools provided.  The responses of the Patrons will be taken into account in finalising the extent and nature of school accommodation provision in the relevant areas.</P>

	<P>The progression of school building projects, whether to commence architectural planning or to proceed to tender and construction, is undertaken with regard to the availability of funding and the priority attaching to projects. </P>
        <P>Priority is established primarily on the basis of a projects&rsquo; band-rating in accordance with the Criteria for Prioritising Large Scale Projects, details of which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. However, there a range of other factors taken into account in the selection of projects. These factors include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the need to achieve an appropriate balance of capital expenditure on a multi-annual basis between primary and post-primary building projects</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the overcrowding at a school (details supplied) in County Galway; his proposals to extend this school in the near future; if there is currently a devolved grant system which would allow the board of management to provide the extension even if a substantial amount of funding had to be raised locally; if his attention has further been drawn to the urgency in this case; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Departments website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. </P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>
        <P>An application for additional temporary accommodation was submitted by the school and was assessed with reference to the current accommodation, staffing and enrolment trends.  In <Col N="973"/>the context of the available funding and the number of applications received for that funding, it is not possible to approve all applications at this time.  It was deemed that the current arrangement between the school in question and the Agricultural College was adequate to accommodate an additional class, if necessary.</P>

	<P>The schools approved funding for the purchase of prefabricated classroom(s)/construction of permanent classroom(s) in 2008 and 2009 are listed in the tabular statement.

	<P>My Department grant aids school authorities for appropriate costs associated with rental of temporary accommodation, where such accommodation has been approved by my Department. Payment of the annual rental cost, upon receipt in my Department of the necessary supporting documentation, is generally made to  schools in advance and in two instalments, i.e. January-June and July-December where rental is continuing or up to the expected date of cessation if  for a shorter period.</P>
        <P>The rental agreement for temporary accommodation is a matter to be managed by the school authority and the accommodation provider.  Of the small number of  schools who have yet to submit invoices for the January-June 2009 rental  period, officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department have made  contact with these schools to establish the position.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has been requested by my Department to arrange for its Special Educational  Needs Organisers (SENOs) to review special needs assistant (SNA) allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation  of such posts are properly met. The review is currently under way and it is  intended that it will be completed during 2009. The NCSE will not be preparing  a report in relation to the review. However, SENOs will communicate directly  with schools in relation to the outcome of the review.</P>
        <P>My Department is separately carrying out a Value for Money and Policy Review of  the Special Needs Assistant Scheme. It is expected that this review will be  completed by the end of 2009. Once completed, a final report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of the school concerned. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board,  National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at  01-8738700.</P><Col N="986"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. The responsibility also  includes identifying appropriate educational placements for individual children  with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally  regarding pupils&rsquo; education. It is open to the parents concerned to raise any  queries they may have relating to their child&rsquo;s special educational needs  directly with the school authorities or with the local SENO. The parent may  contact the SENO using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I  understand from the NCSE that the local SENO is liaising with the parents of  the pupil in question.</P>

The Board of Management and Design Team have been requested to confirm in writing when all the issues have been addressed, and confirm full compliance. Upon receipt of the necessary confirmations, the project will be considered for progression to Tender Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act and to do so in a manner that respects principles of equality. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rights of minorities are also protected in Equality legislation which  outlaws discrimination on nine distinct grounds &mdash; gender, marital status,  family status, age, disability, race, sexual orientation, religious belief and  membership of the Traveller community.  The equality legislation makes specific  provision for certain aspects of the school system notably ethos and schools  whose enrolment is open to one gender only.</P>
        <P>In the event that the provisions in the Equality legislation were found to be  inadequate by clear evidence of discrimination and additional protections were  considered to be desirable I believe that changes to the relevant primary  legislation might be necessary rather than attempting to provide them by means  of regulations under the Education Act.</P><Col N="988"/>
        <P>On the issue of enrolment policy generally a consultation process took place  with the main education partners and the responses received are being  considered before formulating specific proposals for action in order to address  any anomalous enrolment practice that has been identified by the audit of  enrolment policies.</P>

The records of payments to suppliers and other contractors made by my Department between 19 May 2009 and 17 September 2009 show that approximately 80% of payments were made within 15 days from the date of receipt of a valid invoice from a supplier, 15% of payments were made between 16 and 30 days while 5% of payments were made after 30 days.</P><Col N="989"/>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is an ongoing need for capital investment in educational infrastructure in all sectors due to anticipated demographic increases which will lead to increasing enrolments and participation levels.  There will also be a continuing requirement to upgrade existing accommodation in our schools and third-level institutions.  The extent of capital expenditure in the education area, as in all other areas, has to take account of overall priorities.  However, in recent years, investment in educational infrastructure has been given priority by this Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2009 capital allocation available to my Department amounts to &euro;813.8m.  The capital allocation for subsequent years will be determined as part of the Estimates processes and having regard to competing demands and priorities.  Within the schools&rsquo; sector the 2009 capital allocation amounts to &euro;614m which is just &euro;30m less than the 2008 outturn in the sector.  This lower amount is sufficient to deliver the capital programme in 2009 due to the reductions emerging on tender prices for large scale projects, the positive impact of the 2008 rapid delivery programme of new schools in developing areas and the slow-down in the number of new applications for additional accommodation in existing schools.</P>
        <P>In the higher education sector, the 2009 allocation amounts to almost &euro;200m all of which is expected to be fully expended by the end of the year.  The 2009 allocation is an increase of some &euro;45m relative to the level of direct Exchequer capital expended in 2008 in this sector.  Additionally it is the also the case that lower tenders are delivering better value for money on large scale projects.</P>
        <P>The HEA is currently in discussions with the College to which the Deputy refers to clarify the most recent budget estimations for the project in question.  I will arrange to forward a copy of the OECD report to the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> the amount of funding allocated to a company (details supplied) in County Cork for work in DEIS schools in 2008, 2009 and projected for 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding in respect of 2008 and 2009 amounting to &euro;62,000 and &euro;64,000 respectively was allocated by my Department to the company referred to by the Deputy to provide performances on relevant topics and drama/arts workshops in disadvantaged schools in the area where the company is located.  The company is among a number of Theatre and Arts Groups that received funding from my Department over the last ten years or so.  This support was drawn from the Department&rsquo;s educational disadvantage budget which is primarily focussed on assisting schools in their efforts to cater for the specific educational needs of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
        <P>With the introduction of the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme in 2006, significant additional capitation funding was made and continues to be made available to the 876 schools in DEIS.  DEIS is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of the current economic downturn the Department&rsquo;s focus is to retain mainstream resources on core interventions in schools.  Support for the Theatre Groups is not consistent with this focus and such spending cannot be regarded as a priority.  While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on the groups, given the extremely challenging economic circumstances, difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  As the main focus of Social Inclusion measures is to retain resources in DEIS schools, these schools may at their discretion choose to use some of their additional disadvantaged capitation to avail of the services provided by the Theatre Groups.</P>
        <P>My Department fully appreciates the importance of arts and culture to children&rsquo;s education and personal development.  The arts help to promote a child&rsquo;s self esteem and enjoyment of learning.  They also provide an important vehicle for personal enrichment and cultural expression, as well as creating awareness and respect for other cultures.  Working through the arts helps to nurture and develop cognitive, communicative, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social, and spiritual intelligences and skills.  Learning through guided activity and discovery, with children as active agents in their own learning and enrichment, is a vital part of this process.  This is why arts education, through Music, Visual Arts, and Drama, and of course, through language, forms an integral part of the primary curriculum.  Schools in DEIS are particularly aware of the importance of the arts in addressing disadvantage, and in promoting success in learning.  Many schools in DEIS use the flexible budgets they receive to promote integrated links with community arts organisations and to offer enrichment programmes in support of the curriculum.</P>

        <Quest> the name and address of each primary school which gained a teaching post at the start of the 2009-2010 academic year due to the enrolment figures on 30 September 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390, 392 and 415 to 418, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  My Department does not keep dual records for teacher allocations to schools based on what they might have been if there were no budget changes.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.</P>
        <P>The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled and the associated assessed levels of these pupils&rsquo; language proficiency.  It is an annual allocation process that commences in the Spring of each year when schools apply to my Department.  Language support posts are  approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed following clarification of actual enrolments on 30th September.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published provisional information on the Department&rsquo;s website about teacher allocations for 2009/10 school year.  This was done as a first step at improving the level of information in the public domain about changes to the <Col N="993"/>staffing allocations in primary schools.  The allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.  Allocations are continuing in respect of special needs, language support and developing posts.  The final position for any one school will also depend on a number of other factors such as the outcome of appeals processes and the operation of redeployment arrangements which can mean a teacher remains in his or her existing primary school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.</P>
        <P>The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until later in the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and I remain committed to publishing updated information on teacher allocations which will also include aggregate information on the numbers of primary teachers redeployed through the panel system.  At that stage a comparison can also be made between the level of resources allocated to schools this year compared to last year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 and 393 together.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my  Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil  enrolment. At the level of individual schools the budget changes in relation to  the allocation of teaching posts will impact in different ways depending on  whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school  has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  My  Department does not keep dual records for teacher allocations to schools based  on what they might have been if there were no budget changes.</P>

Language support posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed following  clarification of actual enrolments on 30th September.</P>
        <P>Provisional information on teacher allocations to second level schools, whether  enrolment related or otherwise, was published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The  information represents the position at the time of publication and is not the  final position. At this point the allocations process for special needs, language support etc. is still underway. The information on the Department&rsquo;s website will be further updated later in the year when the allocation process is fully completed. At that stage a comparison can be made between the level of  resources allocated to schools this year compared to last year.</P>

        <Quest> the details of additional resources supplied by his Department in the 2009/2010 school year to the pupils who were enrolled in special classes for children with mild general learning difficulties suppressed earlier in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 394 and 395 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</P>
        <P>All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the  General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence  special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD).  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the  pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their  peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so  that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that teacher allocations to schools typically increase  or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the  normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits  schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the  class. This minimum was not fulfilled in a number of classes; therefore schools  no longer qualify to retain the classes.</P>
        <P>Some schools have advised that they had enrolled children with a low incidence  disability in classes intended for pupils with a mild general learning disability. These children may qualify for individual resource teaching support through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and these schools were advised that it is open to them to liaise with the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) in this regard.  The Deputy will appreciate that the NCSE allocates such resources and my Department does not retain records in relation to individual allocations.  I have arranged for the Deputy&rsquo;s query in relation to this issue to be forwarded to the NCSE for their direct reply.</P>
        <P>I wish to reiterate that pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have, access to additional teaching resources to support their education. However, there is a requirement to make appropriate use of the  resources available and along with all other areas of expenditure, provision is  dependent on the resources available to the Government.</P>
        <P>Details of the schools where classes for MGLD were suppressed are set out below for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.</P><Col N="995"/>

        <P>The Teaching Council was established on a statutory basis in March 2006 to promote teaching as a profession at primary and post-primary levels in Ireland.  Teachers who have met the registration requirements of the Teaching Council are permitted to teach in State recognised primary and post-primary schools and have their salaries paid from state funds.</P>
        <P>Registration as a teacher at primary or post-primary (including further education) level is governed by Section 31(5) of the Teaching Council Act,  2001.  The application process involves the submission of an application form, together with transcripts, proof of identity, evidence of character, other documentary evidence and the application fee.  Each application is assessed having regard to set criteria in relation to qualifications and teaching experience as well as evidence of character.  At the end of that process, registration may be granted in full or with conditions, or refused.</P>
        <P>Teachers are paid according to the level of their assessed qualifications.  The details of where these qualifications were obtained are not held centrally on my Department&rsquo;s payroll systems.  My Department will arrange for the Teaching  Council to provide the Deputy with the number of primary teachers recently registered with Irish qualifications and the number registered with qualifications from outside the State.</P>

        <Quest> the reason Ireland has not taken part in international surveys on achievement at primary level since 1995; the steps he proposes to take to correct this omission; the reason Ireland should continue to benchmark its educational achievements at primary level from an educational and competitiveness point of view; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Ireland participated in the IEA Reading Literacy Survey in 1991 and in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Survey in 1995.  Since then, national surveys of literacy and mathematics achievement have been conducted at two grade levels in primary schools in 2004 and 2009, and at one grade level in 1998/99.  Ireland participated in the Programme for International Student Achievement for fifteen-year olds in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009.  The Educational Research Centre conducted all of the above surveys on behalf of my Department.  Data were collected internationally for Trends in International Mathematics and Science Survey (TIMMS) in 1999, 2003 and 2007 and for the Progress in International Reading Literacy Survey (PIRLS) in 2001 and 2006, but Ireland did not participate in these studies.   </P>
        <P>A decision to participate in international surveys has to take account of the research capacity available to administer the surveys, the overall cost of participation and the likely benefits.  Arising from Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the first three cycles of PISA, information is readily available on trends in achievement in  reading literacy, science and  mathematics  and a range of other learning outcomes for lower secondary education.  As new curricula were being introduced in primary schools from 2001 to 2007, it was not opportune to participate in international studies of curriculum at that stage.  The absence of key EU countries from PIRLS and the predominance of developing countries in the survey were also factors in the decision not to participate in the survey.  The Department will consider participation in future international studies at primary level in the light of the resources available and the anticipated needs of the education system for evidence for the development of curriculum policy for primary education.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission was established by Government in 2003 to assume operational responsibility for the certificate examinations.  The role of SEC is to provide a high quality examination and assessment system incorporating the highest standards of openness, fairness and accountability.  As part of its remit the SEC is enjoined to maintain standards year on year, and this is achieved through the quality assurance procedures put in place in the preparation of test items and examination papers, in the marking of the examinations, and in the administration of the appeal processes. </P>
        <P>All of the SEC&rsquo;s examinations are prepared in accordance with the principles outlined in the document, The Preparation of Test Items &mdash; Principles and Protocol, available on its website <Col N="1002"/>at www.examinations.ie.  The processes operate in accordance with key principles of validity (that the examination measures what is intended in keeping with the syllabus), and reliability (that the examinations produce results which are consistent).  Content standards for the syllabus are determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and these are put into effect as a set of performance standards by the SEC.</P>
        <P>Examiners receive training, scripts are monitored and a sample is re-marked to ensure that the established standard is applied consistently. In addition, marking schemes are published, and candidates may review their scripts against the marking scheme before making a decision on an appeal.  Both the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the State Examinations Commission participate in international educational networks and keep abreast of international developments in this area. In addition, the NCCA engages in widespread consultation with educational and industry stakeholders in regard to ongoing curriculum reform, to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s education system maintains its quality and relevance in line with best practice.</P>
        <P>Ireland has participated in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment of 15 year olds in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009, and the results to date show little variation.  In addition to the above, a comparability study and benchmarking exercise of selected subjects in the Irish Leaving Certificate against those subjects at A level in the UK was competed by an Expert Group in 2003.  The subjects selected for the comparability study were Mathematics, English and Chemistry.  The process concluded in the Expert Group&rsquo;s agreement to treat a single Irish Leaving Certificate subject at Higher Level as equivalent to two thirds of an A Level.  The approach enabled agreement to be reached on the allocation of UCAS Tariff points to CAO points for the purpose of entry to higher education in the UK.  The agreement was put into effect from 2005 onwards.  Overall, insofar as can be determined within a context where curriculum continues to evolve in line with changing needs, the information available would suggest that consistent standards are being maintained in the examinations from year to year.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> his proposals to conduct research at second level which would examine the outcomes of the leaving certificate examinations with a view to comparing those outcomes with internationally comparable standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I have no plans to conduct research to benchmark the outcomes of the Leaving Certificate against international performance.  My Department is not aware of the availability of internationally standardized test instruments or protocols which would enable this to be done readily for this age group.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment published a comparative study in international developments in upper secondary education in 2003.  The study highlights the difficulties in comparing the outcomes of post compulsory education given the differing systems across countries.  Systems differ in their objectives and structures, their level of academic and vocational integration, the provision of alternance systems, the duration, number of subjects studied, and the impact this has on depth and breadth of learning in individual fields.</P>
        <P>Indeed, even within senior cycle education in Ireland, outcomes differ significantly depending on the programme followed, the number of subjects taken, the level at which they are assessed, and the grades achieved.  Ireland has participated in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009, and in the International Civic and Citizenship Survey in 2009.  PISA assesses the performance of 15 year olds across 57 countries in the domains of reading literacy, mathematics and science.  The 2006 results show that Ireland:</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />performed very well in reading, ranking 6th out of 56 countries and 2nd in the EU.</P><Col N="1003"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />had a mean score which was significantly above average in science, ranking  20th out of the 57 countries</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />performed at the OECD average in Mathematics, ranking 22nd of 57 countries. There were fewer lower achievers and higher achievers than the OECD average, with the majority of Irish pupils scoring in the mid range of achievement.  The results of PISA show performance is largely unchanged in 2006 relative to previous surveys.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">In addition to the above, a comparability study and benchmarking exercise of selected subjects in the Irish Leaving Certificate against those subjects at A level in the UK was completed by an Expert Group in 2003.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the discontinuation of the Special Class for pupils with a Mild General Learning Disability (MGLD) in the school in question.  The Deputy will be aware that teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1.  My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class.  This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy and therefore the school no longer qualifies to retain the class concerned.  The special class which has closed pre-dates the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities.  All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</P><Col N="1004"/>

        <P>All children with MGLD who were in the class that has been suppressed will be able to receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model.  Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature.  My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s policy is to support the inclusive education of students with special educational needs across the schools system.  In this context, a range of supports are provided to schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs.  The supports available include additional teaching support, special needs assistant support, school transport and grants for the purchase of teaching materials and specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>

	<P>The person in question worked for over 22 years as a secondary school teacher until 2003 when he reached mandatory retirement age.  Throughout the duration of his service it was open to him on a voluntary basis to become a member of the secondary teachers superannuation scheme which is a contributory scheme.  However he did not do so.  Accordingly, he was not eligible for any superannuation benefits on retirement.  As a non-member of the superannuation scheme he would have paid full rate Pay Related Social Insurance and may have qualified for pension benefits under the social welfare code.</P>
        <P>In 1996 under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work (PCW) for teachers significant improvements in superannuation arrangements were introduced.  These improvements included a provision whereby, a teacher who became a member of the superannuation scheme could, while in service, retrospectively purchase certain earlier service which s/he had given prior to becoming a member of the scheme.  These new arrangements were advised to secondary schools at the time. In addition an information booklet on the superannuation provisions in a Questions and Answers format was issued to secondary schools in 1999/2000.  The person in question did not opt to join the superannuation scheme during his service.  It is not possible subsequent to retirement to become a member of the scheme or to avail of its benefits as the superannuation scheme does not allow such arrangements.</P>
        <P>The matter was considered by the Pensions Ombudsman.  However, he formed the view that the Department did not have any discretionary powers to grant a pension and that, in the circumstances, the Pensions Ombudsman did not have any powers to assist the person.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that plans are well in train to re-locate the school to which she refers to alternative accommodation.  The planning and Building Unit of my Department is working closely with the school authority to ensure that the transfer to this accommodation is as smooth as possible.  With regard to the school&rsquo;s application for a new building, this, in common with all such applications, has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project in question, are now available on my Departments website at www.education.ie.  </P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to special needs assistant support.  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply. </P>

	<P>In the years 2005 to 2008 the vast majority of the National Lottery funds disbursed by my Department arose from the payment of grants to support Youth Services.  National Lottery funds were also disbursed to support Local Drugs Task Forces, Cultural Activities, Irish Language and Adult Education Organisations.  Grants to support mainline youth activities were paid directly to national and major regional youth organisations by means of the Youth Services Grant Scheme. </P>
        <P>Certain other Youth grants were paid via the Vocation Education Committees or via National/Regional Youth Organisations.  Due to the funding arrangements in place to pay allocations to either national/regional organisations or VEC committees it is not possible for the Department to identify to the Deputy each individual group for which a grant was paid in those years.</P><Col N="1007"/>
        <P>Data relating to National Lottery funds disbursed by my Department are included in the annual Appropriation Accounts of the Department which are published by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Extracts from the accounts, identifying the National Lottery funds disbursed for the years 2005 to 2008, are set out below in tabular form.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2009 Departmental administrative and Ministerial functions in relation to Youth Affairs Section were transferred from my Department to the Department of Health and Children.  If the Deputy has a particular interest in an organisation/project funded by National Lottery funds I would be happy to have my officials obtain the relevant details and communicate them to him.</P>
