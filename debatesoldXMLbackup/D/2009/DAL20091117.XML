      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3 together.</P>
        <P>The projected cost of the communications unit in 2009 is &euro;257,432, of which &euro;119,270 is a direct cost to my Department while the balance is borne by three other Departments whose staff are seconded to the unit.  The cost of the unit from June 2007 to date has been &euro;725,951.  The projected cost for 2009 represents a reduction of almost 15% on the 2008 cost, 22.5% on the 2007 cost and almost 30% on the 2006 cost.  In fact, it is the lowest cost since 2003.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it necessary to second staff from other Departments?  Which Departments are involved?  I was not aware that staff from other Departments were seconded to the communications unit.  </P>
        <P>From statements made by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor on several occasions, my understanding of this unit was that individual Departments were obliged to take cuttings of newspapers and news items relevant to each Department and Minister, for example, the Ministers for Transport or Education and Science.  For example, I understood the latter Department not to have a paper cutting service to supply the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, every morning because the communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach was to do all of that.  Last year I asked this question because it was evident what was going on.  Is it still the case this service is <Col N="726"/>provided in the communications unit and there are no paper-cutting services in other Departments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I answered this on several occasions.  The Deputy appears to have a continuing fixation about it.  A review was undertaken to see how we might provide this service most effectively.  It is being provided at a lesser cost on a continuous basis as a result of the need to be mindful of expenditure in this or any other departmental area at this time.  Individual Ministers also have their own communication service.  The public interacts with agencies and bodies and non-governmental organisations.  A whole range of people engage daily with Departments on an ongoing basis.  That service must be provided in the public interest of providing accurate information and ensuring people have a service to deal with their inquiries.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions, I referred to various replies I have given on this matter.  They confirm that, on review, the present arrangements are the most cost effective and it would not be possible to provide the service in any other way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Which other Departments are represented on the staff of the communications unit in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?   There is a cost of &euro;119,000 directly to the Department of the Taoiseach from a sum of &euro;257,000, as the Taoiseach mentioned.  Am I to take it there are no separate paper-cutting communications units in the Departments of Transport, Education and Science and all others?  I understand the purpose of this unit was to eliminate duplication and overlapping and save the taxpayer money.  Is it the case that the two Ministers present, Deputies Noel Dempsey and Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, do not have paper cutting services and communications units in their Departments because the Taoiseach has a service that supplies the rest of the Government?</P>
        <P>In what form is that information sent to other Departments?  Is it by e-mail or in hard copy delivered to other Ministers&rsquo; offices for dispensation to heads of sections?  Does the communications unit listen to radio stations and go through the newspapers every day, taking out relevant information for different Ministers and dispensing it in hard copy?  I am trying to be helpful.  The Taoiseach does not want an entire body of public servants cutting up papers and transferring them to different Departments if there is one section in his Department that does it for all others.  That is what I would like to know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I can have the details on individual staff costs, and so on sent to the Deputy.  The overall objective is to ensure that all parts of Government are aware of key issues across a wide range of media outlets.  The media, the Opposition and the citizens expect Ministers and officials to be fully up to date on such issues so that they can respond to them.  The situation was assessed by a panel of officials including managers from the Government Information Service, GIS, and the Department&rsquo;s head of information technology.  I understand that when a formal tender process was made the bids were in excess of the costs at which we provide the service at present.  The present cost of the unit as provided by staff is much cheaper than it would be if done any other way.  The unit has a small number of staff and uses cheap but effective technology in addition to the e-mail network for dissemination.  The alternative would be to decentralise the function in full to individual Departments.  It is clear that this would involve far more duplication, as people across all Departments would have to do what is currently done centrally.  The alternative of doing everything centrally is not realistic, given the ongoing need for monitoring items of particular interest in each Department.  It cannot be a question of total centralisation or total decentralisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="727"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was it necessary to second staff from other Departments into this unit?  It has a small staff and has a specific job.  What Departments are represented?  Was there a purpose for seconding staff or was it just a matter of finding a job for somebody?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a question of putting the team together.  We can arrange to get that detail to the Deputy in terms of its cost, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Taoiseach stated, we have had questions on the Government&rsquo;s listening post a number of times.  The unit listens to the radio, reads the newspapers, takes clippings and cuttings and keeps an eye on what kind of coverage the Government is getting.  I was surprised that it did not seem to cross Colm McCarthy&rsquo;s path when he was examining the public service.  I could not see a reference to it in the McCarthy report.  Would the Taoiseach regard the communications unit as an essential service of Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Regarding Dr. McCarthy&rsquo;s committee, he identified &euro;5.4 billion in areas he considered could be modified, eliminated, cutback or whatever out of a total spend &mdash; he only dealt with the current programme &mdash; of &euro;57 billion.  This is an indication that not everything that is being done is something that needs to be changed.  Some 90% of what has been looked at throughout all of the programmes were not included for recommendation in the McCarthy report, which puts some perspective on the promulgation of the idea that everything is unnecessary and can be simply washed away, in fairness to the people who work in the service.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question, it is important that we have a communications unit that is in a position to provide accurate, up-to-date information from a series of requests, including from Members of this House and elsewhere.  The ability to respond effectively and accurately is a particular responsibility of Government and is not one about which the Opposition must care too often.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question on whether he considers the unit to be an essential service of Government.  Would he be satisfied to have it used as a benchmark for assessing whether particular services should be discontinued or downsized?  For example, we often hear that the Government is contemplating the implementation of at least some of the McCarthy report recommendations and some downsizing or rationalising of the various services provided through Departments.  Would the Taoiseach be satisfied to state that the communications unit is not included in the report, is an essential service of Government and should be the measure for all of those services identified by the McCarthy report as suitable for cutbacks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think that one could measure everything against the communications unit and suggest that it is the benchmark for all Government activity.  That would be absurd.  There are four staff members in the unit.  It is not a major part of the operation.  There are two executive officers, one staff officer and a clerical officer.  There are also two vacancies I have not filled.  I am aware of the need for this work.  It is necessary in terms of co-ordinating and getting Departments and people on the outside to know exactly what is the position on various issues.</P>
        <P>On the question of putting it out for tender, I authorised a review of the unit independently of the McCarthy deliberations.  I did not have to wait for anybody to ask me.  I did that because I wanted to see what was the position.  When one asked people to tender, the lowest tender was far in excess of what it cost to do the job inside.  That should be a good indication of value for money and perhaps an indication that it is being done in as cost-effective a way as possible, <Col N="728"/>that if one were to get others to do it and release these staff for other work, one would, in fact, impose a greater burden on the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I think everyone would agree.  Deputy Gilmore would have a press liaison function for his party and for his own business.  He could not do his job without it.  It is an essential part of his operation.  In the same way, there is a need for Government to have a communications unit.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6 together.</P>
        <P>There are currently seven special advisers in my Department.  Under the direction of my programme manager, who is my principal special adviser, the primary function of the special advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The role and duties of special advisers are described in section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997.  In summary, these are providing advice, monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department, as requested; and performing such other functions as may be directed.</P>
        <P>Special advisers are also tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, environmental, administrative and media matters, and performing such other functions as may be directed by me from time to time.  In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities in speech drafting.</P>
        <P>Each of the advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers.  My advisers attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities.  They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside Government.</P>
        <P>The advisers assigned to the Government Chief Whip and to the Minister of State provide advice to the Ministers of State and monitor, facilitate and secure the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department of the Taoiseach, as requested by the Ministers of State.  My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis.  He monitors and reports to me on progress on that work as well.</P>
        <P>The total salary cost since June 2007 to date for the special advisers attached to my Department is &euro;2,798,870.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The front page of one of the national newspapers today sets out clearly the scale of payment by Government to special advisers, media advisers and other personally appointed staff.  It is interesting to note that the Government spent &euro;6.2 million in 2008 on <Col N="729"/>special advisers, media advisers and other such persons &mdash; one would build a few schools for that.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated &euro;2.7 million is the cost since June 2007 to date and that the purpose of these advisers is to facilitate, monitor and secure Government objectives.  I am not sure how successful they have been.  Are these special advisers subject to reductions in salary the same as everybody else?  Are they subject to the income levy because of bonuses and increments that they receive?</P>
        <P>I mean no disrespect to the person involved, but how, for example, does the Taoiseach justify an increase of &euro;10,000 in the salary of somebody who writes scripts for the Taoiseach and who was employed by his predecessor?  The person&rsquo;s salary, I understand, was &euro;118,000 in 2007 and the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, when appointed increased it to &euro;128,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>How much was it earlier?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand it is &euro;128,000.  It was &euro;118,000 in 2007 and after the Taoiseach&rsquo;s appointment, it increased by &euro;10,000 to &euro;128,000.  Is there a particular reason for that or was it based on bonus, increments or whatever?</P>
        <P>Are all of these positions subject to the recruitment embargo?  If, for some reason, a political, special or media adviser happens to be let go or retires from the Department of the Taoiseach, is that subject to the ban on recruitment as well?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no bonuses in relation to these payments.  They are appointed at a certain salary scale depending on their responsibilities.  I did not make any arrangements for increases.  These increases presumably arise as a result of people moving into other increments.  In other words, whatever rules apply also apply to them.  As regards the recruitment embargo, these people take up the job in line with the tenure of the Government of the day, so they leave office when the Government&rsquo;s term ends.  In that respect, therefore, they will not have the same terms of employment as people in the public service generally.  </P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, this system was first introduced back in 1992 during the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour coalition Government.  It has remained with us throughout every period of Government since then.  The Deputy made a point about the cost of advisers.  Given a total pay and pensions bill of almost &euro;20 billion, the idea that Ministers or other office holders would have advisers, whose tenure coincides with their own term in office for the purpose of providing supplemental or independent advice to the Department and assisting and liaising in respect of whatever jobs and responsibilities they have, puts in context the fact that this is a very small part of the total Government operation.  It was introduced at the time for a good purpose and obviously it must be kept under review at all times.  Under the Public Service Management Act, there is no limit on the number of advisers a Taoiseach can appoint, but there are arrangements in place regarding Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall the appointment of what were then known as programme managers back in the rainbow Government&rsquo;s time.  By and large, that system streamlined work going into the Cabinet where there might have been differences of opinion or a range of views being expressed by different Ministers, particularly when a number of parties constituted the Government.  It had a streamlining effect on putting business through. </P>
        <P>I did not catch the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer to the question on advisers having to leave for some reason or other.  It may be as a result of tragic circumstances or perhaps somebody wants to leave for a different job.  Is there a facility to reappoint or is such a vacancy subject to the embargo?</P>
<Col N="730"/>
        <P>I understand that the Department of Health and Children came second to the Department of the Taoiseach with a spend of &euro;514,000 on advisers in 2008.  When I asked this question of the previous Taoiseach, he always said that in this case the advisers are paid through the Department of the Taoiseach because the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, was the leader of a minority party in Government.  That is no longer the case, however, as she is effectively an Independent Deputy.  Therefore, the adviser or programme manager involved remains in the Department of Health and Children, but is paid for by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The title has been changed to that of a special adviser with responsibility for health and children.  What is the justification now for having a special adviser to the Minister for Health and Children paid for through the Department of the Taoiseach when the Minister involved is no longer the leader of a minority party in Government?  That was the justification given for it on so many occasions in the past.  Does this not amount purely to a presentation of massaged figures to avoid a situation where the Minister for Health and Children continues to have exorbitant moneys for running her Department?</P>
        <P>Is there a reason this set of advisers is paid for by the taxpayer through the Department of the Taoiseach when its function pertains to the Minister for Health and Children?  There is no longer any justification for this given that the Minister for Health and Children is no longer the leader of a minority party in government.  The cost in 2008 was &euro;514,000.  One would build another school for that amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the Deputy mentioned the cost and stated one could build another school for this or that, the fact is that advisers add value to the work of an Administration.  They assist in making sure policies are being implemented and they comprise a very small part of the overall Government operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Making a pejorative remark about it is to suggest that this is a valueless exercise; it is not.  It is the second time the Deputy suggested that it is valueless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The money would build another school.  The advice they have given the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Deputy&rsquo;s view.  He is entitled to his view on it and can play the populist game.  There is no problem with that.  The fact is that these people are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a populist game but a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Taoiseach to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is on both sides of the fence, as usual.  He referred to how important it was to have advisers when his party was in power but now that he is in opposition and I am in Government, he suggests there should be none at all.  That is the true position and there is nothing more to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I said it streamlined the system, but what has happened here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If he can get a line in a tabloid newspaper that gives him a big figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>They were not paid for by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="731"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Deputy will be delighted with himself.  He will get another big picture in the paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question of the advisers being paid for by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>The Deputy knows what the game is.</P>

	<P>Let us deal with the issue seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should deal with it seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The value added in this regard is well worthwhile.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I enjoyed it quite a lot.  It was a very challenging Department.  I have some understanding of the workload involved and of how issues can arise in the Department.  I have some understanding of how, despite the best efforts of everybody, unexpected issues can arise in respect of which people would not be on notice, yet one is expected to have immediate and detailed replies in every respect.  That is not often possible.  That is the point I was making, but of course it has been conveyed in a different way by others for their own political purposes.</P>
        <P>Let me return to the point.  The point we are talking about relates to recruitment embargoes and other issues raised by the Deputy.  The question of the appointment of special advisers is subject to guidelines outlined by the Department of Finance in respect of staff taken into the private offices of Ministers.  One must obviously comply with those arrangements.  That is what is done in the case in question, just as it was done under preceding Governments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated the system pertaining to programme managers and special advisers dates from the early 1990s.  I am sure he will recall that, at that stage, the idea was that there would be a single programme manager for each Department or Minister and a single adviser for each Minister, the idea being that the programme managers would drive the implementation of the programme for Government and the advisers would provide advice on policy areas.  However, this seems to have mushroomed considerably during Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s term in office.  I wish to put two issues to the Taoiseach, the first is that the numbers seem to have grown substantially, and the second is <Col N="733"/>that the salaries seem to have grown.  Today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> refers to the salary for the top adviser, the programme manager to the Taoiseach, having doubled in the past ten years.  Looking down the list of advisers that was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department a programme manager appears to be on a salary pretty close to the Secretary General of a Department.  Two special advisers are on salaries the equivalent of deputy Secretary General.  Two other advisers appear to be on salaries that are pretty close to that of an assistant Secretary General.  The salaries of a further two advisers approximate to the salary of a principal officer.  That appears to be an entirely parallel administration.  Why is there requirement for such a number of programme managers and special advisers?  When the practice began there was only one, but this is as many if not more than the number of deputy secretaries general and assistant secretaries general operating in the Department in the normal way.  Surely there is huge duplication of activity between the normal Civil Service and the Fianna F&aacute;il civil service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which is operating purely for the Taoiseach on a political basis, all of it at taxpayers&rsquo; expense?  To say that &euro;2.7 million, or whatever was the cost since 2007, is small money begs the question of what type of advice they have been giving the Government since then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with a few of the points made by the Deputy.  I did not say it was small money; I said in the overall context of a total public service pay bill of &euro;20 billion it is important when emphasis is put on the cost of special advisers that we see that it is a very small part of the total public service operation, both in the Civil Service and the wider public service.  That is a matter of fact.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the fact that Deputy Gilmore was not a member of the Labour Party when the system started, but the first leader of the Labour Party who introduced it had more than one adviser.  He had three advisers.  I well remember when Deputy Gilmore was preferred with a Ministry in the then Department of the Marine, he had an adviser.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is in the same position in the same Department and he does not have an adviser.  The proliferation seems to be selective depending on the circumstances of who Deputy Gilmore wants to talk about.</P>
        <P>On a wider point on pay rates, which is an important one, the remuneration is related to specific Civil Service grades.  The fact that there has been an increase in the past decade is an indication of the increase in salaries that have occurred within Civil Service grades.  The suggestion that they were arbitrarily increased without reference to any guideline or, as the Deputy tried to imply, were some preferential parallel arrangement is incorrect.  That should not be put on the record as having any substance in fact.  The positions relate to existing grades.  That has always been the case.  There is no change in the situation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore suggested that it all started off with one adviser per Minister.  I made the point that a predecessor of the Deputy&rsquo;s quite rightly had more than one adviser.  Otherwise, he would not have been able to do his job in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office as it was wider than simply having a ministerial job.  He took on those people.  I am sure he was well served by them and would regard their appointments as having been justified in all the circumstances, not because one wishes to be profligate with taxpayers&rsquo; money but one needs to ensure that there is independent and other advice available within Departments.  One sometimes hears from the Opposition that I listen to those in my Department and to no one else, or that I am not making any arrangements to determine the other side of the argument.  No matter what way one turns it appears there is an argument to be made.  That is the nature of our adversarial politics but the <Col N="734"/>fact is that for the past 17 years of Government in this country we have consistently had such arrangements.  I agree we must ensure that people do their job responsibly and well.  They are brought in by Ministers.  Their tenure is in line with the Minister&rsquo;s tenure.  Their pay is in line with established Civil Service grades and refers to their level of responsibility or whatever workload they take on.  That has been the case for successive Governments and it will probably be the case for future Governments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not question the necessity for programme managers and advisers.  I accept that is necessary and that the Government has to have independent advice.  What I am questioning is the numbers and from where the salaries came.  It is not the case that programme managers were always paid the same salary as a Secretary General of a Department.  I want to ask the Taoiseach two questions.  First, when was the decision made to link the salary of a programme manager to that of a Secretary General of a Department?  Second, given that it was not the case that special advisers were always paid the same as a deputy Secretary General of a Department, will the Taoiseach indicate when that decision was taken and how long have those two posts been linked to the two most senior posts in the Civil Service structure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that information.  I have no problem in finding it out for the Deputy.  The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 obviously post-dates the introduction.  When the introduction of these posts came into place I am sure they were aligned with some range of responsibilities and subsequently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It was around principal officer level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I believe it was higher than that, with respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not Secretary General.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
        <P>The Government published the White Paper, Regulating Better, in 2004.  It provides a framework for advancing the better regulation agenda in Ireland.  Some of the recommendations and actions outlined in the OECD report and the White Paper relate specifically to individual sectors and relevant Ministers are responsible for reporting directly to the House in regard to them.</P>
        <P>The better regulation unit in my Department is tasked with the promotion of the better regulation agenda across Government.  In this context, it is currently co-ordinating the Government input to the review of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory systems and processes being undertaken by <Col N="735"/>the OECD.  The review is being conducted as part of a set of similar reviews covering the original 15 EU member states which is being funded by the EU Commission and covers issues such as regulatory impact analysis, administrative burden reduction and approaches to enforcement.</P>
        <P>I would like to also briefly refer to other work the unit is carrying out.  It recently published a Government Statement on economic regulation providing a framework for the future development of economic regulation in Ireland.  It covers issues such as governance and accountability; the appropriateness of structures and mandates; cost effectiveness and engagement with stakeholders.  Particular actions include the establishment of a forum which will provide a direct interface on a yearly basis for senior Ministers and key economic regulators to discuss Government priorities and enhance the responsiveness of the regulatory environment to changing economic and social factors.  In addition, relevant Ministers will now be statutorily required to review the roles and mandates of regulators every five years.  Ministers will also approve planned expenditure by regulators, including any industry levies, following consultation with stakeholders.  In the aviation sector, the Minister for Transport will bring forward legislation to merge the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority with the planned National Transport Authority.</P>
        <P>Work is also continuing on the Statute Law Revision Project, which is steered by my Department in partnership with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Statute Law Revision Bill 2009 recently completed Committee Stage in this House and deals with local and personal Acts up to and including the year 1850 and private Acts up to and including the year 1750.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, expects to bring forward the Bill on Report and Final Stage this Thursday.  These private Acts are those which are concerned with the affairs of a single individual or body, and local and personal Acts are concerned with matters affecting a very limited section of the community such as a single local authority or company.  The current Bill provides for the express repeal of more than 1,350 such Acts.  This is in addition to the almost 3,500 public and general Acts which were already repealed by the Statute Law Revision Acts of 2005 and 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work being undertaken on statute law revision, individual Ministers are also undertaking significant consolidation projects including in the key areas of company law and customs legislation.  Revised RIA guidelines have now been published and take account, in particular, of the need for improved quantitative analysis and for the increased use of RIA to evaluate draft EU legislative proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Have we done any work on a baseline study of the cost of red tape in Irish industry?  Every day, Members are being contacted by businesses in various sectors and inevitably red tape arises as an issue, with more form filling and administrative obstacles of one sort or another.  Since we last discussed this, I raised the question of a baseline study that would show the cost of red tape for Irish industry.  Is there any such study or is work under way on one?  The Taoiseach could then point out to business anywhere in the country his assessment of the cost of red tape and how it is proposed to deal with it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a process in place regarding the reduction of administrative burdens and a group on business regulation is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It has set out a programme of work that would seek to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden significantly.</P>
        <P>The question of regulation constantly arises.  On the one hand, one needs efficient and effective public administration in the interests of public accountability and to avoid arbitrary decision making.  On the other hand, as one sought to address business issues in the financial <Col N="736"/>services area and Ireland sought a competitive advantage creating employment in that area, light touch regulation brought its own difficulties when wider issues came into play when the whole financial market almost came to collapse.</P>
        <P>One sees in EU regulatory discussions and wider discussions with other financial markets and regulatory authorities, the need to ensure a greater degree of oversight and accountability in that area, given that what was seen as financial innovation increased risk factors and brought about a situation where the whole remuneration structure and the means by which financial services were applied meant that we saw a lot of activity that increased the risk of what happened happening.  By the time regulatory authorities get to the point where they know what is going on, the harm is done and we then must deal with the impact and retrieve the situation, often causing great economic disturbance and turmoil.</P>
        <P>The question of finding the right level of effective regulation is an important principle of public accountability but by the same token we must avoid and deal with instances where bureaucratic procedures are built up over time that fail to take account of the need for more expeditious responses to people&rsquo;s application or requirement for consent or approval to get on with doing their business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment about getting the right balance for effective regulation.  Regulation that was too loose caused mayhem that we are now dealing with.</P>
        <P>The recent OECD economic survey of Ireland made two points.  It indicated that we should move to a single agency to deal with employment and unemployment.  This concerns the work of F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Given the extent of the regulation that exists, is the Taoiseach of the view that this should be done?  Clearly, there are cost implications where money may be saved, either by outsourcing training courses or giving them to the VECs, as distinct from the cost of F&Aacute;S at the moment.</P>
        <P>In its economic report the OECD also recommends the removal of unnecessarily restrictive regulations, strengthening competition policy and changes to planning laws, with particular reference to the legal profession, pharmacies, doctors and pubs, in addition to the network industries.  I am sure the Taoiseach has taken note of the report.  Perhaps we might get a response at the next Question Time to some of the points it has raised as regards reducing the administrative regulatory burden on business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We seem to have the worst of both worlds with regard to regulation.  While the Government has been looking at all the reports on better regulation, with more and more working groups examining this question, people in business are being tortured with filling forms and trying to respond to one agency or regulatory body after another.  The quantity of regulation does not seem to equate with the quality, an example being the regulation of the banks.  Where stands regulation of the banks today in circumstances where one financial institution has decided it is going to appoint the same person as chairman and chief executive, and where a new managing director is being appointed at a salary level in access of what the Government says it should be?  Is there regulation of the banks, or now that the print is drying on the NAMA legislation, are they again free to go back to doing as they like? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance has been outlining the Government position on the second matter Deputy Gilmore has raised in an earlier programme. </P>
        <P>With regard to the questions raised by Deputy Kenny on the question of outsourcing and using private companies for the purposes of training programmes, to work in partnership is a <Col N="737"/>good thing, although there have been some recent controversies in this regard where the certification processes were not what they should have been.  The question of proper oversight when other agents act on behalf of statutory authorities for the provision of training is again an important aspect of regulation.  Work cannot simply be farmed out without the statutory authority being in a position to properly oversee it and ensure that standards are being maintained and regulated.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Competition Authority, there have been a number of interim reports in respect of certain professions and some of the recommendations have been acted upon.  I understand the final is due in the middle of next year.  Any specific regulatory matters raised which are the responsibility of particular Ministers, should elicit replies from them through the parliamentary question procedure.</P>

        <Quest> the actions which will be prioritised under the new National Drugs Strategy to combat the supply of drugs here; the discussions he has had with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41713/09] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 17 actions, Nos. 2 to 18, inclusive, of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-20016 are included under the supply reduction pillar.  The objectives of this pillar are to significantly reduce the volume of illicit drugs; to prevent the emergence of new markets for illicit drugs; to disrupt the activities of organised criminal networks; to target the income generated through illicit drug trafficking; and to reduce community drug problems. </P>
        <P>The actions of the strategy envisage an increased emphasis on community policing, including through the continued roll-out of local policing forums and the inclusion of drugs issues in a more central way in the work of joint policing committees.  Also, I recently announced the extension of the &ldquo;Dial to Stop Drug Dealing&rdquo; campaign that has proven effective.  Lead responsibility for the delivery of much of the supply reduction pillar of the strategy lies with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s Custom Service.</P>
        <P>As set out in the strategy, I will meet twice a year with a number of Ministers and various senior officials who are directly involved in the work to address the drugs problem.  Since the strategy was launched in September I have already met under this process with the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform and the Secretary General of that Department, the Garda Commissioner and senior officials of Revenue&rsquo;s Custom Service.  These meetings greatly facilitate a co-ordinated approach to the drugs problem, allow for a useful exchange of views on issues arising in respect of relevant actions of the national drugs strategy and focus on the importance of the continued effective implementation of other programmes that affect the factors underpinning problem drug use.</P>
        <P>An oversight forum on drugs, which I chair, has been established under the strategy and the first meeting was held last month.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda and Revenue&rsquo;s customs service are represented on this forum, the primary role of which is the ongoing high level examination of progress across the strategy and the addressing of operational difficulties and blockages that arise.</P>
<Col N="738"/>
        <P>A drugs advisory group also has been set up with membership drawn from across the statutory, community and voluntary sectors.  This group, which meets approximately once a fortnight, advises me, as Minister, on operational and policy matters relating to the national drugs strategy and oversees and supports the work of the drugs task forces.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda and Revenue&rsquo;s customs service also are represented on this group.</P>
        <P>I am determined that real progress will be made to combat the supply of drugs across the period of the strategy, with all sectors working in a co-ordinated and targeted way to achieve the implementation of the agreed actions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s response referred to meetings, resources and everything that is being attempted in Ireland to prevent drugs use and in particular to prevent young people from taking drugs from the perspective of going into schools to educate them.  Recently however, Judge Tony Hunt called for security at private airports to be increased.  It is outrageous that the Judiciary is worried about drugs coming into this country via private airports.  As for the level of checking at such airports, only 18 checks were performed at Weston Aerodrome this year.  What are the Minister of State, his committee, the Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform doing about private airports?</P>
        <P>It is similar to the two-tier approach taken to the issue of drugs itself.  While one will not see Garda activity at parties frequented by the upper class, it will be seen in working-class areas in which it is known drugs will be present.  A two-tier system is in operation in Ireland in respect of law and order and drugs.  Moreover, a two-tier system exists regarding the importation of drugs.  The Minister of State should meet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform immediately and should then report back to this House to inform Members of the measures being taken by the Government and the Garda to stop drugs from being imported via private airports.  Second, the Minister of State should raise the issue of unregistered mobile telephones with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Although such mobile telephones can be used by gangsters and criminals to tip one another off, there is no security or monitoring of them.  I seek information on what is happening in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the matters raised are outside the Minister of State&rsquo;s direct ministerial responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>He is on the relevant committee that meets in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific question asked by the Deputy regarding private airfields and so on perhaps should not be directed towards the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I understand it falls more properly under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners.  I have met the Revenue Commissioners who have advised me that the traffic coming through such airports is profiled and that the Revenue Commissioners have mobile units that carry out random checks.  Such random checks are a feature of customs operations and are performed quite regularly, based on profiling of flights, traffic and so forth.  Moreover, this does not simply pertain to flights but to traffic entering all ports nationwide.  The use of profiling, intelligence and information is the primary way in which the customs service conducts its business.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made a number of comments as if to suggest nothing has been done.  It is important to put on the record of the House that since the strategy was published on 10 September 2009, I have held a series of meetings with the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="739"/>Law Reform, that Department&rsquo;s Secretary General, customs, Revenue and the Garda Commissioner and I will outline some of the actions arising therefrom.  The number of dog units used to detect drugs entering ports has increased.  The customs service recently has launched a new cutter at sea.  A new mobile scanner for incoming trucks will be operational before the end of this year.  Operation Anvil has been allocated increased funding in the current year.  The Government has introduced legislation such as the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act in respect of gangland crime and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009.  I also have extended the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing campaign.  These actions have been carried out specifically to tackle this problem in recent months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>While everything the Minister of State says is fine, the problem is that a member of the Judiciary has made a public statement to the effect that he is unhappy with the lack of regulation of private airports.  Moreover, neither I nor the country in general is happy.  The Minister of State should respond in this House at a later stage to the effect that sniffer dogs, the Garda, the customs service and whoever has responsibility will be deployed at private airports, as the flow of drugs into this country must be stopped.  The criminals are sophisticated and if they wish to import drugs through private airports, they must be stopped and it should not be made easy for them.  The tests that are in place for public airports must also apply for private airports.  If this requires the installation of full-time staff in private airports, then this must be done because the scourge of drugs must be stopped.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Deputy when he states that nothing is being done.  As I noted, every flight into a private airport is regulated and monitored.  The customs service, based on its information, decides on whether to perform a check.  This is a small island nation and the risk is as great from the sea.  I note that seizures made in this regard have been made at sea rather than at airports.  The only way in which we will deal with this issue from a supply reduction point of view is through improved international co-operation.  In that regard, I advise the Deputy that the Garda&rsquo;s liaison officers are based in London, the Hague, Madrid, Paris, Lisbon, Europol and Interpol.  As one cannot patrol every seaport and airport on a permanent basis, the manner in which one can achieve an effective supply reduction is through such intelligence and information sharing.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the progress he has made regarding the consideration of the recommendations contained in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated in the House on a number of occasions, the recommendations in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes represent a set of options that are being considered by the Government in the context of the 2010 budget.</P>
        <P>It has been well flagged that serious inroads in the gap in the public finances between income and expenditure must be made.  The report from the special group has provided a broad range of measures for consideration by the Government in that regard.  As the Deputy will be aware, it proposes a range of savings relating to various functions of my Department.  Towards that end, it proposes that a number of schemes be abolished or reduced and makes specific recommendations regarding agencies under the aegis of my Department and indeed the Department itself.</P>
<Col N="740"/>
        <P>However, I believe it would not be appropriate for me to engage in a line-by-line discussion of the various recommendations of the report from the special group, not least because of the work that is in train by the Government to frame the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The last part of the Minister&rsquo;s response is interesting because the main question being asked nationwide through all the agencies funded by his Department is whether the Department will survive budget day.  I note <i>The Irish Times</i> published an advertisement in recent weeks in respect of the appointment of a Secretary General for this Department.  Was clearance received from the Minister for Finance for this appointment?  If so, can Members take it that the McCarthy recommendation that the Department for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs be dissolved will not take place and that the Government has overruled and cast aside this recommendation?  In itself, this will determine many people&rsquo;s Christmases, because it will ensure that their employment will not be affected.  A previous reply from the Minister on the community services programme stated it employed 2,700 people, each one of whom is worried as to where matters stand, how he or she will be affected by the cuts and whether the Department will be dissolved.  Given the evidence of the aforementioned advertisement, is it Government policy that this aspect of the McCarthy report will not be implemented?  Will those who are employed through the various agencies funded by the Department find out that their jobs are safe and that they can look forward to progressing the many wonderful projects they are implementing at the behest of the Government and the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the first part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the decision to advertise the position of Secretary General of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was approved by the Government in the normal way.  That job has been publically advertised.  In this case it was rightly decided to have a public advertisement to see who would apply not only from within the public service, but also from outside. </P>
        <P>The configuration of Departments is purely a matter for the Taoiseach.  Even within the current Government, as in the previous Government, responsibilities are in continual flux.  Parts of the responsibility for the marine were transferred to the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and Transport and so on.  Where departmental responsibilities move from one Minister to another, it does not put an end to the role.  Fisheries continue under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  People try to spin it to the effect that a change of ministerial responsibilities means a change in or elimination of the programmes but that it is unfair and disingenuous.</P>
        <P>The position of Secretary General to the Department has been advertised and it is intended to make an appointment in due course.  I know of no proposal at the moment to change the configuration of Departments but that is a matter for the Taoiseach at any time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not correct to say that this is within the remit of the Taoiseach at any time.  When a new Government takes office, the Taoiseach determines the different Departments.  I do not, however, recall a Taoiseach&rsquo;s deciding in the middle of a Government&rsquo;s term to dissolve a Department as recommended in the McCarthy report.  The people want a decision on where this stands.  Talking about shifting the responsibility to different Departments removes the resolve that existed in the initial stages of implementation of each project and programme.  The concern is that if the Minister of the day in any Department decides on his priorities at the outset but more responsibilities are added in the middle of a Government&rsquo;s term, it reduces the chance of those priorities being processed as the Minister wishes, and as we in the Opposition have on many occasions supported him to do.</P>
<Col N="741"/>
        <P>Will this Department survive McCarthy?  Will the people employed in its various agencies be able to say that there is no change in the projected funding and that, while there may be cutbacks, the thrust of each programme remains the same and that they will not be diversified by falling under the remit of some other Minister?  That is the big problem.</P>
        <P>The Minister has not made a decision about the appointment of the Secretary General of the Department.  He has said it will happen but I want to know when it will happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It will happen as quickly as these processes come to a conclusion.  The public process will take slightly longer than an internal process would do but there will be no delay.  That is not within my control.  These recommendations are made independently and a certain number of names are brought forward.  That process will go ahead and be brought to completion.  </P>
        <P>I know of no proposal to change the responsibilities of my Department.  I share the view of the Deputy that this Department has done very good work.  Many areas, whether severely deprived urban areas, isolated rural areas or islands, would not have received the same attention in the normal way under the line Departments.  The same applies for the drug problems with which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, deals.  The Department works because it deals with communities on a geographic basis or on the basis of social deprivation.  If we did not have that system, these communities would keep falling through the cracks.  I fully accept the support of the Opposition Deputies for the work of this Department and their positive attitude.</P>
        <P>I know of no change but it would not be true to say that change is not possible because many years ago the Department of Labour was set up, and Dr. Paddy Hillery was appointed, mid-term.  I know of no proposal to change this Department.  Speaking on TG4, the Taoiseach made it quite clear when asked about the Department&rsquo;s responsibility for the Gaeltacht that he did not visualise change &agrave; la McCarthy.  I cannot pre-empt any decision he might make but I do not see any imminent change.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if the funding available to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is sufficient to capture the potential for job creation in gaeltacht areas; the level of funding that has been made available from the Department of Finance to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to allow them to assist in job creation in gaeltacht areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41714/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The funding arrangements for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are primarily a matter for my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance.  In 2009, the capital funding being provided by the Exchequer to an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s amounts to &euro;19.65 million.  Furthermore, the organisation is allowed to reinvest any return it receives from sales of assets into its capital programme for job creation purposes.  This policy has realised additional resources of over &euro;30 million over recent years.</P>
        <P>In addition to the aforementioned sources of funding, an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s is also administering the enterprise stabilisation fund and the employment subsidy scheme in the Gaeltacht on behalf of Enterprise Ireland.  I assure the Deputy that an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s continues to pursue a vigorous strategy aimed at developing and securing employment in the Gaeltacht.  My Department maintains regular contact with the organisation in respect of policy and, in this regard, my officials meet with its senior executives frequently about the management of the funding that is available to the organisation.  I am acutely aware of the need to support job maintenance and job creation <Col N="742"/>in the Gaeltacht, especially in the current economic climate, and my Department will continue to work closely with an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that there is an embargo on job creation in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Last July, the chief executive or a spokesman for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s made clear that it had 250 jobs for the Gaeltacht areas but the Department of Finance issued an embargo.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s had the money in its budget but was not allowed to spend it.  The same embargo was, however, was lifted for the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Enterprise Ireland.  There is discrimination against &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, rural Ireland and jobs in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister asked the Minister for Finance to lift this embargo?  Has he spoken to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s about the 250 jobs it proposed to create in the Gaeltacht areas which need it?  Gaeltacht areas in constituencies represented by Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s, myself and the Minister have lost many jobs.  What is the Minister doing about the 250 jobs &Uacute;dar&aacute;s will create if it gets approval for grant aid from the Department of Finance which is holding that back?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should calm down.  He is in a very excitable humour today.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>He has good reason to be. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is no wonder when I see how the Minister and his colleagues are running the country. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts of the case are that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s was severely extended because of the lack of its own income this year.  It is an important principle for me, although I do not know if the Deputy holds the same view, that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s should be able to meet its commitments for grant payments and so on as they fall due.  That was not the situation in the middle of the year.  I am not blaming the Department of Finance.  My Department and I told &Uacute;dar&aacute;s not to sanction any further grants until we were satisfied that the sanctioning of further grants would not create an impossible burden on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s finance.  The collapse of its income has put its capital budget under severe strain.</P>
        <P>Permission was given in the autumn to approve grants to the amount of &euro;2 million and again in November to the amount of &euro;1.89 million, which is almost &euro;4 million in total.  We are asking &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to prioritise grants that would have an immediate benefit.  I have suggested that small grants be diverted to Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG, which has a great deal of money that it has not approved, or a great deal of permission that it has not used.  This is the sensible way to proceed.</P>
        <P>It is very important for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, at a time when money is scarce, not to get involved in forward building but to concentrate on projects that will yield an immediate return in jobs.  If a building is needed as part of a particular project it may go ahead with that if jobs will be created immediately.  That is the priority. We are working with them month by month to ensure permission is given for programmes from which jobs can be created and products launched.  However, each Department must live within its capital envelopes.  The control is being exercised by my Department in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can talk all day and night but there is an embargo on jobs in the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I am disappointed the Minister has not spoken to the Minister for Finance about this matter.  How many jobs have been lost because of this embargo?  This is discrimination against the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and the Gaeltacht areas because the same embargo that applied to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland was lifted.  I demand this embargo against the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s be <Col N="743"/>lifted immediately.  It is wrong because the Gaeltacht areas badly need jobs and job creation programmes.  The &Uacute;dar&aacute;s claims it can create jobs but because of the embargo it cannot.  Will the Minister speak to the Minister for Finance to have this embargo lifted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not normal for a Minister to ask the questions on Question Time but, is this an embargo on the recruitment of staff in the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s or an embargo on it approving new projects?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has stopped the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s from spending money.  The &Uacute;dar&aacute;s claims the money is there; the Minister, otherwise.  The &Uacute;dar&aacute;s claims it can create jobs but the Minister will not allow it to spend money.  That is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should conclude on the question &mdash; rather the answer &mdash; instead of drawing more questions upon himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s problem is that he knows the question but he does not know how to answer it.  I am after putting it as simply as I can.  I cannot put it any simpler.  I want jobs in the Gaeltacht and the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>What I was trying to say, but the Deputy was not listening, was that the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s was given permission to approve grants to the value of &euro;2 million in September and a further &euro;1.89 million in November, approximately &euro;4 million in total.  We are agreeing with the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s on a month-by-month basis on the approval of programmes for job creation within its spending limits.  There is no embargo.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Catherine Byrne</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to tackle the increase in heroin and cocaine use, as outlined in the recently published 2009 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, The State of the Drugs Problem in Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41788/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The drug prevalence statistics contained in the recently published report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction were compiled from the latest figures available for individual countries.  In the case of Ireland, they reflect the outcome of the all-island drug prevalence survey 2006 to 2007, which provides the best estimate of the drug prevalence.  One of the findings of the 2006 to 2007 survey was the emergence of cocaine as a threat, particularly among younger adults.  On the other hand, whole-population surveys are not a reliable mechanism for assessing heroin use as the numbers of people involved are relatively small.</P>
        <P>Overall the EMCDDA report points out that cocaine use has risen across Europe; heroin use, which is covered in much less depth in the report, is stable across Europe but no longer shows a decline; and polydrug use is now the norm among problem drug users.  These points are broadly in line with experience in Ireland.  The introduction to the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 speaks of the growth in cocaine use, albeit from a low base, the dispersal of heroin use around the country because when the 2001-2008 strategy was drawn up heroin use was seen primarily as a Dublin issue, and polydrug use as a norm among problem drug users.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the new strategy, which was launched in September, has been drawn up with the aim of addressing such issues.  The overall strategic objective of the strategy is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. <Col N="746"/> The new strategy has an appropriate balance between supply reduction and demand reduction initiatives.  Supply reduction measures will focus in particular on measures to reduce the volume of illicit drugs reaching Ireland and the disruption of the activities of organised criminal networks.  In regard to demand reduction, there will be a significant emphasis on prevention measures, with some such measures focusing on the broad population, while others will target specific groups deemed to be most at risk.  We must endeavour to equip young people, in particular, with the skills and knowledge necessary to make informed choices about their health and future that will include a rejection of drug use.  There will be also a major focus on developing a national integrated treatment and rehabilitation service to aid those already involved with drugs.</P>
        <P>The difficulties facing our society as a consequence of problem drug use are significant and addressing all the factors involved will not be easy.  However, I am determined that real progress will be made across the period of the strategy, with all sectors working in a co-ordinated and targeted way, to achieve the implementation of the agreed actions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The report also states that Ireland has the fourth highest incidence of cocaine use among 15 to 24 year olds in Europe.  I remind the Minister of State it is a known fact that 15 year olds can buy a line of cocaine or a bag of heroin easier than they can buy a packet of cigarettes in a shop.  As a result of Government and departmental cuts in community projects, there has been a significant increase in cocaine use in all communities.  It is on the streets for all to see and all one needs to do is open one&rsquo;s eyes.  Without the intervention of these projects and their influence on young people, their lives are at risk.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister of State refer to health as I missed some of his reply.  I strongly believe that prevention is the best action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should concentrate on the fact that taking away funding for community use through community projects, education and youth caf&eacute;s, is devastating.  I have another question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call the Deputy again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Byrne I wish to be clear that this EMCDDA report ranked Ireland fourth in terms of cocaine use.  However, the report is specific in stating that cocaine use is primarily seen in western Europe, in Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom.  I am not trying to diminish the significance of the problem but other countries which do not have a cocaine problem tend to have a problem with other drugs, particularly amphetamines.  </P>
        <P>I certainly agree with the Deputy on one point.  Earlier in the year I attended a UN convention on narcotics.  I listened to presentations from a significant number of countries, from the wealthiest to the poorest countries in the world.  Every one of those countries had a drugs problem.  If as a society we wish to make a significant impact on the drugs problem the only way to do so is in the area of prevention, awareness and education.  We can make all the seizures and treat all those who are addicted but if we want to effect a radical change this will happen only through education, prevention and awareness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I agree with him on that point.  The report clearly states that the widespread use of cocaine and heroin in the countries to which the Minister of State referred, and the number of people seeking detox<Col N="747"/>ification treatment, increased significantly.  The only figures I can find are for 2005 to 2007, when there was a rise of 170% in cocaine-related cases.  This is a significant figure.  What urgent action is being taken to prevent addiction in the first place?  Where this has failed, what measures will be implemented to adequately treat these people and give them proper treatment places?  As the Minister of State said, prevention is the most important factor but people are also suffering and they need treatment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that prevention is the key.  I refer to those who are currently addicted and are looking for treatment.  The figures referred to are for 2006 to 2007.  It is a concern that during times of recession, the emergence of heroin use can pose a significant problem.  I have had discussions with the HSE.  It was decided in the past month to have additional clinical services up and running before the end of the first quarter of next year in parts of the country where services were poor or non-existent, for example in Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, Drogheda.  In addition, it was decided that GPs would also assist.  There must be a combined package, otherwise people will go to a clinic but will not have progression routes and this is not sufficient.  In the southern part of the country, the HSE has committed to a number of additional detoxification beds, including counselling services, as not everyone requires an opiate substitute or methadone.  An additional 10,000 counselling hours will be provided next year for up to 400 people who are addicted.  These are tangible initiatives which are underway as we speak to deal with this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 64 together. </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to assure the Deputies, and the House, that my Department has and will continue to work with Departments and other public bodies to assist them in meeting their obligations under the Act in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible.  I reiterate that the obligation under section 10 of the Act to publish documents simultaneously in Irish and English applies only to a limited number of key documents published by public bodies, including annual reports and accounts and documents setting out public policy proposals.</P>
        <P>I have long advocated that documents such as these should be published by way of CDs or the Internet, rather than in hard copy.  I am aware that a number of public bodies already follow this practice. The Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga specifically advocates this approach to public bodies in the guidebook on the Act published by his office circulated to all bodies in 2008.  The Government adopted a similar policy last year as one of a number of measures designed to reduce costs across public bodies.</P>
<Col N="748"/>
         <P>With regard to the issue of whether the level of funding spent on translating official documents into Irish would be better spent on reviving the Irish language, I believe that given the constitutional position of the Irish language and its application in the &Oacute; Beol&aacute;in case of 2001, it would be a mistake to think there is a choice between implementing the Act &mdash; with consequent costs &mdash; and not implementing it.  The Act provides a planning mechanism by which constitutional obligations can be met over time in a planned and coherent way.  The alternative is an <i>ad hoc</i> approach, in which public bodies respond in a fragmentary and crisis management way to perhaps much more prescriptive judicial orders<b>.  </b>Given its position as the first constitutional language, the objective of the Act is to ensure that delivery of public services by public bodies through the Irish language is seen as normal and as being required to meet minimum standards of customer service and corporate governance, rather than an optional extra or add-on.  The provision of public services in Irish so that the citizen has the option of engaging in official business with State bodies through Irish, is essential to the future of the language.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year the State and the local authorities spent &euro;1.8 million on translation of documents.  In the past six years, &euro;6 million has been spent on the translation of documents.  It is Fine Gael&rsquo;s view that this money could be better spent on the Irish language.  It is like the film &ldquo;Lost in Translation&rdquo;.  This is what is happening &mdash; they are lost in translation.</P>
        <P>I put it to the Minister that it is now time for a review of the Act itself.  The Minister says he is telling local authorities and State agencies that putting information on their websites will do, rather then printing out all the documents.  We cannot afford another &euro;1.8 million next year.  When there is talk of cutting the home help service, charging for medical cards and cutting services at hospitals, we cannot afford to spend &euro;1.8 million translating documents that nobody wants.</P>
        <P>The Minister is attending tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Can we hear a review of the Act?  Will the Minister agree at least to tell local authorities and State agencies they do not need to spend so much money?  They should put documents up on their websites for people to download, which will cover their obligations under the Act.  Will he issue a ministerial order, once and for all, telling them to do this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am all for saving money.  We are all for saving money where money should be saved.  However, if we have a first constitutional language, there are certain obligations involved to the users of that language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot afford it any more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of affording it.  As I have pointed out, there is a constitutional obligation.  If the Deputy believes we can no longer afford the Irish language&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not saying that.  We cannot afford the translation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy mentioned specifically the translation of local authority plans.  As I said before, we do not see any need to produce hard copies.  However, it is interesting to consider the case of County Clare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Then why are they doing so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="749"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us consider the case of County Clare.  I understand the local authority translated the county development plan into Irish and printed English and Irish-language versions.  Great play was made of the fact that nobody bought the Irish-language version, but the county council does not have a record of how many hits the Internet page received.  I asked my officials to check the numbers involved and was told that 190 copies of the English-language versions of the three plans had been bought over a four to five-year period, at a cost of &euro;50 each.  This equates to an average of 18 copies a year.  It is obvious that people are downloading the documents, in Irish and English, from the Internet.  Any sensible person would do this.  In other words, nobody is buying them in any language.  There are probably hundreds of copies of the English-language county plan, produced at enormous cost, lying around Clare County Council because people did not buy it when they could get it from the Internet.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s colleague, Councillor Joe Arkins, put it well when he said that spending on the Irish language by county councils should occur not only during the good times but also in times of recession.  Another Fine Gael councillor, Johnny Flynn, said the cost of translating the documents was 10 cent per resident of County Clare.  There is money to be saved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot afford it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We will discuss this in great detail at tomorrow&rsquo;s committee meeting.  I will be able to prove that the translation of documents into Irish is saving the State considerable amounts of money, and I will bring a small level of physical evidence in with me to prove my point.  It is saving funds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to conclude as Deputy O&rsquo;Shea wishes to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it mind-boggling to imagine that the translation of documents into Irish is saving the State funds. If the Minister can apply that economic principle to all State spending there will be no need for a &euro;4 billion cutback.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>No; there will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The arguments being presented by the Minister are legalistic.  What we all want to see is greater use of the Irish language.  That is the real issue.  To be translating documents into Irish that, by the Minister&rsquo;s own admission, few people are reading even in English&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to put his question.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="750"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying the expenditure on translating documents that are not read by a significant number of people &mdash; and whose Irish versions are not read to any significant degree even on the Internet &mdash; is justified in contrast to other, more productive spending which would promote the use of the Irish language?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I must clarify that I never said or intended to convey the idea that nobody read the Clare county plan or that people were not using it every day.  I imagine that if one looked at the number of hits for the county plan on the website one would see it was one of the most used documents, in Irish and English, to be found anywhere.  County plans are working documents that are used every day.  What I said was that there were few people stupid enough to pay &euro;50 for a document they can get free from the Internet.</P>
        <P>We will, I hope, have a detailed and rational debate about this tomorrow.  When we were framing the Bill and debating it in the House, we discussed the balance between the right of the citizen to use the first official language in communicating with the State and the cost of producing documents.  We tried to take a middle road, that is, that certain basic documents would be seen as a fundamental right of the citizen.</P>
        <P>The question of usage is a vexed one when we are talking about rights.  We know that habitual Irish speakers are a minority.  If we say a document should not be published because many people would not use it, this has mind-boggling implications for a whole set of minority rights.  When we are dealing with minorities, the numbers will always be much lower.  We must tease out the question of whether minorities &mdash; particularly in this case, as the minority is using the first official language of the State &mdash; have some rights to basic documents in Irish and, if so, which documents.  As the Deputy knows, I am open to debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to bring in Deputy McGinley, if the Minister will allow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that on Report Stage of the National Asset Management Agency Bill, under amendment No. 223 in the name of the Minister, section 7 of the Official Languages Act was set aside?  We will not immediately have a translation of that Act into the first official language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of Cabinet, I am aware of that.  I understand the reason is that translation in the House comes under the remit of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, but it was not in a position to ensure the Irish-language version would be ready when the Bill was signed by the President.  The problem arising is that under section 7 of the Official Languages Act, the Bill is not enacted until versions in the two languages are available.  The Houses of the Oireachtas is dealing with the matter and I have no doubt it will get full co-operation from the relevant Department.</P>
        <P>I must further point out that, separately from the Official Languages Act, there is a constitutional obligation to translate all Acts of the Oireachtas into the Irish language.  The Act states that the Irish version of an Act should be produced at the same time as the English version, which is to protect us against constitutional challenge in the courts.  That is the difficulty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 71 and 325 together.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that I suspended funding for the scheme of community supports for older people earlier this year pending the completion of a comprehensive review of its operations by my Department.  That review is now completed and is being considered.  Pending the establishment of new arrangements, I lifted the suspension at the end of September to afford community groups the opportunity to apply for funding for equipment, particularly monitored personal alarms and monitored smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.  However, requests for other items of security equipment are being funded in the usual manner.</P>
        <P>In order to facilitate the installation of equipment before Christmas, groups were advised that applications received before 21 October would be given priority.  The scheme continues to receive applications and my Department will process as many as possible so that the funds provided can be fully drawn down by community groups to allow for the timely installation of equipment.</P>
        <P>At the end of last week, some 300 applications had been received.  Of these, 93 applications to the value of &euro;240,000 have been approved and are either paid or in the process of being paid.  These funds will provide equipment for 822 older persons.  I estimate that applications in respect of a further 1,800 older men and women will be funded in the coming month.  Applications received prior to the suspension of the scheme in respect of 3,695 older men and women were funded earlier this year.  In total, some &euro;1.5 million has been approved to date in respect of equipment for approximately 4,500 older people.</P>
        <P>I have received a report of the review carried out by Department officials and will give consideration to its recommendations over the coming weeks.  These focus on the need to reinforce the local community support ethos of the current scheme, to simplify the administrative arrangements and to take account of other developments since the scheme was introduced in 1996.  Subject to available funds and with the co-operation of community groups, the current scheme will continue to process applications until a new scheme is introduced in early 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year on 6 April, the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, announced funding for this scheme.  The following day was budget day and the scheme was closed down.  The Minister announced the re-opening of the scheme on 6 October.  Eleven working days later my office rang the Department to discover if applications were being accepted and was told the scheme had closed.  I believe it is open again but is dealing only with applications made before 21 October.  </P>
        <P>I want a commitment from the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, that in the budget of 9 December this scheme will not be closed again.  I also want a commitment that those persons who made an application after 21 October will have their applications dealt with and that <Col N="752"/>funding will be in place for them.  Elderly people are worried.  They do not know whether the scheme is open or closed.  The Minister of State is pulling wool over their eyes.  He is using the old Fianna F&aacute;il spin again &mdash; it is open one day, closed the next.  It is a bit like the grant for older people.  In my county alone, every Deputy was out announcing the wonderful scheme and asking elderly people to go and apply for it.  The county council has &euro;7 million in approvals and got &euro;600,000 from the State a few weeks ago.  Is the scheme open or closed?  Will it stay open or will it be closed in the budget in December?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State to reply briefly because I want to include another Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to give Deputy Ring straight answers.  First, the scheme is open.  Second, 4,500 people have availed of it to date.  Third, I have applications on hand, received prior to 21 October in respect of approximately 1,800 people.  As I said at the time, it is my intention that all these will be dealt with before Christmas.  There were 840 pre-registered groups and 20 additional ones, totalling 860.  It was a concern of the Department that each group would have an equal opportunity to apply for priority and be dealt with in a timely fashion.  If that were not the case, what happened in the past was that groups would apply and six months later their application would be dealt with.  We are dealing with these on an ongoing basis in a timely fashion.</P>
        <P>There is a review and, as I stated in my response, pending the implementation of the new scheme those applications that are being and have been received will be processed.  As I said time and time again, 860 groups were written to specifically and asked to forward priority cases.  If they did so before 21 October, those applications were to be processed before Christmas.  We are on target to honour that commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the review be made available to Opposition spokespersons or will it be placed in the library?  Deputy Ring mentioned grants for disabled people.  In Kildare, &euro;3.5 million was committed to that scheme, although &euro;5 million was not committed to in respect of senior citizen grants.  The grant in question must be dealt with positively in the forthcoming budget.  People in our communities have a fear now that was never there before.  Due to the banking crisis, some of them are hoarding their money at home and this is creating major problems.  As Deputy Ring did, I ask that this scheme be underpinned in the forthcoming budget to provide funding for all organisations interested in having these facilities implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the funding there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the 1,800 people I mentioned, there is funding.  Next year&rsquo;s budget will bring a figure, whatever it may be.  That is part of the budgetary process as the Deputies know well.  It is intended that the scheme will run next year.  We have done a report and there are various recommendations and so on to consider.  I have just received them.</P>
        <P>While the scheme is generally working well, there are areas of concern in that it is not being administered equally across the country.  Another interesting fact that arose concerns the piece of technological equipment in question.  Most Deputies will know that equipment of this nature, whether one&rsquo;s computer, mobile telephone or LCD screen, has become cheaper in recent years but we have seen no reduction in the price of the equipment in question.  There are a number of such issues that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I reiterate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the report?</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="753"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem making the report available in any format.  I ask the Deputy to give me an opportunity to deal with the matter for a week or so first.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the latest debacle to erupt in banking circles.  I understand from comments made today by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that yesterday evening a proposal from Allied Irish Banks was dropped into the Department of Finance.  This proposal was obviously not dropped in on a whim.  It was for the appointment of a person as managing director of AIB, on a salary of &euro;633,000.  </P>
        <P>As I understand it, the State has 25% control in AIB.  The Government gave it &euro;3.5 billion in preference shares, intends to acquire the loan book for an assumed figure of &euro;24 billion and has guaranteed all its liabilities.  I understand the Cabinet discussed this matter this morning.  The Taoiseach is well aware of the importance of our country&rsquo;s reputation, the credibility of our banking system and the integrity that goes along with that.  Was there any contact between Allied Irish Banks and the Minister for Finance or his Department concerning this matter?  Does the Taoiseach support the proposed appointment, given that this person is an insider, has been on the board since 2003, has been central to many of the lending practices of Allied Irish Banks and will not do anything to enhance the reputation of the Irish banking system in <Col N="754"/>general?  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view, arising from this latest debacle in banking circles?  Effectively, the Government has been given another major snub, following what happened with Bank of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance outlined the position regarding this matter which came into the public domain during the past 24 hours before he was in a position to consider the appointment and report to the Government today.  The Government reiterated its position of 11 March when it noted the content of the first report of the covered institutions&rsquo; remuneration oversight committee which looked at salaries in this area and agreed to the report being available to both Houses of the Oireachtas and the public.  It also agreed the Minister for Finance would write to the financial institutions asking them to revise their remuneration plans in such a way as to respect the salary cap of &euro;500,000 or the amount recommended by the committee, whichever should be the lesser.  We simply confirmed that was our position.  I am sure discussions are ongoing between the bank and the Department, arising from that communication by the Minister in respect of correspondence that came into his office last night and was in the public domain before he had an opportunity to consider it.  That is where matters rest.  It is important, in the interests of effective management of the bank, which is in all of our interests, that we allow the process to develop with a view to finding a resolution that is consistent with the Government position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the reaction of people, particularly the young, to the situation.  This is one of the major institutions centrally involved in the financial and economic debacle in which we find ourselves.  It is one of the major institutions in respect of which Mr. Trichet today referred to countries losing their reputations and credibility.</P>
        <P>The Government effectively has 25% control of the bank and the Minister for Finance has stated that we are deeply embedded in the banking sector.  Clearly, an insider is being appointed to the job.  Minister after Minister has been discussing prescription charges of 50 cent and cutting child benefit and every other allowance of which one could think while Allied Irish Banks has proposed, not on a whim, to the Department of Finance that a person be appointed as the bank&rsquo;s managing director with a salary grossly in excess of the Government&rsquo;s guideline.  This breaches every ethical guideline of good corporate governance and does nothing for our country&rsquo;s reputation or the attempt to sort out the banking situation.  The Government is being told that it has no moral authority, has lost credibility, is losing integrity and that the bank will do what it likes.</P>
        <P>The Government gave the bank &euro;3.4 billion in taxpayers&rsquo; money, guaranteed all of its liabilities, will buy its loan book for &euro;24 billion and controls 25% of it.  Everyone else is being forced to take pain on all levels, but a proposal was dropped into the Department of Finance by the bank at 7.30 p.m. and discussed by the Cabinet this morning.  Now, there is neither a managing director nor credibility of Government.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has this matter not been dealt with decisively by the Government in view of the State&rsquo;s control?  Neither we nor the bank know what is occurring and the Government will not say.  Surely there is someone among the Irish diaspora who is objective, external, would do the job for &euro;500,000 and would clean up the bank within 18 months.  The person proposed to be appointed was centrally involved in lending practices in an institution that was partly responsible for the current debacle.</P>
<Col N="755"/>
        <P>What is this doing to the attempt to restore credibility to banking institutions and our financial credibility of which the Taoiseach and Ministers spoke in recent weeks?  Does the Taoiseach support AIB&rsquo;s proposal on the appointment of a managing director on a salary grossly in excess of the guidelines set by the Government?  He is an insider and his role as managing director is not in keeping with the best standards of good corporate governance.</P>

	<P>The situation is that the Government has made clear the arrangements in respect of our position regarding the filling of a position of a CEO in line with the decisions that we communicated in March.  That is the position.  The board brought forward the name of the person it felt to be the person best qualified, given all of the choices that it had based on those who were available to do so, to run the bank.  An issue came into the public domain this morning before the Minister for Finance had given proper consideration to it or been given an <Col N="756"/>opportunity to consider it.  He has now communicated to the bank the position that he holds, supported by the Government, and we now await developments in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The salary of the bank&rsquo;s managing director is not only in excess of the Government&rsquo;s guideline, but is also approximately 20 times what a county council road worker is paid and whose pay the Government is proposing to cut.  This day week, every child will be home from school or parents will need to find child minders because all of the schools will be closed.  People with medical appointments, many of whom have waited for them for some time, will have them cancelled because hospitals will be operating on a Christmas Day roster.  People making urgent telephone calls to social welfare offices will not be answered.  If there is a spate of bad weather, there will be no county council road workers to clear the roads and drains because all of the staff will be on strike.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago, I put it to the Taoiseach that it would be better for this country were there a national agreement.  I suggested five measures that should form part of that agreement and urged the Taoiseach to engage in talks with the unions concerned so that we would not head into a period of industrial strife and conflict.  We are only one week away from a national strike.  What are the Taoiseach and the Government doing to avert the strike due to occur this day week, 24 November?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does Deputy Gilmore not talk to his friends in the unions about the strike?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Talks are continuing with the public sector unions regarding the whole question of public sector pay and the contribution it can make to the budgetary requirements we will face in the coming weeks ahead of 9 December.  We are also in the process of indicating to them our view of where we believe the necessary efficiencies and changes have to take place in order to reform our public services in the longer term as well as in the short and medium terms.  This is continuing.</P>
        <P>A decision was taken by, as Deputy Gilmore said, the unions concerned to embark on a one-day strike on 24 November.  I very much regret the fact that it appears the strike will proceed.  I would ask that it not proceed for two reasons, given the impact it can have on the provision of services for those who require them and because it is not clear what it can achieve, since it would be far better to continue with the discussions that are ongoing between Government and the unions.  I would ask that people would, even at this late stage, consider the position further and avoid the necessity of withdrawal from work on that date, given the impact it will have on society, and allow their representatives to continue in discussions with the Government as we seek to find a way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach knows well that type of appeal is meaningless, particularly given circumstances in which overwhelming numbers in the unions concerned took the decision to take strike action.  If the Taoiseach is serious about averting the strike &mdash; I hope he is, although I did not detect that from the tone of his answer &mdash; he and his Ministers need to engage directly in these talks rather than leaving them to officials.  We are a week away from a strike.  The Government will either make a serious attempt to avert it or it will not.</P>
        <P>Were this a strike by unions seeking a pay increase, everyone in the House and elsewhere would tell them to negotiate or, if they could not reach agreement in negotiations, use the Labour Court, the conciliation and arbitration mechanisms or the State&rsquo;s other industrial relations machinery.  In the current circumstances, the Government is seeking to reduce the <Col N="757"/>pay bill, but the same rules should apply.  The Government should negotiate or, if an agreement is not possible, use the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery to resolve issues that cannot be agreed.  What should not be allowed to occur and into which the Government is sleepwalking is a strike next Tuesday.  If that strike goes ahead, the Government will inevitably go down the road of conflict, industrial action and strife, which is not what the country needs.  We need a period of time where people pull together, not engage in conflict.  The Government has a responsibility to roll up its sleeves and try to reach agreement with the unions concerned to avert that strike.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are precisely the sort of sentiments that I expressed over the weekend.  I agree that it is a difficult situation for any trade union representative where what is in prospect is a reduction in the overall pay bill rather than an increase being negotiated.</P>
        <P>However, I emphasise, and remind the Deputy, that I am engaging with the public sector unions to see what policy options they claim could be available here to assist in ensuring that we make the necessary savings of the order of &euro;1.3 billion that must come from the public sector pay bill as we seek to bring forward reductions of the order of &euro;4 billion in total public service provision.  It is an inescapable fact that public sector pay must be part of that contribution.  There is no way around that.</P>
        <P>We have engaged, and are engaging, with the public sector unions to see if there is a means of doing this that would be acceptable to all.  I am interested in obtaining the reductions in the pay bill by whatever means is available to us.  I would like to do that by agreement.  I have made that clear from the outset, but I also have made clear that the Government has a duty to discharge here.  We must discharge that duty, hopefully, with agreement.  It will not be for the want of trying.</P>
        <P>There is no question, in terms of the pejorative terms being used by the Deputy, of sleep-walking or anything else.  Everyone recognises the seriousness of the situation.  Everyone sees how difficult the choices are and how limited the options may be, but we are approaching this matter in good faith.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss why the Minister for Finance has agreed to breach his own guidelines in respect of the pay of bank chief executives in the case of AIB; why an outside chief executive has not been required by the Government, and the extent to which the board appointing the chief executive has been changed since the guarantee was introduced.</P>

	<P>I, too, seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Science to take immediate steps to resolve the difficulties in VECs and local authorities across the State whereby, due to the unprecedented number of student grant applications, the recruitment embargo placed on both bodies and the unavailability of overtime, many students must wait until January to receive their first student grant payments; and due to the delay on student grant payments, many students are defaulting on rent, unable to purchase vital college books, equipment and supplies, and many students currently attending third level institutions are not registered leaving them without access to crucial services such as libraries.  There is clearly no prospect of us ever achieving a smart economy while we shamefully neglect this critical human capital resource.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. 28, statements re Pre-Budget Outlook.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; and (2) the proceedings on No. 28 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. tonight and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.

        <P FLI="0" el="5">In making his nomination for the appointment of Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, has the Taoiseach had discussions with President Barroso in respect of possible portfolios to be awarded on her acceptance or does he have a priority portfolio in mind?  While these appointments are for the European Union and not in respect of nationalist positions, most other countries have stated a preference for their nominees to be appointed to particular portfolios.  Does he have any one in mind in that regard?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, I join Deputy Kenny in congratulating Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn on her nomination for appointment as Commissioner, and, I wish her well in that role.  Does the Taoiseach have any plans to bring her nomination before the House for approval?  I appreciate that, technically, that is not required, but since it is a nominee of the country rather than a nominee of Government, I want to know if the Government has any plans to bring the proposal before the House.  Can he give any assurance to the House that she will be allocated a senior and significant portfolio?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe there is precedent for requirement that the nomination of a proposed Commissioner by Government for consideration by the European Parliament would be brought for approval before the House.  I am not aware that such is a requirement.</P>
        <P>Everyone will be aware of the merits of the candidate concerned.  Obviously, there were other prospective candidates who would equally be able to serve Ireland well in this situation.  I had to take into account a number of points, one of which was the following comment from the President of the Commission:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To allow me to propose a properly balanced team to the Council and the European Parliament, I would therefore ask you all to see gender balance as a common goal and as a shared responsibility.  I would therefore urge you to pay particular attention to the presence of women in the College as our discussions continue towards conclusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Quite apart from that aspect, the capacity and ability of the proposed nominee is well known to many Members of this House who recall a distinguished career in politics here in Ireland.  Her work on the Court of Auditors is well regarded also.</P>

	<P>Obviously other considerations come into play as regards that.  As I have said, there are many people who could have completed this task.  Deputies raised the portfolio question, but that is a matter exclusively for the President of the Commission.  He has made it clear that portfolios are not assigned to countries, but to individuals.  The matter is required to go before the European Parliament for its approval, so we must await that process and not assume its outcome.  I have every confidence, however, that the capacity of M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn will be reflected in a portfolio that will enable her to serve the college well and to serve her country well in the spirit in which commissioners are appointed.</P>

        <P>Members of the Government will be going to Copenhagen for the climate change conference, which is so important.  The climate change Bill is expected to be published next year, but does <Col N="760"/>the Taoiseach have a clearer fix on that?  Is it likely to be early in 2010?

Unfortunately, it appears that suicide is on the increase in this country.  The grief expressed by German people in recent days has been experienced by many families.  It is important to address this matter.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide time for the House to discuss the issue of suicide. </P>

	<P>A number of weeks ago, I sought a debate in this House on the same issue following a report on suicide in the<i> Irish Examiner</i>.  I support Deputy Se&aacute;n Power&rsquo;s request in this regard.  It is a fundamental issue for Irish society and time should be made available for a substantive and qualitative debate on the nature of suicide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>My second question concerns the receipt of correspondence from a group called Shell to Sea, which has been critical of the political process and of most politicians in this House.  The group obviously has some political friends, however, because the correspondence, including an invitation to a meeting, arrived in an Oireachtas envelope.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle can have the matter investigated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement that Mrs. M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn will be Ireland&rsquo;s new EU Commissioner, will he invite her here to discuss her new portfolio when it is agreed, and to discuss the new relationship between the European Commission and the European Parliament in the context of the Lisbon Treaty?</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspapers reported that Denmark has done a deal with the United States on the Copenhagen climate change conference.  We were led to believe that the outcome would be a legally-binding agreement, but it will be no such thing.  It appears the Copenhagen event will be a damp squib.  Was the Irish Government a party to that decision?  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, made so much of the issue but was absent from the meeting where the decision apparently was made.  Does he know anything about this?  What is the Government&rsquo;s position concerning this matter?  The EU was supposed to be leading the way on climate change, yet it now seems to have done a sweet-heart deal behind everybody&rsquo;s backs.  At least, one country appears to have done so and it will make it much more difficult to meet any of the Kyoto targets or to build on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not agree with the characterisation the Deputy puts on Denmark&rsquo;s chairmanship of this process.  It has given a huge amount of time, effort and commitment to this area.  Obviously any global deal requires all parties to the proposed treaty to meet the necessary responsibilities.  </P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="762"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>That was supposed to happen in Copenhagen. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent times, only very optimistic people thought a treaty would be signed at Copenhagen.  What is possible &mdash; the Danish chairmanship remains very committed to it &mdash; is obtaining a political framework to enable the detailed legal work to ensue after a global deal is achieved, hopefully at Copenhagen.  It does not do that prospect any justice to suggest that in some way the Danes, in undertaking the onerous task as chair of this process, are in any way resiling from that commitment or effort.  On the contrary, there has been an intensification at EU level to provide leadership in this area.  At its recent meeting, the European Council confirmed that.  In fact, the Commission President and the Swedish Presidency have been working hard in recent weeks &mdash; including trips to India, China and the United States &mdash; to try to ensure that other partners in this process will provide the same commitment to financial aspects of a global deal, as the Europeans have.  I do not think the Deputy is correct in his assessment of the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>

	<P>May I reply?  </P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>Neither do I agree with what the Deputy said about the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who has been keeping closely abreast of this issue on an ongoing basis for obvious reasons, both in terms of his ministerial capacity and his interest in this area over many years.  </P>
        <P>As regards our nominee for the position of Irish European Commissioner-designate, it is open to the House to examine what arrangements it should have to invite representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to attend Oireachtas committees.  Now that we have passed the Lisbon Treaty, it would ensure that people could see what benefits it brings, how we can improve the whole political narrative of Europe and how it interacts with our domestic politics.  That is an issue for this House to consider urgently.  I am favourably disposed to examining the ways we can assist in that matter.  It is not just a question of the Irish nominee.  When the Commission is chosen and approved, it will be a matter for all national parliaments to determine how to have structured dialogue therewith so as to keep up to date and ensure that the Commission will be able to hear national parliamentary perspectives on an ongoing basis.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It refers to the climate change Bill we will be introducing in 2010.  It is now up in the air because, although there is to be a political decision of some description made in Copenhagen, there will be no legally binding deal.  We have only now discovered this.  It is not how it was supposed to be.  I understood from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, that it was not how the Irish Government was approaching the issue.  It was approaching it in the context of there being a legally binding deal.</P>

	<P>Did the Minister have any say in the new arrangements or has he been involved at all?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is mistaken.  At the European Council meeting, it was very clear from all who spoke that it was unlikely that a legally binding deal will be made at Copenhagen given the rate of progress thus far, but that we will seek to establish a political framework that will enable the technical and legal drafting to take place thereafter on the basis of a committed deal by all partners.  If all global partners do not sign up to a deal, it will not happen at Copenhagen and we will have to continue to work on the issue.  It will not go away after the meeting in Copenhagen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Do we have a position on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incorrect for the Deputy to suggest everyone was suggesting at the European Council meeting that there would be a legally binding deal.  That was not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information on the same subject, I appreciate the Taoiseach is indicating there is a setback in the climate change negotiations.  Will he clarify whether he will still be travelling to Copenhagen?  It is very important that whatever effort can be made is made to ensure that we will make real progress rather than have stalemate at the talks in Copenhagen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have indicated our preparedness to travel on the basis of the work that is ongoing and that we hope we will be in a position to pursue a deal at Copenhagen.  Obviously, all Heads of Government are indicating their preparedness to travel on the basis that a deal will be possible.  We must await the outcome of the negotiations.</P>

Given the urgent need to introduce the legislation, will the Taoiseach inform the House whether it is deemed necessary and desirable to introduce it before it is expected to be brought in according to the legislative programme in view of the issues raised by Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business and the comments of various other Members over the past year in particular?</P>

	<P>I am sorry if I appeared to anticipate my opportunity to speak.  On the matter I raised last week, that is, the legislation on new regulatory arrangements and the governance of the Central Bank, it is simply not acceptable or satisfactory that no date for the legislation has been specified.  The excuse used last week was that the Department of Finance has been very busy.  We all know it has been very busy recently.  If it had been busy last year or the preceding year, it would have been much better for the economy.  Will the Taoiseach be able to state next week the year in which the legislation will be published?  We are about to start a debate on the economy and most of the commentary will refer to failures of financial regulation and failures with respect to governance by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  It is absolutely unacceptable that we should be discussing this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Pre-budget Outlook: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Never before has so much information and advice and so many expert reports been published in the run-up to a budget.  The publication of the McCarthy report represented a dramatic new departure in the organisation of our public finances because detailed papers on the Estimates for expenditure and the options facing the Government in this regard were published well in advance of budget day.  Therefore, a major reform of our financial procedures has taken place this year.</P>
        <P>This detailed analysis of our economic position, together with the pre-budget outlook published by my Department last week, has already resulted in an informed, rational debate outside this House about the options facing the country.  I hope a similarly constructive debate will take place here this evening.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the current and prospective economic and budgetary positions.  I look forward to hearing the views of the parties opposite on what needs to be done to put the public finances on the road to recovery.  I am glad both the Fine Gael and Labour parties agree an adjustment of &euro;4 billion to the public finances is necessary for 2010.  I hope we can reach further agreement on how that adjustment should be secured.  What is at stake, after all, is the economic future and well-being of the country.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Before setting out the Government&rsquo;s broad thinking on the public finances, I will outline the short to medium-term prospects.  As everyone in this House will be aware, the past year and a half has seen an unprecedented rate of economic decline.  Gross domestic product will decline this year by approximately 7.5%.  Declining levels of activity have taken a heavy toll in the labour market.  This year, the number in employment will fall by about 165,000, with the construction, retail and manufacturing sectors the worst affected.  The unemployment level has risen significantly, standing now at 12.5%.  This is unacceptably high.  All the Government&rsquo;s efforts are aimed at getting people back to work.  A reasonable degree of agreement has emerged on the short-term outlook.  The current consensus forecast is for a GDP decline of 1.1% next year.  My Department anticipates that growth will return during 2010, but that for the year as a whole the economy will contract by approximately 1.5%.  That represents an improved position since the supplementary budget last April.  The world economy has turned a corner.  It is fair to say that there is light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
      
        <P>While unemployment is anticipated to rise into next year, recent labour market developments suggest that the rate of increase has slowed.  The creation and protection of jobs remains the <Col N="766"/>overriding objective of Government policy.  All aspects of active labour market policies are required to ensure that work rather than unemployment remains the norm.  There are three main pillars to the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy and these were further highlighted in the pre-budget outlook last week.  We are ensuring that we have a properly functioning banking system, capable of meeting the needs of savers and borrowers.  We are taking steps to ensure that our public finances are stabilised and put on a longer-term sustainable path.  We are helping to regain our international competitiveness to be in a position to exploit the global economic recovery and to generate economic growth.  All three of those problems must be addressed, as their resolution is complementary.  If they are addressed we are on the road to addressing the social problems which unemployment causes and putting the economy on the road to recovery.</P>
        <P>A significant amount of time has been spent both within this House and elsewhere discussing what needs to be done to restore the banking system.  Whatever divergence of opinion there is between us, everyone agrees that a fully operational banking system is a cornerstone of a modern economy.  Restoring confidence and repairing this system is a fundamental requirement for economic recovery.  That is why the Government, in the same way as Governments and central banks across the globe, has intervened to provide substantial support to the financial sector and the broad economy in the current crisis.  The Government&rsquo;s priority has been to ensure we have a banking system that can serve the best interests of the economy.  Much work remains to be done, but I firmly believe we are well on the way to a resolution of this most difficult crisis in our financial institutions.</P>
        <P>The deterioration in the economy has exposed weaknesses in our public finances.  We are currently in the untenable position where our tax revenues are now back at 2003 levels while current spending has increased by 70% since then.  Borrowing for day-to-day spending has escalated to unsustainable levels and an Exchequer deficit of &euro;26 billion is projected for this year.  To put that enormous figure into perspective, we must borrow &euro;500 million each week to fund it.  Another way of looking at this annual deficit is to consider it in terms of our national debt.  At end-2008, our national debt stood at approximately &euro;50 billion, next year it is now likely to be approximately &euro;100 billion and without action would continue to spiral out of control.</P>
        <P>All of us in this House who subscribe to the basic tenets of responsible economic management will agree this cannot continue.  Debt service costs are rising rapidly and are absorbing a large and growing share of tax revenue.  We must halt that phenomenon and ensure that it does not become ingrained and inhibit the Government&rsquo;s ability, and that of successive Governments, to provide essential public services.  It is imperative to inspire confidence both internationally and domestically that the deterioration in the public finances is being arrested.</P>
        <P>It is vital to restore balance to Government expenditure and ensure that taxation is at more sustainable levels.  As a number of commentators have remarked, the improvement in the economy in the medium term will not be sufficient to close the budgetary gap.  There is a significant underlying deficit that must be tackled in a targeted manner.  The report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the report of the Commission on Taxation will form the basis for future tax and spending policy.</P>
        <P>That said, our immediate priority is to stabilise the deficit at this year&rsquo;s level, which on a general Government basis is a deficit of 12% of GDP.  To do so requires an adjustment of &euro;4 billion.  Without such savings the deficit would be approximately 14% of GDP.  Between now and budget day, the Government will decide how the necessary savings can be secured.</P>
        <P>Turning to where the adjustments should come from, as I said at the outset, I welcome the views of this House, but it is important to bear in mind some key facts.  Taking account of the <Col N="767"/>significant increases that have been made to personal taxation this year, the marginal tax rate now stands at 52% for PAYE earners and is higher for the self-employed.  We know from our experience in the 1980s that we cannot tax our way out of a recession.  However, who funds the income tax yield tells its own story.  In overall terms 4% of income earners contribute approximately half of the income tax yield.  For 2010, it is estimated that approximately half of income earners will pay no income tax.  While they may have some exposure to the income levy, having 50% of earners out of the tax net is not viable if we want to fund the range of services we expect Government to provide.</P>
        <P>In terms of the other significant taxes &mdash; VAT and excise duties &mdash; our rates are already high by international standards.  There is a significant risk in terms of cross-Border factors of further deterioration in the receipts if substantial increases are imposed in those forms of taxation.  The rate of corporation tax must be seen in terms of international markets and our ongoing ability to foster enterprise and stimulate job creation.  Consequently, given that those four tax areas represent the vast bulk of overall tax revenue, there is limited capacity to raise additional revenue in the forthcoming budget.  Consequently, I have already indicated that the immediate focus will have to be on expenditure reduction measures.</P>
        <P>In terms of expenditure, the overall amount of gross current voted expenditure stands at approximately &euro;56 billion in 2009.  Roughly one third of spending is on social welfare related matters, one third on programme expenditure, including the capital programme, and the final third on public sector pay and pensions.  Therefore, the bulk of the adjustment, which will have to be on day-to-day spending, will have to consider all spending lines.</P>
        <P>Of significance in regard to considering such matters is that we are currently in a period of falling prices.  While a prolonged period of price decline would bring its own problems, the current short-term decline in consumer prices has the effect of supporting real income levels.  In that light, there is some scope to adjust public spending while protecting the living standards of those most in need.  The Government is determined to achieve the necessary savings and in this evening&rsquo;s debate can help inform how the savings will be secured, ahead of next month&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to correcting the public finances has been acknowledged by the European Commission.  In its excessive deficit report, which was published last week, the Commission acknowledged the balanced approach taken and the measures which have been implemented towards reducing the deficit.  The Commission has also proposed a one-year extension to 2014 of the deadline to bring our deficit below the 3% of GDP threshold.  That proposed extension, which will be considered by the Council of Ministers in early December, is to be welcomed.  However, an additional year to correct, while easing somewhat the adjustments required for 2011 and subsequent years, does not change the focus of our need to stabilise our very large deficit now.  If anything, it reinforces the need to continue to take effective action in 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition to restoring the banking system to health and stability and restoring stability to the public finances, the Government has focused on the needs of the wider economy and in particular the promotion of favourable employment conditions.  The pre-budget outlook reiterates the requirement that we reposition our economy on a more sustainable, export-led growth path through regaining our international competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness has deteriorated in recent years.  As a number of agencies such as the National Competitiveness Council have outlined, elements of our costs are higher than that among many of our competitors.  While that has not been helped by some factors beyond our control, such as the appreciation in the value of the euro in recent months, there are measures we can take through domestic policy action to address this issue.</P>
<Col N="768"/>
        <P>In recent years our labour costs moved out of line with productivity developments.  As we refocus our economy on export-led growth, a focus on these crucial input costs will become more important.  Reducing labour costs through some combination of nominal pay reductions and enhanced productivity is an essential part of the strategy to improve competitiveness.  The Government has already taken measures to reduce the public service pay bill through the pension levy and initiatives to reduce the headcount.  I acknowledge the contribution made by public servants in that regard.  The Government has indicated that a further &euro;1.3 billion in savings from the public service pay bill will be required next year and there is engagement with the public service unions on the manner in which that will be done.</P>
        <P>The public sector has already made an important contribution but more is required.  In the private sector jobs are being lost, working hours reduced and there is some evidence of downward adjustment in earnings.  Engagement with the social partners is ongoing and important but Government must ultimately balance all the challenges and issues and present the best way forward through the budget.</P>
        <P>We do have strengths.  For example, our labour force continues to be highly skilled and flexible.  We have made significant investment in education at all levels to ensure we have the skills demanded by our knowledge-intensive economy.  We have greatly enhanced our infrastructure.  Pursuing a responsible, fast and balanced approach to tackling the challenges is what we face and it is at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s approach.</P>
        <P>We are facing tough challenges.  To succeed in dealing with them we must continue to pursue appropriate policies to position the economy to benefit from the global recovery.  The Government is acutely aware that businesses, families and almost everyone in our society are affected by the deterioration in economic conditions.  In the forthcoming budget we will bring forward policies that will ensure that the burden of adjustment is spread as evenly and as fairly as possible.</P>
        <P>A number of challenges face us, and this Government has and will continue to address them all.  We have taken significant action to curbing expenditure and raising additional tax revenue since July 2008 to address the crisis in our public finances.  Our immediate priority is to stabilise the deficit and this we will do in the forthcoming budget.  In this regard our actions have been commended by various outside commentators, internal commentators and the international market reactions have changed in our favour.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The anger among Deputies in this House reflects the anger in the broader public.  We are in a position where the economy has lost 200,000 jobs in the past 12 months, where many young people&rsquo;s futures are blighted, where one third of our young people under the age of 25 are now unemployed, and where 100,000 &mdash; 60% &mdash; of the job losses have hit young people under the age of 25.  We face the prospect of seeing the renewal of emigration, with our brightest and best taken away from these shores.  We are now facing the budget, one of the pivotal decisions to be made in the economic cycle, and the Government has nothing to add to the debate we have heard in the weeks running up to today&rsquo;s debate.  </P>
        <P>It is a reflection on the paucity of ideas on the Government benches that while the Members opposite recognise the need to confront competitiveness and create employment, not one single idea has been offered as to how that might be done.  That is the problem we face.</P>
        <P>The Government would have this debate portrayed as if it was about flushing out the Opposition to come up with &euro;4 billion in cuts.  That is what the Government would like us to have a debate about.  This is the same Government that would also have us believe that it was pursuing sustainable policies until it was swept away by an international tsunami; that the property bubble and the damage it has done to this economy has nothing got to do with it; that the collapse in our competitiveness, much of it generated by public run utilities and publicly regulated activities, has nothing got to do with it; and that the weak performance management in our public services and in our health sector which, despite huge increases in spending, still cannot guarantee care to those most vulnerable when they need it, has nothing got to do with it.  It would also have us believe that the extravagance and the obscene golden handshakes to people who have let us down has nothing to do with it.  That is not the reality.  The Minister was at the centre of a web that created those problems and he has to confront his responsibility if we are to begin to confront the problems we now face.</P>
        <P>It would be doing a huge disservice to those young people if the Government succeeded in reducing this debate to one about how we will find &euro;4 billion in savings.  This is a debate about how we will transform this economy, this society, our politics, the way we run our public utilities, the way we run our public services and the way we generate innovation to offer our young people a future.  It is about a vision of an Ireland that can be competitive again and that can create employment for our young people.</P>
        <P>There is not a shred of evidence that the Government is giving any thought to those areas.  The Government has collapsed this to a sense that this is 15 people around the Cabinet table who are victims of a collapse in public finances, and they are looking to see how they can bale themselves out.  The victims of this crisis are not the 15 people sitting around the Cabinet table.  The victims are the young people who see no prospects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

<Col N="771"/>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>----in a Government that is not offering any vision for the future.  There is not an ounce of vision in this, and that is what we must confront in this debate.</P>
        <P>The bigger question that underlies this is whether the Government has the capacity to lead the transformation.  Does it have the vision, the courage, the determination or even the authority?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Or the bottle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The truth is that the Government has been at the heart of the many problems we must now confront, such as the low performance in public service.  The Minister has been at the heart of decisions such as that on decentralisation, the establishment of the Health Service Executive without reforming the structures, the decision to pay out benchmarking awards without getting reform, and the decision to have strategy statements for which no one would be responsible when they fail.  In the process it has undermined and demoralised a highly committed public service.</P>
        <P>In terms of the Minister leading the public service reform, how much more time does he need?  The Taoiseach was Minister for Finance for four years, or 72 months.  He had the opportunity to reform the public service and he did nothing about it.  How can we now believe that the Minister has been transformed and that he has a vision of a high performance public service, with people rewarded for success and accountable for failure?  We do not see it in his actions, and it is very hard to believe he will do it now.</P>
        <P>How can we believe that the Minister will confront power in the banks when he has been at the heart of the web of cosy relationships that undermined proper scrutiny of the way our banks were being run?  How can we believe that he will confront competitiveness when he has been at the heart of settling with big, powerful public utilities instead of confronting their obligation to perform to the highest international standards to provide utilities that are competitive with the standards in other countries?  People do not believe the Minister can confront those problems because he has not confronted them during the years of inactivity in office.</P>
        <P>The choices we make in this budget can shorten or lengthen the prospects of this recession.  The sort of choices the Minister made last year lengthened it.  He sought &euro;6 billion in extra taxes.  All international evidence tells us that to attempt to focus all the adjustment on the tax side is doomed to failure.  It condemns thriving businesses to ruin.  Whereas by contrast, if the Minister were willing to confront the cost of delivering public service, rationalising the system, delivering value and rooting out waste he would give a positive signal that would create a buzz within the economy.  Yet he took the other route.</P>
        <P>If, as he did in previous budgets, the Minister focuses on cutting front-line entitlements while leaving the bureaucracy intact, that will fail and will lengthen the recession.  If he slashes investment for infrastructure, as he did last year, and it would seem he proposes to commit to another &euro;750 million cut in our investment, that means that the infrastructure we need to build competition for the future is undermined.  This is not the time to cut investment.  This is the time to make room for investment by making our savings elsewhere but the Minister is persisting in taking measures that lengthen rather than shorten the recession.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s banking solution, relying as it does on a huge gamble for the tax payer that has little guarantee it will get credit flowing, is another example of a decision that will prolong the recession.  It will leave us with a legacy of high property prices while not confronting the change that must happen and it fails to confront the professional investors in the banks with the losses they must take.  Instead, the taxpayer is asked to shoulder the burden for the years to come.</P>
<Col N="772"/>
        <P>We must look at this budget as an opportunity to make decisions that will strengthen our ability to recover and that will have employment at its heart.  We propose a cut in employers&rsquo; PRSI, halving the lower rate and cutting the ordinary rate by 2%.  We will fund that by extending the PRSI ceiling and removing the allowances at the bottom.  We will also fund it by a carbon tax and by a windfall tax in respect of energy.  That move, which would reduce employers&rsquo; costs by 2.5%, would create, according to the ESRI predictions, 30,000 jobs over time.  That is the way to go.  We must give every employer who is now struggling against an overvalued currency and excessive costs in services, many of them created and run by the Government, a break.</P>
        <P>We have been around the country, visiting five cities, and we are heading to Athlone next week and that is the cry that is coming out.  Businesses are hanging on by their fingernails, finding it impossible to get credit and finding the costs too difficult to sustain.  They need relief and we must give them it in this budget.</P>
        <P>With proper reform we can attract private sector investment to invest in electricity, telecommunications, water, energy saving and forestry infrastructure that we need for the future.  We can attract private investment into those areas if we are willing to run them on a strictly commercial basis, if we are willing to put equity into them and if we are willing to raise a national recovery bond and money from pension funds that are crying out for an opportunity.</P>
        <P>We can come up with extra investment strategies instead of solely relying on the Exchequer&rsquo;s public capital programme.  We could attract &euro;11 billion into investment that will be there for the long-term and that will make us the envy of other countries, with high speed broadband, a smart electricity grid and a water system that does not see 40% of the water flushed down the drain in leakage.  We must use this opportunity to create that infrastructure for growth for the future and that is what this budget must be about.</P>
        <P>Of course I recognise, as everyone recognises, that in doing these things we face a financial constraint.  I accept that &euro;4 billion must be found this year.  I also accept that we must find &euro;1.3 billion savings on the public service pay bill.  I accept that we cannot leave even the social welfare bill immune, although we must seek to protect as many as possible.  We must accept large swathes of the McCarthy report, particularly those aspects that emphasise rationalising agencies and reducing the administrative burden we are carrying that is not delivering at the frontline.  We will set out our budget as an alternative, as to how we will square the books.</P>
        <P>Let us not, however, pretend that this debate is about finding cuts of &euro;4 billion or raising taxes.  It is about our being willing to confront those changes, particularly the way we fund our public services.  The Minister came into this House and pretended the McCarthy report would transform the way we do business.  That is not the case.  Look at the Estimate volume in front of the Minister.  We are presenting existing levels of service as if what was done last year has some sacrosanct right to remain in existence.  There is no right during this crisis for any agency to expect the money it got last year.  Agencies must be made to bid for their money on the basis of the performance they will deliver.  They must be accountable for the performance they deliver.  When they say they will deliver something, they must do so or be held accountable for the consequences.  They must be given the tools, as managers, to make decisions, to change the way they spend their money.</P>
        <P>We would be further on if we knew from the Government how it intends to move people from one agency to another.  There is still no system for that.  We would be moving on if we knew what we were going to do when an agency is rationalised and some people are no longer needed.  What system would there be to redeploy them or to pay them off if they must be let go?  We do not have that from the Minister.</P>
<Col N="773"/>
        <P>It would be an interesting if the Government said how it would manage change, how it would go about closing agencies that are no longer performing, how it would move people from areas that are wasteful.  We are told there are 6,000 wasteful administrative posts in the HSE.  How will we move them to frontline services that need support?</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste tells us that many of the proposals in the McCarthy report are rubbish.  We would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s analysis of which ones are rubbish and his analysis of the impact of the different changes that have been allocated by the report on public service delivery.  Then we could have a real engagement.  This, however, is the usual dialogue of the deaf the Minister and his predecessor have gone on with, thinking they can come into the D&aacute;il with a list of numbers while offering no performance as to what those numbers will deliver next year if we agree to them.  That is rubbish.</P>
        <P>The Minister must insist the agencies and the spending Departments say what they will do with their budgets.  We want to see those managers report quarterly on their performance against those targets.  If we were ushering that system as part of our response to this crisis, there would be some sense of hope that at last a Government is willing to hold management accountable while being accountable itself, with Ministers held accountable for what they deliver.</P>
        <P>We have not seen that.  Time and again the Government offers a strategy and when it fails, no one turns up.  They are all there for the glossy launch, when there is a press conference and a beautiful slide presentation, but there is no one there when nothing is delivered at the end, when there is no primary care system, as was promised eight years ago, when there is no impact on climate change, as was promised eight years ago.  No one is there to own up for the responsibility, although I take my hat off to my former county colleague, at least he admitted the Government had failed in respect of its climate strategy.  That is at least a recognition that someone in Government has an inkling of what it is to deliver professional standards.</P>
        <P>Yes, we are facing into a tough budget but we must hold out the prospect for the young people who are feeling the impact.  We make no apology for saying we cannot touch child benefit.  We cannot touch it because both the boom and the bust have hit young families hardest.  The explosion in house prices was a direct transfer from young people trying to get on to the housing ladder to older people, who saw the benefits of selling homes.  Young people are the ones who are suffering negative equity, bearing the major burdens.</P>
        <P>Those young people are the first hit when companies are in trouble.  We must defend those people and protect them as best we can.  Child benefit is one recognition that young families must be supported.  Every other country in the world tries to provide support to those bringing up the next generation and we must be no different.</P>
        <P>This is an opportunity.  Rarely is there a crisis in which there is a willingness on the part of everyone to contribute but we must have a vision people can support but that vision is not coming.  It is not there in the sad script delivered from a word processor in the Department of Finance.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach wants the Opposition parties to reveal their hands long before he reveals his own.  It is like asking Giovanni Trapattoni to show his tactical notes to his French counterpart a full 24 hours before the game starts in Paris.  All I can say to the Taoiseach is to dream on.</P>
        <P>The pre-budget outlook is a dishonest and deceitful document.  What credence can citizens give to a document that purports to set out income and expenditure for the coming year but that does not provide a clue as to the ongoing cost of the banks to the Exchequer for 2010? <Col N="774"/> There was no provision in the April budget for Anglo Irish Bank but the Minister borrowed &euro;3.8 billion to hand it over, a decision that grossly inflated the Exchequer deficit for the year.</P>
        <P>Without a clear statement on the provision for banks in 2010, how can we honestly debate how many billions we can afford for health, welfare and pay?  Anglo Irish Bank is a clear and present danger to our national solvency and if more billions are to be thrown into the Anglo incinerator, we are entitled to be aware of that on budget day.  We heard at the weekend that it is looking for &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion more.  The Minister&rsquo;s failure to make any indication of his attitude as regards further billions for the Anglo Irish Bank bonfire is an act of gross deception.  He said all along that the bank bailout would cost us nothing but my God, was he wrong.</P>
        <P>Now the Minister wants to hide the true cost we had to pay in 2009 and to maintain that pretence by leaving it out of the budget arithmetic and the national accounts for 2010.  The deficit for 2009 will be &euro;26 billion, but nearly &euro;3.8 billion of this is down to Anglo Irish Bank.</P>

	<P>Coincidentally, this is almost the same figure as the Minister&rsquo;s targeted budget correction for next year. </P>
        <P>The Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il want us to believe that the budget deficit and the bank bailout are entirely unconnected.  However, the inconvenient truth is that if it was not for the &euro;3.8 billion allocation to Anglo Irish Bank the deficit would have been far closer to the April target and we might be beginning to see some progress and stabilisation.  To escape from the NAMA hangover, I have been reading the memoirs of Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>

	<P>One might say I am a glutton for punishment after too many late nights in this august Chamber.  What lessons has the peace process for us as we attempt to deal with our economic woes?  Two features stand out for me.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and we all jump together.  Both are of vital importance now.  The main gripe people had earlier this year was the sheer unfairness of the cuts and the belief that some sections of society were exempt. </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach tells us, &ldquo;We are all in this together&rdquo;.  It is far from clear that &ldquo;we&rdquo; really means what is says on the tin, namely, that everyone has to make a contribution and be seen to do so in a balanced way.  Justice has to be done and has to be seen to be done.  The Labour Party accepts a deficit reduction target of &euro;4 billion as long as the actual measures do not cause even further contraction in the economy.  I say this to the Minister as the author of the half point increase in VAT that sent people in their tens of thousands across the Border.</P>
        <P>Leaving party politics aside, there is both an ethical and economic dimension to this.  On the ethical side, it is about fairness.  On the economic side, it is a question of minimising the deflationary impact of the budget.  I am deeply worried about the deflationary impact of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.  It seems the principal target of the cuts will be the low paid, social welfare and health.  The impact of cuts on the spending power of the least well off will be far more deflationary than, for instance, effecting &euro;1bilion in savings through closing property tax shelters and other tax loopholes principally availed of by the super-rich.  It is a truth universally acknowledged that somebody who is rich and who gives up a little share will continue to spend whereas if the income of a poor person is cut, this will have a much greater deflationary effect.  We want to cut the deficit percentage.  Spending cuts are part of the mix but cannot be the sole component of the budget day package.</P>
<Col N="775"/>
        <P>The Minister never tires of repeating his &ldquo;Apocalypse Now&rdquo; scenario, although he never acknowledges his own and his party&rsquo;s complicity in creating this situation.  How often we hear the refrain, &ldquo;We are where we are&rdquo;.  No, we are where the Minister, his leader and his party have brought us.  Those who feathered their nests as a result of this Government&rsquo;s actions and policies cannot be allowed to withdraw to the sidelines while everyone else picks up the pieces.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keefe has boasted that in 2007 Ireland had 33,000 millionaires.  Now those millions are well and truly hidden from public gaze and we are repeatedly told that the poor souls have taken such a hit that they cannot cough up anything extra.  How different it is elsewhere.  I read that in Germany there are moves afoot among the wealthiest to put together a national recovery fund, rather like ICTU has suggested, with as much as &euro;100 billion to assist that country&rsquo;s efforts.  Now that is wartime psychology, with everyone pulling together to protect the country they love.  In the USA, billionaires campaign for additional taxation on wealth to demonstrate social solidarity during the emergency.  Have I heard a single squeak from our home grown millionaires to echo that call?  All I hear are special pleas to the effect that no pot of gold exists.  Ansbacher Man has gone into retirement but his sons and daughters have inherited the same mindset.  When things get tough, the tough pack up and run.  Deputy Bertie Ahern let the cat out of the bag recently as he feted his good friend Mr. FitzPatrick of Anglo Irish Bank fame.  He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Seanie has a bit stashed away&rdquo;.  I am sure he has, and so have many like him.</P>
        <P>We have the Revenue accounts which tell us, in a study published in the summer, that the effective rate of taxation for many in the top echelon, people with incomes of &euro;2 million annually, was between 9% and 20%, after the measures the Labour Party had advocated were finally introduced.  Millionaires they might have been, even billionaires, but Fianna F&aacute;il in Government faithfully served their interests and tweaked the tax code in a thousand ways to accommodate them and release them from the obligation to contribute their fair share.</P>
        <P>Are they still free of that obligation in the Minister&rsquo;s mindset, or do these people have to jump together with the rest of us?  I can say without equivocation that my party will face the obligation to meet the deficit target.  In our last spell in Government we produced, with Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn as Minister for Finance, the first balanced budget in a generation, so we have form on this and we have total commitment to financial stability.  We will agree nothing, however, until everything is agreed and that &ldquo;everything&rdquo; has to be a balanced mix that can command the confidence of the whole of society.</P>
        <P>Do not ask me whether I agree with this cut or that.  I agree to nothing unless it is part of a fair mix.  I will agree to a great deal, if it is. If the Minister bites the bullet, or the garlic, on fair taxes at the top, I will bite some others.</P>
        <P>The Minister has spoken of wartime.  Can there be tax exiles in a wartime economy?  If one lives and does business here, then one should pay one&rsquo;s share, no ifs, no buts, no special pleas.  Our tax system is enormously unbalanced and part of the challenge of restoring us to a stable, fair and prosperous society involves rebalancing it.  All should read Dr Peter Bacon&rsquo;s account this week of the hotel sector and the destruction of so many viable and important family hotels and chains because of irresponsible tax breaks which, in his words, have made a whole sector insolvent.  If we are to jump together then tax reform and tax justice is a core part of the equation.  I am not a supporter of high marginal rates and never have been.  The high marginal rates of yesteryear are a nightmare scenario.  Low tax rates, however, must run in tandem with the principle that everyone pays his or her share.  There are people in this country who talk of low taxes when they really mean, &ldquo;No taxes&rdquo;, for themselves and their clients.  That has to end now.</P>
<Col N="776"/>
        <P>The McCarthy report was published on 16 July.  In each chapter there are suggestions about agencies, administrative cuts and savings which individually are of no great consequence but collectively add up to a great deal.</P>
        <P>Some were so obvious that I am amazed there were no announcements to implement them on 17 July.  Why this procrastination?  Did Ministers get cold feet about their own sections?  Did the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, refuse point blank to walk the plank as suggested?  How could the Minister have sanctioned a large advertisement in this weekend&rsquo;s newspapers for a new Secretary General of a Department that may be abolished?  Does joined-up government exist at all?  While there are big spending Departments, there also are ten other Departments in which efficiencies could deliver a good slice of savings that could amount to as much as &euro;500 million in total.</P>
        <P>Curiously, the Minister has balked at publishing the report on higher pay grades in the public sector.  Some of these salary levels have grown excessively in recent years and are no longer justified.  If the private sector wishes to take some of those concerned and to pay them more, let it do so.  This is the reason the Labour Party advocates a cap that would apply to the Taoiseach, the President, Ministers and senior grades in the public service generally.  The combined savings would be worth the effort in itself.  No less important is the signal it would send that the Government means business.  Percentage cuts of 10% here or 5% there are not the way to go at the top whereas a cap is a serious indicator of intention.  One should see where one gets with this suggestion as a start and could work down the scale thereafter.  It is impossible to ask for cuts in pay generally unless it is accepted that those at the top must show serious intent in reducing salary levels that have been allowed to drift up through the tyranny of percentage increases that gave most to those already at the highest levels.</P>
        <P>Scientists use an especially strong conditional expression called IFF, meaning &ldquo;if and only if&rdquo;.  The Labour Party is willing to support the &euro;4 billion budget target on four conditions: first, if, and only if, the burden of sacrifices is shared and seen to be shared by measures that require a major contribution from those who own the lion&rsquo;s share of our nation&rsquo;s wealth; second, if, and only if, salary reductions oblige those on the highest incomes to sacrifice most and those on the lowest are protected; third, if, and only if, the spending cuts are spread across the board in each Department and are focused on the elimination of duplication and other sources of waste and inefficiency; and  fourth, if, and only if, there is compelling evidence of deep cuts in the cost of maintaining this bloated Government with all the perks and luxuries accumulated for far too long.</P>
        <P>Three weeks remain before budget day.  In those three weeks, Ministers have an opportunity to build a sense of national unity that would help us to deal with the crisis.  At present, only some are in the firing line to make sacrifices while others, who can easily afford to take a hit, are assured that their pot of gold is safe.  This is no way to build a national spirit.  The young people who now constitute 20% of those on the unemployment register are being offered &euro;204 per week, which may be reduced, to go on the dole instead of the Ministers opposite using their imagination to release that creativity, education and fantastic skill about which the managing director of Microsoft spoke so eloquently in Dublin at the weekend.  He spoke of the need for optimism with a small &ldquo;o&rdquo;.  To get people on-side and to release their creative energies, the Minister must build a consensus around fairness and justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to put forward the Sinn F&eacute;in proposals to the Minister.  He has stated repeatedly that he does not want to take the measures his Government is about to take, namely, cutting dole, pensions, child benefit and front line services.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposals would raise sufficient funds for him to avoid being obliged to <Col N="777"/>introduce any of those measures and we hope he is willing to adopt them.  If he does not seek actual proposals but is looking to Sinn F&eacute;in to provide political cover to further impoverish the most vulnerable in society, he will be left wanting.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has examined a series of proposals that will contribute both to bringing borrowing under control in the short term and to raising money for a stimulus package that will address the deficit in the long term.  The Government has failed abysmally to recognise the necessity of dynamic stimulus measures to kick-start the economy.  Sinn F&eacute;in also challenges the other Opposition parties to support these proposals.  Our proposals are fair and some are radical.  However, radical measures must be taken with a &euro;22 billion deficit.  The Government has shown that it is not willing to leave anything off the table except taxing the wealthy.  Its proposal to charge medical cardholders for prescriptions shows the moral cowardice of its approach.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not afraid to take on the big earners and the vested interests.  The Government would rather take from children and grannies than from its wealthy friends.</P>
        <P>Before I outline my party&rsquo;s proposals, which I launched yesterday, I wish to consider briefly the coalition&rsquo;s own pre-budget outlook.  The Government has claimed it is capable of running this State&rsquo;s economy, which is a dubious assertion considering the hames they have made of affairs to date.  It has once again set out its plan for recovery in this pre-budget outlook, which is breathtaking in its assumption of correctness despite all the previous misguided and downright wrong forecasts from the Department of Finance.  The aforementioned document almost is laughable in its poor analysis of the current crisis and the solutions it offers to us.</P>
        <P>First, I note that a heading on page 4 of the pre-budget outlook states &ldquo;Repairing our banking system &mdash; a separate issue to the fiscal challenge&rdquo;.  I will credit the Minister for having done a magnificent job of separating the banking issue and his biggest brainchild, NAMA, from the fiscal issue.  The special purpose vehicle set up for NAMA to keep the &euro;54 billion the State will be obliged to borrow off the books is one of the greatest con jobs I have ever witnessed.  The mantra from Ministers that this State cannot continue to borrow in the region of &euro;500 million a week when, in one year, NAMA could end up costing the state &euro;1 billion a week is one hell of a sleight of hand.  Repeating the myth that the problems caused by the banking system are separate from the public finances does not make it true.  Moreover, people will see it is not true when faced with a huge debt service obligation because money was borrowed to keep bank executives, shareholders and developers happy and not for public services such as hospitals and schools.</P>
        <P>The next page of the Government&rsquo;s pre-budget document sets out five reasons it is necessary to take those crucial actions planned by the Cabinet and I propose to deal briefly with them.  The first is &ldquo;to restore economic competitiveness, without which we will be unable to benefit from the global upswing&rdquo;.  This is the global upswing for which the Government is hoping and praying, like the rising tide, in the hope it will lift all boats.  Unfortunately, the Government appears to think restoring economic competitiveness can only be achieved by slashing wages and public spending and does not contemplate our serious lack of infrastructure.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s pre-budget submission focuses on using this period of recession to invest in that infrastructure, thereby both readying the State for a return to competitiveness and stimulating the jobs market and hence the revenue stream.</P>
        <P>The second reason is &ldquo;to inspire confidence, internationally and domestically, that the deterioration in the public finances is being arrested&rdquo;.  Were I an international investor, last May I would have heard the Government promise that, by the end of this year, Ireland would have a deficit of just &euro;19 billion, which it would be reducing by &euro;4 billion in this budget.  It now is known that the deficit will be in the region of &euro;22 billion but the &euro;4 billion adjustment is still the Government&rsquo;s figure.  We will be cutting spending to almost a stand still, which hardly is <Col N="778"/>confidence inspiring.  My party&rsquo;s proposals include a stimulus which will raise revenue so the cycle of cutting and deficit contraction can be ended.</P>
        <P>The third reason is a gem.  It is &ldquo;to prevent the debt level rising to unsustainable levels so that the cost of servicing that debt is contained&rdquo;.  My reply to that in a single word is NAMA.  The fourth reason is &ldquo;to assist economic growth by taking responsible action on fiscal and incomes policies, which will avoid unnecessary further adjustment in the labour market&rdquo;.  This is interesting.  Does the Government have an income policy?  Can the Government tell us how this policy applies to Brendan Drumm, or to the Taoiseach?  Or does the income policy apply only to people with average and low incomes?  Is this necessary to avoid unnecessary further adjustment?  Is this a promise from the Minister?  Are we to believe that after he has slashed social welfare, pensions and child benefit, put a charge on medical cards and cut the pay of people on &euro;30,000 or less per annum, that he will not do anything else and that there will be no further cuts after this budget?  My party would protect those on low and middle incomes and bring fairness to the top of the income scale, particularly in the public sector.</P>
        <P>The fifth point is &ldquo;To restore expenditure and taxation to more sustainable levels.&rdquo;  I thought taxation was completely off this Government&rsquo;s agenda.  I bet the Minister is wondering how that dirty little &ldquo;T&rdquo; word crept in there.  Our pre-budget proposals make a start towards fairness, but there is much more to do.</P>
        <P>These are the Minister&rsquo;s reasons for his proposed fiscal adjustment and I question the motivation behind each and every one of them.  I question everything this Government says because it has lied to us time and time again.  It has been wrong time and time again.  Not one financial measure introduced over the past 12 months has brought us closer to economic recovery.  They have driven us further into recession.  In the October budget it increased VAT, despite the State&rsquo;s being already over-dependent on consumption taxes, which the Minister acknowledged this evening, so contributing to the collapse in those taxes.  In January it took money out of the pockets of low and middle income earners, lowering their disposable income.  In April it doubled levies, bringing some of the lowest paid into the tax net and cancelled Christmas for people on the brink of poverty.  The Government has taken from the economy where it makes no sense to take, the bottom and the middle.  It has left the top relatively untouched, yet it claims there is no more room for taxation.</P>
        <P>Our way of dealing with the social welfare bill is to create jobs, to reduce the live register figure of 422,500.  Our total stimulus package of &euro;4 billion must be paid for and to this end we examined the taxation system and genuine waste in the public sector.  In total, combined with a transfer from the National Pension Reserve Fund of &euro;2 billion, which is &euro;2 billion less than the Government is giving to the zombie Anglo Irish Bank, we have raised &euro;7.6 billion in our pre-budget submission.</P>
        <P>Our proposals are radical and brave.  We challenge the Government&rsquo;s assertion in its document that expenditure cuts are more effective than raising taxation measures to close a deficit, an assertion backed up by the disreputable IMF and that bastion of democracy, the EU Commission.  The right will always seek and find other creatures within its ranks to back up its biased view of the world and the Government has done that well this year.  Expenditure cuts in this budget will not bring about recovery.  They will bring about poverty, irreversible damage and more cuts next year, and the year after, until the Government breaks its cycle of slash and burn economics.</P>
        <P>The deficit is a result of our economic woes, not the cause of them and only a stimulus package for the economy will create the momentum for recovery that will ultimately bring the deficit under control.  To pay for that stimulus and to bring much-needed funds into the State&rsquo;s <Col N="779"/>coffers, the only option available to this Government is to raise money from those who can afford it.  A 48% tax rate on income in excess of &euro;100,000 raises &euro;355 million.  A 1% wealth tax on assets, excluding farmland, of more than &euro;1 million, could bring in &euro;1.6 billion.  Standardising discretionary tax reliefs raises &euro;1.1 billion.  Capping public sector pay at &euro;100,000 brings in &euro;450 million.  These are just a few of the many proposals we put forward yesterday.  In total they help us to pay for a stimulus worth &euro;4 billion that invests in a &euro;2 billion labour intensive infrastructure package; that provides for a &euro;600 million jobs retention fund; that cuts excise duty for the Christmas period and returns the Christmas social welfare bonus.  These are all business and household friendly measures that will not only boost confidence in the economy but start bringing in the revenue needed for recovery.</P>
        <P>This is not rocket science.  It will not be popular for those used to being protected from Government measures except when they have a positive money-raising effect.  It will, however, be a damn sight more popular with most on this island who fall into the not so well-off category.  More important, it will put the country on the road to recovery.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke last October about patriotism and how it is necessary in these times.  He asked for patriotism from the lowest paid, those who could least afford to contribute.  I ask the Minister to show patriotism.  This is a great land.  We are a great people.  We are masters at triumphing over adversity and punching well above our weight.  We can achieve success again, but it must be a fairer success this time, not one that benefits the few but that benefits the many.  To get there, the start must be fair.  What the Minister plans for December is not fair and it is not just.  Our proposals are both and we urge the Minister to take them on board at this critical time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate, albeit for just ten minutes.  The Minister for Finance has set out as per the pre-budget outlook the basic parameters within which we must operate.  The narrative being suggested here is that nothing has been happening since this Administration took over which is at variance with the facts.  We have taken corrective measures.  In respect of taxation and the fiscal consolidation the tax changes in the two budgets that the Minister for Finance has introduced have been progressive, seeking to reduce the impact on those with low incomes and to ensure that those on high incomes pay and contribute more.  That is precisely what has been done in the progressive nature of the tax changes which, in addition to the expenditure savings, were taken as a first part step in the approach to stabilise our public finances.</P>
        <P>We do not need to engage in a long introductory debate on what this economy has had to contend with in the reduction in international trade, the collapse of the financial markets, the adverse impact of currency exchange rate on our competitiveness and the pressure that has placed on exports.  In response to what Deputies have said about taxes, the marginal tax rate on the average industrial wage increased from 26% to 30% as a result of changes made in 2009.  The marginal rate for those on twice the average wage increased from 43% to 51%.  The marginal rate on earnings over &euro;175,000 increased from 43.5% to 52%.  That has brought about a progressive change in respect of who is making the contribution on the tax side.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to suggest that the Government has been indifferent to that matter or that it is not interested in fairness on that issue.  Quite the contrary is the case.  We must also accept that the economic model that we built up over time brought employment to almost 2 million people at the height of our prosperity, when we were at a different stage in the economic cycle before the financial and economic market collapse.  We had a competitive marginal tax rate which helped in maintaining employment and an external investment policy that brought in many world leading companies in new growth industries and sectors.</P>
<Col N="780"/>
        <P>We must be mindful in the debate on taxation that we do not, at a time of contraction in the economy, seek to burden a labour market which has already experienced job losses of 165,000 or 170,000 in the past year.  Thankfully the level of unemployment has not bottomed out to the level anticipated last March but we face a rise in unemployment next year because growth will return in the second half of the year if we take the action required now.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are aspects of the deficit that will recede as a result of growth, buoyancy and increased revenues if we take the right corrective action in a timely fashion.  The most benign interpretation of the structural element of the deficit from the ESRI and others is &euro;10 billion, while other more pessimistic outlooks put it at &euro;15 billion to &euro;16 billion.  The &euro;4 billion in cuts to be undertaken in this budget will start to make an important impact on the overall structural deficit which will not be eliminated regardless of the growth that will return to the economy.  It is also true that the tax revenues that come from export-led growth will be less than the domestic driven growth we have seen in the past.</P>
        <P>We neither have the time for or people interested in a history lesson.  However, the narrative that comes from the other side of the House is about profligate Government spending.  When one checks the record, at a time when there were still budget surpluses, the critique from the Opposition was that Ministers were too mean.  Ebenezer Scrooge was one name ascribed to me by Fine Gael Members during the budgets I brought before the House.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach should check Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s budget day speeches.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When they talk about the need to avoid a bubble, we all know their policies meant exactly that in the last election.</P>
        <P>The important point is about correcting our public finances.  It is also about regaining competitiveness in our economy and maintaining and creating jobs.  The Government will examine all areas whether it be the tourism sector or the construction sector particularly after the serious job losses with the collapse of the domestic housing construction in the past 18 months.</P>
        <P>Perhaps Deputy Bruton will clarify his suggestion that there should be no cuts in capital investment.  He believes this must be maintained at present levels which means greater cuts would have to be found on the current expenditure side.  This would have a serious impact on day-to-day service provision.</P>
        <P>Tender prices are down by 30%.  The Government is interested in maintaining the same level of output in capital but ensuring we use the more competitive tendering process now available.  The depression in the market place will help get better value and outcomes.  This is enabling us to get far more done with less money with the schools, roads and public transport we intend to build.  It is important to point this out as there was a critique coming from the Opposition that the Government was not achieving in a range of areas.</P>
        <P>The three big spending areas are health, education and social welfare.  I agree there is need for further reform of the HSE.  It must be acknowledged, however, there have been significant improvements in basic measurement of health staff performance and benchmarking it against best international practice.  We are seeing real improvements in output and productivity growth as a result of having better management systems in place.</P>
        <P>There has also been development in primary care services.  I accept we have not yet reached the target of 530 primary care teams but by the end of 2011 they will be in place.  It is by diverting activity from hospital services into properly resourced primary care that we will see an improvement in health service delivery.  There has also been increased productivity in hospital services.  With 1,000 fewer beds there have been lower waiting times for elective sur<Col N="781"/>gery.  There has been improvement in the management of patient care in our hospital system with greater throughput and efficiencies.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that there is absence of vision on the part of the Government about where it wants to bring the economy.  The smart economy framework sets out the platform for the areas of growth that we can identify.  It is not about people in white coats in laboratories but about increasing productivity across all sectors of the economy.  It is only by improved productivity that we will regain economic growth and competitiveness.  By examining our labour and other rates we can see how we can get more productivity out of this economy in both the private and public sectors.</P>
        <P>It is important that public sector reform needs is accelerated.  This crisis provides us with an opportunity to do this, I hope by agreement.  There are many tens of thousands in the public service who are dedicated to their jobs but who want to move away in some sectors from the crisis management mode to more redeployment, flexibility and opening up of organisational boundaries.  There is an appetite for this and it can be done, particularly in the health sector.</P>
        <P>However, it involves a rate of change from getting way from the nature of the health debates held in the House recently.  There is a need to redeploy and reconfigure to move hospital services to centres of excellence.  I accept parochial and local pressures have been brought to bear in this area.  However, we must be prepared to recognise reform involves discipline and preparedness to move the existing configuration of services to ensure they are more cost effective.</P>
        <P>There has been unprecedented investment in education.  Even in the more difficult times of today, there is still a commitment to continue with schools refurbishment and ICT investment.  It has also not just meant investment in teacher training and providing computers in classrooms but ensuring broadband infrastructure for schools and the bandwidth to enable it to be used as a real e-learning tool.  The vision remains to modernise our education system at primary and post-primary level.</P>
        <P>We need more collaborative projects in third level education.  The problem which has bedevilled the health system, that institutions are stand-alone operations rather than a wider network of universities and institutes of technology, must be overcome.  There are also opportunities in the internationalisation of education services with bringing more income and people to the country.  It is important to recognise education as playing a role in economic policy and as an economic tool.</P>
        <P>All of this investment and commitment in upskilling and preparing our people to adapt to new technologies to take up new opportunities can only happen if we face up to the short-term reality &mdash; we are spending far more than we are taking in.  This is not a sustainable position and we must proceed with the budgetary adjustments.  The Minister for Finance recognises, as does everyone who supports the Government, that it is open to Members opposite if they wish to put forward their constructive contribution to the debate.  There is at least consensus in the House that this level of adjustment is necessary.  All parties will have to recognise that there is no unanimity on what is fair when it comes to these cuts.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il is very proud of what it has been able to achieve for those on fixed incomes during the recent period of prosperity.  When inflation was approximately 12%, increases were made to the old age pension of more than 50% and the basic unemployment rate of 37%.  We are conscious of the need to calibrate how we deal with that issue, knowing it cannot be avoided.  The present level of investment in the social welfare area cannot be sustained in view of what taxpayers are in a position to contribute.  We will approach that with the care and consideration that would be expected of parties in Government who have as much social concern in this area as any other party in this House.</P>
<Col N="782"/>
        <P>The social welfare area amounts to one third of expenditure, as the Minister for Finance pointed out.  The public pay and pension area must make its contribution, no matter what people think about it and we seek agreement on that issue.  The programme area of expenditure also must make its contribution.  These three areas must all contribute to the adjustments to be made.  Despite what Deputies Burton and Bruton have said, the Government will take on that responsibility as carefully as it can.  It will do so on the basis that all of us are interested in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and ensuring job creation.  Unless these corrective measures are taken, economic recovery will not occur quickly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened carefully to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks and I have read the speech of the Minister for Finance.  The Taoiseach is somewhat realistic in his observations this evening.  The problem&rsquo;s affecting this country are beyond any one person and cannot and will not be addressed without coherence, cohesion and a deal of courage.  It will need a very clear and decisive agenda.  The Taoiseach said he does not wish long contributions about the context in which we are having this debate and that is an important statement.  For this to happen we could all go on political rants about how we got to this position.  We remember very clearly the statements from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that 98% of taxpayers would be better off under Fianna F&aacute;il and that they were the only party that could look after the economy.</P>
        <P>The speech written by the Minister for Finance does not contain anything new.  The sad fact is the people who put this together, the senior civil servants, will be out on strike next week, if that is what they voted for.  There is nothing new in his speech, nothing we have not heard in the past couple of months.</P>
        <P>This debate is only a veneer.  It was stated that the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, was going to challenge everybody to present budgetary details this evening and yet there is nothing new in what we have heard from Government.  I would make the analogy that when the good ship <i>Economy Ireland</i> last pulled out of a port after a change of crew from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, it was well equipped, well stocked and was well balanced, on an even keel.  Unfortunately its destinations with the next two crews provided me with an observation that people on that ship would be better off as pirates of the Caribbean.  The treasure of Ireland has been looted by those who were permitted to do so.  The Minister for Finance is correct when he says there is light at the end of the tunnel and that the world has turned a corner, yet people are in prison in other countries and we are still just beginning to talk about things here in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to make a political rant.  The Fine Gael Party accepts the principles of the figure of &euro;4 billion as being a necessary adjustment.  Between the Lisbon treaty referendum and now, I have been to practically every county in the country.  I say to the Minister for Finance there are so many fine people who are thinking ahead, who want to develop new products, who want to be able to market their products, who are paying wages and salaries every week, who feel crucified by the way the State does not appear to have an agenda and a clear view of the horizon as to where we will be in three years&rsquo; time.  These people want to contribute and their workers also want to contribute.</P>
        <P>I recently visited an unemployment exchange.  The Minister should consider the potential in any of those queues, which include graphic designers, engineers, young architects, teachers, young farmers and others.  The Minister will know of the potential in this country that is doing nothing.  We want to harness that potential.</P>
        <P>In many ways this time of crisis presents a great opportunity to sort out things that have gone wrong for so many years.  The Minister refers to the courage to sort things out.  What was the Government doing in the last number of years when it was getting very clear advice in this <Col N="783"/>House on a whole range of areas?  The advice on the economy and policy in many cases came from my party and from the man beside me, Deputy Richard Bruton.  It is now six years since I said if the Government was paying benchmarking at &euro;1 billion a year, it should be sure to get efficiencies in return.  This advice was laughed at, yet it is now costing &euro;2 billion and it has not worked.  I refer to the public servant who walked into my office in the past fortnight and said he wanted to get out because there were five of them in his office with nothing to do.  That is not the way we want to be.</P>
        <P>If we are going to make these adjustments I advise the Minister to seriously consider what Fine Gael announced this evening, a cut in PRSI which will affect 100,000 businesses and which will create a palpable ease for employers.  We have demonstrated how this can be funded.  If the Minister is looking for constructive suggestions, we will give him plenty of them and we will publish our budget strategy before the budget date of 9 December, just as we did last year.  We will set out our views on how the strategy can be achieved.  We will retain the strong capital programme and make a bigger adjustment at the other end.  We will demonstrate what we believe is the way to get the country moving and kick-start job creation again.</P>
        <P>At meetings in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and next Thursday in Athlone, people who write cheques, who pay wages, who are thinking about their employees, who want to keep their businesses open, are saying to the Fine Gael Party to give them a break.  They are saying they need some assistance.  They say if we want workers to be kept employed, if we want families to be able to pay their mortgages and their taxes and to contribute to the economy, then they insist we give them the opportunity.  They are willing to respond to decisive Government but that is not what has been there.</P>
        <P>In response to such an announcement this evening, 100,000 businesses will react very positively.  It will affect 1.7 million workers across the country to their benefit and ease a restriction and obstacle to business.  This is the kind of thinking that Government should implement in order to get people back to work, shorten the dole queues and move us forward.  If we decide to focus solely on expenditure cuts of &euro;4 billion, which everybody accepts in principle, that will not create a single job.  We will be stuck next year with another &euro;4 billion and another &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion the year after and never get out of the current mess.  We have been led onto the rocks.</P>
        <P>It is about having a broader agenda.  I agree we must deal with the fiscal challenge and the adjustments that have to be made in social welfare and in public pay and current spending.  We will give our views on those policies.  However, the Minister must go beyond that agenda and look at the broader methods for restoring abroad our financial credibility, integrity and reputation.  We must increase our competitiveness, cut Government costs and go back to where we were, proud and strong internationally so that people will regard Ireland as a place of quality and high productivity.  These qualities are still there in many Irish firms but our competitiveness rating has slipped significantly.</P>
        <P>Last June, before the D&aacute;il summer recess, I explained Fine Gael&rsquo;s programme for a national economic recovery authority to be set up under the Department of the Taoiseach, which would leverage &euro;11 billion between the pension reserve fund, the European Investment Bank and an appropriate bond.  We believe we could create 100,000 jobs in the big areas where State assets are not being utilised properly, in broadband, clear water, smart grid, in renewable energy and for the greener homes bank.  There are many opportunities for creating up to 100,000 jobs.  The Taoiseach said at the time he would make a considered response to our proposals but I never heard anything more about it.  If the Government takes this action now we will assist.  The people on the dole queues want to work.  I do not want to see them going to Australia or England or wherever else.</P>
<Col N="784"/>
        <P>I have a letter from Galway which asks if I realise that about 100 newly trained nurses from Sligo, Galway and Ballinasloe are planning to leave the country as there are no jobs for them.  England is paying them relocation allowances.  Neither the Taoiseach nor I want that.</P>

	<P>When the Taoiseach says there will be efficiencies in the HSE I can dispute this statement in so many areas.  I agree that primary care is the way to prevent people from going into hospital in the first instance.  I visited a primary care centre in the Rowe Creavin centre in Waterford.  It is a great location and those involved do incredible work.  I am sure the Donegal centre also does great work.  However, we are behind in our targets.  There is evidence there are at least 6,000 surplus staff in the HSE.  There has been talk of redundancies but nothing has happened.  </P>
        <P>The Government will not give any detail of its budget proposals, nothing except what is stated in the pre-budget outlook and what the Minister for Finance said in his speech tonight.  I ask the Government to remember the thousands whose homes are in negative equity and the thousands of young people whose future careers in this country are in doubt.  There are many businesses struggling who are looking to this Government &mdash; because it is the Government <i>in situ</i> &mdash; to deliver some relief to them and to remove some of the obstacles.  Some people do not agree with me but I would much prefer that given the scale and complexity of the problems we face we would all be seeking the one thing that would allow any Government to sort out this, and that is a mandate from the people.  People will say a general election is not what is needed, but I believe it is needed.  The people should vote for the Taoiseach, for Fine Gael or for different parties.  They must make up their minds, and the best horse will jump the fence.  Then the Government will have a mandate and the real authority to take the decisive but fair action that is so necessary in the interest of social justice and equality.</P>
        <P>This country has so much potential, but to harness it is beyond the scope of any one person.  I urge the Taoiseach to listen, as he said he would, to the constructive suggestions from this party on employment and job creation.  In order to move our country forward, we must get workers off the dole queues and back into a situation in which they can pay their taxes and contribute to our economy.  I would like to see us moving up the list again in three years&rsquo; time in the fields of education and health, with our public finances back in order, and earning money for our country by exporting, as we have always been able to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party came into Government in entirely different circumstances in June 2007.  The scale and speed of the economic crisis that has hit the Irish people since then is now well documented.  To be honest, all of us in Government have struggled to come to terms with what is happening and put in place effective measures to deal with our major problems.  However, we will persist.  Above all, we will tell it as it is and give a truthful picture.</P>
        <P>It would be all too easy to emulate the actions of some in Opposition and tell people that we can resolve our difficulties without any pain or sacrifice.  It would be easy to claim there were painless solutions.  I have a clear memory of what happened to the Irish people in the late 1970s and 1980s.  I was among the legion of people signing on at the dole office and ultimately I had to go abroad to get a job.  This is etched in the memory of anyone over the age of 40.  Too many of us here today have failed to grasp those lessons of the 1980s, much less apply them to our current difficulties.</P>
<Col N="785"/>
        <P>In summary, what happened through that period was that Ireland&rsquo;s political leaders failed to take control of our shattered finances in time.  They failed to take necessary and painful corrective action early enough and we reaped the fruits of this with a slow and chronic recession which lasted into the mid-1990s.  A generation of young people were left without work and without hope.  They had no option but to leave Ireland.  Now we find that some in this House would have us repeat that cycle.  We cannot, must not and will not do that.  Unlike others involved in previous coalition Governments, we in the Green Party are ready to apply those lessons from the 1980s.  We are prepared to take hard political decisions to cut costs over the coming two years.  Right now, we must put the future prosperity and independence of the people first.  We must apply the lessons of the 1980s which the people paid so dearly to learn.</P>
        <P>There is a simple sum at the heart of this debate.  It costs &euro;58 billion per year to run the country, but tax revenues are just &euro;32 billion.  We are running a deficit four times the amount permitted under the membership rules of the European single currency.  We are borrowing between &euro;400 million and &euro;500 million per week just to stand still.  Increasingly, our ability to borrow that money is being called into question.  We must find economies.  We must cut spending and we must all take our share.  If we act swiftly and decisively, we can set things to rights in a relatively short period.  I believe that as long as we tell the people the truth, they will see the wisdom of what we are trying to achieve.  I have confidence in the intelligence, toughness and resilience of the people.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming budget will be tough.  However, we are working with our partners in Government to make the cutbacks as fair as possible.  We are working to minimise the pain for the most vulnerable people and we are working on reforms to ensure that we do not return to the depressing economic cycle of boom and bust.  Our first obligation is to restore stability to the economy.  Just to stand still, we must find &euro;4 billion worth of savings next year.  The harsh reality is that &euro;1.3 billion of this must be saved from the public sector pay bill.  Public service pay and pensions account for more than one third of our spending.  I understand the anxiety this causes to public sector workers and their families, and I understand their instinct to protect their livelihoods.  However, I appeal to that very instinct when I urge them now to step back from the brink of conflict and industrial action.  Most public servants are committed to serving the public.  There are efficiencies to be found, but we face a choice between cutting essential services and cutting pay.  I favour cutting pay, and most public servants I know agree.</P>
        <P>I am a long-time supporter of social partnership.  It had its flaws and some important mistakes were made in its application but, overall, social partnership served us well and was the mainstay of efforts to haul the economy out of recession.  Social partnership took us out of the bad times in the past; now is not the time to abandon it.  We must re-visit it, strengthen it and use it to point the way forward.  Cliches and fantasy economics will not fix the economy.  Only tough action and implementing the right decisions will do that.  Let us see the colour of the Opposition&rsquo;s money.  Let us hear exactly what they have to offer.  So far, I have been deeply underwhelmed.</P>

        <P>We must be solvent both financially and ecologically.  It will not be easy but we must undergo a transition to a sustainable economy.  Our taxation system, our regulatory systems and our public spending must all support this transition.  That is why we are working to reform our planning system.  It is why we are working on projects to deliver greener and cleaner energy from renewable sources.  It is why we are working on a scheme of tax reform which will be broader and fairer to all.</P>

As set out in the programme for Government, we need to move to a site-value-based taxation system for land, which will provide a fair long-term tax base and encourage sustainable economic activity.

	<P>The one result we got from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, was the lack of a plan.  He spoke of a plan but none was provided by the Government in the Chamber today.  The Minister for Finance read out a document that was devoid of a plan.  The only item I agreed with was that we know from our experience in the 1980s that we cannot tax our way out of a recession.  The Government tried to do that last year and it failed dismally.  I hope it learned its lesson.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party believes three issues must be tackled.  The Government must address the public finances, restore banking and get credit flowing and deal with the area of international competitiveness.  We put forward a proposal to deal with these.  We are an exporting nation.  The only way we will come out of this crisis is by getting back to what we are good at, namely, dealing on the export market.  We are a small open economy.  We were doing that up to around 2003 and suddenly the wheels came off the wagon when the Government moved towards construction.  It was getting &euro;30,000 from every house produced.  As the Minister stated, less tax is received from exports than from construction.  However, ultimately the revenue is more stable.  We no longer have the luxury of being able to devalue our currency but we must make our economy competitive.  We must ensure that we maintain jobs.</P>
        <P>My party has been around the country meeting business people.  They wish to keep people in employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good to hear.  The Deputy&rsquo;s party might come back and we will give it more.</P>
        <P>According to the ESRI, up to half our general Government deficit came about because of unemployment.  We cannot come out of this crisis without dealing with the issue of unemployment, getting people back to work and ensuring that employers can keep people in work.  We put forward a proposal today which would deal with employers&rsquo; tax cuts.  We would cut the lower rate of 8.5% in employers&rsquo; PRSI to 4.25% and would take 2% off the top rate of tax, from 10.75% to 8.75%, for people earning up to &euro;40,000.  That would impact on more than 1.6 million employees and 100,000 employers.  There would be enormous benefits.  For every person who does not go on social welfare, the State would save &euro;20,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the key.  They would contribute in terms of taxes and would retain their homes.  Such a step would ensure that we dealt with the fundamentals.  We cannot restore this economy without keeping people in jobs.  We cannot restore the economy without cutting the costs for employers.  The only way we can restore our competitiveness internationally is to bring down our costs.  The luxury of devaluation is gone.  We have the benefits of certainty with the euro.  We must address the issue of employment costs.  My party proposes doing this through the employment tax code measures and we hope the Government will take this on board.  This proposal on restoring competitiveness is one of a series of measures we are putting forward, unlike the Government which has none.  </P>
        <P>Other areas that must be addressed include energy costs.  The four biggest costs for employers at the moment are labour, rent and rates, energy and bank interest charges.  All need to be addressed.  My party has come up with an employment tax cuts package.  It is very straightforward, cutting costs to employers, restoring competitiveness and ensuring that people can stay in jobs.  Concerning energy costs, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, must look at the issue of the energy regulator and how to set prices in terms of energy costs.  It should be possible to have ongoing reviews to ensure that the reductions in world markets are passed on to businesses.</P>
        <P>Regarding rates, my party is committed, at council level, to a policy of no increases in commercial rates in the coming three years.  I have not heard the Government say that.  It is a very pro-active measure.</P>
        <P>Regarding banking, there is nothing in NAMA to ensure that credit will flow.  If credit does not flow, businesses will not be able to function.  The measure I proposed for cutting employers&rsquo; PRSI would give a cash flow advantage to an employer which is needed in big measure.  In its last budget, the Government included nothing of a stimulus package for jobs.  We put forward a proposal for employers&rsquo; PRSI exemption for two years and are now building on that with tax cuts for existing jobs.  What the Government did was ludicrous.  Nowhere in the world would business people increase their charges at a time when business is going badly as the Government did, going from a 21% to 21.5% VAT rate in the last budget.  It was illogical.  It was done during a bi-monthly VAT period just coming up to Christmas and made no sense.</P>
        <P>What is needed is a plan and we in Fine Gael wish to play our part.  The Government cannot have a debate on the budget and not put forward a single proposal.  The document from the Minister for Finance is a load of waffle.  It creates nothing of a pro-active nature and shows no direction.  I can see why the <i>Financial Times</i> published a survey today which showed our Minister for Finance having dropped from 18th to 19th place &mdash; last.  That is how international markets view the way this Government is dealing with the Irish economy.  We need a change of direction, a general election and a new Government to ensure that we can introduce these <Col N="790"/>measures to restore our international competitiveness, get our public finances in order and have a banking system that is both sound and provides credit to small business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In the limited time available to me I wish to deal with three issues &mdash; farming, jobs and cross-Border trade.  After his first budget last year, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, admitted his decision to raise VAT at the same time as the UK Chancellor decreased his rate meant a loss of &euro;700 million in revenue to our State.  Even though he brought in a second budget, he made no effort to rectify this situation.  It is important that he advises us what this loss has come to in a full year.  I understand 50% of the alcohol sold on the island of Ireland is now being sold in the six Northern counties.</P>
        <P>Jobs are being lost in retail and other sectors as a direct result of this haemorrhage of business.  The Minister can no longer ignore the issue.  A reduction in VAT would certainly help our tourist and other high employment sectors and must be introduced.  We can never tax ourselves out of the current crisis but the Government clearly has no commitment to bringing in structures which would help create employment, minimise the dole queue and, in turn, improve our tax income.</P>
        <P>Agriculture is still the main industry in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan but the Government has done everything to undermine the structures.  It has cut REPS, installation and EU aid.  Even the dairy industry which used to give the single best income on family farms is in crisis.  Beef and sheep farmers are losing money and pig farmers are in serious crisis.  We are advised that many pigs will die this Christmas if funds are not made available.  Many farmers are failing to get necessary support from either their banking institutions or the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In all my years of involvement in the industry, I have never seen such fear among farm families.  Like many mortgage holders, they cannot understand that a Government could find so many billions of euro to prop up the banking structures without having received any commitments in return to support small industry, mortgage holders and agriculture.</P>
        <P>We appreciate, and most parties have agreed, that it is necessary for EU reasons and common sense to make savings of &euro;4 billion, but it is vital that whatever cuts are made are fair and reasonable and do not cause further deterioration in the potential of agriculture and job creation in general.  Only jobs can bring us out of this crisis.  Taxation will not.</P>

	<P>I listened carefully and did not shout and roar, even though I was tempted.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s point in this debate has been made clear, namely, let us have a general election.  We will not, since it would solve nothing.</P>

	<P>We are operating on the mandate given to us by the people when they voted for us.  For some reason, Deputy Enda Kenny cannot get it out of his head that he did not make it two and a half years ago or get into the position for which he had hoped.</P>
        <P>Be that as it may, we are faced with a budget.  I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench, including the Taoiseach, for this debate.  Everyone agrees that there must be &euro;4 billion in cuts.  I listened to Deputy Richard Bruton, who stated that Fine Gael agreed with many of the McCarthy proposals as outlined by an bord snip nua.  However, the party will not tell us with which proposals it will agree, because not doing so enables each of its Deputies and Senators to tell their local newspapers that they are appalled by the latest cuts.  &ldquo;Appalled&rdquo; is a good word and Fine Gael uses it often.  Its eminent spokesman on finance is able to say the party agrees with most of the McCarthy cuts, but it does not specify a single cut it would implement.</P>

	<P>Members know that I am genuine when I say that those on the margins must continue to be protected.  They are under more pressure than anyone else.  As many Deputies have stated, including the nice people on the Labour benches, there is a new poor, people who never had to face the dole queue or look for assistance but are now doing so.  I am glad to hear Deputies from every party discussing people who are under pressure where mortgage payments are concerned.  I hope that some sense will prevail regarding a moratorium on repossessions.  We cannot throw people out on the street because it will only lead to different problems.  Stating this is important.</P>
        <P>My good friend from the Border counties, Deputy Seymour Crawford, mentioned jobs, which is also an issue for those of us in Dublin, particularly those of us who represent Dublin South-West.  In the Tallaght social welfare office, the unemployment figure has increased by more than 90% in the past year.  One need not be on the Opposition benches to be caring and upset about this situation.  Some Deputies might smile, but I have been made redundant three times.  Maybe some of them will get me again.  I know what it was like to go home and tell my family that we were under pressure.  In recent weeks, my brother-in-law lost his job, as did my sister, a nice woman in Kilnamanagh who Deputy Rabbitte knows.  She has never been unemployed since leaving school, but she lost her job in a reputable firm.</P>

	<P>Not to be too parochial, but the Minister for Education and Science gave a good presentation to the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, as one would expect.  I told him that I was glad he was not suggesting that the lights would go out.</P>
        <P>We still need the building sector.  Let us not forget that building schools is important, as it will provide employment and help people.  I want to mention two schools in my constituency.  The first is the Holy Rosary national school in Ballycragh which has operated in prefabs for more than 20 years.  The other one is the all-Irish school, Scoil Chaitl&iacute;n Maud, in Knockmore.  Surely some mandarin in the Department could find an innovative way to complete these projects.  We all have priority projects we want to see built, but I am putting on record my genuine support for those two projects and I hope the Minister will consider them along with the others.</P>
        <P>I will listen to the Labour Party leader and to all other contributors today, and I look forward to this debate.  I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Johnny Brady, for his courtesy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance began by stating that more information has been made available before this budget than before any other.  It is true that we have a great deal of information about the state of the economy and much of it was contained in the pre-budget outlook published last week.  It tells us that the economy will contract by 7.5% this year, and estimates contraction of 1.5% next year.  Taken with the fall of 3% in GDP in 2008, this is one of the worst recessions experienced by any developed country since the Second World War.</P>
        <P>It tells us that the unemployment rate will average 11.75% in 2009 and 13.75% in 2010, and that employment will fall by 7.75% in 2009 and by 3.75% in 2010.  Recent data show that unemployment in Ireland is now the second highest in the OECD, and a third higher than the eurozone average.</P>
        <P>The pre-budget outlook shows us that confidence in the economy is so low that consumption will fall at a greater rate than incomes.  Consumption, according to the outlook, will fall by 7.5% in 2009 and 3.5% in 2010 in response to a rising savings rate.  It tells us that the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 2009 will be almost &euro;26 billion and next year, after corrective action, it will be almost &euro;20 billion, while the general Government deficit for 2009 and 2010 will be 12% of GDP, four times the Stability and Growth Pact target.  By the end of 2009, the level of national debt is set to be double the 2007 level.  By the end of 2010, the general Government debt is forecast to reach 78% of GDP.  The cost of paying for all of this has been pushed up by the mishandling of the banking crisis.  The cost of ten-year Government debt issued in today&rsquo;s auction is some 140 basis points above bund rates. The money that has been handed over to the banks amounts to &euro;4 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and &euro;7 billion between AIB and Bank of Ireland, and that is before we come to the &euro;7 billion that may be lost in the NAMA project.</P>
<Col N="795"/>
        <P>That is the legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il, after 12 years in Government.  In any other democracy a Government with that record would have resigned or fallen in the face of those economic failures.  When Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke states that the only policy the Opposition has is a general election, she is right.  The only solution to this is a general election and the sweeping from office of the Government and the main party which is principally responsible for this tragedy.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s only policy appears to be one of a brass neck.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens have tied themselves together and to office, and their only answer to the economy is to demand to know what the Opposition will do about it.  The Labour Party has been clear that the fiscal deficit must be dealt with now, rather than adjustment being delayed.  We have, therefore, accepted that an adjustment of approximately &euro;4 billion is required in the coming year.  We should not pretend this will be easy, such is the scale of the problem that Fianna F&aacute;il has created.  This will be a difficult adjustment, no matter how it is done.  What we must seek to ensure is that the least damage is done to the economy and that the burden of adjustment is fair.  Where we face choices is in the make up of those adjustments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In April last, the Government, through the Minister for Finance when he spoke in the budget debate, set out a mixed approach to the &euro;4 billion adjustment, consisting of &euro;1.75 billion in taxation, &euro;1.5 billion in current spending and &euro;0.75 billion in capital spending cuts.  Since then, however, the Government has utterly shifted its position, explicitly advancing the argument that there is an economic benefit from cutting expenditure alone. The Minister for Finance today, in a speech in which he told us nothing, might at least have offered an explanation as to why he has shifted his policy and why Government policy has shifted as to the mix that should go to make up the &euro;4 billion adjustment.  The Government position is a dangerously partial and one-dimensional reading of the situation which ignores important economic and social realities.</P>
        <P>For the budget to succeed it must be credible to both domestic and international audiences.  To achieve that credibility requires a realistic policy mix including spending reductions and revenue raising.  It also must be fair, and be seen to be fair.  Where possible, the measures adopted should be based on reform &mdash; reform of taxation, reform of spending and reform of administration.  I have already stated that there should be a negotiated reduction in the public sector pay bill.  That must be knitted into an agenda of reform in the public service, something for which Labour has been calling for years.  Across-the-board pay cuts are an admission of failure because they will not deliver the necessary changes in working practices and organisation of the public service.  We need a Minister for public service re-organisation, but we also need far more autonomy and responsibility to be devolved to Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>As capital budgets were increased during the bubble, tender price inflation eroded the volume of output that was achieved.  Now, tender prices in construction are falling.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors estimates that tender prices for general construction fell by 17% in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009 and commensurate savings can be made on the capital budget, without affecting the level of activity.  Reductions in capital budgets, however, must be accompanied by two policy changes.  First, we need a new national development plan that takes account of changed economic circumstances and that sets out a clear set of priorities for Government investment.  We can no longer afford the laid-back approach to capital budgeting that has been seen to date.  Second, the Government should move on proposals to access non-traditional sources of investment financing, to deliver on infrastructural needs, without impacting on the general Government balance.  There are a number of ways in which this can <Col N="796"/>be done, including through a national investment bank.  Again, there were promises made in the April emergency budget, but nothing has happened.</P>
        <P>If spending cuts are to be part of the budget mix, as they must be, so must revenue raising, which must be accompanied by reform.  Ireland simply cannot afford the vast array of tax expenditures that are still in the system.  Labour has identified many of these over a long number of years.  There is still more than &euro;600 million in rent relief for landlords, more than &euro;400 million in property-based tax reliefs and a series of reliefs across the system that are too generous in current circumstances and which can be pared back.  Labour will also support a carbon tax, which would raise approximately &euro;0.5 billion.</P>
        <P>We need to seek a contribution from the better off in society.  Labour has proposed a third rate of tax on single incomes over &euro;100,000, and the Government must deal with the scandal of tax exiles who are not making their contribution.  One cannot talk the language of fairness but then insist on pursuing cuts in social welfare without seeking any contribution from the best off in society.</P>
        <P>There are choices.  There are real options if the Government has the courage to embrace them, but it does not and it will not.  I do not accept that there is only one way to deal with this problem, nor do I accept that the person who wants to inflict the most pain on the weakest sections of society somehow has the greatest grasp of the problem.  Frankly, we have had enough of that kind of undergraduate advice.  It shows little understanding of the past and no regard for the future.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a dangerously divisive tone to public debate in our country now.  Fianna F&aacute;il is promoting a beggar-my-neighbour approach, in the hope that by dividing the country, by isolating and demonising particular sections in society and the workforce, it can pretend that those sectors alone can carry the burden of adjustment.  That is a false choice and a sum that does not add up.  We will not get through this crisis by creating division.  The problem cannot be hived off onto the backs of one group or another.  It can be dealt with only by all of us pulling together.</P>
        <P>We will get through the crisis only on the basis of unity and a negotiated national agreement.  If we abandon the partnership approach, it could take a generation to restore.  People who are sent away from the negotiating table will not be enticed back when the economy improves.  One will be faced with conflict and higher wage claims when the economy starts to recover.</P>
     
         <P>It will serve the interests of no one to go down the road of conflict and industrial action.  I am not just saying that here, but have already said it at trade union conferences.  That is why I have advanced a set of five proposals that, I believe, should form the basis for negotiations on a new agreement for national recovery.  They comprise a moratorium on home re-possessions, a coherent jobs strategy, a negotiated agreement on public sector pay, a budget based on fairness and industrial peace.</P>
        <P>Today, the Government borrowed a further &euro;1 billion and we paid 1.4% more for ten-year money than the German Government would pay.  By seeking out conflict, by facilitating those who are trying to dodge paying their fair share, Fianna F&aacute;il is making the problem worse.  A negotiated and shared approach, on the other hand, would send a powerful signal that Ireland is united in its commitment to dealing with its problems. http://www.labour.ie/press/</P>
        <P>The most depressing thing I have heard in this debate is the promise from Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor that Fianna F&aacute;il must continue to do what it has always done.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always looked after itself and let the country go to hell.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past 18 months, newspapers have carried headlines such as &ldquo;Girl (12) taken into care in trafficking investigation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chinese restaurant owner linked to 34 missing children&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nigerian girl trafficked for sex trade goes missing from HSE&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lithuanian &lsquo;trafficker&rsquo; agrees to extradition&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leaders of trafficking gang face 15 years in jail on exploitation charges&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Human trafficking is the third most lucrative illicit business in the world after arms and drug trafficking.  Trafficking is a hidden crime.  Its victims cannot or dare not make themselves known to the authorities for fear of retaliation or because they are illegal immigrants.  A common feature of many victims of trafficking is that their home countries are poor and there are few opportunities for employment.  The groups most vulnerable to this crime are those of low status, without powerful protectors &mdash; typically women and children, especially orphans or those subject to domestic violence &mdash; in addition to impoverished men and those in debt bondage.</P>
        <P>Many of the trafficked adults are deceived about the type of work they will be doing and may be charged exorbitant fees by agencies for arranging work.  When they arrive, they are tricked or intimidated into surrendering their travel documents and either forced into prostitution or subjected to forced labour.</P>
        <P>The types of legitimate work that women think they are being recruited to do include jobs in the restaurant trade, domestic work, child-minding or accountancy.  They may also be promised education or training opportunities.  Some women know they may have to work as prostitutes for a while, but they have no idea of the violence and degradation to which they will be subjected.  Many children or their families think they are opting for a better life with better education and employment opportunities, sometimes within a private foster family.</P>
        <P>Many of the victims are held in what is an invisible prison.  They are in a foreign country with no language skills and are vulnerable as a result.  The same mechanisms of domestic violence have been used down through the generations in this country and elsewhere.  Such victims are often raped in order to test them out initially.  In some cases they are offered to the trafficker&rsquo;s friends to cultivate them in the trade of prostitution.</P>
        <P>In its 2009 &ldquo;Trafficking in Persons Report&rdquo;, the US State Department kept Ireland in the second of three performance tiers, based on an assessment of its record in prosecuting offenders, protecting victims and preventing abuses.  That report stated: &ldquo;the Government of Ireland does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking .... Although Ireland made significant strides, there was no evidence that trafficking offenders were prosecuted or convicted during the reporting period, and concerns remained about victim identification and protection.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The report came 12 months after the enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to tackling sex trafficking has been piecemeal to date.  During the summer, I welcomed the publication of the Government&rsquo;s anti-human trafficking plan, which I hope will tackle the proliferation of sex trafficking into Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;180-million illegal sex industry.  Ireland must enforce its legislation and put support services in place for victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is calling on the Government to put a comprehensive strategy in place to deal with the proliferation of trafficking here and through Ireland into the UK and other parts of Europe.  Four specific aspects need to be dealt with if we are to address this question successfully: prosecutions; accommodation; legislation in place concerning the prostitution industry; and child trafficking.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 is significant legislation.  It provides for the first time that a trafficked victim is not guilty of any offence and also that the purchaser of sex can be, in certain circumstances, guilty of an offence.  However, the major problem with the <Col N="799"/>legislation&rsquo;s enforcement is in the identification of a person as a victim of trafficking.  While I welcome the publication of the anti-human trafficking plan, which hopefully will tackle the proliferation of such activity, there are no clear policies or guidelines to identify a woman as being trafficked or what happens to women who have been identified as being sex-trafficked.  To date, Ireland has not yet convicted anyone of trafficking.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to investigate, prosecute and convict perpetrators of all types of organised crime, but even more so for a hidden crime like human trafficking with its confused and scared victims.  However, we are starting to see some progress on enforcing the legislation.  Some 16 months after the enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, there have been 73 investigations into potential trafficking, as identified by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Of those, at least 14 are minors and 11 of the 73 have been granted a period of recovery and reflection.  Some 90% of the 73 cases of potential victims of human trafficking are being investigated on the basis of sexual exploitation, according to information provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A number of files have gone to the DPP who must decide whether to prosecute.  One case currently before the courts involves the trafficking of a child for sexual exploitation.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau&rsquo;s anti-trafficking unit relies on information provided through non-governmental organisations, the public or coming across a brothel in the day-to-day investigations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The unit should be more proactive in identifying suspicious activity and confronting it head-on.</P>
        <P>Human trafficking needs to be viewed through the prism of organised crime.  Detective Inspector Jonas Trolle of the Stockholm police said that trafficking and prostitution are always connected with organised crime.  Germany and Holland, which have legalised prostitution, are legitimising the income of these organised crime groups.  It is imperative that the organised crime section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is mandated to deal with human trafficking as well as the victims of this crime.</P>
        <P>In May this year, the 21st report of the Independent Monitoring Commission stated that Continuity IRA members continue to be involved in a large range of serious criminal activity, including brothel keeping.  The issue is clearly linked to organised crime.  Subversive elements that have sought to undermine the State in the past have now become involved in this area.</P>
        <P>They feel there is money to be made in the industry.  It is important that the organised crime unit of the Garda focus on the industry and on the issue of trafficking.  It is also important that clear protocols on the policing of brothels be put in place and that garda&iacute; be trained to be aware of the vulnerability of victims and to realise some may be undocumented.  We spoke at length in recent debates on undocumented victims coming to the attention of the Garda.  Victims are severely traumatised in many cases.  The 60-day period is too short for them to recover sufficiently to make an informed decision about co-operating with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Fundamental to the protection of victims is the provision of safe and secure accommodation.  It is interesting to read in a report issued last December that one in five women discovered in suspected brothels leaves the country.  It is imperative that these women, some of whom are the victims of trafficking, remain here to assist the Garda in the collation of evidence that can be given in court to secure convictions against the traffickers.  Thus, traffickers can be put behind bars once and for all.  In this context, it is imperative that we do not view trafficking as an immigration crime coupled with the facilitation of smuggling people into the country.  The latter is a different issue.</P>
        <P>The victims of trafficking may not necessarily be from outside the European Union.  There were a number of incidents in the past in which victims who approached the non-governmental organisations turned out to be citizens of the European Union.  They require the same level of protection from traffickers as victims from outside the Union.  It is imperative that we do not <Col N="800"/>view them purely as illegal immigrants.  If we do, we are further exploiting them.  We should not guarantee them permanent residency in this country.  Doing so would seriously compromise the ability to have successful prosecutions but we need to put in place a sensible and practical period for recovery and reflection.  Such a period would help victims recover from their terrible ordeal and give them an opportunity to reflect on what they should do next.  Fundamental to this is the provision of safe accommodation.</P>
        <P>I disagree fundamentally with the Minister&rsquo;s anti-trafficking plan in respect of accommodation.  Provision is made in the anti-trafficking plan for the Reception and Integration Agency to cater for the victims of trafficking.  It is wrong to place the victims with this agency.  Asylum centres are revolving doors for victims of trafficking.  There are numerous documented cases of children placed in the care of the HSE who have disappeared from the asylum accommodation in which they were placed.  Even the Minister&rsquo;s report and the evidence he has given to the House suggest that 70% of the potential victims of trafficking identified by the Garda have been either children in HSE care or asylum seekers.  It is clear the asylum system is regarded as a soft touch for the trafficking of people into Ireland.  We cannot allow victims identified in brothels or labour exploitation to be returned to the same centres from which they were trafficked in the first instance.  This is their great fear.  Unless we provide accommodation such as that provided under the Sonas housing initiative, whose staff have the skills set to cater for the victims of trafficking, we will not secure the number and types of convictions we desire.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that figures published recently by the Galway Rape Crisis Centre indicate one in five victims who report rape and abuse are asylum seekers.  There is substantial anecdotal evidence to show the rape of women in asylum centres is being used as a mechanism to groom them for the prostitution industry.  It is fundamental that we send out a clear message that our asylum process is not a soft touch for human traffickers and that we address, once and for all, the issue of the placing of the victims of trafficking back into asylum centres.  We must provide proper and adequate accommodation for victims.</P>
        <P>The Sonas Housing Association is well capable of dealing with the needs of victims.  It is prepared to provide the assistance and accommodation that is needed.  If we are to send out a clear message that Ireland is no longer a soft touch regarding human trafficking, we must put women into secure accommodation such that they will be prepared subsequently to assist the Garda and give evidence in court to secure convictions.</P>
        <P>It is important that the brief of the anti-trafficking unit in the Department be extended to included migrant women in prostitution.  The report of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Globalisation, Sex Trafficking and Prostitution, published in April 2009, indicates a minimum of 102 women and girls have been clearly identified as sex trafficked into the country in 2007 and 2008.  Eleven of them were children.  The only way the Government can fill the data gap so it can ascertain the full extent of the problem in Ireland is to have the anti-trafficking plan allow for the extension of the unit to include migrant women in prostitution.  This could provide a source of very valuable information allowing the Government to learn exactly what is taking place.  The Minister&rsquo;s evidence that 90% of potential victims are in the industry in the first place should be one of our focal points.</P>
        <P>The anti-human trafficking plan contains no reference to funding for educational advertising and promotion campaigns on trafficking aimed at migrant communities.  While funding has been provided in the past, we need serious and significant ring-fenced funding targeted specifically to bring the dangers of trafficking to the attention of migrant communities and others.  We must tackle this issue head-on and explain that those who avail of the services of trafficked prostitutes are sponsoring organised crime and the trafficking of more women into this country.</P>
<Col N="801"/>
        <P>The Immigrant Council of Ireland produced very important research stating 970 of the 1,000 women involved in the indoor sex industry in Ireland are migrant women.  Our immigration legislation is being undermined by traffickers exploiting loopholes in the legislation and policing practices to bring women here for the sex industry.</P>
        <P>There is currently a clampdown on prostitution in Norway and Sweden.  The authorities have criminalised the buying of sex.  As a consequence, the industry has moved out of those countries into some of the other Nordic countries.  Last week, the UK House of Commons passed a Bill that will target the demand end of the industry.  The legislation will make it an offence to pay for sex from a person who is subjected by a third party to force, threat or any other form of coercion.  The offence is a strict liability offence.  In other words, it will not be a defence to say one did not know the prostitute was being forced to engage in prostitution.  This, in reality, will mean the industry will move from Britain and Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland.  The Scottish Parliament intends to introduce legislation next year similar to that of both Sweden and Norway in that it will criminalise the person who purchases sex.</P>
        <P>If that were to happen, it would put further pressure on the industry across the water and push it more into this jurisdiction.  Given the current ease of access into this country, we could easily become the new red light district of Europe.  It is urgent that we deal with prostitution in this country and review the existing legislation because this issue is coming down the tracks at us very quickly.</P>
        <P>The Garda states that the sex industry and trafficking rings are not a big issue in this country.  It is quoted in the media as saying that it could easily close down the prostitution industry, literally overnight, because it is based on mobile telephones, which are the lifeblood of that industry.  It could close the business by removing the telephone numbers from the systems.  If it is that easy to close down the industry, why has it not happened to date?  Why is the Garda saying the issue is not a problem in this country?  A total of 1,000 women a week are involved in the indoor sex industry in this country.  The majority of them are migrant women, most of whom have been trafficked into this country.  I urge the Minister to urgently review the existing provisions on prostitution laws and to bring forward proposals that will clamp down on the potential exploitation and abuse of our jurisdiction.</P>

	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Naughten, on bringing this issue to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  A few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to read the Immigrant Council of Ireland&rsquo;s report, Globalisation, Sex Trafficking and Prostitution &mdash; The Experiences of Migrant Women in Ireland.  Reading that prompted me to speak in the debate tonight.  I pay tribute to the council on its work.  It is easy for people to sweep an issue such as this under the carpet, as if it never existed.  It is only because of debates such as this in the D&aacute;il, which I hope will receive the full glare of publicity, that such issues come to attention.</P>
        <P>I believe the situation is worse than is generally accepted.  Prostitution is a real cancer in society.  From a trafficking point of view, animals are treated better in terms of dignity.  Against that background, anything that can be done should be done by ordinary people through the Government, Members of the House and the various agencies of State such as the Health Service Executive and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need to do the best we can to clean up this dreadful mess.</P>
        <P>The report by the Immigrant Council of Ireland reveals that, in the lucrative Irish sex industry, large numbers of migrant women are being sexually exploited in indoor prostitution.  The report demonstrates the severe trauma and harm caused to women by trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation.  The 102 women who were identified as having been trafficked into this country were aware of a further 64 women who were trafficked, giving a possible total of 166 women trafficked in a short period.  They are the ones who are documented.  I expect the actual <Col N="802"/>figure is much higher.  According to that research, 11% of the 102 women were children at the time they were trafficked.  One is getting to the bottom of the barrel when children are involved.  There is no reason to believe many more children are not involved.  The work of the various agencies involved in this area should get the respect it deserves.  Every Member should take the report extremely seriously.</P>
        <P>I understand that the vast majority of women trafficked into this country are from African countries.  Women reported being transported by aeroplane, train, bus, car, boat and ferry.  Many were transported by other means of transport.  Some came through the United Kingdom via Belfast and were then transported to other parts of this country.  With an open shoreline like ours, it is not difficult for traffickers to ply their terrible trade.</P>
        <P>When trafficked women reach Ireland, they are sometimes passed on to Irish brothel owners who prostitute them.  Other women are held and prostituted by original traffickers.  In either case, documentation is usually taken from the women.  In most cases the woman is then not only illegal in this country, but is without any documents.  When one is from an African country, speaks very little English, with no documentation and nowhere to turn, one is in a bad place.  As a nation, we should hope that the human dignity of such women will be protected.  I congratulate Deputy Naughten on what he is trying to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The following is an account from a young trafficked woman who was lucky enough to be rescued by the Garda and to get treatment from a non-governmental organisation in this country.  It is an appropriate setting of the scene for a debate which I thank Deputy Naughten for introducing in the House.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I came to Ireland for a better life, trusting my helper.  A few days later I became a prisoner.  I was locked in a room.  They were using me to make money.  I was forced to have sex with different men, which was organised by them.  After sleeping with the men, they paid money to my organisers who came to collect it from me.  I became useless, meaningless, helpless, hopeless &mdash; no person to speak to.  My world was turned upside down.  No freedom.  I have to do what they say to do, not what I want to do.  It was like hell.  I was dying in silence.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is a danger when one passes legislation and puts a trafficking plan in place for one to think the job is done, but it is not.  The problem of human trafficking in this country remains a growing one.  Credit is due to the Government for the legislative response that came into effect in June 2008 and also for the trafficking plan that was published this summer.  There is an onus on us to assess the performance of the legislation since its introduction, how it has been implemented, who is implementing it and, most importantly, whether we are finding and protecting the victims of human trafficking in this country.</P>
        <P>Tough prosecution is secondary in that regard.  We must find, target and prosecute those responsible for facilitating and organising the trafficking of people.  Approximately four years ago it began to dawn on policymakers in this country that human trafficking was a real and growing issue.  At the time this country was booming.  We were a land of opportunity, but we were also a new target for organised crime to deliver a product, primarily young girls, into a growing sex industry.  Prosperity brought problems and we did not deal with them initially.  We are trying to do so now.  The sex and prostitution industry in this country has changed dramatically in the past ten years.  It has gone from the streets where primarily young and middle-aged Irish women worked to being conducted behind closed doors.  Currently, 97% of the women involved are non-Irish nationals.  Some of them do not even speak our language.</P>
        <P>Two &ldquo;Primetime&rdquo; programmes and one &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme identified the problem as a growing issue in this country.  In the case of the BBC programme, Ireland was identified as <Col N="803"/>a transit country, the easiest way to take young girls into the sex industry in Great Britain.  I was in the European Parliament at the time the programme was aired and I tried to focus on the responses needed to address the issue.  I was involved in the Stop the Traffik campaign that was launched in 2006.</P>
        <P>It is worth reminding people of the extent of the problem the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform faces.  This is a very large global criminal industry.  The facts are startling.  Approximately 2.5 million people are in forced labour at any one time around the world as a result of trafficking.  Just under 300,000 people are in forced labour in the industrialised world as a result of trafficking &mdash; about 11% of that 2.5 million.  People are trafficked from approximately 127 different countries and approximately 137 countries are exploiting the victims.  Ireland is one of those.  The majority of people are between the ages of 18 and 24 and in Ireland&rsquo;s case the majority are young women.</P>
        <P>What is most startling is the profits generated through this criminal industry.  The estimated global annual profits made from the exploitation of trafficked forced labour is &euro;31.6 billion each year.  That is a figure given by the International Labour Office in Geneva in 2005; I expect the figure has greatly increased since then.  It is &euro;15.5 billion in industrialised countries.  That is almost half the total figure.  This is a very large business which involves sophisticated, well organised, ruthless and well-financed criminal gangs targeting countries for a reason and the response we develop must take that into account.  It is not surprising, therefore, that a small, open country like Ireland has been targeted.  This motion acknowledges that over 100 women and girls have been clearly identified as being trafficked between 2007 and 2008, but anyone who knows anything about this issue knows that is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
        <P>In terms of whether we are doing enough, this motion proposes four actions that develop what the Minister has already done in Government: improve the effect of the legislation; improve the policy to date; protect young women; and target traffickers.  I sincerely hope the Minister accepts this motion.</P>
        <P>The first issue I want to discuss, and Deputy Naughten raised it, is the need to move the focus away from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to the Garda organised crime unit.  We must break the connection between illegal immigration and trafficking into Ireland.  One involves primarily people coming to Ireland to work and develop a better life here, and they are breaking the rules in doing it in some cases.  The other is a criminal act whereby the smuggling arrangements are organised to exploit and abuse a victim.</P>
        <P>The problem, if the two are not separated, is that they get lumped into the one and in terms of garda&iacute; who are trained to identify on a daily basis people coming to Ireland illegally with fraudulent papers, passports or whatever, that type of training does not equip them to identify likely trafficked victims and treat them appropriately as victims of abuse and exploitation.  Essentially, that is the problem with the current system.</P>
        <P>Since the legislation was enacted last summer, we have had examples of women being arrested, handcuffed, treated with suspicion and put in jail cells as a result of a court judgment while the assessment procedure was ongoing as to whether the person should be categorised as a trafficked victim.  That is not acceptable.  We must recognise that the implementation of the law is not as it should be.  We should not treat people as criminals and put the onus on them to prove that they are trafficked victims.  It should be the other way around.  We must be big enough to accept that garda&iacute; alone are not the appropriate decision makers in terms of interpreting whether someone is a likely victim of trafficking.</P>
        <P>Various expert groups in Ireland have proven themselves through experience and working with trafficked victims and victims of the sex industry.  They know what they are looking for, and the criteria is clear in terms of United Nations protocols in this area.  They should be <Col N="804"/>involved in the determination process at an early stage with the garda&iacute; to try to separate victims as early as possible to ensure that we can help them, rather than trying to establish whether someone is a victim of trafficking in the intimidating atmosphere of a Garda station or a jail cell.  In many cases, those women will not trust police services or the garda&iacute; because of past experience in their home countries.  The method of determining who needs assistance when an illegal immigrant comes to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is wrong.</P>
        <P>I understand what the Minister was trying to achieve in the new trafficking law when he made assistance conditional on co-operating with the garda&iacute; to try to help them secure convictions, but that is not taking a human rights approach.  If somebody is a victim of rape, physical abuse or exploitation in a kitchen, the first priority must be to help that person understand how he or she got into that position and build faith and trust between the social and health services that we can provide to them here and the victims themselves.  The first priority should not be securing a conviction of the person who brought them here.  That should be secondary, but it is not in the current legislation.  Nor is it in the current approach, and that is wrong.  We should recognise that and change it.</P>
        <P>Regarding the recovery and reflection period, I agree with Deputy Naughten.  We must extend that, and be seen to extend it.  People are not asking for permanent residency in Ireland.  The groups campaigning for immigrant rights and the rights of victims of trafficking are not asking for that.  They are asking for a longer period to ensure that the proper assessment can be done and the proper health care provided, whether that be emotional, physical or whatever the case may be.</P>
        <P>We must separate the accommodation of asylum seekers or refugees from where we accommodate victims.  The image we must have in our minds is that of a young Irish girl who has been found in a brothel, in an extreme case maybe handcuffed to a bed, who has been earning money for a pimp or a brothel owner.  If we cannot find her parents, do we send that young Irish girl to a migrant centre or to an asylum seeking accommodation unit?  If she is a Nigerian, Malaysian or Brazilian girl, or a street girl from Calcutta, she should have the same rights as an Irish girl, or an Irish young woman, in this country if she is found to be a victim of abuse and exploitation.  That is the way we should see it.</P>
        <P>The only way we will make a serious impact on this industry is to target demand.  That is the reason I want the Minister to take seriously our final proposal that we will re-examine prostitution laws and laws around the sex industry in Ireland.  I have no qualms about saying that people who use prostitution in Ireland should be criminalised.  It is the only way to target and kill demand.  It will never be entirely eradicated but if we are serious about helping people who find themselves in prostitution, whether they be trafficked here or in prostitution because of drug addition or a series of other complicated reasons, we must target the people who use them, pay for them and consider that normal living.  If we are serious about helping those people, we must target those who use them and pay for them, those who consider that to be normal living.</P>
        <P>Until we target our prostitution laws in the same way that has been successfully done in Scandinavian countries and in the same way that is being considered in Britain, we will not make an impact on this industry.  The first priority should not be prosecutions, but the protection of victims.  We will find that if we protect victims properly, the prosecutions will flow from that because we will build proper trust between the State agencies and the victims we have an obligation to help.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that the 60 day recovery and reflection period goes beyond the minimum period of 30 days provided for in the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings and is longer than that offered by many EU Member States;</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner based on his professional assessment of the operational requirements;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the concerted efforts of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in regard to the provision of training, the identification and protection of victims and in the determined fight against trafficking in human beings in Ireland and notes the progress being made in this regard;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I thank the proposers of the motion, which gives us a good opportunity to discuss an important issue.  It also gives us an opportunity to take stock of our position in the aftermath of legislation that was passed by this House only 17 months ago.  Reading the motion put forward by Fine Gael Deputies, there seems to be a lack of awareness regarding the measures which have been taken by the Government in the past 17 months, and before that when preparing the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken a very firm stand against trafficking in human beings by putting in place a wide range of legislative and administrative measures in terms of prevention, protection and prosecution.  The position that is being put forward is that the State is doing little to tackle this most serious of human rights abuses or that the measures being taken are not the correct ones.  I can state emphatically that this is simply not the case.</P>
        <P>A dedicated anti-human trafficking unit was established in my Department in February 2008, prior to the enactment and commencement in June 2008 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which provides for penalties of up to life imprisonment.  The unit works closely with more than 50 governmental, non-governmental, international and other organisations nationally and internationally to co-ordinate a comprehensive, holistic and &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; response to the issue of human trafficking.  A key element in assisting the unit in fulfilling its role is the work being done in the range of interdisciplinary consultative fora which are in place since mid 2008.  These fora include State agencies, non-governmental and international organisations which make recommendations to a high level interdepartmental group, which reports to me.</P>
        <P>In addition to a round-table group &mdash; I attended one of these round-table meetings last year to hear the issues first hand &mdash; there are five working groups made up of expert representatives from the state agencies, NGOs and international organisations which meet regularly to identify and address issues at a real and practical level.  The groups deal with awareness raising and training, development of a national referral mechanism, child trafficking, sexual exploitation and labour exploitation.</P>
        <P>I would like to give an idea of the extent of engagement that has taken place since the anti-human trafficking unit was established in February 2008 in an efforts to address this issue.  In 2008 it had more than 150 meetings with relevant stakeholders,16 of which were with the groups to which I have just referred.  To date in 2009 it has had about 110 meetings with relevant stakeholders, of which 19 have been with the groups to which I referred earlier.</P>
<Col N="807"/>
        <P>On 10 June of this year, I published the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland 2009-2012, which was prepared under the auspices of a high level interdepartmental group.  This plan sets out in detail the measures which have been already undertaken across Departments and agencies to address the issue.  It also identifies areas which require further action.</P>
        <P>The plan is based on what is known as the three Ps in the area of trafficking: prevention, protection and prosecution.  While I do not intend to list every measure being taken to address this issue, I will outline some of the more significant measures. In addition to those to which I have already referred, they include the establishment of a dedicated unit earlier this year in the Garda National Immigration Bureau and an awareness raising campaign aimed at the public and personnel likely to encounter victims of trafficking and training for law enforcement and other front-line personnel likely to encounter victims of trafficking.  To date, 1,124 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have received training in human trafficking and awareness-raising of this phenomenon, with a further 250 garda&iacute; having received training on tackling trafficking in human beings, prevention and protection, including training in the investigation of this type of crime.  Since last year more than 130 people from different Departments and agencies have participated in awareness training.  There also has been provision of accommodation, health care and material assistance for potential and suspected victims by the Reception and Integration Agency and the HSE in the case of adults and by the HSE in the case of children.  There also has been the provision of legal advice and assistance to potential and suspected victims of trafficking by the Legal Aid Board from the time of their first contact with GNIB all the way through to the end of the process for them.</P>
        <P>As I have already stated I do not wish to elaborate on every initiative or development that has been undertaken but I would like to take this opportunity to refute any suggestion that the State is not doing enough to assist victims.  In addition to the substantial grants made by my Department and the HSE to non-governmental organisations to support their work with potential victims of trafficking and women in prostitution, potential victims of trafficking can access a range of State services directly.  Contrary to what is sometimes alleged, access to services is not contingent upon a person co-operating with the authorities; the opposite is the case.</P>
        <P>Once a potential victim comes to the attention of the competent authority &mdash; which for cases of human trafficking is the Garda National Immigration Bureau &mdash; they are offered access to a range of services.  These include accommodation, health services, both medical and psychological, through a care plan based on their individual needs, and legal services provided by the Legal Aid Board.  All of this happens immediately the GNIB becomes aware of a potential victim and before a person has been identified by the garda&iacute; as a suspected victim of trafficking and granted a 60 day recovery and reflection period.  As Deputies are aware, the period was increased from 45 days to 60 days during debate on Committee Stage of the original Bill.  We are the higher end of the scale internationally with a 60 day recovery and reflection period.</P>
        <P>The Reception and Integration Agency accommodates potential victims and suspected victims of human trafficking referred by the Garda National Immigration Bureau both prior to and during the 60 day recovery and reflection period.  Both non-EEA and EEA nationals are accommodated by RIA.  A referral by GNIB is a sufficient basis for the RIA to accommodate the person.</P>
        <P>The Government is anxious that potential and suspected victims of trafficking are offered suitable accommodation and I am satisfied that the standard of accommodation in the RIA system is suitable for suspected victims of trafficking in the same way as it is suitable for asylum seekers.  RIA already has a package of supports in place for asylum seekers and is sufficiently experienced and flexible to meet the needs of potential and suspected victims of human traffick<Col N="808"/>ing.  When necessary, appropriate translation and interpretation arrangements are available to RIA, the HSE and GNIB to assist communication with a potential victim.  RIA reception centres also include a medical centre on-site managed by the Health Service Executive.  The HSE develops an individual care plan for each potential or suspected victim of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of concerns expressed from some quarters about the suitability of RIA accommodation.  Alternative models, it is claimed, offer greater anonymity, support and privacy.  However, the alternatives too may give rise to concerns, for example, that they might result in the isolation of victims.  One of the strengths of the RIA system is that RIA has experience in accommodating many people from diverse nationalities, races and backgrounds, each with differing needs and experiences.  I have consulted with both the Reception and Integration Agency and the Garda National Immigration Bureau who refer potential and suspected victims of trafficking to RIA and, to date, neither is aware of any substantial difficulties with this accommodation.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, it should be noted that accommodation providers in RIA centres are required, under contract, to ensure that accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and State agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food-hygiene, water supply, fire safety and general safety.  All RIA centres are inspected unannounced at least once on an annual basis by independent inspectors and they are also subject to twice yearly examinations by RIA staff.  Any diminution in standards which comes to the attention of RIA is immediately followed up and proprietors are instructed to make any changes and improvements deemed necessary. We will, of course, continue to work through the various consultative fora to which I referred earlier to develop and enhance services for victims in line with available resources.</P>
        <P>I would also like to take the opportunity to address allegations made in certain fora on traffickers recruiting persons from RIA reception centres.  It has been claimed that suspected victims of trafficking who are housed in RIA centres are being groomed and are open to being put back into the hands of the traffickers.  I understand from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it has investigated an incident where specific rather than general allegations of this nature were made.  It has informed me that following investigations there was no evidence to substantiate these allegations.  Furthermore, no statements of complaint have been forthcoming from the complainant or any other parties.  In the few situations where potential victims have expressed fears, whether well founded or not, they have been relocated to alternative RIA centres.  I urge anyone who has any such information or evidence to bring it to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation as a matter of urgency.  A crime prevention officer from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also liaises with potential or suspected victims to assess any security risk and advise them on appropriate precautions.</P>
        <P>In addition to the available health care services, there is an established link between RIA and the community welfare service &mdash; through the asylum seekers&rsquo; new communities&rsquo; unit of the HSE &mdash; which will assist potential and suspected victims in accessing necessary supports, particularly where suspected victims are moving out of RIA accommodation following the 60-day recovery and reflection period.</P>
        <P>The Legal Aid Board provides legal advice and legal aid to potential and suspected victims in accordance with the terms of the Council of Europe Convention and the UN Protocol.  Other protection includes the provisions in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which provides for a guarantee of anonymity of alleged victims of trafficking unless the judge fully or partially waives this in the interests of justice.  Under section 12 of the Act an alleged victim <Col N="809"/>of trafficking, with the leave of the court, will be permitted to give evidence through a live television link, from either within the State or abroad.</P>
        <P>I do not accept any suggestion that identified victims of human trafficking are primarily dealt with as illegal immigrants rather than victims.  This is simply not the case.  It is the State&rsquo;s policy not to remove any person from the country who may potentially be a victim of trafficking.  While the deployment of personnel and the assignment of areas of responsibility is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, I take issue with any suggestion that garda&iacute; in the national immigration bureau are unsuited to carrying out their mandate to protect victims of human trafficking because they also enforce Ireland&rsquo;s immigration laws.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a well deserved reputation for dealing with victims of all kinds of serious violence and trauma with sensitivity and understanding.  The suggestion that members of the GNIB would act differently because a person is a victim of human trafficking or is an irregular migrant is unwarranted and shows a lack of appreciation of the work done on the ground.</P>
        <P>On the trafficking in persons report, this contains many inaccuracies and does not take full account of the numerous measures that are in place, many of them being developed in consultation with the stakeholders, at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Show us the evidence. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.  The report states that Ireland provided limited protection and assistance to trafficking victims during 2008.  This is not correct.  It goes on to say that Irish officials referred trafficking victims to NGOs providing food and shelter or to immigrant detention centres.  Ireland does not have immigrant detention centres.  In another location, the report states that the Government provided temporary legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims during the reflection period.  Again, this is incorrect.  There are no circumstances in which an alleged victim would be removed from the State while a claim of trafficking is being investigated.  We very much take issue with the statement in the report that one of the leading anti-trafficking NGOs in Ireland publicly expressed concerns to the effect that the Government does not recognise all sides of trafficking.  This is a very serious allegation, implying official negligence and very bad faith.  I totally reject it on behalf of all those who work very hard on a daily basis in the Garda, my Department and in other State agencies as well as in other NGOs in this respect.  The report states another inaccuracy to the effect that the 2008 law criminalising human trafficking provides for extra-territorial jurisdiction over Irish residents who engage in child sex traffic tourism abroad.  Again, that is not correct.  Ireland has had legislation in that respect for more than ten years, the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996.  Again, I suggest, as with the case in the 2008 report by the US, that they need to get their facts right in these issues. </P>
        <P>Measures have been put in place in dealing with the status of victims of human trafficking in the State as set out in the national action plan.  In particular, administrative arrangements have been put in place, reflecting the provisions to be replicated in section 127 of the forthcoming Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which deal with the immigration protections to be afforded to suspected victims of human trafficking.  The arrangements provide for a 60-day period of recovery and reflection in the State.  In circumstances where the suspected victim wishes to assist with any investigation or prosecution arising, he or she may be granted one or more six-month renewable periods of temporary residence in the State.  These protections allow a victim of human trafficking to acquire a formal status in the State where required.  It should be noted that the 60-day recovery and reflection period is double that of the 30-day minimum set out in the Council of Europe Convention to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings and compares well with other EU member states.</P>

        <P>I now turn to the laws regarding prostitution and activities associated with prostitution.  In terms of current prostitution legislation, Ireland already has a range of laws in place to address this issue.  Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 it is an offence for a person to solicit another person in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  The offence can be committed by the customer, male or female, the prostitute, male or female, or a third party acting for them.  The related crimes of living on the earnings of a prostitute, the organisation of prostitution, procuring a woman or girl for prostitution, advertising brothels, the services of prostitutes and causing and encouraging the prostitution of a child are also criminalised under various items of legislation.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation that will make it an offence to have sex with a child under 18 years in exchange for money or some other consideration or by abuse of a position of trust, authority or influence over that child.  It should be noted that section 5 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 made it an offence to solicit or importune a person known to have been trafficked in any place, public or private, for the purpose of prostitution.  In such circumstances, a person who accepts or agrees to accept a payment, right, interest or other benefit from another person also commits an offence.</P>
        <P>On legal advice, a defence was included for a defendant to prove that he or she did not know and had no reasonable grounds to believe that the person in respect of whom the offence was committed was trafficked.  I will keep the laws on prostitution under review and monitor the position in other countries.  If there is reason to believe that I need to change the law I will bring forward proposals in the usual way.  The public debate now emerging on whether the so called Swedish model would have the effect of reducing demand for prostitution will prove useful in that respect.</P>
        <P>I am fully aware of the UK proposal in a policing and crime Bill and which provides for punishing those who pay for sexual services of a prostitute, subject to force, coercion or fraud.  It will be a strict liability offence.  That is to say, ignorance of the fact that the person knew or ought to have known that any of the prostitutes activities were controlled for gain or were subject to force, deception or threats will not be a defence.  I understand that the Bill received royal assent last Friday.</P>
        <P>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operational measures also address prostitution &mdash; as has been evidenced by initiatives such as Operations Quest and Gladiator, which resulted in convictions and sentences, and the current ongoing Operation Abbey, a joint UK-Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na-Northern Ireland-Welsh operation as a result of which a person is currently before the courts in Wales.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In regard to the issue of setting up a high level group specifically to examine the laws concerning prostitution and extending the brief of the anti-human trafficking unit to include migrant women in prostitution, I have asked the trafficking unit in my Department to examine the ICI report, &ldquo;Globalisation, Sex Trafficking and Prostitution -The Experiences of Migrant Women in Ireland&rdquo; and to report back to me.  I await that report and will decide then on what further action should be taken.  During its second year of operation of the Dignity Project, an EU funded multinational, multi-agency research project into victim protection and care in the field of trafficking in human beings, the Irish partners might like to consider this proposal, including the use of some funding for study visits, and revert with their views in due course.  One of the Oireachtas committees, perhaps, might access some of that funding, to find out the position in some other countries, particularly in relation to issues of prostitution, for instance, in Sweden, and see what has happened post-change there in that respect.</P>
<Col N="811"/>
        <P>On the issue of prostitution, incidentally, for me to change the law, it would be necessary to be satisfied that any change would be in the interests of prostitutes and not leave them open to even greater exploitation by pimps, or not make it easier to induce young boys or girls into prostitution or increase the dangers being experienced by prostitutes by driving prostitution further underground or expose them to an even more violent type of client who would not be put off by changes in the law.</P>
     
        <P>Again, I respectfully suggest that we should look at the experience in Sweden.  My Department will do so, as perhaps could an Oireachtas committee with some funding in that respect from the Dignity project.  Against this background, the suggestion made in the motion about a high-level group is somewhat premature at this stage.</P>
         <P>I do not stand before the House tonight to claim that everything the Government is doing is perfect and needs no change.  I accept that legislation should be reviewed on a constant basis as this issue is particularly new to Ireland.  This is the reason I have been committed to launching the national action plan.  I believe it is a living document, which should be kept under review, updated and subject to a mid-term review as is provided in the plan.  Against this background, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak about this important issue.  The debate on human trafficking and on prostitution tends to be clouded by emotive argument often based on preconceived opinion rather than on evidence or practice on the ground.  I will seek to expand on some of the points made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and base my contribution on evidence and practice on the ground.</P>
        <P>At the outset, I wish to address the claim that the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, is not the appropriate division within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle trafficking and that authority in this matter should be given over to the Garda organised crime unit.  As the Minister noted, the deployment of personnel and the assignment of areas of responsibility is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, trafficking is an extremely complex phenomenon that overlaps a range of issues such as irregular migration, international organised crime, political and economic instability in countries of origin, among others.  It is an over-simplification of the issue to suggest that trafficking in human beings can be dealt with solely by law enforcement authorities charged with investigating organised criminal gangs.  While certainly there are numerous links between trafficking and organised crime, trafficking is intrinsically linked to migration as it usually, but not always, involves the movement of persons from one State to another and on balance is therefore best dealt with by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, which has particular expertise in the field of migration.  Moreover, a dedicated unit within the GNIB, namely, the human trafficking investigation and co-ordination unit, has been established.  This unit has the responsibility to provide advice, support and where necessary operational assistance to investigations undertaken at district level throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>The decision to give responsibility for the investigation of offences of human trafficking and the establishment of a dedicated unit for the investigation of human trafficking, in particular, took into consideration the links between the cross-border movement of persons and the identified links between the immigration process and human trafficking.  The GNIB already has responsibility for international co-operation on breaches of immigration law.  While the GNIB has primary responsibility for the investigation of immigration crime and human trafficking, the GNIB also is part of the national support services, which is comprised of other national units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda technical bureau and the operational support unit.  All of the above units and the specialist services <Col N="812"/>within them are available to the Garda National Immigration Bureau or any other district or division in the course of an investigation.</P>
        <P>It also should be noted that approximately 350 garda&iacute; throughout all the Garda divisions will have received in-depth training on tackling human trafficking, prevention and protection and in the investigation of crimes involving human trafficking by the end of this year.  This training is delivered by the International Organization for Migration in co-operation with the GNIB.  The United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre also contributes, and probably uniquely in a Garda training course, NGOs working in the areas of trafficking of human beings for sexual and labour exploitation contribute to the training by offering their perspective and experiences.  This training is in addition to the more than 1,100 garda&iacute; who have received basic training on awareness raising.</P>
        <P>I now will turn to claims regarding the low number of victims and no prosecutions.  Claims have been also made that few victims of trafficking have been identified and that no prosecutions have been forthcoming.  I assure Members that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made concerted efforts to make certain that victims are recovered and protected and that traffickers are brought to justice.  I have noted when attempts are made to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-trafficking activities that far too much emphasis is placed on the number of prosecutions made and the convictions obtained on foot of these.  This fails to acknowledge the substantial work done in other areas, such as preventative action taken against traffickers, co-operation with other law enforcement authorities to tackle trafficking on an international level and the range of support services put in place to assist victims.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 came into force on 7 June 2008 or approximately 17 months ago.  While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is actively investigating cases, they are complex, time-consuming and notoriously difficult to prosecute.  By way of example, one person who has sought access to the recovery and reflection period and who wanted to tell her story took five different sessions to do so.  The typed report of her comments amounted to more than 55 pages.  Since then however, the person in question has reverted to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has made an additional statement to the effect that she was not telling the truth in her original statement and that the person who she stated was her friend is in fact her alleged trafficker.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not surprising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe this example gives some indication of the complexities in the work done by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of trafficking.</P>
        <P>In order to address issues such as these, I have been informed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a thorough and internationally recognised system of victim identification is in place.  All information that is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the time the case is being considered is taken into account.  To enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to establish what indicators of trafficking are present, it is necessary for the person alleging trafficking to be interviewed.  The outcome of this interview assists the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in being satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is a suspected victim of human trafficking.  Ultimately, to make a decision and to progress any investigation into such allegations of a criminal offence, possibly contrary to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to document the allegations in a statement.  While &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; are not the same as evidence, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be in possession of sufficient information to afford reasonable grounds for that belief.  Where there is insufficient information for the detective superintendent to have reasonable grounds for believing that a person is a victim of suspected traffick<Col N="813"/>ing, the case remains open and every effort is made to gather additional information from the potential victim or other sources.  The National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland 2009-12 provides for the development of a memorandum of understanding between key stakeholders to take place over the lifetime of the plan.  Identification may be one issue for which a memorandum of understanding could be considered.</P>
        <P>I will now move to investigations.  In 2008, 96 investigations were commenced where human trafficking was alleged or suspected.  Sixty investigations relate to suspected breaches of the provisions of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, while 36 investigations relate to suspected breaches of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  Provisional figures for 2009 indicated that up to 9 November, 57 incidents have been recorded by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the category of human trafficking offences, 37 of which relate to possible offences under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, 18 to possible offences under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 and the remaining two to possible offences under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  In the cases in question, 31 of the persons involved have made a claim of asylum and as a part of their claim have alleged that they were the victims of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>A small number of files are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on whether to prosecute.  At present one case is before the courts in which a person is charged with a human trafficking offence under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 in respect of the trafficking of a child for sexual exploitation.  A total of 11 persons have been identified as suspected victims of human trafficking on the basis that there is reasonable grounds for believing that he or she was a victim of an offence under sections 2 or 4 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  Five persons have been granted a temporary residence permission, which is valid for a period of six months from the date of grant.  Two of these have been granted a second six-month temporary residence permission and three are in their first six month period of a temporary residence permission.  Six persons have been granted the 60-days recovery and reflection period to which the Minister referred previously.</P>
        <P>Account must be also taken of international co-operation undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While in many cases, due to the international nature of this issue, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will engage in investigations, sometimes of a comprehensive nature, but the arresting, charging and convicting of suspects will take place in another jurisdiction.  Three persons have been transferred under the European arrest warrant system to other EU states, including one who is a suspected international child trafficker who is due to stand trial in the Netherlands this month.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau has forwarded significant bodies of evidence gathered in the course of investigations to the law enforcement authorities in other jurisdictions that has directly contributed to the initiation of trafficking related proceedings.  In particular, it has supplied such evidence to Romania, the UK, Italy and the Netherlands.  I hope my contribution to this debate has provided some insight into the complexity of the work of the dedicated team in the Garda National Immigration Bureau in the area of human trafficking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to support this Fine Gael motion.  I congratulate Deputy Naughten on assembling the motion and using Private Members&rsquo; Business to ventilate a subject that, as Deputy Connaughton said, is too frequently swept under the carpet.  There is, however, a growing awareness of this issue.  I have had the opportunity in the past year to address meetings in Cork, Sligo, Kilkenny, Galway and Dublin about this issue.  I have the impression that even if relatively few have informed themselves on the subject, they <Col N="814"/>are doing so and there is a growing awareness of the change taking place in the character of prostitution in Ireland.  More people are coming into contact with people from outside this jurisdiction who have been trafficked here for the purposes of labour or sexual exploitation.  This subject has rarely been dealt with in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If there is one woman trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation, or indeed labour exploitation, into this country, it is one case too many.  We know that human trafficking is not a phenomenon that excludes Ireland, even if we do not have especially extensive data in this area.  This motion reproduces the key statistics from the Immigrant Council of Ireland report, to which the Minister referred, entitled Globalisation, Sex trafficking and Prostitution.  The figures are not wildly different from those contained in the study done by Dr. Eil&iacute;s Ward of NUI Galway and Dr Gillian Wylie of Trinity College.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform concedes that it does not have reliable data on the extent of trafficking in our jurisdiction but says: &ldquo;it is likely to have been a relatively minor activity but has the potential to grow&rdquo;.  Since it made that comment there is more information available that challenges the claim that the phenomenon is relatively minor.</P>
        <P>Belatedly in 2008 the Government moved to comply with its international obligations when enacting the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act.  Apart from bringing us towards compliance, the parliamentary process had the merit of ventilating a phenomenon in Irish society about which there is still a great deal of ignorance.  We know that sex trafficking, defined in international law by the 2000 Palermo Protocol, involves the use of force, fraud or coercion to transport an unwilling victim into sexual exploitation and is a lucrative racket dominated by international crime networks.  Ireland is not immune from this racketeering in human beings.  Those trafficked are mainly young, vulnerable women often fleeing poverty in their countries of origin or deceived into seeking a better life on the false undertakings of the criminal networks involved in trafficking.</P>
        <P>The new legislation creates a criminal offence of trafficking persons into, through or out of Ireland for the purpose of their sexual or labour exploitation.  During the course of its passage through the D&aacute;il, the Labour Party tried to focus on the need for the protection of, and provision of services to, victims of trafficking.  We were convinced that the trafficking of young women for purposes of exploitation is quite separate, and should be kept separate, from issues that arise in the context of immigration, yet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform chose to make a partial response to our claims in the context not of the human trafficking Bill but rather in the context of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>Human trafficking cannot be appropriately addressed in the context of immigration legislation.  Such measures as are now offered in this context will require to be monitored rigorously.  I hope the Minister will use Report Stage of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill to insert, in particular, special provisions for under age persons.  The right of minors to services ought not depend on co-operation with a criminal investigation or prosecution.  I agree with everything Deputy Naughten said about children&rsquo;s rights and the need for protection for children in this regard.</P>
        <P>Only a few weeks ago I was indebted to the Minister for his assistance in dealing with a trafficking case that presented at my clinic.  This involved a case of a woman trafficked into domestic labour seven days a week, commencing at 6.30 a.m. for six of those days until 11 p.m. for &euro;120 per week.</P>
        <P>I support the measures proposed by Deputy Naughten in this motion, to end the policy of placing victims of human trafficking in asylum centres and introduce independent accommodation, support and protection services.  The proposal to extend the period of recovery and <Col N="815"/>reflection as defined in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 is a matter on which I sponsored an amendment on Committee Stage and I hope we can improve on it on Report Stage.  One of Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s main objectives is to move the focus on human trafficking from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to the Garda organised crime unit.  He seeks to extend the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s anti-human trafficking unit to include migrant women in prostitution and to establish a high level group to examine our prostitution laws with a view to preventing the proliferation of sex trafficking.</P>
        <P>It is timely that we would examine the modern character of prostitution and its connection to the phenomenon of human trafficking and criminality and what steps ought to be taken to address the issues that arise.  I had the opportunity a few months ago to meet a senior Swedish politician, courtesy of the organisation Ruhama which does excellent work at the coalface.  She detailed to me the progress made in Sweden as a result of the recent decision to criminalise the purchase of sex.  I have also read material that is equivocal on the outcomes in Sweden and is fearful of the implications of driving prostitution further underground.</P>
        <P>My attention has also been drawn to an extensive analysis in <i>The Guardian</i> by Nick Davies which disputes the scale of trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation into the UK.  He develops at some length his thesis that the minimal research available is distorted.  Time does not permit me to go into detail on that now but his views are vehemently contested in the UK.  Therefore, I welcome the proposition to establish a high level group with appropriate professional support that can assess conflicting evidence and analyse the available literature, including the Swedish experience and the legislative measures currently contemplated in the UK.  That way I hope we will not have to re-invent the wheel but get the best from the Swedish and British practice.  The establishment of the anti-trafficking unit must put the State in a better position than it has been in up to now, particularly with experience garnered.</P>
        <P>A distinction must be drawn between victims of human trafficking who require help, care and protection and migrants, whether legal or illegal.  Listening to the Minister, I was not persuaded he accepted that distinction.  There is a major gap between the Minister&rsquo;s perception of the operation of existing procedures in this area and the experience of persons working at the coalface.  I hope tonight&rsquo;s debate will bring renewed efforts by the House to address a phenomenon that oppresses and degrades women in our society irrespective of their country of origin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Rabbitte as a gcuid ama a roinnt liom.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in broadly supports the Fine Gael motion.  In many respects, it does not go far enough in demanding the introduction of real, effective measures to combat human trafficking and to protect the victims of this odious crime.  While Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s human trafficking legislation, it believes it did not go far enough.</P>
        <P>While progress has been made in this area, the Government&rsquo;s predictably self-congratulatory amendment makes reference to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  The State has not even ratified that convention.  There is nothing in the Government amendment suggesting that it plans to.  Just as we were the last EU state to make human trafficking an offence, we are now lagging behind the 26 other Council of Europe members that have already ratified the convention.  It is a shameful distinction and one that the Government should reverse immediately.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the plans to extend the recovery period to 60 days, up from the 45 days currently provided for in the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill.  Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s Committee <Col N="816"/>Stage amendments called for a 90-day period although that is not reflected in the Fine Gael motion.  The amendment that Deputy Finian McGrath submitted in my name called for it to be extended to six months.  I repeat that call.</P>
        <P>When someone has been through such a traumatic experience, it is simply unrealistic to expect them to recover from it quickly.  Sixty days is an improvement on 45 but it is still insufficient if the aim is to provide genuine assistance to these victims rather than to use them to gain prosecutions only.  It must always be remembered that these are the victims of an odious crime.</P>
        <P>By the same token, it is crucial the recovery period not be made dependent on co-operation with the Garda.  Many victims are simply too traumatised.  Often they may have genuine and understandable fears about co-operating with the police due to the nature of policing in their home countries.  There is also a real risk in some cases that co-operation could put themselves or their families in danger.  Traffickers often keep their victims in line by means of threats to their families or to themselves if they ever return home.</P>
        <P>There are also young people trafficked by family members or family friends who exercise authority over them which, due to cultural factors, the young person may not feel able to defy.  There are several reasons why a trafficking victim may not co-operate with police but this does not negate their human right to a recovery period.</P>
        <P>This is made clear in the convention which states that the personal situation of the victim should also be taken into account.  It was also noted by the expert group on trafficking in human beings, established by the European Commission in 2003, which advised:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">those trafficked persons who do not wish to testify as witnesses &mdash; or are not required as witnesses, because they possess no relevant information or because the perpetrators cannot be taken into custody in the destination country &mdash; require equally adequate protection and assistance as victim-witnesses.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Recovery should be a central objective of government policy in this area.  The national action plan, referred to in the amendment, is weak on supports for trafficking victims. In many cases these people have been raped, beaten, tortured and abused.  It is unclear how their needs for legal assistance, safe and secure housing, social supports, interpretation, translation, counselling and suitable medical care are to be met.  This assistance must be provided to victims, regardless of their willingness to act as a witness in any proceedings against those responsible for their trafficking.  We would welcome the support of victims in any proceedings against the perpetrator but it should not always be compulsory.</P>
        <P>Human trafficking can encompass a wide range of forced activities.  The Fine Gael motion concentrates on sex trafficking but there are other forms.  Around the globe, and undoubtedly in Ireland, significant numbers of people are trafficked to work in the domestic sector, the agriculture and catering industries.  I commend the Migrant Rights Centre for the excellent work it has done in exposing these practices, but the extent of trafficking for forced labour is still under-recognised.</P>
        <P>The head of the British human trafficking centre, North Yorkshire Chief Constable Grahame Maxwell, recently stated more people are trafficked for labour exploitation than for sexual exploitation.  I am not sure whether that is the case in Ireland.  However, as long this type of trafficking is overlooked there will be many cases that go undetected and with dire consequences for its victims.</P>
        <P>The Government could take a significant step toward ending this practice by signing and ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers <Col N="817"/>and Members of their Families.  This has been in force since June 2003 and is the only one of the core UN human rights treaties that the State has not signed.  In defending its refusal to sign, the Government continues to hide behind the Common Travel Area.  Anyone who has tried to enter this State from Britain in the past six or seven years knows that the Common Travel Area is dead in the water.</P>
        <P>Greater attention also needs to be paid to the trafficking of children not only for sexual exploitation and forced labour but also for begging and petty theft.  The International Organization for Migration has noted a marked increase in this problem across Europe in recent years.  A report published by the Swedish national criminal police earlier this year described how what appears to be a family unit consisting of two adults and two to three children will travel from country to country, with the children being sent out to do the begging or stealing because they can usually avoid prosecution.  The report stated the children are trained from an early age not to co-operate with the authorities which reinforces the point I made earlier about the need to separate co-operation from the granting of a recovery period.</P>
        <P>Again, the extent of this type of trafficking in this State is unclear but it merits investigation, particularly in view of the unfortunate comments recently made by a judge about certain parents raising their children to steal.  There are children being raised to steal, undoubtedly, but it may not be their parents doing the raising.</P>

	<P>The forthcoming budget is being framed at a very difficult time for families.  These are particularly tough times for the more than 400,000 people on the live register &mdash; some of whom are working greatly reduced hours and some of whom have lost their jobs.  Many of them have long years of employment behind them and never thought that they would be out of work.  Many are young graduates who worked hard to get the points for college and to get good qualifications in the expectation of starting their careers immediately.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I am acutely conscious of the needs of the 412,407 people who were on the live register at the end of October 2009.  I also fully understand that a wide range of other groups &mdash; such as people with disabilities, carers and pensioners &mdash; depend on the welfare budget for vital support.  I assure the House that this Government has done and will continue to do the very best it can to protect the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade there have been very significant increases in welfare payments.  The State contributory pension has increased from &euro;113 to more than &euro;230 per week; the weekly rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance has been raised from &euro;93 to &euro;204 per week; child benefit has increased from &euro;44 to &euro;166 per month.  We have provided increases in welfare rates that were far in excess of increases in both prices and wages.  Even throughout the economic difficulties of the past two years, the Government has done its best to prioritise social welfare.  The October 2008 budget provided for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates at a time when inflation for 2009 was expected to be 2.5% and in reality, prices have dropped considerably this year.  By September 2009, prices &mdash; as measured by the consumer price index &mdash; had fallen by 6.5% and are now forecast to drop by an average of between 4% and 5% for <Col N="818"/>the year.  I appreciate it is important to consider not just the overall change in the consumer price index but the impact this could have on individual groups.  To that end, the Department of Finance has carried out a technical analysis which suggests that between September 2008 and September 2009, the CPI fell by approximately 3.25% for retired households; 5.75% for unemployed households; and 7.5% for working households.  Prices fell by about 7.5% for the highest income decile and 5.25% for the lowest income decile.  Therefore, while decreases in the cost of items like mortgages and cars would naturally have had a greater impact on higher income families, the overall cost of living has also dropped significantly for pensioners, for the unemployed and for low income households in general.</P>
        <P>In framing the April supplementary budget, very tough decisions had to be made across the whole range of Government expenditure.  In that context, the provision of &euro;21.3 billion for social welfare services in 2009 &mdash; 20% more than the amount spent in 2008 &mdash; was a clear demonstration of our commitment to protecting the most vulnerable people in society.  Tax rates and borrowing had to be increased to fund this extra expenditure on social welfare.  We know from the pre-budget outlook that if we do nothing next year, just to cater for the increased numbers under all the various headings, that budget will go well beyond &euro;22,000 million next year.  Unfortunately, that is not a sustainable position.</P>
        <P>In framing next month&rsquo;s budget, the Government is facing very difficult choices.  We know we must reduce expenditure by &euro;4 billion next year but we also know that there is no easy or pain free way of doing this.  Social welfare spending makes up the largest single block of Exchequer gross current voted expenditure, accounting for 37% of the total, at just over &euro;21 billion this year.  Public pay and pensions, at &euro;19.8 billion, accounts for 35%, while other programme expenditure, not including pay, at &euro;15.8 billion, accounts for the remaining 28%.  The scale of the savings required from public expenditure as a whole means that some reductions will have to be made in the social welfare area.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that any decrease in welfare spending may be hard for people to cope with.  However, if the Government does not take steps now to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances, we risk making the economic situation far worse for everyone, including welfare recipients, in the long term.  It is clear that excessive borrowing and an unsustainable increase in the national debt will hamper our ability to fund social services, including welfare, in the future.  We must find an appropriate balance between protecting the most vulnerable people in the short term and taking necessary action to avoid prolonging our country&rsquo;s current economic difficulties.  To that end, I assure Deputies that our deliberations on the welfare budget are not just being informed by analysis and proposals from groups such as the Commission on Taxation, the McCarthy group, the OECD or the ESRI.  They are also being influenced by the understanding that each of us has -not just as Ministers but also as constituency TDs &mdash; of the real difficulties facing families at this time.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I have met a wide variety of groups recently to listen to their views about the forthcoming budget.  The very successful pre-budget forum attended by nearly 30 different groups gave them an opportunity to voice their concerns and to give their views on the budget.  I have also met separately major groups representing national interests such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, the Disability Stakeholder Group, the National Women&rsquo;s Council, Accord, the Carers Association and the Family Support Agency Network.  Each has genuine concerns about the needs of the people they represent and genuine worries about the future.  I assure Deputies that the views of these and other groups have informed my Department&rsquo;s consideration of potential budget measures.</P>
<Col N="819"/>
        <P>The Government has not yet made a final decision on the welfare budget and I would welcome any suggestions from Deputies as to how expenditure by the Department of Social and Family Affairs could be reduced, with a view to protecting social services in the longer term.  The scale of the current crisis demands much from us as public representatives.  It demands that Government and Opposition Members put aside any concerns about political popularity and be frank and open with people about the choices that must be made.  Pretending to be all things to all men will not help to get this country back on track.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael spokesperson on finance stated earlier in this debate that we cannot leave the social welfare budget immune.  However, he has so far refused to set out any proposals that deliver significant savings in welfare spending.  I look forward to genuine engagement and to hearing real proposals, not empty rhetoric.  That is what the people deserve at this difficult time.</P>
        <P>Child benefit is one area where there are proposals in the public domain.  The rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 &mdash; having trebled for the first two children and increased by more than 185% for the third and subsequent children.  Overall expenditure on the scheme grew from just under &euro;965 million in 2001 to nearly &euro;2.5 billion in 2008 and this year approximately 12% of all social welfare spending will go on child benefit.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Taxation recommended in principle that the payment be taxed, while the McCarthy group recommended an across the board cut in child benefit payment rates.  The issues involved in either taxing or means-testing the payment for everyone are complex.  For a start, we would have to determine the household income of all 600,000 families who currently receive the payment.  While the household income of married couples who are jointly assessed by the Revenue would be readily available, the joint income of cohabiting couples would be much harder to determine.  I am conscious that child benefit payment has made a significant contribution towards reducing child poverty.  I am also conscious of those young working couples who are stretched with mortgages and with difficulties with employment and who perhaps are not on social welfare but whom also have great need of their child benefit payment.  The Government is still considering the potential options and no final decision has been made.  I am trying to find the fairest way of achieving savings while protecting those on low incomes as much as possible and not penalising any group too much.  I appreciate the value of that money to very many people.  To reassure people, I reiterate that no final decision has been made.  I look forward to hearing the views of other groups who have yet to speak.</P>
        <P>The best way to reduce overall spending on welfare is to keep as many people as possible in work and get as many as possible back to work.  To that end, the Government has focused increasingly in the past two years on labour market activation measures.  My Department is co-operating well with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with initiatives such as the back to education allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance.  New programmes such as the short-term enterprise allowance and a work placement scheme, which are specifically designed to meet emerging needs in the current environment, have been introduced.  I assure the House that the Government will do all it can to support employment.  We will do all in our power to ensure that every last cent of taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent as efficiently and effectively as possible.  However, we must also act now to avoid excessive borrowing and get the public finances back on track in the interests of everyone, including those dependent on the welfare system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Neville, Creed and Clune.</P>
        <P>Given the limited time I have, I wish to speak on only one issue, which is the air travel tax.  Since it was introduced by the Government in last year&rsquo;s budget it has left a trail of destruction.  Even in July, the height of the summer season, trips abroad by Irish residents were down 11.3% compared to 2008, while the number of overseas visitors to Ireland fell by 9.1% in the same <Col N="820"/>period.  Meanwhile, US Airways, Delta Airlines and CityJet have all left Shannon Airport.  The trail of destruction, however, does not stop there.</P>
        <P>The tax is counterproductive.  While it may have brought in about &euro;60 million up to the end of September, how much revenue has been lost to the Exchequer as a result of its introduction?  Defending the introduction of the tax, the Minister of Finance said that our UK neighbour also has a travel tax.  However, the Minister needs to get real.  We cannot compare ourselves to the UK.  Around 61 million people every year use London Heathrow Airport, which is an international hub serving the whole world.  Ireland is an island nation which is very much dependent on air access, and our economy is dependent on tourism.</P>
        <P>The reduction in visitor numbers to Ireland means lost bed nights for hotels and bed and breakfasts.  It means less VAT for the Exchequer because of falling revenues and less money being spent on tourist attractions, car hire and so on.  Everybody is hit by it, from the taxi driver who picks up passengers at the airport to the local shopkeeper.  It has a major knock-on effect.  When the year-end figures are published in the new year they will reflect another significant decline in passenger numbers at our airports.  It looks highly likely that Ryanair will not do a deal with Shannon Airport Authority and will base just one aircraft at the airport, with the loss of hundreds of jobs and an increase in the number on social welfare.  I am concerned that Ryanair will simply leave and attempt to increase its traffic at UK destinations.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to imagine the devastating effect this would have on the region.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance cannot ignore the situation.  Airlines, airports, the tourism sector, hotels and even the Government&rsquo;s own tourism strategy group have joined forces to condemn this tax.  I am tired of listening to the same old rhetoric that the Government cannot intervene in aviation matters.  This is the one area over which the Minister for Finance has control and for which he has the solution in his own hands.  If the economy in the mid-west region is to get back on its feet, the Minister must axe the tax.  The ball is in his court.  I ask him not to score another own goal but to give the airports a break.  A compromise must be found here; otherwise, the tourism industry will suffer.  I ask the Minister to axe this tax in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I am extremely concerned about the recommendation in the McCarthy report that &euro;50 million be saved in the area of mental health and disability.  The situation with regard to mental illness and suicide is serious in recessionary times.  Studies and experience since the 1890s have shown that the incidence of suicide and psychiatric illness increases during recessions.  The director general of the World Health Organisation, Margaret Chan, stated earlier this year that in times of recession, &ldquo;it should not come as a surprise that we continue to see more stresses, suicides and mental disorders.&rdquo;  The director of the WHO&rsquo;s mental health and substance abuse department also stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">There is a clear evidence that suicide is linked to financial disasters.  I am not talking about the millionaire jumping out the window but about poor people.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The potential psychological impact of economic recession on mental health is severe.  Job loss, job insecurity and uncertainty, economic strain, loss of income, home repossessions and restricted access to credit lead to a reduction in mental well-being, an increase in mental health problems and ill-health, increased substance misuse, especially alcohol and drugs, and intimate relationship breakdown and divorce.  There is a loss of perceived social worth and a loss of purpose and daily structure, a reduction in social contact and an increase in social isolation.  Increases in suicidal behaviour &mdash; both self-harm and completed suicide &mdash; occur.</P>
<Col N="821"/>
        <P>We saw this week statistics showing an increase of 43% in suicides in the first three months of this year.  In addition, the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork has reported an increase in attempted suicide and self-harm since the recession began.  People who are unemployed are two to three times more likely to die from suicide than those in employment.  I heard today a statistic from a senior person in the HSE that for every 1% increase in unemployment there is a 0.79% increase in suicide.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Minister to ensure there is no reduction in funding and that there is an increased contribution in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The economic downturn has been felt more harshly in the agricultural sector than in any other sector to date.  The Teagasc farm income survey, which has attracted little attention in this House, showed that incomes in the agricultural sector across all product enterprises collapsed in 2008 by 13.7% on average.  To take examples from particular sectors, the average income for family farms in the beef sector is &euro;7,700.  It is anticipated by Teagasc that the 2009 farm income survey will show a further collapse of the order of 20% on top of the existing fall of 13.7% in 2008.  No other sector has suffered as much as the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P>My point is about the agricultural budget in 2010.  While I accept that no Department is exempt from the search for savings and efficiencies &mdash; I recognise that many possible savings have been identified in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, particularly by the McCarthy report, and these should be pursued &mdash; the simple message I want to send out is that the Government should keep its hands off the farm gate schemes.  There is absolutely no scope for further cutbacks in farm gate schemes in the agricultural budget in 2010.  There simply is not room for manoeuvre.</P>
        <P>A false economy that has been pursued by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is the discontinuation of REPS 4.  This is despite the commitment in the programme for Government to maintain participation in the scheme at 70,000.  The net effect of that decision will be to force thousands of farmers onto farm assist which, unlike the REP scheme, is 100% funded by the Exchequer, while the REP scheme is co-funded by Europe to the tune of 45% or 55%.  I implore the Government not to come looking for savings at farm gate level.  However, there is certainly room for efficiencies in the overall budget of the Department, and the Minister could usefully pursue these.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>In the next budget, it will be important to protect existing jobs and encourage the development of new jobs.  This is a general statement that many people have made, but it is important in view of the actual cost of unemployment to the Exchequer.  The ESRI estimates that up to half the gap between Government income and spending will be bridged if we can help people on the live register to get back to work.  Every additional person in work will cut &euro;20,000 from our borrowing as a result of the additional taxes and lower social spending that will result.  This is why there must be a focus on protecting and promoting jobs.  Our lack of competitiveness must be addressed if we are to protect those jobs.  We must help employers to continue in business and encourage future investment, both indigenous and foreign.  It is equally important to encourage indigenous businesses.  </P>
        <P>In 2000 we were the fourth most competitive economy in the world.  We have slipped now to 19th position.  Poor infrastructure, high energy costs, lack of broadband and transport have contributed to our lack of competitiveness.  There is a lack of efficiencies in Government and in delivering Government services.  In the last budget the Minister offered a list of the quangos <Col N="822"/>he intended to amalgamate and reduce.  As a simple example, the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority were to be merged into one but we have heard nothing since.  That is a simple example of how the Government has not shown leadership, direction or the bottle to deliver on that.</P>
        <P>We need to see in the budget a clear sense there is a plan, that we know where we are going, and, very important, that the current generation of unemployed young people will be catered for.  In the main it is young people who are caught in the awful scenario of high debt and negative equity.  Some of these people are paying dearly for properties and will continue to do so for a long time.  Many cannot afford to do so now and some are dependent on the State for mortgage interest relief.  These are our vulnerable young people.  There are also those in our education system, our colleges and schools.  We need to tell them that things will be different, that Government services can and will be efficient and that this nation can and will return to be among the top in the world league in terms of competitiveness.</P>
        <P>That is how the Government must direct us.  I encourage the Government to look at the benefits that have resulted from investment in research and development and from innovation projects.  That is the key to our future.  If we wish to be up there competing at that level with other nations we need to continue to support the effective investment that has been in place in research and development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this pre-budget debate.  For some considerable time the Government has announced its intention to reduce the budget deficit by &euro;4 billion next year.  Earlier today the Minister for Finance indicated that the scope for increases in taxes is minimal and that reductions in expenditure will be the priority on this occasion.</P>
        <P>Over the last 12 months the Government has moved speedily to address the difficult economic situation which the country faces.  As well as additional budgetary measures to tackle the deteriorating budget deficit, it has also had to deal with the banking crisis and the establishment of NAMA to handle the toxic assets crippling the banking sector.  It has been a difficult period for the country on several fronts but it is widely recognised that this Government has moved with conviction and resolve to begin to address the problems besetting us at this time.  We have implemented corrective measures amounting to 5% of GDP.  We have agreed to reduce our budget deficit back within the EU 3% limit, by 2013-2014 and have had this plan approved by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Already, we are beginning to see concrete results.  Labour costs are expected to have fallen by 7% this year, relative to our EU partners.  High levels of unemployment represent real hardship for many families but while unemployment is at a high level there was a drop in unemployment in October, which is welcome news.  The unemployment figures impact on the budgetary situation in two ways, by increasing social welfare costs and reducing tax income.  Therefore, any improvement, however small, is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s exports continue to perform well and our balance of payments may move into surplus next year.  A number of other factors are a further source of encouragement.  A recent business sentiment survey indicated that Irish companies reported stronger levels of activity, felt more optimistic about the economy and were more up-beat than at any time since the survey started in late 2007.  Elsewhere, an economist with the IMF recently indicated that the recovery has started while our Central Bank has suggested that our economy may be over the worst.  Furthermore, the Government ratified the Lisbon treaty, ensuring that our commitment to Europe is perceived as being back on track.  This should help to maintain foreign direct investment in this country.</P>
<Col N="823"/>
        <P>However, this is not in any way to diminish the unprecedented fiscal challenges we still face.  The budgetary difficulties can be illustrated in stark but simple terms.  We are spending in the order of &euro;22 billion more than we are generating in tax revenue.  This situation is unsustainable in the longer term and further action needs to be taken now if this problem is to be resolved in the medium term.  Some have argued for taxation increases but the Government considers this approach alone is likely to have a deflationary impact, with income from taxation already contracting.  It appears there may be a year-on-year decline of 20% in tax revenue.  Although the Commission on Taxation has produced its report there appears to be a consensus in some quarters that any new taxes introduced should replace rather than complement any existing taxes already in place.  In any event, we have increased personal taxation in the past 14 months so the scope for further increases is not realistic.  Furthermore, any increases are unlikely to assist in maintaining jobs that are often already under threat.</P>
        <P>In promoting economic recovery, the Government is committed to achieving a fully functioning banking sector and bringing sustainability to the public finances.  To achieve these goals, reductions in public expenditure are required across all Departments.  No Department can escape because all have benefited from the increased revenue available over the last decade.  When we examine the fruits of the last decade, we see new transport and other infrastructure, increased and enhanced social welfare payments, greater numbers of teachers and special needs assistants, additional nurses and garda&iacute;.  However, if the current budgetary situation is to be resolved &mdash; as it must be &mdash; then all aspects of public expenditure will need to be re-visited.</P>
        <P>My own Department of Education and Science will not be immune from the examination process.  However, the recently re-negotiated programme for Government has re-affirmed the commitment that education remains a priority for this Government.  I welcome that the Government has agreed in general that there will be no further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio.  I wish to highlight that there are mechanisms open to schools to apply for additional resources, for example, in cases where they are experiencing large increases in enrolment.  There are independent appeals mechanisms for allocation of teachers, including language support teachers.  Five hundred additional posts will be available that can be targeted at schools with larger classes.  However, I stress that funding for these additional teachers will need to be considered in the context of overall funding available to the Government for 2010.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo; Keeffe, has introduced a number of measures in the past year which have been the subject of some attention.  However, the determination of the Government to protect scarce resources for education can be demonstrated in two areas where my Department has received concessions in the past year.  The Departments of Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs were fortunate to get an increase in allocations in 2009.  In addition, when the Government introduced a moratorium in the public service, a special arrangement again was made for the Department of Education and Science, which prioritised the filling of teacher and special needs posts, a privilege not extended to all other Departments.</P>
        <P>While the programme for Government emphasises the priority of investment in education, difficult choices still must be made by the Cabinet.  My Department of Education and Science, a high-spending Department, will not be exempt but will play a part in the overall budgetary corrective measures, while protecting, in so far as is possible, most vulnerable citizens.</P>
        <P>I turn to the area of lifelong learning.  In view of the high level of unemployment, education and training become critically important, not only in responding to the immediate challenge but also in securing our long-term recovery.  Late last year the Government  published its framework document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy, which outlined its strategy to drive an enterprise economy, improve competitiveness, establish Ireland as an innovation hub and  encourage <Col N="824"/>research and development while also promoting renewable energy and the creation of green-collar jobs.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Skills will be the engine behind a new modern knowledge-based economy.  The national skills strategy sets out clear goals and objectives with regard to upskilling the workforce over time.  Speaking as the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are adopting an integrated approach to a number of activation activities.  A range of measures have been introduced to expand services to the unemployed and to promote a flexible learning environment tailored to the specific needs of the individual.</P>
        <P>The Government will focus on resolving the budgetary situation while continuing to give consideration to maintaining and improving supports for the unemployed.  Since the beginning of the year, substantial additional resources have been directed to doubling job search capacity, providing more training places and supporting redundant apprentices and those wishing to avail of third level studies while improving the back to work enterprise allowance and back to education allowance schemes.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to implement innovative measures to support the unemployed in accordance with its overall strategy as outlined in the smart economy document.  It will also ensure that, despite the need for difficult expenditure reductions across all Departments, it will achieve maximum impact from available resources for those losing their jobs.  The forthcoming budget is likely to implement many cost saving exercises that will have far-reaching consequences, but the Government will find the resources to see that those in education and the unemployed will continue to receive the supports required despite a diminishing fund of resources.</P>
        <P>To listen to Members of the Opposition speak in this debate, one could get the incorrect impression that those motivated by compassion are only those who sit on the opposite benches.  Nothing could be further from the truth, but the Government must be committed to taking the difficult measures now to improve our budgetary situation and to help stimulate a more competitive economy.  We have not been and we will not be found wanting in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Deputy Lee will share time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeorgeLee"><NameTxt>Deputy George Lee</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, with Deputy Connaughton.  The pre-budget outlook document, the basis of this evening&rsquo;s debate, outlines an amazing economic disaster as eloquently as any document could.  We went from having a current budget surplus of &euro;9 billion in 2006 to borrowing, according to this document, &euro;26 billion this year.  Without any changes, we will borrow &euro;20 billion by next year.  This is an economic disaster of monumental proportions for a country that was doing so well.</P>
        <P>As all budgetary documents are these days, this one is a multi-year document.  It shows how budgets will progress in the years to come.  The document on the 2008 budget forecasted that 2010&rsquo;s tax revenues would amount to &euro;55 billion.  Much has happened since and income taxes have increased by almost &euro;4 billion.  Even then, we will only get &euro;30 billion next year according to this document.  Given the target of &euro;55 billion, this is a catastrophic drop of nearly 50% on the country&rsquo;s revenue.  Adding &euro;4 billion to &euro;55 billion should have given us &euro;59 billion.</P>
        <P>The people who led us into this situation are asking us to trust them to lead us out of it.  They are also asking those of us on this side of the House what they should do.  It is incredible.  Trust is at the heart of this issue, but the country has seen a bonfire of trust.  No one can trust the numbers of the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank or the Department of Finance.  No one can trust them in terms of their stewardship of the economy, since this document states <Col N="825"/>that they blew it.  The Departments of the Taoiseach and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are just as responsible for economic management in terms of the direction of the economy and the country.  Nowhere in that apparatus could we place our trust in the hope that what we were about to do in terms of cutbacks could lead us to somewhere positive.  It is difficult to believe the same people are asking us to enter into this venture and help with the choice of who should pay the price.  The Government must believe that people are stupid.</P>
        <P>There has been bad management of the economy, with structural imbalances the likes of which no economy could have endured.  No one else would have done nothing about them, but the Government tended to ignore them in recent years.  With the collapse of the construction sector, we have gone from being able to make up any number for the economy and the taxes would come through to a situation in which a contraction of 1% in the economy leads to a decrease of 3% in taxes.  It is an incredibly bad situation.  We used to have a great deal of money in the kitty.  It still has some money, but we are &euro;26 billion short.</P>
        <P>Now, people are supposed to pay for that incompetence and we are supposed to tell the Government who will pay.  The Government must have some neck to expect people on this side of the House to go along with this idea.  The Government and everyone around it are responsible.  In terms of who should pay the price, the Taoiseach is responsible.  He was Minister for Finance for the four years prior to this economic catastrophe.  He did nothing about the economic imbalances at the basis of the report.  He sits at the head of a Government that wants the Opposition to point out the way forward.  What a neck.  No one is that stupid.  Someone should pay, that is, the Taoiseach.  In this context, following the Government is difficult.</P>
        <P>The Government brought Ireland into the single currency with great support from all sides of the House.  However, this meant different rules of engagement with regard to economic management.  When the country hit a recession, there would only be one way of making adjustments, namely, via the labour market.  These rules were written large when we threw away economic instruments like interest rates and currency movements.  It was important to manage the economy correctly.</P>
        <P>We are in our first deep recession since entering the single currency and the only way out is through the labour market, that is, higher unemployment rates and pay cuts.  This seems to be how economies adjust.  It is certainly how the Government is pushing it, telling people in the public sector and elsewhere that they must take pay cuts.  The threat is that, if they do not take those cuts, the IMF will come in and make big decisions for us.  This is complete rubbish.  The IMF will not come into Ireland because it does not enter regions of economies and Ireland is a region of a single European economy.</P>
        <P>Europe is calling the shots.  When it tells the Government to give &euro;54 billion to the banks, the Government says, &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;.  When it tells the Government to reduce borrowing to 3% of GDP by 2013, the Government says, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;  It is a question of who is running the country and what decisions are being taken.  The idea that we would be told to reduce the deficit to 3% by 2013 or all hell would break lose did not convince me in the first place.  It is already clear that this target is movable for Europe.  The target is now 2014.  What Europe is asking us to do in terms of adjustments it has never asked of any other economy.</P>
        <P>The report refers to a deficit of &euro;26 billion, &euro;13.5 billion of which is not related to the day-to-day running of the economy.  In terms of our collapse, this equates to approximately 7% of GDP.  This is not off the scale at all, but we are being told that we must crucify all sectors of the economy because we are supposed to live up to someone else&rsquo;s desire to have us crucified to a 3% deficit of GDP by 2013 or 2014.</P>
        <P>Page 23 of the report relates to capital expenditure.  It states that the Government will spend 4.5% of GDP on capital investment through the years until 2013.  By that time and at 4.5% for <Col N="826"/>capital investment, we will have a deficit of 3%.  This means that we must have a surplus on our day-to-day running of 1.5% of GDP by 2013.  Despite unemployment being the way it is, with immigration taking off and people being crucified left, right and centre through pay cuts, we are supposed to run the economy with a surplus.</P>
        <P>The idea of economic stabilisers is important.  It is also important that we be realistic about the cuts for which we are asking.  The only cuts that are really important are those that Fine Gael proposed today, namely, cuts in employer PRSI.  Jobs should be put at the centre of our economic adjustment so that we can have employment, not the long-term consequence of following a blind mantra on cutting everything because someone else says so.</P>

	<P>I have little time, so I have only two pieces of advice for the Government.  However it manages the budget, I hope that it will not make the hames of it that it made of the past two, which were patently unfair for the worst off among us.  The Government has all the figures at its disposal and one could not foresee again that it could make such a hames of a budget.</P>
        <P>I know as well as everybody else in the D&aacute;il tonight that we face a significant problem.  We know that it will be a budget the likes of which we have not seen.  Whatever else, if the Government wants to bring people with it, at least be fair.  I always say that the broader the shoulder, the greater the load, in other words, those who are able to carry the load financially are the ones who should be asked to do it.  The Government did not do that on the last occasion.</P>
        <P>My final point was mentioned a moment ago by Deputy Lee.  Whatever else it does, the Government must ensure that the job creation policies are put in place.  Please God, we will find ourselves in a competitive state in the next year or two.  All of the factors would seem to indicate that we will be able to produce much more competitively in the next couple of years due to the downward pressure on prices of goods and services.  We should at least be in a position to make the most of it.</P>
        <P>On job creation and the smart economy, I see no reason why wind energy, wave energy and the like would not be able to support import substitution, and that we will not be able to create thousand of jobs in consequence with a consequent improvement in the balance of payments.  This is an opportunity for the Government on budget day to put the building blocks in place on that.  It takes courage and imagination, both of which qualities the Government does not possess in abundance, but I sincerely hope it will catch on to it on this occasion.</P>

	<P>Every reasonable person recognises &mdash; Fine Gael and the Labour Party have lately come o the same conclusion &mdash; that we must make the saving of &euro;4 billion.  On stating that it might be over two years, we all know it must happen in 2010 otherwise we get further into the quagmire, our borrowings will increase and the rate of interest on those borrowings will increase because those who lend us the money will not be as supportive as they have been in the past.</P>
        <P>In this debate I have listened to Members of the Opposition consistently ask us to listen and give them the opportunity to put forward their ideas.  I heard the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance state that they would gladly welcome ideas.  Tonight we did not get one idea other than the bland assertion that the Government created the problem.  Whoever we lay the blame on, we are where we are.  It does not resolve the difficulties for those who are unemployed, it does not reduce our balance of payments and it does not get us one cent towards the &euro;500 million that we borrow every week.</P>
        <P>In terms of solutions, I want to state in this House what I stated in the public domain about child benefit, which costs &euro;2.5 billion.  High income earners who do not have any child care costs should pay their contribution in the national interest, yet Fine Gael says that it will not touch, means test or even tax child benefit.  On the other hand, I the Labour Party says it wants to tax the rich, yet it wants to give the rich child benefit at substantial cost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We know all that.  What does Deputy Kennedy say?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>

	<P>What does Deputy Kennedy say?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying that the rich should not get child benefit.  Those earning over &euro;100,000, if they have no child care costs, etc., have enough income to make their contribution to the crisis that Ireland is in.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>How does Deputy Kennedy know?</P>

	<P>I want to hear the Deputies opposite to outline their tax proposals while at the same time advocating we can hand out substantial money totalling &euro;2.5 billion at a time when the country is borrowing so much.</P>
        <P>On the overall tax assessment situation, surely it is reasonable to suggest that those who earn &euro;150,000, &euro;200,000, &euro;250,000, or &euro;500,000, or maybe those who are lucky enough to earn &euro;600,000 in income, should pay something towards the crisis that their country is in.  That is reasonable.  It is time Fine Gael and the Labour Party owned up to that fact rather than making populist remarks that may go well in Dublin South or North Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe there are no rich people down there, but there are many horsey people who have had substantial incomes.</P>
        <P>We need honesty in this debate.  The people no longer deserve to be given false hope that they will not pay tax and they will not suffer wage reductions.  Some &euro;4 billion is a substantial figure.  Those without a job who I have met, who have come into my office and clinics, tell me that those on high incomes and those who have jobs should be willing to share the pain.  That is a reasonable proposition in the context of where we are today.  It is more than reasonable to ask anyone who has a permanent job with a pension, whether a civil servant, a public representative or otherwise, to make some contribution to the State&rsquo;s finances.</P>
        <P>In terms of the budget, I want to state clearly that the less well-off in society should be protected.  I have no difficulty in saying that the old age pension should be left untouched.  The same goes for the carers and the less well-off in society.  I make no bones about that.  I have said it at our parliamentary party meetings.</P>
        <P>However, those of us who are lucky enough to have jobs must take a little bit of the pain in the national interest.  On the suggestion that we run a budget deficit next year of over &euro;20 billion, it is bad enough that this year there will be a deficit of &euro;25 billion, &euro;26 billion or whatever the outturn.  On suggesting we continue that for the future, Deputy Lee knows international bankers better than, or at least as well as, I do and they will not be as accommodating, in either providing the finance or in giving us a reasonable interest rate, which they are currently doing.  He will be aware that all of the international bodies which rate the credit worthiness of countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I was deeply disappointed in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  The Minister had an opportunity of explaining a number of choices that he has obviously made so far, but chose not to address them.  For example, why has he decided not to seek from taxation a portion of the &euro;4 billion to which he referred?  Nor has he explained the logic that led to the April financial statement and how it has changed so fundamentally in the preparation of the budget in three weeks&rsquo; time.  One of the most upsetting things about this debate is its evasive quality.  It is not a debate about where we want to be economically.  Nor is it a debate about a new form of social economy with a better balance between taxation and services, favouring job creation through green jobs, recognising the work of carers and the immense potential of creative industries.  It has been negative in that respect.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to see the order in which the Minister put the Government&rsquo;s priorities in his speech.  He began by saying he is ensuring that we will have a properly functioning banking system, taking steps to ensure that our public finances are stabilised.  He then referred to international competitiveness.  He mentioned unemployment almost as an oversight.  The social consequences of being &ldquo;where we are&rdquo;, the phrase that is regularly used now, include low incomes, poverty and a lack of job opportunities.  Some 15,000 to 18,000 young graduates will be added to the astronomical unemployment figures.</P>
        <P>There is, however, a certain revelation in the Minister&rsquo;s poorly prepared speech.  On 26 March 2009, he answered Parliamentary Question No. 59, which I tabled.  I asked him about such proposals as he may have had for gathering income from wealth.  He replied:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I have been informed that no general research has been carried out over the past ten years by either the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners regarding the extent and breakdown of wealth as opposed to income.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is interesting to note what we should be discussing in the Oireachtas if one had decided, for example, that one was not going to touch non-productive capital.  That is political economy, which is important.  One may differ as regards ratios, but as regards what is to be gathered from taxation, a balance must be achieved through a reconfigured capital programme or reductions in expenditure.  The speech told us nothing about those matters, although it did have a few clich&eacute;s on taxation.</P>
<Col N="830"/>
        <P>The history of wealth tax proposals is interesting.  I was around when it was attempted before.  It has never been opposed in any country on the basis of its yield, but has always been opposed on the basis of what it revealed.  Those who have written articles and academic papers on the subject take that position rather quickly.  If there is to be no contribution from non-productive capital, what has been happening?  The tax concessions that were made in coming to the current position are very interesting.  According to the Revenue Commissioners, in 2003, two thirds of those who invested in hotels and holiday camps had incomes of over &euro;200,000.  In 2004, annual tax reliefs cost us &euro;8.4 billion, which was 22% of total taxation.  In 2003, the Revenue Commissioners told us that three individuals among the top 400 paid no income tax at all because of tax breaks.  Some 48 had an effective tax rate of less than 5%.</P>
        <P>Something has been done about this, however.  According to figures produced by the Minister last July, it was suggested that, as a result of changes, the top 25 people earning over &euro;2 million each had an average effective tax rate, after application, of 20.45%.  I could cite more statistics like those, but I will simply summarise the position.  Those who benefited from this raft of McCreevy concessions, which have rolled on to the present Taoiseach&rsquo;s time, were a very narrow group of people.  People in the street and those attending my clinics ask me what has happened to all the money.  As we know, by 2004, some &euro;8.5 billion had been spent on property abroad by Irish owners.  The Minister now says he is leaving all that alone, that he can only look at expenditure cuts and it is going to be &euro;4 billion.  The media then join in and say the function of the Opposition is to produce where their cuts might be in relation to this &euro;4 billion from expenditure.  It is nothing of the kind.  My function as an elected representative is to ask if we are trying to get back to where we were nine years ago.  Let us accept that we had a disastrous failure in regulation and a disastrous banking policy.  In addition, we had a property bubble which completely distorted the State&rsquo;s revenue income.  Are we going to try to get to a new place in the economy and forge a new connection between economy and society, such that we will be willing to debate in Parliament the line below which people should not sink?  That is politics and what we are elected for.  We are not here to dance to some miserable tune.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that the cut must amount to &euro;4 billion, as the Government states.  It is a long time since I was teaching economics but I am still aware of the dangers of turning a recession into a depression.  Where every job is costing between &euro;25,000 and &euro;30,000 and there are associated employment-related costs, the Government&rsquo;s slash and burn approach to the economy is increasing the gap it is trying to bridge.  In 2007, 214 high net wealth individuals were subject to an effective tax rate of 20.08%.  It is outrageous for the Government to say it is seeking a consensus on leaving that rate intact.   The mindless character of the slash and burn approach to economic redress is such that it results in job destruction.</P>
        <P>I know the creative industries well.  The figures produced by Indecon&rsquo;s recent study show the Arts Council represents a better multiplier than that associated with the money spent in respect of the IDA.  The Arts Council, through its funding, is responsible for the direct employment of 2,042 people.  Council funding amounted to 40% of the total revenue for supported organisations.  The total employment figure is 3,034.  If one were to include publishing, video, music, etc., one would note the number employed through very modest grants amounts to 16,689.</P>
        <P>When I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, with responsibility for film, among other things, I noted how rich this area was in skill.  The mindless acceptance of the McCarthy report proposals would be devastating in that it would wipe out a growth area.  The value of the creative sector in the eurozone is &euro;564 billion and this figure is increasing.  It is the fastest growing sector in the eurozone, yet it is suggested our function in the House is not to speak about the future form of the economy, the jobs in the creative industries or applied technology <Col N="831"/>through science, or those that would exist if we decided to address the issues associated with caring.</P>
        <P>If one asked me directly whether I wanted Scandinavian levels of service and taxes and whether I would be in favour of forms of redistributive taxation that would include a tax on accrued and unproductive wealth, I would reply in the affirmative.  We should get to a new place and I do not see why we should wear ourselves out in a narrow stupid debate about what cuts one would propose, in which debate one would say, &ldquo;Show me your cuts&rdquo;.  It is a vulgar piece of rubbish and a poor excuse for an economic debate three weeks before the budget.  We have had enough of it and I hope Mr. Charlie McCreevy never comes back to Ireland to see the destruction he presided over.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Is maith liom &eacute;isteacht leis an Teachta Michael D. Higgins mar b&iacute;onn go leor ruda&iacute; speisi&uacute;la le r&aacute; aige.  T&aacute; feals&uacute;nacht an-l&aacute;idir aige agus n&iacute; thiocfaidh salach ar chuid mhaith den tuairim&iacute;ocht at&aacute; aige.  I share his belief that we must have a view on where we are going and a vision of Irish society.  His vision and mine may not be exactly the same but we share a number of ideas.  Arts, music, culture, the Irish language and community are very important.  When making our decisions, we must keep them in mind.  On the other hand, we must face the hard economic reality that if, as in a household, one continues to spend more than one earns, one must keep borrowing the difference.  If one keeps borrowing the difference, the interest will eventually consume one and one will spend all one&rsquo;s money paying it.</P>
        <P>There is a wide consensus &mdash; perhaps the Labour Party is part of it &mdash; that we must close the gap by approximately &euro;4 billion next year.  There are two way of doing so.  One is to raise more revenue and the other is to cut expenditure.  Cutting expenditure is problematic in that it results in cutting revenue at the same time.  If, for example, the Government cuts expenditure, thus resulting in the loss of jobs, it loses the taxes accruing from those jobs and may have to pay for social welfare.  With regard to increasing taxes, it is not necessarily true that if one increases tax by a certain percentage, one will receive that percentage in extra revenue.  This is because one reaches the point of reducing returns.  This is where the debate must lie.</P>
        <P>Many advocate taxing the well off more.  At present, taking the various levies and income tax into account, we have a marginal rate of 53%.  Will somebody tell me what he considers the cut-off point above which he believes one can pay more than 53%?  Is it the equivalent of the combined income of a married nurse and garda or the combined income of two assistant principal officers in an apartment?  If so, one is talking about an income well over &euro;100,000.  One must ask how much tax one would raise even if one did decide to go towards the Scandinavian model really dramatically and adopt an effective rate of 63% at the top end.  What would the net yield be in a year if one did so?</P>
        <P>It is very handy to advocate not hitting the middle-income earners and hitting the high income earners without defining what is meant by &ldquo;middle income&rdquo; and &ldquo;high income&rdquo;.  The more one defines the two married assistant principal officers in an apartment or the married nurse and garda as not being in the high income bracket, the less revenue will accrue from income tax.</P>
        <P>The other big source of tax in this State is VAT.  Many would argue that we are at a point where, if the VAT rate were increased, more people would shop over the Border.  Therefore, raising the rate is not the equivalent of increasing income and doing so does not solve the problem.</P>

	<P>Up to &euro;3 million.  I have no doubt but that if these exemptions were made, the retail sector would come into question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>

	<P>One would not have much of a shop for &euro;1 million.  Sinn F&eacute;in would probably argue on another occasion there are too many taxes on the productive sector, including small businesses.  Deputy Morgan will find that, when he does his sums, he will not be raising a great deal of money when he takes all the inevitable exceptions into account.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  Therefore, the Deputy agrees with my theory.  This is a useful debate because we are getting cohesion in our ideas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>When it comes to expenditure cuts, if people say not to cut social welfare and public service wages, that leaves one with approximately &euro;22 billion in which to do all the cutting.  If one does that, the result is Garda cars with no petrol and hospitals with no bandages because one cannot keep taking the money out of the service delivery area and leave all the rest intact.  They are the hard facts.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate because it provides an opportunity for Members to tell us how they intend to make up the &euro;4 billion.  Every day we hear groups agreeing the cuts are necessary <Col N="833"/>but not to cut them, please.  That is not the reality.  Therefore, we have some difficult decisions to make.  It is important that in the debate speakers put the figures on the table.  I would love for Members to point out where in the Book of Estimates we should change the figures and how they would make the saving.  It is great to talk in generic terms, as Fine Gael often does, about eliminating waste.  However, every time we present a budget Estimate to Fine Gael Members and ask them to show us the waste and suggest where to make cuts, they always disagree and say such a scheme is a marvellous one and that the cut should not be made there.  They suddenly find that there is not as much waste to be eliminated from the system as they claimed.  It is important for Members of the Opposition to say where the waste is and under what heading, and that one can provide the same service by reducing the budget head by such an amount.  That is what it comes down to at the end of the day.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>When one does it that way one then has to face up to the reality that it is not that easy and that one has to make the hard decisions.  Then the Opposition will find its own Members arguing, as they do with us all the time, that no heading should be cut, that all the savings should be made in a vague theoretical exercise to eliminate waste without ever identifying where they see the waste.  If there is waste in the system, it might not be so easy to eliminate it.  I am talking about waste one can eliminate.  It is an impossible notion that one will ever get a perfect system with workers who are perfectly efficient, do everything in a perfect way and there is no waste, or that we would have more than 250,000 people working in the public service always focusing on the work.  Life is not like that.  There is a certain amount of inefficiency.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is possible.  I have inquired of small employers with ten or 15 employees whether any of them are not working to their optimum efficiency and they admit that is the case.  I worked in the private sector for years.  I worked in productive industry and manufacturing.  Of course some people are more efficient than others.  Anyone who tells me that his or her staff work at full tilt all the time never worked in business and never produced any goods.</P>

	<P>It is now 9.45 p.m. and we will finish the debate at 10 p.m.  It is a matter of getting the three speakers into the 15 minutes.  Perhaps the Deputies would take three or four minutes each.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the budget and to highlight some vital issues on which I would like to see improvement.  I have listened to the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  The one thing I would ask the two Ministers present to take back to the Cabinet is the importance of giving people hope.  People have read reams of newspapers and listened to endless stories about how bad the economy is.  Their minds are made up in that regard.  People want and need hope.</P>
        <P>In my constituency more than 8,500 people are unemployed.  A total of 1,888 people under the age of 25 are unemployed.  People in my constituency are leaving this country every day for destinations as far away as Australia and America.  They have no hope in this great country of ours.  I am proud of this country, as are many people.  Past generations were given hope, but there is no hope for the many people in this country who are unemployed.  What has been missing from this debate is what the Government is going to do about job creation.  The harsh reality is that if people do not have jobs they cannot pay the taxes the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, was talking about.  They cannot rear their families and go about doing the ordinary things in life.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, is responsible for job creation but she has not put any thought into addressing people&rsquo;s need for jobs.  A stimulus package is a simple way to take many thousands of people off the dole.  People could be engaged on small, productive projects that are needed in communities and in the education sector.  Schools are in need of repairs and there are many efficient and able persons <Col N="835"/>who could be given a chance to do that work, but the Government has not put anything on the table in that regard.  Do I have more time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate it if the Deputy would co-operate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should do something for the people of this country, especially the young people, in terms of job creation in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Coveney to confine himself to three or three and a half minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to listen to Ministers speak for ten minutes and say little or nothing when one has a lot to say and one only gets three minutes to say it.  I wish to focus on one element, which I hope the T&aacute;naiste will take on board.  She heard Deputy Bruton speak earlier about some of the hard decisions we are willing to take to reduce expenditure.  I wish her to focus on the opportunities that exist for radical reform.  The breadth of the thinking I have heard from Government is purely around revenue raising through taxation, and expenditure cuts through pay cuts and cuts in social welfare.  There are numerous things the Government can do to reform the way we do things, to sweat State-owned assets in a far more effective way, and to get more from less.</P>
        <P>We have put forward proposals on a radical reform agenda and restructuring process for the semi-State companies we own which are responsible for much of the uncompetitiveness in the Irish economy in terms of energy prices, water prices, broadband provision, infrastructure provision and so on.  We can change that by changing the delivery process for those elements that are fundamentally important to getting growth going again in the Irish economy and putting a new platform in place where we can grow a new economy.  We are not doing that.  The ESB needs reform.  Bord G&aacute;is needs reform.  It may no longer need to stay in State ownership.  The way in which we deliver water to business and to households must change.  We spend &euro;1.2 billion every year delivering water and 43% of the water leaks out of our pipes into the ground, yet we are not looking to reform that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Dublin people would not pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is missing the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not missing the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason that is so inefficient is that 34 different local authorities deliver water in their localities.  For a small country we have no economies of scale, no sharing of bureaucracy and no delivery system that is centrally controlled.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to examine some of the constructive suggestions on fairly radical reformation thinking in terms of the semi-State and the public sectors so we can get more from less or at least get more from what we already have by bringing about restructuring and taking on some of the sacred cows the Minister seems to view as being off the table.  We must take these measures to try to get people back to work, get stimulus back into an economy and get competitiveness back on the agenda in a real way.  I ask the Minister to examine the opportunity in crisis for real reform rather than looking at simplistic cuts and taxation measures, which seems to be the limit of Government thinking and particularly the Taoiseach&rsquo;s thinking.</P>

<Col N="836"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The release of the pre-budget outlook last week sets out the parameters within which we must all work when considering budgetary decisions.</P>
        <P>We all know that Ireland has experienced an extremely challenging 18 months.  The pre-budget outlook reflects that.  The global recession has had a particular impact on small, open economies, such as that of Ireland, more so than others.  Allied to the severe contraction of our domestic construction sector, that has placed enormous pressure on the Irish economy and on our fiscal position.  Considered decisions, therefore, many of which will not prove popular, are required to address these challenges and return our economy to a sustainable growth path.  This Government has already taken such decisions, and I can assure the House that it will continue to face up to the challenge that such decisions present as we near the budget of 2010.</P>
        <P>I have heard nothing from the benches opposite this evening that would convince the public that the parties opposite are prepared to address comprehensively the realities of the position the country is in today.  For example, Deputy Bruton talked about transforming government and the way we do things.  I agree with him.  We, in government, are committed to public sector reform.  We have taken steps to rationalise government and further measures will be announced in the budget but what we need now is &euro;1.3 billion savings in public sector pay.  No reform or transformation will provide that saving in the immediate term.  That is the issue any party in government would have to focus on, and the Opposition cannot escape that reality.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton also spoke about the importance of protecting young families.  We agree with that but in a time of scarce resources surely he would agree that we must distinguish on the basis of need.  Resources must be concentrated on those most in need if we are to advance equity in this country.  At a time of growing birth rates we simply cannot afford to leave child benefit outside of our budgetary considerations.  If Deputy Bruton was on this side of the House, he would do exactly the same thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeorgeLee"><NameTxt>Deputy George Lee</NameTxt>
	<P>No, he would not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Meanwhile, Deputy Burton expressed her support for the Government&rsquo;s position on the undesirability of high marginal tax rates by describing them as a nightmare.  I welcome her conversion but I note she did not spell out the detail of the third tax rate that has previously featured in her party&rsquo;s policy statements.</P>
        <P>While there would appear to be broad agreement that we must correct the public finances, we have heard nothing from the Opposition to assist in stabilising the general Government deficit.  The Deputies opposite need to realise that to delay such necessary action can only prolong the agony required to achieve economic recovery.  Already, we are borrowing approximately &euro;500 million every week to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue.  This mounting burden translates into larger debt interest payments, which ultimately erodes the Exchequer&rsquo;s discretion on spending decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should tell us something we do not know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies opposite must realise that the Irish people live in the here and now.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The revisionist history lessons and the refrain of &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t start from here&rdquo; are no longer credible with the public.  The general public realise the scale of the <Col N="837"/>challenge we face.  They are facing it day in and day out as they search for employment and struggle to manage their finances.  If the Deputies opposite are sincere about their desire to assist unemployed people find a job and see Ireland return to the path of economic recovery and growth, it is time for our national debate to hear their proposals &mdash; real proposals that reflect the realities of our economic position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have a single idea?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have many of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not have a single idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>For our part, the path we have adopted to address the issue of budgetary sustainability has been backed by international organisations such as the Commission, the OECD and the International Monetary Fund.  To take the apparently softer path of delaying actions as advocated by some would also mean that confidence would be lost both domestically and internationally in our ability to manage our economic affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister sounds like a commentator rather than someone in power to make decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Through taking clear steps to arrest the deterioration in the public finances we will signal to international investors that the Irish Government possesses the ability to take necessary decisive action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Equally, at home, reducing budgetary uncertainty&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>After all it has done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;would have a positive effect as individuals and companies will have the confidence to increase their spending or decide to expand their enterprises.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the forthcoming budget can most effectively contribute to economic recovery by way of support for the export-orientated enterprise sector.  Ireland can only regain its ground lost through harnessing the skills base and intellectual capital of our people and target it at creating innovative solutions and products that the world will want to buy.  By selling abroad, we create jobs and income at home.  That export income will then trickle down through the local economy, sustaining new jobs in the local traded services that we can choose to avail of every day.</P>
        <P>Our overseas markets are slowly starting to recover.  International organisations such as the IMF and the OECD have upgraded their global economic growth forecasts in recent months.  We have already seen signs of that in Germany, France and Japan, for example.</P>
        <P>Significant challenges remain, however.  Although our economic prospects are improving, we still face negative growth this year and at least for part of 2010.  Despite recent encouraging trends, high rates of unemployment are expected in the medium term.  The rise in unemployment and the increasing financial pressures has placed a heavy toll on individuals and households.  Many of those still in employment have had to take pay cuts and there are still uncertainties to be faced before our economy recovers.</P>
<Col N="838"/>
        <P>We will continue to limit the rate of unemployment through targeted activation measures, creating a higher skilled and better educated workforce that will drive Ireland forward in the next decade.  How many minutes do I have remaining, a Cheann Comhairle?  Is it only three?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>About two and a half minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Coveney complained about the time.  I know how he feels, having only two minutes to discuss very important issues.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness continues to be a major issue.  I do not disagree with Deputy Coveney on the issue of energy costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Minister intend to do about it?  She should give us something to chew on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On competitiveness, we have seen a reduction in energy costs although more remains to be done in that regard.  There has been a reduction in labour costs.  We are reducing the regulatory burden on business.  We are looking at new innovative ways of supporting business.  Competitiveness is a real issue and will continue to be a focus because our competitiveness is recovering.  Prices, rents and wages are dropping.  That will place us in a better position internationally but we will continue to have more work to do.</P>
        <P>We have been remarkably resilient in our exporting sector.  It is important to say that this year we will have a 2% increase in our export potential.  That is hugely important and is indicative of the right policies which are to concern ourselves with the export opportunities that are available.</P>
        <P>That will be done on the basis of the implementation of the smart economy document.  Targeting our research and development skills and venture capital is hugely important to creating our own smart economy and indigenous industries.  The change we have seen in our indigenous and foreign direct investment companies towards sustainability and growth in the context of research, development and innovation is huge.  The Deputies will see that the smart capital aptitude in this country will continue to create new opportunities.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The opportunities available will be high value, innovative and within the green technology sectors.  I established the High Level Group on Green Enterprise in May of this year with a number of key initiatives.  I agree with Deputy Coveney that we must cut through certain parameters to allow that to happen.  I am determined that will happen in the context of access to the grid, for example, and other new ways in which existing companies in particular can reduce their energy burden in the context of the green tech opportunities here and in lean manufacturing.</P>
      
        <P>Activation continues to be hugely important.  We have had some very good discussions in this House on new measures of activation.  It continues as very much a platform the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Education and Science and I to ensure we have appropriate responses and that we are developing, upskilling and dealing with the needs of the unemployed, a seismic task but one in which we have seen some change and some innovation.</P>
        <P>On sustaining people in employment, we have seen the employment subsidy scheme.  The first tranche of that has now been sanctioned, with a spend of &euro;68 million.  At the end of this week and beginning of next week, I will be advertising a further tranche of the employment subsidy scheme, along with the stabilisation fund, which has been hugely important and welcomed by those within industry.</P>
<Col N="839"/>
        <P>The emphasis in my Department has to be on sustainable employment, improving competitiveness and safeguarding the future living standards of this country.  None of that can be done without taking particularly difficult decisions and those are ones which we will continue to debate and consider prior to 9 December.</P>

	<P>On Wednesday 11 November, there was severe flooding in areas of Cork, such as Togher, Rochestown, Passage West, Glenbrook, Monkstown, Carrigaline and Ballygarvan.  There was damage to housing, public property, roads and an alarming situation materialised in Glenbrook, when a stream burst it banks, the water running down a road and sweeping 12 cars with it.  They literally flowed down the hill.  It was a highly dangerous situation where someone could have been injured or killed.  Fortunately, no one was, one of the better notes of the disastrous situation that happened last week in the area.</P>
        <P>I have looked at the OPW website and there was similar flooding in the Cork region in November 2002 and October 2004.  On both those occasions, there was heavy rain, of the order of 40 millimetres.  Last week the Met Office reported rainfall of up to 19 millimetres.  On both the previous occasions there was also a high tide.  This time we did not have a high tide, it was about 6 p.m. and a high tide was not due until midnight.  It is important to acknowledge that the cause of the severe flooding was totally land-related.  There have been reports of gullies not being cleaned and capacity problems in the infrastructure.</P>
        <P>People want to know now what steps will be taken by Cork County Council and the OPW to compensate those people whose property was damaged.  We need to know in the Cork region the cause of the problem and what must be done to ensure it will not occur again.  Looking back at the previous reports on flooding on the area, they refer to a lack of capacity but we need a full, in-depth report on what is going wrong and why these areas are susceptible to such severe flooding.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, launched a flood risk report in Cork earlier this year and he said he was sure the people of Cork would consider it entirely appropriate they set a standard for the country.  The standard set last Wednesday night was not one that should be reflected across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister of State has some good news for us this evening.  A number of families in my constituency and in Deputy Clune&rsquo;s constituency are still clearing muck out of their living rooms and kitchens following flash floods last week because of exceptional weather conditions and which, in some cases, simply washed away road infrastructure, as happened out towards Minane Bridge, south of Carrigaline.</P>
        <P>There are plenty of precedents where the OPW has made emergency funding available to compensate people and assist them to put basic infrastructure in place to ensure this will not happen again if we get similar torrential rainfall.  A total of 19 millimetres fell during a three hour period, the floods were nothing to do with the tides, which are often a problem in the harbour area in Cork, this was pure water volume flowing out of fields on to roads and over blocked gullies, and there is a responsibility on the part of the local authority to rectify the situation, which it is starting to do.</P>
        <P>There is also a responsibility on the OPW to put in place basic compensation for people in some cases for damage that insurance simply does not cover.  In Glenbrook, seven or eight cars <Col N="840"/>literally flowed down the street because of a mud slide, with much of that mud flowing into people&rsquo;s gardens and houses.  Those people need help and even in tough financial times we are not talking about huge amounts of money.</P>
        <P>It is important that the OPW recognises, as it has done in the past in the Carrigaline area, that when there are extreme weather conditions, when the infrastructure simply cannot deal with them and when there is significant damage as a result, it should step in and not only carry out a survey so we know what caused the problem and try to rectify it, but that in the immediate term it should give people some redress or some compensation.</P>

	<P>In the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who must travel to a Council meeting in Brussels, I thank the Deputies for giving me an opportunity to come into the House to discuss the serious flooding in the Cork area in the past week.</P>
        <P>Locations in a number of counties have been affected by serious flood events in recent weeks and the impact on the communities in the Carrigaline, Rochestown, Glenbrook and Minane Bridge areas of County Cork was severe.  Having previously visited locations where extreme flood events occurred, the Minister of State is aware of the devastation and hardship caused by flooding.  He is pleased to have the opportunity to place on the record of the House his personal sympathy and concern and that of the Government for those affected by flooding.  It is only by seeing such events at first hand that it is possible to get a full sense of the hardship and worry that flooding causes.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the local road infrastructure primarily rests with Cork County Council.  The role of the Office of Public Works is to work with local authorities and other State bodies to reduce the risk of future flooding both through the provision of defences to best practise standards and by taking steps to mitigate or reduce future risk of flooding.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the OPW and Cork City and County Councils jointly initiated a major study in 2006 to assess the degree of flood risk in the Lee catchment and the possible measures for the management of that risk.  This study, which is the pilot for a national programme, is now nearing completion.  Flood maps for the areas known or considered to be at risk have been produced and are publicly available through the project website.  A draft flood risk management plan setting out measures for managing flood risk in the Lee catchment will be made available for public consultation in the near future.</P>
        <P>In a parallel exercise, a screening process is currently underway to identify other areas of County Cork, and indeed nationally, where the flood risk may be significant.  This exercise includes a review of past floods, and the recent flooding in Cork will be taken into account to help the identification of high risk areas and solutions.</P>
        <P>The areas where flood risk is considered significant on the basis of the screening exercise will, under a major national programme, then be subject to more detailed analysis, including the preparation flood maps and development of a plan of mitigation measures such as those that are being prepared for the Lee catchment.  This programme was initiated on foot of national  flood policy but it will enable the State to meet the requirements of the EU floods directive that came into force in 2007.  The OPW, in partnership with other State bodies is implementing a range of initiatives to reduce future flood risk including the production, in partnership with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of guidelines for consideration of flood risk in planning development and management.  Pending the formalisation of a detailed flood risk management plan on foot of the screening exercise and studies being undertaken by the OPW, the Minister of State recognises and accepts that <Col N="841"/>there is need to address immediate localised flood problems in the Cork area.  To this end, under an initiative announced recently, the OPW may provide financial and technical assistance to local authorities to carry out studies or works to address small-scale flood problems, subject to specific economic and environmental criteria.  Already in 2009, &euro;31,500 has been allocated for minor flood mitigation projects in County Cork.  Further applications for funding will be considered by the OPW, subject to availability of resources.</P>
        <P>Prior to possible submission of applications for additional funding for minor flood relief measures, Cork County Council has begun an analysis of the flooding in those parts of the county most affected by the flooding that occurred last week.  The OPW has been in contact with the county council, and has carried out an initial inspection of the area.  It is expected that the council will complete a detailed report on the flooding shortly.</P>
        <P>Once the report from Cork County Council becomes available, OPW officials will meet the local authority&rsquo;s engineers.  If the report indicates that measures are possible to reduce future risk of flooding, and provided these are acceptable on economic and environmental grounds, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh will endeavour to ensure that funding will be available to allow works to proceed at an early stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is conscious that in addition to the trauma caused by the flooding, people may also have suffered financial loss arising from damage caused to their property.  Householders should, where applicable, consult their insurers in the first instance on property repairs.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance where it is considered appropriate.  Assistance may be available through the community welfare officer network to victims of the recent flooding.  Where people have suffered hardship, they should contact the local community welfare officer for assistance, and each case will be dealt with confidentially and on its merits.  Recent humanitarian assistance schemes have not extended to cover business or agriculture.  Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mansergh asked me to assure the House that the Office of Public Works will continue to work in partnership with Cork County Council to try to alleviate the risk of future flooding in the areas affected.</P>
        <P>I again express my sympathy and that of the Minister of State to those affected by the flooding, assuring them of the Government&rsquo;s support for the efforts that are under way to address future flood risk in the Cork area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this difficult situation at Navan hospital &mdash; which I believe is being replicated in many hospitals around the country &mdash; on the Adjournment. </P>
        <P>It has been very difficult to get answers on this question.  I have tabled parliamentary questions, concerning which I believe the relevant information has been gathered, but I have not got the answers yet.  Many weeks have gone by, I have tried to meet the relevant HSE officials and the matter has been raised with the Minister, and still I have not received answers.  I do not understand why this service should have been withdrawn from Navan hospital.  I accept that difficulties have arisen in other hospitals around the country, although many of these are being addressed and their services will be retained.  However, Navan hospital has been singled out for positive comment on its embalming services in the recent Willis report and retained organs audit, which dealt, <i>inter alia</i>, with facilities within hospitals for bereaved families and <Col N="842"/>the provision of bereavement services. I am baffled as to why this service is being withdrawn, and I am very concerned.</P>
        <P>It will cause enormous difficulty and great distress to the families of the deceased.  It also indicates a total lack of dignity and respect towards loved ones who pass away.  It is a shame on us, in this day and age.  Many funeral directors will be affected who do not have embalming services.  This is a very important issue and I am disappointed that the Government and the HSE, at a time of so many problems, apparently try to create more.  This is not necessary and can be prevented.  If the HSE has any difficulty with the services at Navan, which have been positively commented on, this should be discussed, so that any changes that might be needed can be implemented.  As matters stand, it is wrong and will greatly affect families in three different ways.  It will cause unnecessary delay, perhaps a day or two, in the release of remains for burial, and that will give rise to great distress and inconvenience for families.  The Government should not add to the distress of families who have lost loved ones.</P>
        <P>It will also increase burial costs &mdash; including embalming costs to prepare remains for burial.  This is another unnecessary cost for families because funerals already cost a fortune.  Then there is the lack of dignity towards the remains entailed in the removal of embalming services from the hospital.  It will mean the unnecessary transportation of dead bodies around the county for embalming purposes, and basically this is not right.  What happens in the case of a death due to C. diff.?  Is it not better to have the post-mortem on the body of the deceased and embalming on site so that the remains are sterilised and the threat of C. diff. being passed on is eliminated?</P>
        <P>Surely it is common sense to have these services all in the one place, where possible.  It is unclear why the HSE wants to withdraw the services.  I am very disappointed at the total lack of communication on this subject.  Will the Minister try to ensure that this service is restored?  Its removal is wrong.  Why was the embalming service at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, stopped, since such an initiative is not indicated in the report and why was it stopped without prior notification to the funeral directors?</P>
        <P>The review of bereavement service practices in the Willis report identified many weaknesses in embalming services within hospitals around the country.  However, Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, was one of only five in Ireland which complied with the Willis recommendations.  As such, it was singled out for good positive comment.  It was even mentioned in press statements and so on, afterwards.  The service at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital was carried out by a fully qualified embalmer, with appropriate insurance cover.  Stopping this service will cause significant delays in funeral arrangements and add extra distress to bereaved families as remains have to be transferred from the public morgue into a preparation facility, and then brought back to the morgue again.</P>
        <P>I want this service restored.  The people of Navan and County Meath want this service restored.  There is no reason for not having it.  There is no cost to the HSE.  Procedures and systems might have to be changed, which can be done.  That is what management is about, there is no real explanation for this and it is totally unfair and unnecessary.  The Wallis report I am quoting from, incidentally, included a detailed investigation into the question of and audit of retained organs.  It recommends a great many changes.  I accept the Minister of State is not in a position to address that now, but I should like a guarantee from her that the changes recommended in this report will be implemented, because many parents have suffered greatly from the scandals of the retained organs.  This report, if acted upon, would prevent that.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Navan hospital embalming service is restored and that the recommendations of this report are adhered to as well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I respond on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  One of the recommendations of the Madden report on post-mortem practices and procedures was that an independent audit of retained organs in the State be undertaken.  The report of this audit, which was undertaken by Michaela Willis, was published and made publicly available by the HSE in July. </P>
        <P>The Willis audit recommended that service level agreements be put in place with external operators who use hospital premises for embalming procedures to ensure that quality, safety and performance levels are clearly defined.</P>
        <P>On foot of this recommendation, the HSE wrote to its hospital network managers on 16 July 2009 setting out new arrangements for embalming at hospitals.  It should be noted that embalming is not a service provided or funded by the HSE.  It is a service provided by commercial entities, such as funeral directors, under contract with recently bereaved families who choose this service.  This does not affect mortuary services provided by hospitals, such as the removal of the remains of a deceased patient.  It should also be noted that embalming is a separate and distinct service, which is not part of the procedures followed by mortuaries when preparing the bodies of deceased persons following their death.  Embalming is an additional option which is chosen by some families for their deceased loved ones and is therefore provided on a commercial basis.</P>
        <P>The memorandum issued to hospital network managers advised that staff in hospitals operated or funded by the HSE are contracted to provide safe and high quality care to patients and their families and that individual staff members should not enter into contracts with commercial entities to provide additional services while in the direct employ of the HSE or in the employ of hospitals funded by the HSE.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements for embalming in hospitals, the HSE now requires that standard controls are put in place in those hospitals the facilities of which are being used for embalming purposes by undertakers or funeral directors.  Each hospital wishing to continue to facilitate an embalming service must develop a service level agreement with each commercial entity that wishes to use a hospital&rsquo;s facilities for embalming purposes.  This is in line with good governance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>

	<P>Having regard to the new requirements, it is a matter for each hospital to decide whether it will enter into a service level agreement with undertakers or other external entities for the provision of embalming services.  I understand that Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, has recently decided to discontinue its present arrangements for embalming services.  However, it will of course continue to provide all appropriate mortuary services for deceased patients in the normal way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with the opportunity to raise this important issue.  It is closely related to the first Adjournment matter raised <Col N="844"/>this evening by my constituency colleagues, Deputies Coveney and Clune in respect of the serious flooding incidents in parts of our constituency last Wednesday evening.  I believe the lack of the Cork lower harbour sewerage scheme was a contributory factor in the flooding incidents that occurred last week in areas including Glenbrook, Passage West, Monkstown, Rochestown, Carrigaline and the Minane Bridge area.  I witnessed at first hand the devastation that occurred to a number of homes, particularly in Glenbrook, which was highlighted on the RTE News last week.  An extremely serious incident occurred that could have had far more serious consequences involving serious injury or even the loss of human life but which thankfully did not occur.  Even in Carrigaline, my constituency office was flooded although the consequences were quite minor, in that a new carpet must be put down.  However, the devastation of people&rsquo;s homes is an altogether more serious matter and I hope Members can give every possible assistance to those who are affected and towards ensuring this does not happen again.  In this regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has responded quite swiftly and I spoke to him a number of times last week following the incident.  Cork County Council has now been encouraged to submit an application for funding as soon as possible which will be given favourable consideration by the Office of Public Works, which already has been on-site at the worst affected areas.</P>
        <P>This brings me to the purpose of the Adjournment matter I have tabled.  In 2004, Cork City Council completed the main drainage scheme for Cork city and suburbs including the Douglas area.  This brought enormous environmental benefits to the Cork city region.  In respect of the River Lee for example, people now swim there again, fish stocks have re-emerged and the amenity use of the river has greatly improved because of the completion of the main drainage scheme there in 2004.  The purpose of this motion is to seek to accelerate a comparable scheme for the county area of my constituency.  This scheme is called the Cork lower harbour main drainage scheme and at present is going through the lengthy process involved in getting an infrastructural project of this scale up and running.  However, it is of critical importance for the area I represent to have this scheme implemented as soon as possible.  For example, approximately 1 billion gallons of untreated foul sewage is simply discharged into the lower harbour every year with enormous environmental consequences.  This highlights the urgent need for this issue to be addressed.  The scheme would cover the areas of Carrigaline, Crosshaven, Passage West, Monkstown, Shanbally, Ringaskiddy and the wider lower harbour area.  Its implementation would bring significant environmental benefits, as well as leisure benefits for the use of the lower harbour area.  It is essential to proceed with this project as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In addition, not only is the lack of the main drainage scheme in the harbour area a possible contributory factor in the case of flooding, it also has been put forward as a reason for not proceeding with major road improvement works that are required.  For example, in the town of Carrigaline where I live, the main street is a shambles.  It is in appalling condition but for many years, the council has cited the forthcoming or planned main drainage scheme as a reason for not carrying out major works on the roads.  Given that this scheme has been in the pipeline for several years and may not happen for some time yet, it is unfair to use it as a reason for not investing in improved road infrastructure in that area.  In addition, in Carrigaline and elsewhere in the lower harbour area, there is a highly inadequate drainage system as a result because a combined surface water and foul sewer system is in place rather than the separate systems that are required.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge this is a major scheme which is going through the process.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has approved the environmental impact statement for the waste water treatment plant in Ringaskiddy.  It was approved last summer and the preliminary report has been submitted by the council to the Department.  Some comments have come back and I understand the council <Col N="845"/>intends to submit a revised report to the Department before Christmas.  I understand that in excess of &euro;70 million will be required from the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme and this evening I seek confirmation that this funding is available to proceed with the scheme in the shortest possible timeframe, that the council will be encouraged to prioritise this project and that the Department will treat it with the seriousness it deserves once the revised report comes before it, in order that this drainage scheme can be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for raising this important issue.  The Cork lower harbour sewerage scheme is included for funding in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, at a current estimated cost of almost &euro;92 million.  The proposed scheme involves the upgrading of the existing sewerage networks in the main population centres of Carrigaline, Cobh, Crosshaven, Monkstown, Passage West and Ringaskiddy in the lower harbour area and their connection to a new waste water treatment plant to be built at Shanbally, north east of Carrigaline.  Cork County Council is currently reviewing the preliminary report for the lower harbour scheme and expects to submit revised proposals to the Department shortly.</P>
        <P>The length of time it takes to advance a water or sewerage scheme to completion largely depends on the nature and complexity of the scheme and the statutory processes involved.  The Department&rsquo;s involvement at individual stages of schemes in the water services investment programme can vary from two to four occasions, depending on the value of the scheme.  It approves the local authority&rsquo;s design brief and preliminary report for all schemes and in some instances it also approves the contract documents.  In the case of public private partnership contracts, the Department additionally approves the local authority&rsquo;s tender recommendation.  Its involvement at key stages is necessary to comply with the Department of Finance capital appraisal guidelines and the Department&rsquo;s own obligations relating to management and oversight of Exchequer expenditure.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have responsibility for all other aspects of a scheme, including appointment of consultants, statutory planning and other processes, site investigations, acquisition of lands and way leaves, tendering processes, appointment of contractors and carrying out of works. The time taken to advance a scheme will depend largely on how quickly these processes are completed.</P>
        <P>The priority to be accorded to schemes in Cork County is a matter, in the first instance, for Cork County Council.  In July 2009, local authorities were asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to the Department by 23 October last.  The Department has just begun its consideration of these assessments, which will form a key input to the development of the 2010-12 water services investment programme.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  Cork County Council will shortly submit its needs assessment return to the Department.</P>
        <P>The 2010-12 programme is a three-year rolling plan for the provision of major water supply and waste water infrastructure.  Strategic environmental and economic objectives have provided the rationale for investment in water services infrastructure since 2000.  With the changed economic climate and the completion of the first cycle of river basin management plans by local authorities in the near future, there is a greater need than ever to focus on these key priorities.  The 2010-12 programme will do this by prioritising projects that target public health and environmental compliance issues, support economic and employment growth, and offer best value for money.</P>
<Col N="846"/>
        <P>The Department expects to publish the 2010-12 water services investment programme in early 2010.  I assure the Deputy that the Department will work closely with Cork County Council to advance priority schemes identified in the programme.</P>

	<P>It is not with any great pleasure that I rise here tonight to state some facts about the ongoing unsatisfactory situation regarding the proposed amalgamation of Cahir boys&rsquo; national school and Our Lady of Mercy national school in my town, Cahir.  This has been continuing for more than ten years.  In 2002 a technical report was put forward for the amalgamation of these schools.  In April 2004 all parties approved a further technical report and amalgamation process.  I pay tribute to the Sisters of Mercy in Our Lady of Mercy primary school and Cahir boys&rsquo; national school for the education they have given to many generations in Cahir.</P>
        <P>The amalgamation schedule was approved and agreed and the boards of management of both schools agreed to put a special needs unit on the site.  Everybody was pleased with this and hoped for progress.  Since then two principals have retired and I wish them a happy retirement and the very best to their replacements.  The least I can do for the people of south Tipperary, who elected me is to be honest, and I expect the same from the officials whom I meet here in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I received a letter on 26 August 2009 in reply to my letter about the amalgamation of the sites of the two schools.  The letter referred to a letter of June 2007 from the Department of Education and Science to the Sisters of Mercy and stated that the Department was still awaiting a reply.  It also states that the Department sent a reminder to the Sisters of Mercy on 25 August 2009.  I took this information seriously and on behalf of the boards of management contacted the Sisters of Mercy in Cahir who referred me to their Reverend Mother in Cork.  I received a response from the recruitment manager stating that she had sent a reply to the Department&rsquo;s letter on 11 July 2007 saying the sisters would be disposed in principle to the sale of the current school site, etc.  In reply to a further letter from the Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit dated 24 October 2007 she wrote on 10 December 2007 giving a map and the value of the land provided by a property consultant.  Since that date, despite contacting the school division at the Department and being referred to the site acquisitions division, the Sisters of Mercy have received no reply from the Department.  The ongoing resolution of this matter rests with the Department, not with the Sisters of Mercy.</P>
        <P>I am asking the Minister of State for clarity, openness and honesty.  It is unfair to blame anybody.  I accept there are budgetary problems and constraints but it is unfair and morally wrong to say that sites were not available and letters not replied to.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s efforts and those of many officials in the Department but the people who write these letters should be rooted out because they do not deserve a place in the public service.</P>
        <P>We should deal with the matter honestly and openly, try to agree a value and make a deal to purchase the land between the two schools.  It would be a splendid amalgamation, and although many adjustments need to be made, everybody is ready for that work.  The pupils, the staff, parents&rsquo; councils, boards of management and ancillary staff in Cahir deserve better treatment and to have their case heard with honesty and fairness.  This is not good enough.</P>
        <P>This is not the first occasion during my short time in the D&aacute;il that I have received such letters blaming another person.  The blame should not lie with anybody.  We all work together to try to resolve these problems and to be honest with ourselves and our constituents.  We know where we are going and the right pecking order.  I appeal to the Minister for Education <Col N="847"/>and Science, through the Minister of State, to deal with this matter and bring it to fruition by sitting down with the sisters who are willing, able and ready.  They have offered a site, not free, but as land values have come down recently I am sure that having given long service to the community in Cahir, the sisters would not be averse to bringing the price down in line with everything else.  In that way we can at least get the site and go through the various stages with all the public representatives, regardless of who is in Government and who is Minister, to progress this in a fair and equitable way.  This will allow us to proceed in an orderly manner.  That is all I ask.  I am not happy with the present situation and could not be expected to be, no more than the boards of management, the school staff, or my other constituents in Cahir could because it is clearly unfair.</P>

	<P>I am happy to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who cannot be present, unfortunately.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the D&aacute;il the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the current position of the proposed amalgamation of Cahir boys&rsquo; national school and Our Lady of Mercy national school.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit assesses all applications for capital funding.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>The staffing level of Cahir boys&rsquo; national school comprises a principal, seven mainstream assistants, one permanent learning support, one release time post, one permanent resource and two temporary language support.  It had an enrolment of 169 pupils in September 2009.</P>
        <P>Our Lady of Mercy national school has a current staffing level of a principal, 11 mainstream assistants, one permanent shared resource for Travellers, one permanent resource, one learning support-resource and three temporary language support.  It had an enrolment of 282 pupils in September 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2004, agreement was reached to amalgamate the two primary schools in Cahir.  The application was assessed and the project was assigned a band rating of 1.4.  The long-term projected staffing for the proposed amalgamated school was determined as one administrative principal, 24 mainstream assistants and four learning support-resource.  An autism unit will also be provided as part of the accommodation.</P>
        <P>A technical inspection was carried out in 2006 on the existing school buildings to determine which would be suitable to act as a host for the amalgamated school.  The report concluded the most suitable building to facilitate the amalgamation would be the girl&rsquo;s school due to its relatively large floor area, good condition of the general building fabric, reasonable development potential and relatively good access to a public roadway.  The report also recommended an additional portion of land be acquired from the Sisters of Mercy to the north east of the Our Lady of Mercy national school to facilitate the development.  The Sisters of Mercy indicated it would, in principle, be disposed to the selling of the current school site, the playing pitch to the rear of the site and an additional 1.5 acres adjacent to the site to facilitate the proposed works.</P>
<Col N="848"/>
        <P>The progression of the building project required to facilitate the amalgamation from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  The amalgamation school building project for the primary schools in Cahir, County Tipperary, will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I again thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for giving me the opportunity to outline to the D&aacute;il the current position regarding the school building project for the primary schools in Cahir, County Tipperary.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 122 on 6 October 2009, firstly, funding for the publication of a weekly Irish language newspaper is provided by Foras na Gaeilge and, secondly, a new competition for the provision of such a newspaper was underway.  I understand from Foras that the interview assessment process has since been completed and that a recommendation will be presented for the consideration of the Board of Foras na Gaeilge at its meeting on Friday next. As this is a public procurement process, it would be improper for me to involve myself in it or make any further public comment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 67 and 98 together.</P>
        <P>The Rural Transport Evening/Night Scheme was implemented in 2007 as a pilot project in seven selected areas, with funding from my Department.  This pilot scheme was in addition to <Col N="851"/>of the rural transport services already provided in these seven areas under the Department of Transport&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rural Transport Programme&rsquo;.  The pilot arrangement was designed to operate for a limited period only and will cease at end-2009.  It was intended to give the rural transport groups involved an opportunity to pilot certain evening/night-time services that, ultimately, could be considered for inclusion in their main transport services.</P>
        <P>Having had the experience of piloting such services, the seven groups concerned are now assessing their overall services with a view to the possible inclusion of more evening/night-time transport services.  To assist with this, I have arranged for Pobal, which manages both the main Rural Transport Programme and the pilot scheme, to work with the Groups in assessing their services and their experience of the pilot scheme.  This work is ongoing and includes making all possible efforts to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the transport service.  This will involve prioritising routes, increasing load capacity, re-tendering to operators to seek cheaper quotes where appropriate and focussing more on generating income from passengers.  I would like to see the seven groups, and indeed, all other service providers, assess their services to identify how best to meet the transport needs of the rural communities they serve, with the inclusion as necessary of more evening/night-time services in their main rosters.</P>
        <P>I understand that some of the rural transport service groups already provide a level of these services and, based on the experiences of the pilot scheme, evening/night-time services can now be further considered.  Decisions in this regard are within the remit of the service providers, in their implementation locally of the Rural Transport Programme.  Delivery of a quality service to rural communities and, at the same time, ensuring value for money is core to the work of the Rural Transport Programme in the current economic climate.</P>

It is expected that programme expenditure on these project approvals will be of the order of &euro;10m in 2009.</P>
        <P>In regard to the matter of evaluating its various schemes and programmes, my Department has put in place a range of financial monitoring, performance measurement and systems review mechanisms.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 100 together.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my reply to today&rsquo;s Priority Question No 56, the recommendations in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes represent a set of options that are being considered by Government in the context of the 2010 Budget.  It has been well flagged that we need to make serious inroads in the gap in the public finances between income and expenditure.  The Report from the Special Group has provided a broad range of measures for consideration by Government in that regard.  As the Deputy will be aware, it proposes a range of savings relating to various functions of my Department.Towards that end, it proposes that a number of schemes be abolished or reduced and it also makes specific recommendations regarding agencies under the aegis of my Department and, indeed, the Department itself.</P>
        <P>However, I believe that it would not be appropriate for me to engage in a line by line discussion of the recommendations of the Report from the Special Group, not least because of the work that is in train by Government to frame the Budget.  That said, I can confirm that legislative proposals in regard to the powers and functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are being considered in the general context of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Linguistic Study of the Use of Irish in the Gaeltacht and the work of the Cabinet Committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht.  I can assure the Deputy that any proposals arising from those deliberations will have due regard to the optimal appropriate structure for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the future.</P>

        <P Just="Left">My Department funds a network of 21 volunteer centres across the country. The Volunteer Centres are based in the following locations: Carlow, Cork, Drogheda, Donegal, Dublin City North, Dublin City South, D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown, Fingal, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick City, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, South Dublin County, South Tipperary, West Limerick, Westmeath, and Wicklow.  In 2007 15 volunteer centres were funded by my Department, this increased to 20 in 2008 and 21 in 2009.  Over the period 2007-2009, funding of &euro;6.351m has been provided to volunteer centres. My Department also provides core funding for Volunteer Centres Ireland, which acts as a national representative organisation and plays a proactive central role in facilitating and supporting the development of the network of local volunteer centres.  I am informed that the numbers of volunteers using these centres has increased dramatically this year. To date in 2009 over 11,813 individuals have registered to volunteer across the network of Volunteer Centres.  Of these, in excess of 3,671 individuals have already been placed in volunteering opportunities that will generate more than 308,518 hours of volunteering this year.</P>
        <P>Other volunteer activities directly supported by my Department include initiatives such as Young Social Innovators, which provides social awareness education for 15-18 year olds in Ireland, Focus Ireland To support the placement of social science graduates who wish to gain experience and to develop skills in working with people who are marginalized and Boardmatch, an organisation which aims to support the development of the voluntary and community sector in Ireland by strengthening boards of management and management committees of non-profit organisations.  Community and voluntary groups can find support from my Department across a range of programmes covering social inclusion, community and rural development, the Irish Language and Gaeltacht.  If the Deputy wishes specific further information on these I will be happy to oblige.</P>

        <P>As I stated in my reply to today&rsquo;s Priority Question No. 56, the recommendations in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes represent a set of options that are being considered by Government in the context of the 2010 Budget. It has been well flagged that we need to make serious inroads in the gap in the public finances between income and expenditure.  The Report from the Special Group has provided a broad range of measures for consideration by Government in that regard.  As the Deputies will be aware, it proposes a range of savings relating to various functions of my Department.Towards that end, it proposes that a number of schemes be abolished or reduced and it also makes specific recommendations regarding agencies under the aegis of my Department and, indeed, the Department itself.</P>
        <P>However, I believe that it would not be appropriate for me to engage in a line by line discussion of the various recommendations of the Report from the Special Group, not least because of the work that is in train by Government to frame the Budget.  It should be noted that certain areas referred to in the Deputies&rsquo; Questions are the responsibility of other Ministers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confident that the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 will provide a comprehensive response to problem drug use in Ireland.  The Strategy seeks to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. This pillar approach is being retained as it has proved effective to date, it was widely supported during the consultation process on a new Strategy and it dovetails with the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2009-2012.  The Actions set out in the Strategy will facilitate a planned and monitored approach to achieving the overall strategic objective.  </P>
        <P>A number of the Actions of the Strategy focus on co-ordination arrangements to facilitate implementation. The changes made in institutional structures, including the establishment of an Office of the Minister for Drugs, facilitate that role.  These changes will also streamline administration and facilitate more effective co-ordination and partnership.  Under the Strategy, I will be meeting twice a year with a number of Ministers and various senior officials who are directly involved in the work to address the drugs problem.  I am currently undertaking the first round of such meetings and I am stressing the need for Departments and agencies to ensure that high priority is given achieving the objectives of Strategy.  These meetings facilitate a good exchange of views, and they also focus on the importance of the continued effective implementation of other programmes that impact on the factors underpinning problem drug use.</P>
<Col N="856"/>
        <P>An Oversight Forum on Drugs, which I chair, has been established and the first meeting of the Forum was held last month.  The primary role of the Oversight Forum on Drugs is the on-going high level examination of progress across the Strategy and to address any operational difficulties and blockages that may arise.  A Drugs Advisory Group has also been set up with membership from across the statutory, community and voluntary sectors.  This Group, which meets regularly, advises the Minister on operational and policy matters relating to the National Drugs Strategy, and oversees and supports the work of the Drugs Task Forces.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the Strategy will have to be achieved in a situation of limited funding and so the optimum use of the available resources is essential.  However, these resources are considerable, with the estimated expenditure on the drugs problem across Departments and agencies in 2009 being in excess of &euro;275m.  The difficulties facing our society as a consequence of problem drug use are significant, and addressing all the factors involved will not be easy.  However, I am determined that real progress will be made across the period of the Strategy, with all sectors working in a co-ordinated and targeted way, to achieve the implementation of the agreed Actions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the majority of expenditure allocated through my Department to community groups involved in drugs initiatives is channelled though the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.  Of the total drugs funding in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2009, over 92% is targeted at Task Force-related activities.  The revised allocation, following the Supplementary Budget in April, for community-based initiatives in the Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas is &euro;32.5m which will support in the region of 530 projects. I also recently approved over &euro;550k towards small-scale capital premises funding in both Local and Regional Task Force areas which is part of &euro;4.5m being spent on all drugs related capital expenditure. No area is immune to cost cutting measures in the current economic environment. It is in this context that all Drugs Task Forces must live within the budgets allocated for their areas of responsibility and I fully appreciate this involves some difficult choices having to be made.</P>
        <P>Sustained incremental funding over recent years has facilitated, among others, the strengthening of existing projects in the LDTF areas, the rolling out of a range of projects and initiatives in the RDTF areas, introducing new initiatives and responses to address cocaine usage and supporting rehabilitation and ongoing investment in capital projects.  These are recognised by Government as key areas to support communities to address the harm caused by problem drugs use and to deliver meaningful solutions. I can assure the Deputy that my primary concern has been &mdash; and continues to be &mdash; the protection of front-line community-based services delivering vital programmes and initiatives in areas worst affected by problem drug use.</P>
        <P>I am, of course, acutely aware of the challenges reduced budget allocations pose. I know that other Departments and Agencies are also very aware of this in the context of their engagement in the Drugs Strategy and the available funding to them for mainstreamed drugs projects and services. However, we have to take account of the current economic reality and of the pressure <Col N="857"/>on the public finances. This, inevitably, means that some schemes will be affected but properly managed, this may also lead to improved efficiencies in services and foster better interagency working to the benefit of all.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The Deputy should also note that Drugs Task Forces have benefitted from funding under the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF). In addition to supporting the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing campaigns in Task Force areas, 80 projects in 23 of the Task Force areas were recently approved funding from the DAF for initiatives aimed at improving services for families of drug misusers.  The Deputy will be aware that, across Government, we are taking a number of difficult decisions, but our approach is to do this in as balanced a way as possible.  There is a critical need to ensure that resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that the maximum benefit is achieved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 326 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the 2009 Annual Report of the European Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction which was published earlier this month.  The drug prevalence figures contained in the report are compiled from the latest figures available for individual countries.  In the case of Ireland the figures reflect the outcome of the all-island Drug Prevalence Survey 2006/07, which provides the best estimate of the drug prevalence in this country.  One of the findings of the 2006/07 survey was the emergence of cocaine as a threat, particularly among younger adults.  Accordingly, the report of the EMCDDA does not contain any surprises in relation to the figures for cocaine use here.</P>
        <P>Direct international comparisons of the use of cocaine are difficult in the light of the differences in the time period to which figures for the various countries apply.  This is also reflected by the greater use of cocaine in western Europe compared to central Europe where amphetamines are a bigger problem and the fact that many drug users are now engaged in polydrug use, another issue brought out in the EMCDDA publication.  At the same time, the levels of cocaine use documented by the EMCDDA raise some concerns.  Arising from the outcomes of the Drug Prevalence Survey 2006/07, and a subsequent report from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, a national drugs awareness campaign focusing on cocaine was implemented in 2008, led by the HSE.   Local cocaine campaigns, dovetailing with the national campaign, were organised through Drugs Task Forces at the same time.</P>
<Col N="858"/>
        <P>The recently launched National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 includes a number of Actions under the Prevention Pillar that will increase awareness of the dangers of cocaine among 15 to 24 years olds.  These include both in-school and out-of school initiatives, measures aimed at the general population and others targeted at those who are deemed to be most at risk, as well as family focused interventions.  Structures have been put in place to facilitate the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 and to manage performance under the various Actions of the Strategy.  I am satisfied that the implementation of these Actions will address significantly on the levels of cocaine use among young adults.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated RAPID areas nationally. Following an independent evaluation of the RAPID programme commissioned in 2006, it was recommended that, in order to further develop and enhance the programme through the lifetime of the 2007-2013 NDP, it should be focussed on seven Strategic Themes: Community Safety and Anti-Social Behaviour, Family Support, Youth Support, Physical Environment, Education, Health and Employment/Training. This recommendation has been pursued and the strategic themes have been established across RAPID areas. </P>
        <P>Separately, in order to ensure the continued relevance of the Programme and the designated RAPID areas, I commissioned, through POBAL, a study to develop/update small area deprivation indices based on an analysis of the most recent census data. I initiated this review last year because from my experience of visiting communities around the country, I felt that some areas that were not in the Programme might be eligible now.  Based on the study, I proposed the designation of five provincial towns as new RAPID areas; this was accepted by Cabinet in May 2009. The study also indicated that minor adjustments to the boundaries of a number of existing RAPID areas would be justified and this process is still ongoing.  I hope to have the whole process completed early in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Government decision of May 2009 included Ballina, Co. Mayo, Dungarvan, Co. Waterford, Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath and Rathkeale, Co. Limerick in the RAPID Programme.  The Revised Programme of Government of October 2009 sets out the Governments commitment to &lsquo;Continue to develop the RAPID Programme that is giving local communities in the most disadvantaged urban areas a real voice for change for the better in their own communities.  We will continue to prioritise initiatives like the RAPID programme, that make a very real and tangible improvement to people&rsquo;s everyday lives.</P>
        <P>The CL&Aacute;R Programme was set up as an innovative programme to deal with infrastructural deficits in the most peripheral communities in Ireland that had suffered significant population loss. As the Deputy will be aware, measures for roads, water, sewerage, schools, and health services are among the many initiatives run under the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  For the future, the Renewed Programme for Government has identified the need to continue to invest in disadvantaged rural communities through CL&Aacute;R, and will do this by focussing the programme <Col N="859"/>on priority local needs in targeted CL&Aacute;R areas. The CL&Aacute;R Programme has constantly sought to address the new challenges faced by small rural communities and has been continuously refocused to deal with the most urgent infrastructural deficits. This approach will continue to inform my delivery of the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  In this regard, I will examine options to deliver on this programme for Government commitment in the context of the resources available to me in 2010 and beyond.</P>

	<P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service have achieved significant success in relation to the number of drug seizures, and the amount and value of the drugs involved.  I congratulate both organisations in this regard.  The ongoing co-operation between the two agencies, and their international counterparts, and their focus on an intelligence-led approach, has proven particularly effective.</P>
        <P>Numbers in the Garda National Drugs Unit, the primary unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na charged with responsibility for law enforcement in relation to drug supply, have increased and additional Divisional Drugs Units have also been established.  The work of these Units is supported by the Organised Crime Unit, now established on a full-time basis, and by the Criminal Assets Bureau, among others.  At the same time, Garda&iacute; generally deal with drug-related issues as they arise on an on-going basis.  Drug seizures by the Customs Service have also significantly increased.  Their Coastal Watch Programme has been in place since 2001, a new Customs patrol vessel has been commissioned, mobile X-ray scanning technology has been acquired and the number of drug detector dog teams has also been increased.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the Supply Reduction Pillar of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to significantly reduce the volume of illicit drugs;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to prevent the emergence of new markets for illicit drugs;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to reduce community drug problems.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The actions of the Strategy also envisage an increased emphasis on community policing, including through the continued roll-out of Local Policing Fora and the inclusion of drugs issues in a more central way in the work of Joint Policing Committees.  Also, I recently announced the extension of the &ldquo;Dial to Stop Drug Dealing&rdquo; campaign that has proven effective.

At the end of September 2009, my Department had incurred expenditure of &euro;1,534,583 on non-property costs arising from the move to the Tubbercurry offices. I should point out that this amount relates only to my Department and does not cover costs incurred by the Office of Public Works.  The Deputy will also be aware that, under the decentralisation programme, 10 staff were due to decentralise to Na Forbacha, Co Galway. This process is now complete and has not resulted in any material additional costs to my Department.  In relation to the staff and areas of operation of my Department that have decentralised to Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo and Na Forbacha, Co.

        <P>All three phases of the campaigns have been completed and, to date, nearly 5,500 calls have been made to the confidential number.  The Deputy should note that calls are spread right across the country including areas that have not directly run a campaign.  This highlights the fact that the confidential number used in the campaign is open to all to use regardless of the area one comes from.  The Garda&iacute; have confirmed that there have been 138 reports received to date in relation to Co. Cork.  The campaign was originally due to cease operation in September of this year, but due to the positive outcomes being achieved, I decided to continue it with further funding from my Department.</P>

	<P>The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).  Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of September 2009, the transfers to the DAF have totalled some &euro;513.90m.  Funds reclaimed since April 2003 total some &euro;181.27m.  The value of the DAF at the end of September 2009, net of liabilities, was some &euro;49.76m.  This figure excludes &euro;46.47m maintained in a Reserve Account to meet future reclaims by account holders and to cover expenses associated with the operation of the DAF.</P>
        <P>My Department has received applications in 2009 in respect of two DAF measures, namely, Substance Misuse and the RAPID Additionality Round 4.  Under the Substance Misuse measure, the Dial-to-Stop Drug Dealing Campaign sought applications for funding from the 21 Drugs Task Forces.  Ten applications valued at &euro;0.30m in total were approved for funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2009.  A further 83 applications were received for funding for Family Support Projects under this measure.  The Government approved &euro;1.56m in respect of 80 of these projects.  Under the RAPID Additionality measure, 561 applications were received in 2009.  To date, 404 projects have been approved by the Government for funds totalling &euro;5.55m.  The remaining projects are due to be considered by the Government in the coming weeks.  Details of financial position of the DAF and of the individual grants and organisations that have been approved for support and their geographical location are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie.</P>

My Department provides funding to community groups to supply monitored personal alert devices and other practical security equipment for their home under the Scheme of Community Support for Older People.  The Deputy will be aware that a review of the Scheme was undertaken in recent months and revised arrangements will be forthcoming in early 2010. My Department will be happy to work with the other agencies involved with a view to providing improved practical advice on the home security needs of older people.</P>

	<P>I meet with the Chief Executive of Waterways Ireland on a regular basis. At our most recent meeting on 27 July 2009, we discussed progress by the organisation in 2009. In my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s Question No 158 of 6 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2009, I outlined the considerable progress made by Waterways Ireland during 2008, as well as its principal achievements in 2009 to date. I also referred to the preliminary discussions I had with the Chief Executive regarding Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s proposed capital programme and financial provision for 2010.  The precise scale of works to be carried out in 2010 to improve services and facilities along the navigation and the associated funding to be made available will be set out in Waterway&rsquo;s Ireland&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2010, which is currently being prepared, and which will be submitted for approval to the North/South Ministerial Council in due course.  I look forward to meeting the Chief Executive of Waterways Ireland again in Belfast on 2 December at the next North/South Ministerial Council meeting in Inland Waterways sectoral format.</P>

	<P>Waterways Ireland has responsibility for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigational waterways primarily for recreational purposes.  In line with its remit, Waterways Ireland has, since its establishment, developed both waterway and waterside facilities, increased mooring capacity, enhanced existing facilities and opened new waterway destinations.  Waterways Ireland carries out a capital development programme to provide moorings <Col N="869"/>and harbours for public use and other services along the waterways to open up the navigations and facilitate access to the waterways. </P>
        <P>The provision of funding for Waterways Ireland is considered in the context of the business plan and corporate plan priorities approved periodically by the North/South Ministerial Council, having regard to the financial resources available to the two sponsor Departments concerned &mdash; my own Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland.  The precise scale of works to be carried out in 2010 to improve services and facilities and the associated funding to be made available will be set out in Waterway&rsquo;s Ireland&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2010, which is currently being prepared, and which will be submitted for approval to the North/South Ministerial Council in due course.  It should be noted that Waterways Ireland is not a grant-aiding organisation and, as such, cannot financially assist the development of private marinas.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are a number of initiatives in hand which have direct import for the Community Development Programme.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Programme Redesign and Structural reform</i></P>
<P el="0">For some time now my Department has seen the need to redesign its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the Local Development Social Inclusion and Community Development Programmes, drawing on best international practice, and to <Col N="870"/>support the ongoing evaluation of the programmes. The LDSIP and the CDP are the Department&rsquo;s two main social inclusion/community development programmes. Both have a community development element and both are currently delivered through separate local delivery structures.</P>
        <P>In 2008, my Department engaged the services of the Centre for Effective Services to prepare proposals for a redesigned programme.  The Centre has very recently presented a new Programme outline to the Department which I propose to accept.  The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and people in disadvantaged communities.  This will be underpinned by four high level goals:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To promote awareness, knowledge and uptake of a wide range of statutory, voluntary and community services.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To increase access to formal and informal educational, recreational and cultural development activities and resources.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To increase peoples&rsquo; work readiness and employment prospects.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To promote engagement with policy, practice and decision making processes on matters affecting local communities.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The new Programme will preserve elements of good practice from the existing CDP/LDSIP programmes and will enhance monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  Further work by the Centre, on more detailed aspects of the Programme, is ongoing in the light of consultations and feedback with various community sector groups.  As previously signalled, it is my intention that CDPs and partnership/Integrated company structures should align so as to minimise structures and provide a single integrated delivery structure for all areas.  An implementation strategy, involving the stakeholders, is underway in preparation for programme roll-out in 2010.  This will be discussed with groups at a seminar to be held on Wednesday 25th November.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Review</i></P>
        <P el="0">Earlier this year the Department commenced a review of the performance of Community Development Projects funded under the Community Development Programme. This work is nearing completion.  The objective of the review is to identify those projects that produce tangible appropriate benefits for the communities that they serve.  Initial indications are that the vast majority of projects fall into this category and funding will be available &mdash; subject to budgetary constraints &mdash; through the new programme in 2010.  For those projects that do not come into this category, continued funding from the Department will not be available.  However, an appeals mechanism will be put in place.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Conclusion</i></P>
        <P el="0">I acknowledge that the past while has been a time of uncertainty for CDPs.  It is my wish that over the next few weeks CDPs will have clarity on the shape of the new programme, the outcome of the Departmental review and funding arrangements for 2010.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s role in this issue largely focuses on the work of the North West Mayo Forum which, as the Deputy will be aware, was established in November 2008, with the dual purpose of facilitating dialogue on local issues relating to the Corrib Gas Project and also offering the opportunity for furthering the socio-economic development of the North West region and, in particular, Kilcommon Parish.  The Forum has provided an opportunity for a range of local groups with an interest in the Corrib Gas Project to engage in a structured dialogue with each other, with the developer, Government Ministers, local representatives and with relevant Government Departments and public agencies.</P>
        <P>Arising from the deliberations of the Forum and a community consultation process, an investment programme to improve the social and physical infrastructure of the area was drawn up by Mayo County Council whereby a number of projects, both long and short term, were identified.  A number of priority projects involving investment of &euro;750,000 were identified for delivery in 2009.  Considerable progress had been made in the implementation of this programme.  In addition to the above, a major revamp of Col&aacute;iste Chom&aacute;in in<b> </b>Ros Dumhach <i>(Rossport)</i> is to be undertaken, to the value of &euro;340,000.  My own Department has committed funding of &euro;260,000 towards investment projects in the area, as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;100,000 towards village enhancement projects in the area.  These community projects will commence shortly and will be finished for the most part in 2009;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In the area of Rural Recreation / Tourism, &euro;160,000 has been committed for the proposed extension of the of the existing north coast walk from C&eacute;ide Fields to Belmullet, and other associated developments.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These projects are phase one of the implementation of a range of transport, education, enterprise, recreation and village enhancement measures identified as part of the work of the North West Mayo Community Forum.  I am pleased to support the socio-economic development of this area through these initiatives and am confident that they will show tangible benefits for the people of this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In answering this question I take it that the Deputy refers to the &lsquo;various LEADER Programmes&rsquo; she is referring to the various Local Action Groups delivering the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013.  The RDP 2007 &mdash; 2013 has funding of &euro;425m available to be allocated to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.  Expenditure under the programme may continue up to the end of 2015.</P>
        <P>There are 36 Local Action Groups contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP which commenced in February 2009.  Each group has been given an overall programme allocation over the life of the programme.  To date each group has been given an allocation to cover administration and animation costs for 2009.  Project funding has been made available to <Col N="872"/>cover 2009 and a partial project allocation has been made for 2010 and 2011.  Further allocations will be made on a regular basis over the life of the programme subject to resource availability.  Since the commencement of the programme in February 2009, &euro;2.7m has been paid out on completed projects.  It is estimated that up to a further &euro;3million will be paid out on completed projects by the end of 2009 bringing the total spend in relation to project activity to &euro;5.7million for the year.  There is a total of &euro;35.5 million in project activity on hand and more than &euro;18million of that is in respect of fully approved projects.  For a breakdown of the current position regarding each individual group&rsquo;s programme allocations, project commitments and project expenditure please refer to the table below.</P>
        <P>In line with the bottom-up nature of the LEADER approach, the Local Action Group is the principle decision-maker in the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the Groups Local Development Strategy and in line with Department Operating rules and EU Regulations.  Currently there are no plans to change the qualifying criteria for project funding.  Given the level of progress to date and that the programme only got underway in February of this year I am satisfied that the programme is performing well and will achieve its overall targets.</P>

	<P>Introduction of &lsquo;Innovation Fund Ireland&rsquo; is a commitment of <i>Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic </i>Renewal and the Renewed Programme for Government.  It aims to ensure greater availability of venture capital to help achieve our vision for transforming Ireland into the<b></b>innovation and commercialisation hub of Europe by supporting innovative SMEs and help scale indigenous companies.  It is also an objective to use the Fund to help attract leading Venture Capital companies to locate their European operations here.</P>
        <P>Detailed arrangements are currently being finalised by relevant Departments and Agencies for implementation of the proposal, taking account of market developments in the past year.  The opportunity is also being taken, in line with the Renewed Programme for Government, to avail of the expertise of members of the Innovation Taskforce which is currently advising on measures to promote innovation and commercialisation of research.  It remains the objective that the Fund will be established in early 2010.  In the meantime, Enterprise Ireland continues to provide venture capital through its Seed and Venture Capital Programmes.</P>

	<P>As part of the preparatory work for the 2011 census the CSO conducted a public consultation by inviting members of the public and various interest groups to make submissions on the topics to be covered, and on the outputs to be produced.  A notice to this effect was published in the national press in September 2008 seeking submissions, and all government departments were contacted for their input.  This phase of the process has now concluded.  A Census Advisory Group was set up in Autumn 2008 to consider the submissions received and advise on the questions to be tested in a pilot survey planned to be carried in April 2009.  The Census Advisory Group is representative of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data along with the relevant CSO personnel.</P>
        <P>Over 90 submissions covering 31 topics were received in total, among them submissions on the subject of disability, and in particular on the subject of autism.  A specific sub-group was <Col N="876"/>convened to consider the disability questions on the census form.  This sub-group was composed of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  The proposal to list specific disabilities within the disability question, namely to make specific reference to autistic spectrum disorder, or downs syndrome, in the category &lsquo;A learning or intellectual disability&rsquo; was considered at the second meeting of the group.</P>
        <P>The group concluded that it would not be appropriate, nor would there be enough room on the census form, to list all individual disabilities.  However, in order to go some way towards accommodating this request the existing (2006) category &lsquo;<i>A learning or intellectual disability</i>&rsquo; was split into two categories &lsquo;<i>An intellectual disability</i>&rsquo; and separately &lsquo;<i>A difficulty with learning, remembering or concentrating</i>&rsquo; for testing in the pilot survey.  The group felt that this approach narrowed the categories and thus helped address the issue of autism, while allowing the question to remain as inclusive as possible. The new wording of the disability questions which were tested in the Census Pilot Survey in April 2009 were as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The CSO, in consultation with the Census Advisory Group, has now finalised its analysis of the results of the census pilot.  This analysis has indicated that the revised questions on disability tested in the pilot have been successful and accordingly should be recommended for inclusion in the 2011 census questionnaire.  In this regard it is important to bear in mind that only ques<Col N="877"/>tions that have been tested and have been proven to have worked in the census pilot can be considered for inclusion in the 2011 census.</P>

	<P>The Government Decision of 19 May 2009 regarding the reduction of payment periods by Government Departments to 15 days, included a requirement for Departments to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target.  These reports are to be submitted by the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter.  The first such reports covering the period 15 June 2009 to 30 September 2009 were due by 15 October 2009.  The Reports provide details of invoices paid within 15 days, between 16 and 30 days and over 30 days.  Information on the average length of time to pay invoices is not included.  My Department is currently in the process of examining and collating the first returns received from Government Departments.  When this process is concluded, I intend to publish the information on my Department&rsquo;s website.  An initial examination of returns received to date, shows that the majority of payments made during the period were made within 15 days.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The purpose of CE is to help unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The current eligibility criteria set by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for entry onto the Community Employment programme allows for the combination of periods on different social welfare payments provided they add up to at least 12 consecutive months and the person is currently in receipt of the payment at the time of application.  The eligibility criteria is scheduled to be reviewed to see how it reflects the current unemployment situation and how it benefits those clients who would be best served by participating in CE.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 133 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is charged with leading the cross-Government drive to reduce administrative burdens on business. We are doing this in a prioritised way, drawing on the experiences of other Member States who are also involved in this international effort.  Departments are currently identifying the &ldquo;Information Obligations&rdquo;, contained in their legislation, likely to be causing the biggest burdens for business.  When the top Information Obligations have been identified, these priorities will be measured and, following this, simplification plans will be developed, detailing how the reductions are to be carried out. Work is now well advanced in my own Department in measuring information obligations in Company Law, Employment Law, and Health &amp; Safety Law.</P>
        <P>My Department has identified 34 priority Information Obligations across these three areas.  The priorities were identified through consultation with business groups and experts, and by comparison with the results of the UK measurement exercise. It is envisaged that measurement of the 34 Information Obligations will be completed by the end of 2009.  Other Departments are currently listing and prioritising the Information Obligations contained in the legislation under their responsibility. Measurement of priorities identified across Government will be carried out during 2010. Once these measurements have been concluded, simplification plans will be developed. Following this, simplification will be carried out during 2011 and 2012.</P>

	<P>It is the case that an employee must make application to my Department for a redundancy payment or seek a determination from the Employment Appeals Tribunal within twelve months of ceasing employment although the Employment Appeals Tribunal has the power to extend the deadline from 52 weeks to 104 weeks. In this instance, no claim was lodged with my Department for a redundancy payment.  I am advised, however, that a claim was lodged with the Employment Appeals Tribunal in April 2008, and was subsequently withdrawn.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent, quasi-judicial body under the aegis of my Department.  As an independent body, I have no role in the day to day operation of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned on 16 September, 2009, claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  I understand that an earlier application submitted in June 2009 was incomplete and was returned for completion.</P>
        <P>In this case, as in all cases where the employer claims inability to pay the employee(s) statutory redundancy, the Department requires the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. This includes providing the latest set of audited accounts for the company as well as certification from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the fact that the employer has insufficient assets to pay the redundancy entitlements.  Providing this documentation is submitted and is in order, the Department pays the employee(s) directly from the Social Insurance Fund.  If the supporting information required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee is advised by the Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee&rsquo;s right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, this allows the Department to make payment to the employee(s) concerned.</P>
<Col N="882"/>
        <P>In this case, information has been requested from the employee to establish whether the employer has paid the statutory payment, and my understanding is that she has not received her statutory redundancy payment from her former employer.  In view of this, the individual has been advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in order to establish her right to redundancy entitlement.  Recent communication between my Department and the individual concerned has taken place again very recently informing her of the steps necessary in order to establish her claim for redundancy payment.  In relation to lump sum claims such as in the current case, my Department is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first ten months of 2009 at 67,346.  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned on 14 September, 2009, claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  This application is awaiting processing and therefore no decision as to the entitlement of the individual to redundancy has yet been made.</P>
        <P>In this case, as in all cases where the employer claims inability to pay the employee(s) statutory redundancy, the Department requires the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. This includes providing the latest set of audited accounts for the company as well as certification from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the fact that the employer has insufficient assets to pay the redundancy entitlements.  Providing this documentation is submitted and is in order, the Department pays the employee(s) directly from the Social Insurance Fund.  If the supporting information required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee is advised by the Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee&rsquo;s right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, this allows the Department to make payment to the employee(s) concerned.</P>
        <P>In relation to lump sum claims,  my Department is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.  Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first ten months of 2009 at 67,346.  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.

It may be the case that the claim was submitted to the Department in this way and, if so, it would have been returned for completion/signature.  I understand that in this case the employer for whom the individual worked is in Receivership and in that instance, claims for redundancy would be submitted by the Receiver.  In general, eligibility for statutory lump sum redundancy claims require that:</P>

        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009 so that the waiting time is approximately 7 to 8 months depending on the manner of filing the application.

	<P>On the basis of the information supplied it is not clear if the employee was made redundant at a particular point in time or placed on a period of temporary lay off.  A lay off situation exists when an employer suspends an employee&rsquo;s employment because there is no work available, when the employer expects the cessation of work to be temporary and when the employer notifies the employee to this effect.  For a lay off situation to apply the period of lay off must be genuinely of a temporary nature.</P>
<Col N="887"/>
        <P>In general, redundancy is a situation where an employee&rsquo;s job has been made redundant and the employee is not replaced.  A key issue in respect of selection for redundancy is that the selection process must be seen to be fair and non-discriminatory.  Should an individual feel that they have been unfairly dismissed by reason of unfair selection for redundancy, it is open to that individual to take a case to the Rights Commissioners or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.  The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 2007 generally apply to any employee who has 12 months continuous service with the employer. In the case of a complaint referred to a Rights Commissioner, the employer may object and in that event the matter will be heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  If the employee has any further queries in this regard, they may contact the National Employment Rights Authority on their Lo-call number 1890 80 80 90 or via their website at www.employmentrights.ie</P>
        <P>The Unfair Dismissals Acts provide that the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Acts, not to be an unfair dismissal, if it results wholly or mainly from one or more of the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the capability, competence or qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind which he/she was employed to do,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the conduct of the employee (in which case the issue of disciplinary procedures may be important)</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the redundancy of the employee&rsquo;s job</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In determining for the purposes of the Acts whether the dismissal of an employee was an unfair dismissal or not, it shall be for the employer to show that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from one or more of the matters specified above or that there were other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.</P>

	<P>The differential in the price of goods between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland and the UK has been a matter of debate and concern for some time. The Government has been particularly concerned as to the impact these differentials are having on employment, business activity and consumer confidence. To this end I have been engaged with all elements of the grocery goods sector in an effort to bring greater transparency as to the reasons for the north south differential in prices and particularly as to the reasons why the benefits of the Euro&rsquo;s sustained appreciation in value over Sterling were not being passed on to consumers.</P>
        <P>As part of this engagement, my Department and its Agencies have directed a series of actions within the last 12 to 18 months to bring greater transparency to this area,  including National Consumer Agency Price Comparison Surveys; the Forf&aacute;s Report on the Cost of Running Retail Operations in Ireland and the Competition Authority Study on the Retail-Related Import and Distribution Sector.  Publication of these reports has assisted in informing the debate on why Irish consumers had not seen the full benefits of the ongoing strength of the Euro over Sterling in the prices they were paying for certain goods.</P>
        <P>Recent price trends indicate that the north south price differential is narrowing. Indeed returns from the Central Statistics Office show that prices in Ireland are falling faster than <Col N="888"/>anywhere else in the EU. Insofar as comparisons with Northern Ireland and the UK are concerned, the latest comparable figures show that retail prices fell by 6.5% in this jurisdiction in the year to September 2009, whereas prices only fell by 1.4 % in the UK for the same period. At the European level, the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is accepted as the most appropriate measure for community wide price comparisons, shows that in the year to September 2009 there was a fall of 3% in prices in Ireland as compared with an increase in prices of 0.3% (provisional) throughout the EU as a whole.  This narrowing in the differential in prices is very much to be welcomed and clearly will help the competitiveness of Irish businesses thereby helping to retain jobs, business activity and ensuring that Irish consumers get value for money.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the Competition Authority&rsquo;s 2008 Annual Report.  That report does not contain recommendations per se, rather it refers to recommendations made by the Authority that are contained in various reports published by the Authority over the past few years.  The Deputy may be aware of the commitment contained in <i>Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy</i> document to &ldquo;publish a whole-of-government response to recommendations contained in Competition Authority reports within nine months of their publication&rdquo;.  In this context, a prioritised list of Competition Authority recommendations, based on their impact on competitiveness, was drawn up by my Department earlier this year.  Recommendations contained in the NCC&rsquo;s Annual Competitiveness Report and various OECD reports also contributed to this list of recommendations.  I have written to the relevant Government Ministers seeking their views on how these recommendations, as they relate to their departments, can be progressed and I intend to bring an update to Government shortly on the progress achieved to date.</P>

	<P>On September 2nd 2009, I announced the establishment of Dublin Aerospace Ltd, a new aviation maintenance provider supported by Government through Enterprise Ireland.  Dublin Aerospace aims to establish a best-in-class Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility at Dublin Airport, servicing APUs, Landing Gear, Base Maintenance and Training.  The company has commenced operations with 32 initial employees recruited. This number is anticipated to grow to 226 jobs.  The Garage business unit of SR Technics has been taken over by the M50 Truck and Van Centre who were successful in securing the airside vehicle maintenance contract from SR Technics.  SR Technics will continue to operate the Line Maintenance contract for Aer Lingus until a suitable acceptable operator is agreed between both companies.</P>
        <P>A total of 54 apprentice aircraft mechanics and 6 apprentice mechanical automation and maintenance fitters were made redundant by S.R. Technics in April this year.  At the time 26 apprentice mechanics were at Phase 5 of their apprenticeship and are scheduled to do Phase 6 off-the-job training in the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) from 22 February until 11 June 2010.  There were 27 apprentice mechanics at Phase 3 and they have since completed a special Phase 4 off-the-job training programme in DIT on 4 September 2009 last.  This group will also be provided with Phase 6 training in February 2011.  Of the 6 apprentice fitters who were at Phase 5, 2 are currently required to re-sit outstanding examinations before they can progress, 3 are scheduled to commence Phase 4 off-the-job training in January 2010 and 1 is currently completing Phase 4 off-the-job training.  All apprentices will be required to complete on-the-job training with a F&Aacute;S approved employer, and my Department and F&Aacute;S are working to ensure appropriate training opportunities for all redundant apprentices.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees as in this case, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that two rebate applications were received from the employer in question in March of this year.  My Department raised some queries on the applications requiring the input of the employees and a delay was experienced as the employees had left the country making it difficult to obtain the necessary information.  I understand that following receipt of the required information very recently, the rebate claims in question are being processed and payment is expected to issue in respect of these claims within the next one to two weeks.  </P>

	<P>The basis of valuation for all commercial property, including hotels, is set out in Part 11 of the Valuation Act, 2001.  In arriving at a valuation for any property, the Valuation Office valuer takes account of a range of factors such as location, rental evidence, trading data and the physical characteristics of the building (including floor area).  All properties are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally.  Any individual ratepayer who has concerns about the valuation assessed on their property or any part thereof, including the method of calculation may, on payment of the statutory fee, appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal as provided for in the Valuation Act, 2001. There is a further right of appeal to the superior courts on a point of law.  I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act, 2001 and I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 144 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that the <Col N="893"/>measures taken to tackle cigarette smuggling involve a combination of cargo and passenger profiling, intelligence gathering and mutual assistance co-operation with other Customs services. Where appropriate, x-ray scanning technology is used to detect and seize contraband in maritime and air transport. In this regard a second mobile container scanner has been purchased and is due to be put into operation shortly.</P>
        <P>Where feasible, large consignments of contraband cigarettes detected at the point of importation are placed under surveillance and allowed to proceed to their destination under a controlled delivery, with a view to identifying and prosecuting those responsible for the importation. Revenue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement agencies mount joint operations where appropriate.  The multi-agency code-named Operation Samhna, which resulted in the seizure of in excess of 120 million cigarettes at Greenore on 27 October 2009, is a prime example of the fruits of multi-agency co-operation in the fight against organised crime involving tobacco smuggling.</P>
        <P>Revenue policy also entails close liaison with individual tobacco manufacturers and the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee (ITMAC) with a view to identifying illicit cigarettes on sale in the State, current trends and trading patterns. In addition, Ireland, along with other Member States, has ratified two international agreements concluded by European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) with global cigarette manufacturers Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, with a view to tackling the illicit trade in counterfeit and contraband cigarettes. There is also close co-operation and sharing of information between Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control (OTC).</P>
        <P>I can advise the Deputy that Revenue enforcement officers have been conducting checks at retail outlets, markets, and distribution centres in an ongoing operation entitled Operation Downstream since December 2007. This operation focuses on seizing illicit cigarettes that evaded detection at the point of importation. In the course of this operation, 208 seizures totalling 8.7 m cigarettes were made during the first nine months of 2009. These checks are carried out on the basis of specific information received concerning certain outlets and at premises such as markets where contraband cigarettes are known to be on sale. In a parallel ongoing operation targeting cigarette packs bearing counterfeit tax stamps, checks have been made at more than 200 retail stores in the Dublin region in the course of 2009 to date. This operation was instigated following the detection of bogus Irish Tobacco Tax Stamps on counterfeit cigarettes smuggled from China.</P>
        <P>The intelligence and operational strategy is backed up by a robust prosecution policy which has resulted in 125 convictions for cigarette smuggling or dealing in smuggled cigarettes during the first 10 months of 2009. A significant number of other cases are already before the Courts awaiting hearing or are being processed for prosecution.  The Revenue Commissioners actively engage on an ongoing basis with OLAF and also with other Customs Administrations in the Member States on the matter of cigarette smuggling. OLAF has set up a special task force titled Task Group Cigarettes for this purpose. Revenue has sought the assistance of OLAF&rsquo;s Liaison Officer in Beijing in a number of investigations, involving large seizures of contraband cigarettes in maritime containers from China, by requesting the assistance of the Chinese Authorities.  In addition, OLAF have coordinated and supported other major investigations being conducted by Revenue involving cigarette smuggling from the US and more recently from the Philippines.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that, under Community law, passengers arriving from another EU member state are entitled to bring duty paid cigarettes and tobacco for personal use. As regards the statistics requested by the Deputy regarding seizures of cigarettes and tobacco products at Dublin Airport, the position is set out in the following table.</P>

        <Quest> if the Valuations Office is undertaking fresh valuations in local authorities based on property values and business volumes at the height of the boom and revaluing the base for rate purposes in a way that is inappropriate for the present state of the market; and if he will make a statement on the fairness of this approach. </Quest>

	<P>The Valuation Act, 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May 2002 provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property.  The old valuation lists date from the Griffith Valuation carried out in the 19th century. Maintaining these lists requires the Valuation Office to determine valuations by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. The result is a list of valuations that bear no resemblance to modern valuation levels and contains many anomalies. It has long been recognised that protecting the integrity of the local authority rating system nationally requires that this be addressed and the national revaluation programme is the means by which this is being done.</P>
        <P>The basis of rateable valuation for all commercial property is net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property. In a revaluation, properties are assessed, in accordance with statute, by reference to rental values at a specific valuation date and a new list of valuations is produced. This new list is then used by the rating authority to levy rates on individual ratepayers. By virtue of the statutory requirement that the valuation date precede the date on which a Valuation Order is made (initiating a revaluation in any given local authority area) and the work involved in actually carrying out a revaluation of several thousand properties <Col N="895"/>before the final valuation list is published, there will be a significant interval between the valuation date and the date of publication of a new list.</P>
        <P>Revaluation is essentially about the redistribution of the commercial rates burden between ratepayers depending on the relative shift in the rental values of the properties they occupy. It is the relative value of properties to each other rather than the absolute value of an individual property, which will determine whether the rates liability of any given property decreases or increases following a revaluation.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and following completion of the initial national revaluation programme. This should result in a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of the recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.  In essence, the exercise is aimed at ensuring a fair sharing of the rates burden across all categories of ratepayers.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will report on statistics on price increases in insurance rates; and the action he proposes to take to control same which seem difficult to understand or appreciate in these deflationary times. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that there has been an increase in insurance premiums this year. This increase however has to be considered against a backdrop of the continuing stress in the financial markets and the recessionary pressures in the economy which is affecting all financial service providers including the insurance industry.  While the Financial Regulator does not maintain statistics on price increases in the insurance sector, it has provided some background as to why insurance prices have increased in these deflationary times. It has advised me that while the non-life insurance market performed well up to the end of 2006, market sources indicate that much non-life business was written at a loss in 2007. This trend continued in 2008, but the companies were still willing to write business at a loss in order to maintain their market share. They were able to do this as a result of the reserves they had built up during profitable years. However, the situation could not go on indefinitely and indications are that firms are now taking action on pricing to underpin their financial positions.</P>
        <P>This position is supported by a report published earlier this year by Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s titled &lsquo;<i>A Testing 2009 for the Irish Non-Life Insurance Market, Despite Fundamental Strengths&rsquo;</i>. It provides an insight into the problems facing the industry at the moment. The report envisages a difficult year for the non-life industry as a result of rising claims and continuing intense competition which they say is limiting price increases. They add that this combined with anticipated lower investment returns is expected to hinder profitability.  In the current difficult trading climate, there is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the long-term sustainability of the non-life insurance industry and at the same time making sure that the consumer obtains good value for money.  I am particularly conscious of the impact of a significant increase in premiums for both the consumer and business and I have informed the industry that it must be a priority for  them to ensure that insurance cover is provided as competitively as possible consistent with long term commercial sustainability and viability.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, the recent upward trend in insurance prices reflects a range of factors outside the control of the industry.   It would not, therefore be appropriate from a policy perspective to seek to intervene in the commercial conduct or decision making of insurance firms in the absence of clear evidence of market failure in respect of which there is scope to address from a national perspective.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to a loophole in the tax law or schemes that allow for the withdrawal of moneys from limited companies by directors to their personal accounts and nil rates of tax; the consequent loss of revenue to the State; the consequences for the suppliers of services to those companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The position is that where a company transfers funds into a director&rsquo;s personal bank account, whether such bank account is located inside or outside the State, for the purpose of tax treatment it is necessary to determine firstly the character of the funds transferred.  Where the funds transferred represent directors&rsquo; remuneration, the company must make the appropriate deductions of tax, PRSI, Health Levy and the Income Levy under the PAYE system before making any transfer and account for such deductions to the Collector-General.  Where the funds transferred represent dividend payments in respect of shares held in the company by the director, Dividend Withholding Tax must be deducted and accounted for by the company and the director must include such income in his or her income tax return under the self-assessment system.</P>
        <P>Where the funds transferred represent a loan extended to the director at a rate of interest below the specified rate (currently 12.5%), there is a benefit in kind charge on the director from which the company must make and account for the appropriate deductions under the PAYE system.  If the company subsequently &lsquo;writes off&rsquo; the loan in favour of the director, then, in addition to the benefit in kind charge, the amount of the loan written off is taxable as normal remuneration on which tax, etc. is to be paid under the PAYE system.  If the loan has been extended by what is known as a &lsquo;close company&rsquo; (broadly one which is under the control of five or fewer shareholders or under the control of the directors), then the company is deemed to have made, in the tax year in which the loan was made, an annual payment which after the deduction of income tax at the standard rate for that year is equal to the amount of the loan. However, this income tax is repayable when the director repays the loan to the company.  This provision does not apply when the loan does not exceed &euro;19,050, the director works full-time for the company or any of its associated companies and the director does not have a material interest in the company.</P>
        <P>Where the Revenue Commissioners are aware that a company has not applied the correct tax treatment to any funds transferred into a director&rsquo;s bank account, they will take whatever steps are necessary to recover the tax, PRSI, Health Levy and the Income Levy due (and interest and penalties, as appropriate).</P>

	<P>Cohabitating couples are expressly recognised for the purpose of social welfare law but are not recognised for the purposes of income tax law. Although this may appear contradictory, the main aim of both the welfare code and the tax code is to uphold the constitutional right of married couples not to be treated less favourably than unmarried couples.  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  In the particular circumstances outlined, where a couple are co-habiting rather than married, it is not permitted under existing legislation to transfer tax credits between the individuals.</P>

	<P>This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department has no jurisdiction over tax collection matters.  I am advised by Revenue that the case in question involves the gift of property from one person to another where the parties apparently agreed that the beneficiary would pay the Capital Gains Tax due in respect of the disposal of property.  The position is that, to date, only part of the Capital Gains Tax due has been paid.  The liability to pay Capital Gains Tax rests with the person disposing of the property, notwithstanding any private arrangements between the parties that the beneficiary would make the payment to Revenue.  I am advised that Revenue has made this very clear to the person who disposed of the property &mdash; both verbally and in writing &mdash; following the Deputy&rsquo;s previous representations on behalf of the person concerned.  As no proposals have been received to pay the balance of tax due, Revenue is taking appropriate action to pursue collection.  Revenue&rsquo;s Collector-General&rsquo;s Division will be happy to elaborate further on the particular circumstance of this case if the Deputy wishes to make direct contact with that Division (telephone 061-488202). </P>

	<P>The rationale for giving various tax reliefs to statutory and Revenue-approved pension savings schemes is to encourage and promote savings over the long term in order that individuals will have an adequate replacement income in old age. Any proposal, however well intentioned, that would allow pre-retirement access by individuals to retirement savings could significantly reduce the quantum of pension savings available to those individuals in retirement. </P>
        <P>Emerging demographic indicators point to increasing numbers of people living longer and healthier lives with more of their lives spent in retirement than previously. In those circumstances, I think it is important to protect pension savings to ensure an adequate post-retirement income. Revenue approval of occupational pension schemes is given on the basis, essentially, that benefits may generally only be paid at the point of retirement (usually from age 60) or death, whichever is the earlier. Similar rules apply in the case of personal pensions such as retirement annuity contracts and PRSAs. I have no plans to amend these provisions.  In the case of occupational pension schemes, however, subject to the terms and conditions of the particular scheme rules, employees may take &ldquo;early retirement&rdquo; benefits anytime from age 50. However, where early retirement is chosen, benefits will be restricted.</P>

	<P>The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 amended the Value-Added Tax Act 1972 to provide for the introduction of a Travel Agents Margin Scheme.  Under this scheme certain travel agents will be liable to VAT in respect of the travel agents margin on their supply of certain services, not in respect of the overall consideration they receive for such services.  This scheme, which is provided for in Articles 306 to 310 of the EU VAT Directive, is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2010 and will bring Ireland into line with other EU Member States.  Currently all EU States with the exception of Denmark and the Netherlands operate a Margin Scheme for tour operators.  The scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers.</P>
        <P>The EU VAT Directive sets out the various options for Member States in terms of rates of tax that may be applied to particular goods or services.  However, the Directive does not provide an option for Member States to apply a reduced rate to a travel agent&rsquo;s margin on his or her supplies under the Margin Scheme.  Where no such option is provided for in the Directive, the standard rate of VAT must be applied to those supplies.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of unfair competition, Article 307 of the VAT Directive specifies that the travel facilities supplied by a travel agent acting as a principal are to be regarded as a single supply to the traveller, rather than multiple supplies of different travel facilities.  In the absence of the Margin Scheme, stand-alone supplies of hotel room reservations would become taxable as the supply of accommodation in the country where the hotel is situated.  In so far as accommodation within the EU is concerned, this would entail registration and accounting for VAT in each Member State involved.  This would be contrary to the intention of the Margin Scheme at EU level, where the supply by the travel agent to the traveller is taxable only where the travel agent is established.  Under the Margin Scheme, the travel agent is thus relieved of the obligation to register in all the Member States where the traveller uses accommodation bought in by the travel agent.  In the circumstances, the rate of VAT that will apply to the supply of travel facilities by a travel agent covered by the Travel Agents Margin Scheme will be the standard rate of VAT, which is currently 21.5%.</P>

	<P>The latest available figures on incomes of  public sector employees is derived from income tax returns filed for the income tax year 2007 and representing about 96 per cent of all returns expected at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes. On this basis the incomes from the employment of public sector employees amounted to close on &euro;15.1 billion. This figure includes the combined employment income of married couples where both spouses are earning as it is not possible to identify the precise amount of the income earned by the second spouse that arises from public sector employment.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent available year for collection data is 2008.  The yields in 2008 from PRSI contributions, paid over by employers, in respect of public sector employees taxed under the PAYE system are estimated at &euro;2.3 billion. This amount is a combination of employer and employee social insurance contributions and employee health levy.  A breakdown of the 3 components that make up the total PRSI amount is not readily available.  Corresponding payments of PAYE tax amounted to &euro;2.9 billion. Revenue does not have the corresponding figures for the income levy as it did not apply in 2008.</P>
        <P>The Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009 (REV) estimated that for 2009 receipts from the public service pension-related deduction in 2009 would be approximately &euro;940 million.  Figures to end-September show receipts from the pension-related deduction of the order of &euro;540 million, and is expected to be broadly on target at end-year.  The end-September figure does not include receipts from the employees of Local Authorities.  In addition, estimates of superannuation contributions coming to some &euro;540 million in 2009 were published in the Rev.   I should point out that the marginal tax rate comprises income tax, income and health levies <Col N="901"/>and PRSI.  The marginal tax rates for single public servants earning &euro;30,000, &euro;50,000, &euro;75,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 per annum are set out below.</P>

The balance of the funding i.e 10 percent is a matter for the relevant Local Authorities.  No applications for funding for coastal works for 2009 were received from Co. Waterford. The OPW will be considering proposals from the Local Authorities for the 2010 Coastal Protection Programme early in the New Year.  The OPW has no plans to provide 100 per cent funding for Coastal Protection Works. </P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recently completed historical data available on incomes and tax is in respect of the income tax year 2007. On this basis the information requested in relation to the top 4% of income earners and income quintiles is set out in the following table.  To assemble the figures by income quintile, the total number of income earners on the income tax record for each year <Col N="903"/>was broken down into 5 equal groups and distributed over 5 income ranges in ascending order of income. The figures for gross income, income tax, average tax rate and standard deviation were then established for each quintile group as appropriate.  It should be noted that the tax liability in any of the income quintiles shown also includes a liability to DIRT. In the lower quintiles, this is likely to be the only tax liability arising.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the figures for income shown in the table relate to gross income as defined in the Revenue Statistical Report, 2008. They do not include incomes such as income from patent royalties, profits from commercial forestry, income before pension contributions and income from earnings of writers, composers and artists.  It should also be noted that gross income is different to taxable income, also defined in the Revenue Statistical Report 2008, which relates to income after personal reliefs and deductions (including deductions for capital allowances) but prior to the application of tax credits and reliefs at the standard rate.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information available is in respect of income tax relief allowed for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) for the income tax year 2007. RACs and PRSAs are available to the self-employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes.  The information is set out in tables following this reply which provide the number of cases, amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for RACs and PRSAs for the various contribution ranges. The information is based on income returns contained in Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing close on 90% of all returns expected. A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
        <P>The figures for the total number of cases and the total reduction in tax shown in the tables are lower than those indicated in the table supplied with the reply I gave on 3 November last  to Parliamentary Question ref 38545/09 tabled by the Deputy. This is due to the fact that the figures now being provided represent under 90 per cent of all income tax returns expected for 2007, while the figures supplied on 3 November were, in accordance with normal practice, grossed-up at aggregate level to adjust for this incompleteness.  It is not possible to provide corresponding figures in regard to the take-up of the tax relief for pension contributions by employers and employees to occupational pension schemes as the relevant data are not captured in such a way as to make this possible.</P>
        <P>Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers or employers. The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers from 2006 on. These changes have yielded additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions but, as the returns are aggregated at employer level, they cannot provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of any proposals to limit tax relief for pension investment for individuals across different income ranges.</P>

	<P>Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief for investments in qualifying films.  A qualifying film is a film for which the Revenue Commissioners have issued a Certificate under Section 481. Further provisions are included in Regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Arts, Sport and Tourism. I do not plan to extend this provision to include other sectors.</P>

	<P><b>Minister for Finance ( Mr Lenihan):</b> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant available information relates to the income tax year 2006.  In that year, an estimated 2,890 claimants availed of the artists&rsquo; exemption scheme at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of &euro;66 million.  An income distribution by reference to bands of exempt income is set out in the following table. This information is based on income tax returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 93% of all returns expected from claimants for this exemption.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>

	<P>Ireland has played an important role internationally on the issue of alleviation of the debt burden of developing countries. The Government&rsquo;s policy on Debt Strategy, which was prepared jointly by the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs, was published in 2002. It supports the cancellation of the debts of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries in accordance with internationally agreed criteria. This policy is currently being updated by the two Departments and this will be completed shortly. Input to this process has been received from civil society organisations.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor and Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance has always been exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans. As regards debt relief, the Irish Government has provided significant resources for initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden on developing countries mainly through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The MDRI came into effect on 1 July 2006 and <Col N="911"/>provides for cancellation of eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the world&rsquo;s poorer and most indebted countries. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this initiative was &euro;59m which it contributed in full in 2006. Ireland has also contributed over &euro;20m to the HIPC initiative.</P>

The turnover threshold, below which traders can qualify for the cash-basis system, is currently &euro;1 million.  This threshold has been effective since 1 March 2007, before which it was &euro;635,000.  With regard to increasing further the cash-basis threshold, the Deputy will appreciate that it is the usual practice for the Minister for Finance not to speculate or comment in advance of the Budget on what it will contain and I do not propose to deviate from that practice.</P>

	<P>The term public sector is usually taken to comprise all those who are employed, both directly and indirectly, by a public body.  The public service is, broadly speaking, the public sector less the commercial semi-state bodies.  Public <Col N="913"/>service pension schemes are mainly statutory, set up by or under Acts of the Oireachtas, and virtually all are financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, that is, as part of current expenditure, voted in the annual estimates. Thus, pension liabilities are secured by the Government. While pension schemes for commercial state companies are also mainly statutory they differ in that they normally operate a pre-funding system, setting aside funds and investing them to meet future liabilities as and when they arise.</P>
        <P>Most public service occupational pension schemes are contributory. A main scheme contribution of 5% applies to a number of groups, including teachers and local authority and health service personnel. The contribution rate for spouses and children&rsquo;s benefits is, generally, 1.5%. Thus, the combined pension contribution made by many public servants is 6.5%.  There is a wide range of pension scheme contribution arrangements in the commercial semi-state sector. The contribution rates reflect the circumstances within the organisation and the assets and liabilities of the pension fund; the rates are set by trustees, the employers and in many cases are discussed with union representatives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt> Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister for Finance, I have no role in relation to the setting of mortgage interest rates, nor does the Financial Regulator.  The pricing of fixed rate mortgages by lending institutions would normally be based on institutions&rsquo; own cost of obtaining fixed rate funding for the period in question plus a margin. The actual cost of funds for each institution cannot be assessed on a mortgage by mortgage basis as they manage the risk on a portfolio basis using several types of wholesale funding and derivatives, depending on the size of each institution and its mortgage book.</P>
        <P>Regarding the application of early redemption fees on fixed rate mortgages, when a borrower signs a fixed-rate mortgage contract with a mortgage provider, the lender in turn must in effect borrow the money at an agreed fixed rate. The mortgage lender must repay the money at this agreed rate, so there may be a cost to the institution if the fixed rate agreement is terminated before the agreed term. This gives rise to the redemption fee charged in these cases.  The Financial Regulator carried out a review of this issue earlier this year and submitted a report to my Department and the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service. The review focused on the early redemption fees being applied by lenders on fixed rate mortgages and looked at, among other things, actuarial reports examining the formulae applied by the different lenders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principal findings indicate that: the early redemption fee calculation in all cases appears to seek to cover the costs; and lenders do not generally apply additional fees in the case of early redemption. Lenders do not therefore seem to be applying financial penalties in order to dissuade borrowers from early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.  Notwithstanding the findings of the review set out above, I am aware that the Financial Regulator would strongly advise that any borrower who believes that he/she has been charged an excessive early redemption charge should request his/her lending institution to provide a clear explanation of how the cost was calculated.  In the event that the borrower is not satisfied with the explanation, a formal complaint should be made to the lender and in the event of an unsatisfactory response, he or she should exercise his/her option to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman who will independently adjudicate on the matter.</P>

	<P>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department received an application on behalf of the Youth Project referred to by the Deputy, to be considered for funding in 2008 under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme. Due to the large number of applications received and the limited funding available, it was not possible to provide the funding requested.  The 2009 budget allocation for youth services is over &euro;48m, a decrease of 8% on the 2008 figure. In light of budgetary constraints, it is intended that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget will continue to focus on supporting existing youth programmes and services for young people including those with fewer opportunities. In that context, Youth Affairs Unit will not be in a position to consider any new applications for funding this year.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding the provision of the early childhood care and education scheme; the number of services that have joined the scheme; the number of children eligible to participate; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010.  The scheme is open to all commercial and community pre-schools and creche facilities, which are notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) or registered with the Irish Montessori Educational Board (IMEB).  Children will be eligible to avail of the preschool year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months on 1 September each year.</P>
        <P>A key requirement of the scheme is that pre-school leaders must hold a certificate for a major award in child care/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ) or an equivalent recognised qualification in the child care/early education field.  In the first two full years of the scheme, the qualification requirement will be met where a person holds an award in ECCE that includes the four core modules of Early Education, Child Development, Caring for Children and Work Experience and has at least two years of working in a position of responsibility with children aged from birth to 6 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a condition of the preschool year that services which wish to participate will be required to provide an appropriate educational programme for children which adheres to the principles of S&iacute;olta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education.  S&iacute;olta is a quality assurance process which addresses all aspects of practice in early childhood care and education services.  It is designed to support practitioners to develop high quality services for children aged from birth to six years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An annual capitation fee of over &euro;2,450 will be paid to participating services in return for the provision of a free preschool year to each child.  Payments will be made to services at the beginning of each term.  A higher capitation rate of &euro;2,850 per annum will be paid to sessional playschool services where all child care workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the scheme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate all Preschool leaders in the service must hold a level 7 or 8 qualification relating to child care and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and all assistants must hold a relevant level 5 qualification.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a fundamental principle of the scheme that it is available to parents free of charge.  Services may, however, charge parents for additional services provided these are clearly optional to parents and provided appropriate programme based activities continue to be provided to children not availing of such services during the preschool year hours.  Services partici<Col N="917"/>pating in the scheme should be satisfied that they will be in a position to meet all of their costs from the capitation provided and additional funding will not be provided where this is not the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Services can provide the preschool year from a range of options.  A full or part-time day care service will normally provide the place for 2 hours 15 minutes a day, five days a week over 50 weeks.  A playschool sessional service will normally be required to provide a pre-school service for 3 hours a day, five days a week over 38 weeks.  However, where for good reason a sessional service is unable to operate over 5 days, it may participate in the scheme by providing a place for 3 hours 30 minutes a day, 4 days a week over 41 weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Further flexibility is provided for in that, a full or part-time service may choose to provide a sessional service over 38 weeks of a year (or 2 sessional services each day) while a sessional service may choose to provide 2 hours 15 minutes per day over 50 weeks.  Also in cases where children attend a full or part-time day care service for 3 days a week only, consideration will be given to allowing the service to participate in the scheme on the basis of providing the pre-school year to those children for 3 hours 45 minutes a day for 3 days a week.  In such cases, a service will be required to provide the preschool year over 50 weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Applications by approximately 4,200 child care services to enter the new scheme indicate a capacity of 98,000 preschool year places.  It is hoped that some 63,000 children will avail of the scheme in January 2010.  Contracts are currently issuing to all services which meet the criteria of the scheme and a list of services approved to participate in the scheme will be available shortly from the City and County Child care Committees (CCCs).  Based on the applications to date, I am confident that the total number of places available in preschool services applying to enter the scheme will meet the number of places required.</P>

        <Quest> if she has monitored the amount of the &euro;4.78 million allocated to cystic fibrosis services in 2006 which have been spent to date in 2009; if her Department is working with the Health Service Executive on this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The provision of services for people with cystic fibrosis is monitored closely by my Department.  In 2006 additional revenue funding of &euro;4.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to develop services.  I understand from the Executive that amongst other service developments this funding facilitated the recruitment of some 46 additional staff including consultants, nursing and allied health professionals across a number of hospitals. </P>
        <P>The HSE has been asked to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the amount of revenue funding spent to date in 2009.  In addition to revenue funding, under the HSE capital programme, a  new ward block to replace existing accommodation is being developed at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, the national tertiary centre for the treatment of adult patients with cystic fibrosis. This facility will provide single room en-suite in-patient accommodation (100 rooms) and a dedicated day unit for people with CF, including 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.  Site clearance work has already commenced. It is intended  that the building will be operational as early as possible in 2011.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Board has recognised adoptions effected in South Africa and entered them in the Register of Foreign Adoptions under section 5 of the Adoption Act 1991.  The Adoption Board has previously examined the adoption laws of South Africa and deemed them to be in compliance with Irish Law.  The Hague Conference on Private International Law lists South Africa as having ratified and signed the Convention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Adoption Bill 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad and I am actively seeking time for its progression in the current D&aacute;il session.  As I have stated on many previous occasions, under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have also ratified the Hague Convention and from countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement that meets Hague standards.  There are transitional provisions contained in the Bill.  However, the issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, has been raised with me by representative groups.  I am currently examining this and other related matters.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Bill 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad.  The Bill is scheduled to commence its Second Stage process in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 18 November.  As I have stated on many previous occasions, under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have also ratified the Hague Convention and from countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement that meets Hague standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should also emphasise that there are transitional provisions contained in the Bill.  The issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage in the adoption process, when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, has been raised with me by representative groups.  I am currently examining this and other related matters.  There are no proposals in the legislation to restrict adoptions to a specific country after the Hague Convention has been ratified once the necessary standards are met.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was effected in the best interests of the child.  For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of <Col N="919"/>the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</P>

	<P>I understand that the child in question is on the cardiac surgery waiting list and that  the HSE expects that surgery will be scheduled as soon as possible for this patient.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital is the National Centre for Paediatric Cardiology and Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.  The demand for paediatric cardiac surgery has increased due to the increased birth rate and the success rates for children who then require further staged surgery.</P>
        <P>The HSE has worked with the Paediatric Critical Care Network (PCCN) to address the issue of the need for additional intensive care beds.  A new build that will include the replacement of 13 paediatric intensive care beds and an additional 4 beds, providing a total of 17 beds, has been agreed as a new development at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  A design team has recently been appointed and work is under way on the development.  It is anticipated that this new development will be completed within 18 months.  The HSE is in active discussions with OLCHC with a view to implementing an interim arrangement for cardiac surgery and ICU capacity in advance of the building of the 13 replacement and four additional ICU beds.</P>

	<P>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, is a new system of financial support for people who are ordinarily resident in Ireland and require long-term nursing home care. The scheme encompasses an important principle of resident choice. The effect of this principle is that applicants can choose any public, private or voluntary nursing home in the State which is approved for the purposes of the scheme.  The scheme does not extend to nursing homes in Northern Ireland. The decision not to extend the scheme to such nursing homes was taken by Government on the basis of legal advice received.  However, anyone who was in an approved private nursing home when the scheme commenced can retain their existing subvention arrangements. This includes those in nursing homes in Northern Ireland.</P>
<Col N="921"/>
        <P>With regard to the inspection of nursing homes, the Health Act, 2007 provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes by the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the HIQA.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE&rsquo;s) 32 local health areas.  Under the HSE&rsquo;s 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the HSE&rsquo;s Primary Care Reimbursement Service <Col N="922"/>(PCRS) in Dublin.  The initial phase of the centralisation process commenced in January 2009 with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin City to the PCRS.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  The PCRS has processed over 55,000 medical card applications since the start of 2009.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed my Department that the transfer of the case load from the two local health offices included a backlog of some 6,500 open cases which are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS, and as a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and phone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is arranging that additional resources are deployed to respond to phone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications.</P>
        <P>The Executive has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  The HSE has recently put in place a national on-line system to allow local health offices track the current status of applications in the PCRS.  The centralising of the medical card application process is facilitating a number of enhancements to the level of customer service associated with these applications.  The HSE has indicated that later this month a facility will be available where a person can view the status of their medical card application online and if a mobile phone number is supplied with an application, updates by SMS will be delivered to the applicant&rsquo;s phone.</P>
        <P>I fully support the HSE&rsquo;s decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location. The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />improved turnaround time for the processing of applications (under the new arrangements, the Executive will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications, and emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />equitable application of eligibility across the country;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />consistency of service provision to customers;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />clearer lines of governance and accountability; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />mproved unified data.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.</P>
        <P>This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.</P>

	<P>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Items available for sale in so-called &ldquo;head shops&rdquo; are currently not scheduled under Misuse of Drugs legislation. The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review. For example, in 2006 psychotropic (&rsquo;magic&rsquo;) mushrooms, which were on sale in such outlets, were banned and their possession and sale is now illegal. On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.  Deputy John Curran, Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops. My officials are in contact with their counterparts in the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new free preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which will be introduced in January 2010.  The objective of the ECCE scheme is to ensure that all children have the opportunity to avail of free preschool provision.  An annual capitation fee of &euro;2,450, or &euro;2,850 where the higher capitation applies, is being paid to service providers for each child enrolled for the free preschool provision under the scheme.  Parents who may not have accessed a preschool programme for their child until now will be encouraged to support their children&rsquo;s participation in the year on the basis of a daily attendance pattern, as will be the case when a child commences primary school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result, the scheme will normally be required to be provided over five days each week.  This is considered the most appropriate framework to ensure that children receive an appropriate level of early learning involving appropriate programme-based activities in the critical developmental year before they commence primary school.  To facilitate services which currently accommodate a greater number of children than they have places for (i.e. on a <i>pro rata</i> basis), during January to September 2010 services may participate in the scheme on this basis, in which case they will be paid in respect of the number of qualifying children attending per day rather than the total number of children per week.  For the reasons stated above, this will not be continued beyond September 2010.</P>

	<P>Applicants for inter-country adoption must undergo a detailed statutory assessment process, which is undertaken by professional Social Workers, and must be approved by the Adoption Board before a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt abroad can be issued to them from the Board.  An important and integral aspect of this assessment process is that applicants develop and exhibit an understanding of and an appreciation of the culture and ethnic origins of the child whom they would propose to adopt. This is necessary so that the adoptive parents are capable of supporting an adopted child from a foreign country living in Ireland having been adopted abroad.</P>
        <P>Moreover, in order to exercise appropriate control over the process of inter-country adoption into Ireland under the Adoption Acts 1952-1998, it is necessary to ensure that applicants to adopt abroad are only engaging with one specified foreign country at any given time.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad. The Bill is scheduled to commence its second stage process in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 18th of November.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future inter-country adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</P>
        <P>The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are transitional provisions contained in the Bill. However, the issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, has been raised with me by representative groups. I am currently examining this and other related matters.</P>
        <P>My Office has been in negotiations with the Vietnamese Government regarding the drafting of a new bilateral inter-country Adoption agreement for some time. I have clearly indicated my intention to await the finalisation of the International Social Services Report on Inter-country Adoption in Vietnam before making final decisions regarding the next steps. I will be considering the report along with the report published in August by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I anticipate the ISS report will be finalised this month. I will be communicating my decision at the earliest opportunity. I am mindful of the difficult position many prospective adopters find themselves at this point in time.</P>
        <P>The Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai recently led a trade mission to Ireland.  I took the opportunity to meet again with Minister Hai whom I had met with during my July visit to Vietnam. The meeting took place on the 23rd October. Adoption matters were discussed. The meeting was most amicable and allowed both Governments to outline their <Col N="925"/>current positions in relation to the bilateral agreement and legislative developments in each jurisdiction, including Hague Convention ratification. Both Governments restated their desire to achieve the highest standards in inter-country adoption and they committed to ongoing dialogue to advance these goals.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Office does not appear to have received representations to date in this case.  However, I am happy to set out below the current position with regard to the issues raised by the Deputy.  The Adoption Bill, 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad.  The Bill is scheduled to commence its second stage process in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 18th of November.  As I have stated on many previous occasions, under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have also ratified the Hague Convention and from countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement that meets Hague standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was effected in the best interests of the child.  For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.  There are transitional provisions contained in the Bill.  However, the issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, has been raised with me by representative groups.  I am currently examining this and other related matters.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the award and subsequent payment of medical negligence awards; if the current system of lump sum awards is in legislation or simply custom and practice; if it would be more appropriate to have a system with an annual payment; if the court has the power to so order; or the legislation which would need amendment to give effect to same; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In Ireland at present, a lump sum award in respect of general and special damages is the only system of compensating victims in respect of personal injury actions, to include those who suffer such injuries by way of alleged medical negligence.  Currently periodic payments, or the use of Periodic Payment Orders (PPOs), is not a feature of the Irish Tort system.  However, I am informed that the power to make awards of damages on a periodic basis has been a feature of the English legal landscape for a number of years now, since the passing into law in that country of the Damages Act, 1996.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of months the State Claims Agency has been working with a firm of actuaries to draw up a PPO blueprint to be used in catastrophic injury cases, whether caused by medical negligence or otherwise.  The Agency is hopeful that it will have its PPO formulation for presentation to the courts in early 2010.  At the same time, the State Claims Agency is engaging with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the introduction of a statutory PPO scheme.</P>
        <P>Conflicting expert evidence on life expectancy, future care costs, the discount rate and other matters place a significant burden on the judiciary in hearing such cases.  The plaintiff in receipt of a lump sum award must bear the mortality and investment risk that the award will be sufficient to cater for their future needs. Lump sum awards cannot by their nature take account of the changing needs of the patient.  While a review of the system of lump sum awards is not <Col N="929"/>a matter for me or my Department, in my view there is potential to improve the situation for all parties by allowing for periodic payments in the right circumstances.  I look forward to seeing the outcome of the engagement between the State Claims Agency and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in that regard.</P>

	<P>Ireland has contracts with two manufacturers to provide 7.7 million doses of pandemic vaccine over a period of between 6 and 12 months. Both of these vaccines have now received a licence from the EU and all of the available medical evidence, both national and international, indicates that both are safe and suitable for this purpose. It is currently recommended that two separate doses are given but following the receipt of recent clinical data in relation to one of the vaccines (Pandemrix) we are now permitted to recommend that one dose will be adequate to give cover to everyone over 13 years of age except those who are immunocompromised. All children under 13 and those people who are immunocompromised will still require two doses of this vaccine.  As a result of this recent development the Health Service Executive will examine the existing contracts to ascertain if any adjustments can be agreed and we are also looking at the possibility of offering any excess vaccine we might have to other countries that require vaccine.</P>

	<P>Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and where this is not feasible for whatever reason, to support access to quality, long-term affordable residential care.  The priorities of the Department in relation to older people in recent times have been the introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and the bringing into force of new regulatory standards for the long-term residential care sector.</P>
<Col N="932"/>
        <P>The Department, however, is also cognisant of the number of older people living in the community, a large percentage of whom do so with the assistance of the State, family members, carers, or a combination of all three. In accordance with both a recommendation of the Long Term Care Working Group, and a commitment under <i>&ldquo;T 2016&rdquo;</i>, earlier this year the Department commissioned an independent Evaluation of Home Care Packages. This report, by PA Consulting, has been received recently in the Department, and will be published shortly, following consideration by the Minister. The report will help inform future policy and service direction for services for older people generally, including improvements to be introduced in 2010 to the Home Care Package Initiative provided by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>In the context of the issue raised by the Deputy, two other relevant reports on home care were also recently completed.  A Consultation Paper by the Law Reform Commission, entitled <i>Legal Aspects of Carers, </i>was published last July and considers the legal issues surrounding home care. It makes a number of provisional recommendations in the area of standards and regulations generally, including vetting, training and supervision. It also provisionally recommends giving a function to the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), in relation to professional home care. Any such changes would require primary legislation and detailed stakeholder consultations.</P>
        <P>A report, <i>Implementation of the Home Care Package Scheme,</i>undertaken by the National Economic and Social Forum on Home Care Packages, was launched on 28 October last. This acknowledges that while the Home Care Package Initiative was a well thought out policy, various improvements are required in relation to implementation, including training and vetting of staff.  The Department accepts the need for a more standardised approach to the regulation of home care generally, whether by public or private provision. The Department, and the HSE, are at present considering issues such as:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />agreeing national standardised access and operational guidelines for delivery of Home Care Packages; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the adoption  and dissemination by  the HSE of a voluntary code of <i>Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services for Older People, </i>which will apply to public and private providers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition to these measures, the Department is also considering the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recommendations in the context of possible changes to legislation and regulation in the area of home care for older persons generally.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 253 together.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the European Commission commenced a consultation process for the review of the Package Holiday Directive (Council Directive No. 90/314/EEC), which sets out consumer rights in the package travel, package holiday and package tour sectors.  I understand that the purpose of the Commission&rsquo;s review is to update consumer rights in response to significant changes in the market since the adoption of the existing Directive in 1990.  As the key objective of the review is to ensure that adequate protections are in place for the consumer, it is expected that the Department of Enterprise Trade &amp; Employment and the National Consumer Agency will also play an active part in the consultation process for the proposed reform of this Directive.</P>
        <P>Statutory responsibility for regulation of the travel trade sector in Ireland rests with the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR).  Last year, I asked CAR to undertake a review of travel trade licensing and bonding regulations and to recommend any reforms that may be warranted. The review by CAR concluded that any reduction in the level of the bond required by travel agents would increase the likelihood of further calls on the Travel Protection Fund <Col N="934"/>(TPF), which has been called upon in recent times following a number of collapses in the industry in 2008 and to date in 2009, even at current bond levels.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s National Cycle Policy Framework, which I launched in April this year, aims to develop a National Cycle Network.  In this respect I have commissioned the National Roads Authority to map a potential National Cycle Network and I expect to have the results of their work in the New Year.  In addition, with the intention of ensuring synergies across other public organizations, I have arranged for an advisory group under the auspices of the National Trails Office to assist the NRA in their work.  Pending receipt of the Authority&rsquo;s work, I do not intend to make comment on elements that may form part of the network.  However, I can confirm that the Authority is aware of cycling-related works planned and in progress in the North West both in Westport and along the disused rail line between Newport and Mulranny.  These works underline the potential of cycling in the North West region generally.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> his policy on the regulation of public transport fares; if he has undertaken research on the impact of lower, simplified public transport fare structures on achieving the modal switch to public transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Decisions in relation to public transport fares are, for the most part, a matter for the operators of public transport services.  However, proposals for changes to the standard single fare charged by the CI&Eacute; companies and the RPA is, based on custom and practice, subject to control by me and such proposals are considered in the context of the overall impact on public transport patronage, the financial position of the operator concerned, the cost environment and, in the case of loss making services, the level of availability of Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>I have not commissioned research on the effect of a lower, simplified public transport fares structure on modal switch to public transport.  It is clear that excessive increases in fares will damage the attractiveness of public transport while a lowering of fares would require additional Exchequer funding. Nevertheless when established the proposed National Transport Authority provided for in the Public Transport Regulation Bill, 2009 will have the power to introduce a fares scheme for public transport in the Greater Dublin Area or such other areas as may be specified by the Minister and to control fares on public transport services that are the subject of public service contracts.</P>

	<P>Maintaining and developing rural passenger transport services is one of the objectives of my Department.  It is therefore vitally important that the resources available for rural transport are utilised as cost effectively as possible and that best possible service is achieved from these resources.  In that regard, earlier this year, I asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to work with Pobal to explore the potential for achieving better rural transport service delivery through closer working and better resource utilisation between the various service providers.  Arising from this, a number of pilot initiatives have been instigated to explore how the various transport services in rural areas might be jointly developed so as to enhance their coverage and take up.</P>
        <P>In addition to Bus &Eacute;ireann, the initiatives involve the Health Service Executive in its capacity for providing transport to access health services; the Department of Education and Science in respect of school transport services; Pobal in respect of Rural Transport Programme services; and voluntary bodies such as the Irish Wheelchair Association.</P>
        <P>Pilot projects are being developed in the North West and North East to explore how existing transport providers might make more effective use of their individual resources by working in closer cooperation with each other.  The types of pilots envisaged for collaborative action include &ldquo;collect and connect&rdquo; type services; hospital feeder services; co-ordination of disability services; ticketing integration; co-ordinated information provision and journey planning; increased synchronisation of partner systems and processes.  It is expected to be at least 12 months before an integration model incorporating results from the various pilots will be sufficiently developed to allow it to be applied more widely across the country.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann has established a central steering group to provide advice and guidance on strategic, regulatory and legislative issues to the working groups which oversee the two pilots.  The other members of the steering group are officials from my Department, the Department of Education and Science and Pobal.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s National Cycle Policy Framework, which I launched in April this year, aims to develop a National Cycle Network.  In this respect I have commissioned the National Roads Authority to map a potential National Cycle Network and I expect to have the results of their work in the New Year.  In addition, with the intention of ensuring synergies across other public organizations, I have arranged for an advisory group under the auspices of the National Trails Office to assist the NRA in their work.  Pending receipt of the Authority&rsquo;s work, I do not intend to make comment on elements that may form part of the route.  However, I can confirm that the Authority is aware not only of the potential of the canals as cycling and walking routes but also of cycling-related works planned and in progress on the Grand Canal.</P>

	<P>Dublin City Council has developed plans for an off-road cycle route via the Grand Canal, the new Samuel Beckett Bridge and the Royal Canal to provide a link from Portobello to Fairview Park. At the same time South Dublin County Council is developing an exemplary cycling route between Adamstown and Inchicore.  The stretch referred to in the Question lies outside of the scope of the current proposal but would be the missing element in creating a first class cycle way from Adamstown to the city. I am delighted to see the development of new cycle routes in response to the National Cycle Policy Framework which I launched this year.  Indeed, there are proposals for exemplary schemes from many other Local Authorities.   </P>
        <P>I am providing some modest funding to assist Dublin City Council investigate the feasibility of connecting the aforementioned projects.  Any detailed proposal that Dublin City Council may wish to make in relation a canal-based cycle network in Dublin 8 will be considered by my Department in the context of progress with the Portobello to Fairview Park project, proposals by other local authorities and competing demands for scarce financial resources.</P>

	<P>A representative from Aer Lingus briefed officials from my Department on a range of proposals under the Company&rsquo;s cost restructuring plan following the company&rsquo;s announcement of its plan to the Stock Exchange. My officials have briefed me on the proposals. Arising from that briefing, I am aware that Aer Lingus is seeking to secure a UK Air Operators Certificate for commercial reasons in respect of a relatively small part of its operations. The licensing and certification of air carriers is governed by EU Law and the Company will be aware of its obligations in this regard.  I understand the specific matters referred to by the Deputy are currently the subject of internal consultations between Aer Lingus management and staff and their union representatives. It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in these consultations.</P>

	<P>The Irish Aviation Authority is a commercial state-sponsored company which was established in 1994 to provide air navigation services in Irish-controlled airspace, and to regulate safety standards within the Irish civil aviation industry. The Authority receives no money from the Exchequer and funds all its services and infrastructure through charges on its airline customers and its regulatory clients.  The new Visual Control Tower (VCT) will be subject to a competitive tender process in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines on procurement.  The proposed new VCT is not a component of the NDP 2007-2013.  The VCT process will be subject to all Department of Finance guidelines on procurement and value for money.</P>
        <P>The purpose and function of the new VCT will be to facilitate safe and efficient terminal air navigation services at Dublin Airport if and when the Dublin Airport Authority proceeds with the parallel runway at Dublin Airport.  As I have already stated, it will not be constructed if the parallel runway does not proceed.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November, 2006. The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.  The Deputy will be aware of the service to T.D.s and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.  I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the PRA for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.<b></b></P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 286 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of full age or be a minor born in the State</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of good character</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 16 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, although the conditions for naturalisation (or any of them) are not complied with, where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.</P>
        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation on behalf of the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in October 2009. I decided in my absolute discretion not to waive the statutory conditions for naturalisation and the first person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was informed of this decision in letters issued on 23 October, 2009. There is no provision under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, for an appeal in relation to this decision.</P>

	<P>A scheme for the admission of non-EEA researchers was established in November 2007.  The purpose of the Scheme  is to facilitate the admission of non-EEA nationals for the purpose of carrying out research in the State and is administered by the immigration authorities in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Universities Association. <Col N="942"/> The Scheme put in place arrangements which give effect to Council Directive 2005/71/EC  of 12 October 2005 on a specific procedure for admitting  third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research.  </P>
        <P>An enhanced immigration regime operates for such researchers and they are generally treated as equivalent to holders of &ldquo;Green Card&rdquo; employment permits.  This includes the possibility of immediate family reunification for spouses, partners and dependent children.  Visa applications are facilitated to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the terms of the Scheme.  With regard to eligibility for long term residence,  researchers under the Scheme are eligible to apply for the current administrative scheme for long term residence when they have accrued 5 years residence in the State as a researcher. Furthermore, it is intended that such researchers will, subject to the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2008,  be eligible to apply for the statutory long term residence status set out in the Bill.</P>
        <P>While the standard eligibility requirement for this status will be at least five years satisfactory residence in the State, it is intended that green card work permit holders and researchers will be eligible to apply for long term residence after two years. This is by any standards a generous approach.  Long term resident status will confer rights that approach those of Irish nationals and bring with it access, for the foreign national and his or her qualifying dependants, to the Irish employment market and State-funded services and benefits.  The tangible benefits enjoyed by holders of this status are an acknowledgement by the State that, over time, those who migrate to Ireland contribute increasingly to society and the economy and have earned this status and the stability it brings.  Further details on the above Scheme can be accessed on the website of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (www.entemp.ie) and the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).</P>

	<P>It would not be appropriate for me as Minister to provide interpretation of the law on legal matters. However I can confirm, that the powers and responsibilities of a sheriff are as  provided for in section 54 of the Court Officers Act 1926, as amended by section 12 of the Court Officers Act 1945 and section 2 of the Court Officers Act 1951.  Execution of a court order by a sheriff is provided for in the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926.  Execution of Revenue warrants is provided for in section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  </P>
        <P>Section 133 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 implements a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission relating to the powers of sheriffs by abolishing, with effect from 1 December 2009, the power of the sheriff to seize leasehold property used for residential purposes.  Apart from the immediate benefit to residents of such property, abolition of this power will simplify the conveyancing of residential property by removing the need to make searches in Sheriffs&rsquo; Offices.  Copies of Law Reform Commission Reports are available <Col N="943"/>in the Oireachtas library.  The Reports can also be accessed on the Commission&rsquo;s website at www.lawreform.ie.</P>

Any persons found engaging in such behaviour will continue to be dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.</P>

	<P>In the absence of more specific information,  I can only set out the position generally.  The statutory requirements for naturalisation are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  This provides that applicants for naturalisation, other than spouses of Irish citizens, must have been resident in the State for five years of the nine year period prior to the date of application.  Resident in this context means residence for which the applicant had the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and where such permission was not granted for the purposes of study or seeking asylum.  </P>
        <P>A foreign national married to an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage concerned must be recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question number 143 of 5 November 2009.  As I have advised the Deputy, my colleague Minister of State John Curran, at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as a particular area of concern, and in conjunction with relevant Departments and Agencies, is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of such shops. </P>
        <P>My officials are in contact with their counterparts in the Office of the Minister for Drugs in this regard and I have also spoken directly with Minister Curran on this matter.  I understand also that a briefing, with particular reference to &lsquo;headshops&rsquo; has been provided to the Minister by personnel from the Garda National Drugs Unit.  In terms of the further specific controlling of substances on sale in headshops, as the Deputy will appreciate, that is a matter which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977/1984.</P>

I am advised by the Garda Authorities that a sketch scheme has been agreed for the refurbishment of the building referred to by the Deputy. The refurbishment works will include the reorganisation of the public office and reception area, the upgrading of the cells to current standards and the construction of an external ramp.

	<P>The Community-based CCTV Scheme was launched in 2005 to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards the capital costs of establishing a community CCTV system.  Pobal administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.  I am advised by Pobal that in 2007 an application for funding was received from an organisation in the town referred to by the Deputy.  Following a thorough assessment of the application, it was deemed not to have met a number of the qualifying criteria and was therefore not approved funding.  I am further advised that Pobal provided feedback to the unsuccessful applicant in August 2007.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides inter alia for the acquisition of Irish nationality and citizenship.  Section 6A of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004, provides that a person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has,<b></b>during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person&rsquo;s birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.  The section does not apply to certain persons including those born to parents one of whom is at the time of the persons birth an Irish citizen, a British citizen or a person entitled to reside without restriction.  For the purpose of calculating reckonable residence under section 6A certain residence is excluded from consideration including unlawful residence, residence for the purpose of study and residence covered by a provisional permission granted pending determination of an asylum application.</P>
        <P>In determining if a child, who has applied for a passport to the Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs on the basis that they have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, is entitled to a passport, the Passport Office makes an assessment of the parent&rsquo;s reckonable residence through an examination of their immigration permission stamps. If the parents do not have sufficient residence and the child does not have an entitlement to citizenship, then it will be open to the parent of the child to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation on the child&rsquo;s behalf under section 15 of the 1956 Act, when the child has 5 years reckonable residency in the State.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 25 September 2006.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30 April 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>On 20 June 2008 the person concerned made an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of his parentage of Irish citizen children, born  in the State before 1 January 2005, in accordance with the provisions of the IBC/05 Scheme. The closing date for the receipt of applications under this Scheme was 31 March 2005. As the application of the person concerned was received long after this closing date, it was received much too late for consideration and the person concerned was informed of this by letter dated 18 March 2009.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned now falls to be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

Based on this recommendation, the person concerned was advised of my decision to issue her with a formal declaration of refugee status by letter dated 27/10/2005.  This communication also advised the person concerned of the rights and entitlements accompanying refugee status in the State. The person concerned continues to hold the status of refugee in the State.  As you are aware, a proposal to revoke refugee status has been issued.  As this case is currently under examination, it would be inappropriate for me to comment pending the outcome of that examination.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 132 of Thursday, 18 June, 2009, and the written Reply to that Question.  As stated in my last Reply, the person concerned has submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State which is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must -</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of good character</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 16 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, although the conditions for naturalisation (or any of them) are not complied with, where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.</P>
        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation on behalf of the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in October 2009. I decided in my absolute discretion not to waive the statutory conditions for naturalisation and the first person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was informed of this decision in letters issued on 30 October, 2009. There is no provision under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, for an appeal in relation to this decision.</P>

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them.

	<P>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) informs me that the person in question was refused Refugee Status in 2005 and is therefore not entitled to be issued with an Irish Travel Document. The person concerned was granted temporary permission on 11 March 2008 to remain in the State for three years until 11 March 2011.  In exceptional cases an application for an Irish temporary travel document may be considered.  In all such cases INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue. </P>
        <P>An application for an Irish temporary travel document will only be considered by the Immigration Services Section in INIS on receipt of a fully completed application form.  Supporting documentation accompanying any such application should include original correspondence from the relevant consular authority outlining the steps necessary to be followed by the person to facilitate the procurement of a national passport if their presence is required outside the State. I am informed by the Immigration Services Section of INIS that the person concerned was previously facilitated with a temporary travel document in May 2008 primarily to allow the holder of same to procure their national passport.  It remains open to the person in question to return this temporary travel document and submit a new application accompanied with the relevant supporting documentation to the Travel Document Unit of INIS which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2<b>.</b></P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 provide for three categories of offences of assault respectively.  Section 2 provides for an offence of assault. Section 3 provides for an offence of assault causing harm and Section 4 for an offence of assault causing serious harm.  Offences under sections 3 and 4 of the Act come within the definition of &ldquo;arrestable offences&rdquo; as set out in Section 2(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1997 (as amended by Section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006), meaning an offence where an arrest of a person may be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty and includes an attempt to commit any such offence. </P>
        <P>In addition to the provisions of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended) provides in Section 6(1) that it is an offence for any person in a public place to use or engage in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  Section 18 provides for an offence of assault with <Col N="959"/>intent to cause bodily harm and Section 19 (as amended by section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006) provides <i>inter alia</i> for an offence of assaulting a peace officer acting in the execution of his or her duty.</P>
        <P>In respect of any of the offences set out in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, Section 24(1) provides that where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na finds any person committing an offence under a relevant provision, the member may arrest such a person without a warrant.  I have not been advised of any particular problems in this area and have no immediate plans to introduce a power of arrest in respect of an offence under section 2 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  I will, however, keep the matter under review.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Question 114 of 10th November, a complex range of training, technological, financial and legal issues must be addressed before the changeover referred to by the Deputy could  take place. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are at an advanced stage in developing proposals for the operational aspects of a new system.  Because of the complexities involved, it is likely that any new system would initially be introduced on a pilot basis to allow all the operational and legal aspects to be fully tested and evaluated.  This is a matter which is being pursued by the Garda authorities and, given the extensive operational and other issues involved, it is not possible to indicate when the relevant work will be completed. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314 and 315 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland and our EU partners continue to pay close attention to the situation of Iraqi refugees, of whom there are estimated to be in excess of 2 million. We are particularly concerned by the large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons, and by the burden being borne by neighbouring states, especially Jordan and Syria. Ultimately, assistance efforts on the part of the international community need to be focused on ensuring that Iraq can once again be considered a secure and peaceful home for the majority of these citizens.</P>
        <P>The particular humanitarian problems with regard to Palestinian refugees on the Syria/Iraq border are long-standing and go back to the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, with whom this group are seen to have been identified. Before the March 2003 invasion, UNHCR estimated there were 34,000 Palestinians in Iraq. This group was particularly vulnerable during the ethnic violence which followed the collapse of the regime as the mostly Sunni Palestinian refugees were targeted by Shi&rsquo;a militias for their ethnicity and for allegedly receiving preferential treatment under Hussein&rsquo;s regime. Palestinian refugees in Iraq were increasingly targets of violence, kidnapping, and death threats. Some tens of thousands fled to neighbouring Syria and Jordan, until those options became closed to them and they were essentially trapped in the no man&rsquo;s land between borders.</P>
        <P>There are currently estimated to be more than 2,700 Palestinians living in three unofficial desert camps on the Iraq-Syria border in difficult and harsh conditions, and for whom resettlement within Iraq does not represent a viable option. The refugees have been receiving assistance through UNHCR. Ireland has also contributed to providing assistance to this group. In 2006, the Minister for Justice, on behalf of the Government, decided that Ireland would offer assistance to international efforts to reduce the numbers in one such refugee camp, the Al-Rweished camp, on the Iraq/Jordan border. The bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s refugee repatriation funding was directed at this area that year and approximately 180 refugees were permanently settled in Ireland, which, together with resettlements to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden, facilitated the closure of the camp by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>In the largest ever resettlement of Palestinian refugees in the US, approximately 1,350 Palestinian refugees from the camps on the Iraq/Syria border are currently being considered for resettlement in the US. In addition, a further 98 Palestinians from the makeshift camps <Col N="962"/>near the Syrian border are being housed in a &ldquo;transit camp&rdquo; in Slovakia for up to six months while their final resettlement to other countries is arranged by UNHCR. Further comprehensive action on third country repatriation will be required to address the situation in the remaining camps.</P>
        <P>While Ireland is not currently involved in this resettlement programme, we continue to provide support to Iraqi refugees, as well as to those displaced within Iraq and their host communities. This funding is channelled through UNHCR, and has totalled &euro;3.2 million since 2007. In addition, a member of Irish Aid&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps was deployed as a reintegration officer with UNHCR in Syria in 2008.</P>

	<P>Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the US continues to be a high priority of this Government. We are also committed to developing our bilateral migration arrangements with the United States, through the establishment of a reciprocal two year renewable E3 visa scheme.  In discussions with US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, during her visit to Ireland in October, I stressed that the Government was continuing to pursue a three pronged strategy to address migratory flows between Ireland and the US. This strategy involves seeking a solution for the undocumented Irish, the establishment of an E3 visa and the continued expansion of the working holiday programme, which was concluded last year. In response to these issues, Secretary of State Clinton indicated that immigration reform may be addressed in early 2010, following the passage of health care legislation.</P>
        <P>On my visit to Washington and New York on 14-17 October, I held extensive discussions on the prospect for progress on immigration reform with significant number of key Democrat sand Republicans in Congress. These included the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator John McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Chris Dodd, Senator Bob Casey, Senator Paul Kirk, the Chair of the House Sub Committee on Immigration, Zoe Lofgren and the members of the House of Representatives Friends of Ireland Group.  There was considerable support expressed at these meetings for efforts to find a solution for the undocumented and for the E3 visa initiative. I received some indications that a comprehensive immigration bill which would address the concerns of the undocumented could be introduced in Congress in Spring 2010 but I was also told that such a timetable could be influenced by ongoing debate on health care reform and the fact that 2010 will be an election year in the US.</P>
        <P>In New York, I also had a very useful meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, who are continuing to lobby for the undocumented Irish, with the assistance of former Congressman Bruce Morrison. During my visit, I was pleased to announce a further grant of $50,000 to ILIR. This brings to $285,000, the total amount of funding allocated by the Government to ILIR since 2006.</P>

	<P>The Passport Office may only issue passports to Irish citizens. Accordingly, each application is considered with reference to Irish citizenship law and more recently with the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008.  The person in question was born in the State on 8 February, 2007. Her entitlement to citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004 (&ldquo;the 2004 Act&rdquo;). Section 6A of the 2004 Act provides that persons born in the State on or after 1 January, 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or a British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where the parent has been lawfully resident in the State for 3 of the 4 years preceding their birth.</P>
        <P>At the time of the birth of the person concerned, her mother was a Dutch national. Section 6B(2) of the 2004 Act makes particular provision for parents from EU Member States whereby such nationals may make a declaration in a prescribed form concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the 4 years preceding the child&rsquo;s birth. This declaration is supported by the submission of the parent&rsquo;s EU passport and by documentary evidence of that parent&rsquo;s residence in Ireland. That non-Irish citizen parent will then be regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of s6A, unless the contrary is proved.</P>
        <P>The Passport Office in Balbriggan has received two applications for this person. The first of these was made in March, 2007 while the second was received in April of this year. In both applications, the submitted evidence of residence in Ireland in respect of the parent who is the EU national has been insufficient to demonstrate the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, the Passport Office is not in a position to issue a passport to her.  It should be noted that there has been considerable correspondence between the Head of the Passport Office in Balbriggan and the applicant&rsquo;s mother and the family solicitors. This correspondence has outlined the position above to them. The Head of the Passport Office in Balbriggan remains available to explain any detail that is still unclear to the applicant&rsquo;s mother. His contact details are 01.673.3215 or kevin.walzer@dfa.ie.</P>

	<P>In 2008, Ireland spent &euro;920 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA). This represented approximately 0.59 % of our Gross National Product (GNP).  For 2009 the total budget for ODA is expected to reach &euro;696 million. Based on current projections this will represent at least 0.48% of GNP. This means that Ireland will remain one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.  The Government is currently examining expenditure estimates in preparation for next month&rsquo;s 2010 Budget statement. Our aim is to protect the aid programme to the maximum extent possible within the context of the current difficult fiscal environment.  Finally, I would point out that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the best in the world. Our peers in the OECD have described it as &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo;. I can assure the Deputy that this quality will be maintained while we continue to ensure maximum value for taxpayers&rsquo; money in our aid programme.</P>

	<P>On Friday, 2 October the Irish people gave a ringing endorsement to the proposal to amend the Constitution of Ireland in order to allow Ireland to ratify the Lisbon Treaty. The referendum was supported by 67.13% of those who voted in a turnout of 59% of voters. The full result of the referendum was published in Issue no. 80 of <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> on Tuesday 6 October.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved the terms of the Treaty under Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution on Wednesday 7 October by way of the following D&aacute;il motion:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, signed at Lisbon, 13th December 2007, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Tuesday, 6th October 2009&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">President McAleese signed the 28th Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009 into law on Thursday 15 October. On the following day, she signed the instrument of Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the treaty of Lisbon.  Ireland&rsquo;s ratification process was completed when, on Friday 23 October, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty, Minister of State Dick Roche T.D. deposited the Instrument of Ratification with the Government of Italy, which acts as Depository State for this Treaty.</P>
        <P>All 27 Member States have now completed their ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by depositing their Instruments of Ratification with the Government of Italy. The Treaty will enter into force on 1 December 2009.  In order to give effect to the relevant provisions of the Lisbon Treaty in the domestic law of the State, the European Union Bill 2009 was enacted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and signed into law by the President on Tuesday 27 October. The European Union Act 2009 will be subject to a Commencement Order on 1 December, the same day on which the Treaty enters into force.</P>

	<P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 324, 328 and 340 together.  </P>
        <P>I am very aware of the growth in the number of headshops and I have voiced concerns in regard to their activities on numerous occasions.  My concerns in relation to their selling of substances that are represented as being &ldquo;legal highs&rdquo; or &ldquo;herbal highs&rdquo; centre on the potential health hazard arising and the fear that use of these products may act as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs.  The Department of Health &amp; Children has the main statutory responsibility in this area.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, the importation, exportation, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are regulated and controlled.  The products on sale in headshops are currently not scheduled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation, but this situation is being kept under review by the Department of Health and Children.  Meanwhile, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service are working to ensure that no illegal substances are sold in these premises.</P>
        <P>I have raised my concerns about the proliferation, and the activities, of headshops in many fora since my appointment as Minister.  The matter was discussed with the various parties involved at the first meeting of the Oversight Forum on Drugs, set up under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, in October.  Also under the Strategy, I have had meetings in recent weeks with the Minister for Health &amp; Children and the Minister Justice Equality &amp; Law Reform and headshops were among the issues considered.  I also discussed headshops at meetings last week with the Garda Commissioner and senior officials of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The headshop issue is causing concern across Europe and no EU Member States has come up with a comprehensive response so far.  A number of possibilities for addressing the activities of headshops have been discussed at my various meetings and these are being followed up by the relevant authorities.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to outlaw the practice of clothing collections by persons claiming to represent various charities who in many cases do not and which cause nuisance to the public also by way of leaflet dropping in the middle of the night; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two issues of public concern raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, and I fully share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns. Firstly, there is the practice of non-charities representing themselves as charities when collecting from the public. Secondly, there is the public nuisance and annoyance that can be caused by undertaking such collections at anti-social hours.</P>
        <P>Of particular concern and relevance to me, given my statutory responsibility for the regulation of charities, is where certain collectors of clothing and bric-a-brac from households convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are a charitable in nature, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship.  I consider that this is unfair both to donors, whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to <i>bona fide</i> charities that are reportedly losing out on donations as a consequence.</P>
<Col N="970"/>
        <P>The Charities Act 2009 will, when commenced, help to address this issue.  The centrepiece of the new statutory regulatory regime for charities will be a Charities Regulatory Authority with extensive regulatory powers and a Register of Charities upon which any charity operating in Ireland must be entered. It will be an offence for any organisation that is not on the Register of Charities to describe itself or its activities in such a way as to cause the public to reasonably believe that the organisation is a registered charity.  This will limit the scope for non-charities to suggest to the public that they are charitable in nature.  This will in turn help the public to distinguish between genuine charitable and non-charitable collections, and to make more informed decisions about which collections they choose to support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second aspect of public concern is the nuisance caused to the public by certain collectors delivering leaflets or undertaking collections at irregular hours. I have no statutory function in relation to such collections. I am advised, however, that local authorities may have powers under the Waste Management Act 1996 to enable them to control such collections. In that context, it may be helpful to refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No 7666 of 27 February 2007 on this issue given by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government previously.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of the 14 Local and 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces is, inter alia, to facilitate greater local/regional focus on drugs issues and a more co-ordinated response to them. A key element in this is education, prevention and awareness raising.  There are a significant number of projects being funded through the Drugs Task Forces with an education and prevention focus. These projects, while varying in type, aim to create greater societal awareness about the dangers and prevalence of drugs and to equip young people with the skills and supports to make informed choices about their health, personal lives and social development. The Department of Education &amp; Science is represented on the Drug Task Forces and it is also open to Drug Task Forces to liaise with schools in their area through the various projects they fund.</P>
        <P>In addition, many of the projects funded through the Drugs Task Forces focus specifically on drug awareness, ranging from local drug awareness groups to other initiatives such as &ldquo;Awareness Weeks&rdquo;.  Such measures have proven to be effective as many of them focus on the issues particular to their own localities.  With particular regard to cocaine usage, heightening awareness of the risks associated with the combined use of alcohol and cocaine was a fundamental element of the national cocaine awareness campaign undertaken by the HSE in 2008.  Allied to this, Drugs Task Forces, with funding provided by my Department, undertook local campaigns at that time to dovetail with the national campaign.</P>
        <P>The recently launched National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 places particular emphasis on prevention.  Various prevention and education interventions are planned, focusing on young people, both in the school and the non-school setting, as well as on the overall population.  A sustained range of awareness campaigns is envisaged as part of this approach.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 341 and 342 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has worked, and will continue to work, with Departments and other public bodies to assist them in meeting their translation obligations under the Official Languages Act in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible.  In addition, I wish to again reiterate that the obligation under section 10 of the Act to publish documents simultaneously in Irish and English applies only to a limited number of key documents published by public bodies, including annual reports and accounts and documents setting out public policy proposals.</P>
        <P>I have long advocated that documents such as these should be published by way of CDs or the internet, rather than hard copy.  I am aware that a number of public bodies already follow this practice.  Indeed, the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga specifically advocates this approach to public bodies in the guidebook on the Act that his Office published and circulated to all bodies in 2008 and the Government adopted a similar policy last year as one of a number of measures designed to reduce costs across public bodies.</P>
        <P>At the request of my Department, Foras na Gaeilge began development of an accreditation system for Irish language translators in 2006 and the system continues to be rolled out on an ongoing basis. To date training courses have been provided to over 1,000 translators and, following successful completion of the designated examination, there are currently 147 translators on the accredited panel of translators.  In order to support that important work, Foras has commenced the process for putting a similar system in place for Irish language editors.</P>
        <P>Again at the behest of my Department, in 2007 Foras na Gaeilge began the process of developing, on a phased basis, a translation memory resource for the Irish language.   The translation memory project collects the highest quality official English-Irish translations and formats them for use in both automated and manual translation, providing significant savings to all users as regards time and cost, and significant increases in consistency and standard of translation.  The first collection of formatted texts has been made available to accredited translators and I understand that training will be provided shortly in the most efficient use of this resource on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>In regard to information technology software, I should also mention <b>Focal.ie,</b> a national terminology database for the Irish language which has been developed by Fiontar, Dublin City University, with the assistance of funding from Foras na Gaeilge and from my Department&rsquo;s Ciste na Gaeilge.</P>

        <P>This funding will complement the supports provided by the County Enterprise Boards and will focus, in particular, on the development of indigenous rural resources in artisan food, forestry, marine, rural / agri-tourism, cultural heritage and community promoted enterprises; the development of recreational tourism and other complementary tourism supports and environmentally friendly initiatives.  Axis 3 and Axis 4 (LEADER) of the RDP commenced in February 2009 and there is currently project activity totalling &euro;5.2 million registered under the Business Creation and Development measure.  Over &euro;2.5 million of this is in approved projects with &euro;422,706 in registered expenditure to date.</P>
<Col N="974"/>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s LDSIP provides for integrated approaches to identify and support individuals, groups and communities in accessing suitable and sustainable employment and self-employment options.  Types of activity supported include: proactive outreach and targeted supports such as complementary education and training, support with work placement, support into self-employment or enterprise, and community enterprise activities.  Enterprise support is a feature of the LDSIP and is differentiated from mainstream enterprise initiatives by its focus on disadvantage and on supporting the individual into self-employment or enterprise through training and education, mentoring, networking and after-care as well as small grants towards start-up.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the work of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission (WDC), which are agencies under the aegis of my Department.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is working to reverse the downward employment trend in the Gaeltacht and effect the transition from a declining manufacturing sector to employment in services, including Irish-language centred employment.  To assist in the current economic climate, an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s is administering in the Gaeltacht the new Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund which have been established to address the needs of vulnerable small to medium enterprises.</P>
        <P>The WDC Investment Fund supports businesses, community initiatives and &lsquo;flagship&rsquo; projects in the Western Region.  It invests directly in sustainable projects, many of which may be experiencing a funding gap.  My Department also operates, in conjunction with the relevant County Enterprise Boards, an Enterprise Scheme for the non-Gaeltacht Islands, the aim of which is to encourage the development of both new and existing micro-enterprises on islands outside the Gaeltacht.  The introduction of this scheme, which complements the enterprise supports provided by &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta on Gaeltacht islands, recognises the higher costs and locational disadvantage involved in running an island-based business.</P>
        <P>I have also allocated some &euro;47m to projects approved under the Community Services Programme.  This Programme supports local community activity to address disadvantage, while delivering good quality services and providing employment activities for people from specific target groups, including people with disabilities, travellers, recovering drug users, long-term unemployed and lone parents.  A broad range of services are eligible for support and include the management of community, leisure and sports facilities, heritage centres, child care, community media, elder care and transport.  Support is provided under the Programme by way of a contribution towards the cost of a manager, where appropriate, and full-time equivalent workers.  A small non-wage material and overhead grant is also provided.  To date, 454 projects have been approved for funding under the Programme, supporting an estimated 2,700 positions.</P>

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that good progress has been made in developing walking trails as part of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy. In the case of my own Department, we have successfully introduced the Walks Scheme, in consultation with Comhairle Na Tuaithe, for the development, enhancement and maintenance of Waymarked Ways and other priority walks. <Col N="975"/>Currently there are 18 walks in the Scheme with 1,091 participant landholders.  Thanks to the efforts of Comhairle Na Tuaithe in implementing the National Countryside Recreation Strategy and those of other key stakeholders in this area, the number of walks available is constantly increasing.  Details are available on the Discover Ireland and CoillteOutdoors websites.  Figures provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in relation to walking tourism are very encouraging, with over 500,000 walkers visiting Ireland in 2008.  These figures also indicate that the numbers of walkers visiting the country are increasing year-on-year, despite the difficulties in some areas of tourism.</P>
        <P>The input of the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) in this area has been very beneficial. Specifically, one of the measures carried out by the RSS participants is the maintenance and enhancement of way-marked ways, agreed walks and bog roads.  Whilst the landholders who participate in the Walks Scheme are responsible for the routine maintenance work, it is the RSS participants that undertake the more onerous maintenance work, such as the installation of stiles and bridges.</P>
        <P>The Walks Scheme in County Cork is implemented by West Cork Development Partnership.  Currently 468 participant landholders on the Walks Scheme provide maintenance on 177 km of trail on the Beara Way and the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way. The Sheep&rsquo;s Head was awarded the European Destination of Excellence award in 2009.  The competition was designed for destinations that have developed the tourism potential of their protected areas in a sustainable manner.  The local Rural Recreation Officer reports strong commitment and co-operation from the participant landholders who have developed, maintained and enhanced these trails to a very high standard.  Increased resources available for maintenance from the Walks Scheme and the involvement of the Rural Recreation Officer have underpinned this progress.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am not in a position to say at this stage what financial resources will be available for the Co Kildare region or for groups, bodies and agencies involved in the fight against drugs.  The financial resources available will not be known pending the December budget.  I am, of course, acutely aware of the challenges reduced budget allocations pose.  I know that other Departments and Agencies are also very aware of this in the context of their engagement in the Drugs Strategy and the available funding to them for mainstreamed drugs projects and services.  However, we have to take account of the current economic reality and of the pressure on the public finances.  This, inevitably, means that some schemes will be affected but properly managed, this may also lead to improved efficiencies in services and foster better interagency working to the benefit of all.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Drugs Strategy is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and Agencies and my Department&rsquo;s allocation is part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.  In 2008, it was estimated that total expenditure on drugs programmes was over &euro;275m and initial indications are that this level will be broadly maintained in 2009.    *With effect from 1st January 2009 the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund transferred to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</P>

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated RAPID areas nationally.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal&rsquo;s website under the RAPID section &mdash; http://www.pobal.ie/Funding%20Programmes/Rapid/ Pages/Funding.aspx  &mdash; and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information.</P>

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated RAPID areas nationally.  Following an independent evaluation of the RAPID programme commissioned in 2006, it was recommended that, in order to further develop and enhance the programme through the lifetime of the 2007-2013 NDP, it should be focussed on seven Strategic Themes: Community Safety and Anti-Social Behaviour, Family Support, Youth Support, Physical Environment, Education, Health and Employment/Training.  This recommendation has been pursued and the strategic themes have been established across RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>Separately, in order to ensure the continued relevance of the Programme and the designated RAPID areas, I commissioned, through POBAL, a study to develop/update small area deprivation indices based on an analysis of the most recent census data.  I initiated this review last year because from my experience of visiting communities around the country, I felt that some areas that were not in the Programme might be eligible now.  Based on the study, I proposed the designation of five provincial towns as new RAPID areas; this was accepted by Cabinet in May 2009.  The study also indicated that minor adjustments to the boundaries of a number of existing RAPID areas would be justified and this process is still ongoing.  I hope to have the whole process completed early in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Government decision of May 2009 was to include Ballina, Co. Mayo, Dungarvan, Co. Waterford, Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath and Rathkeale, Co. Limerick in the RAPID Programme.  The Revised Programme of Government of October 2009 expresses <Col N="979"/>the Governments commitment to &lsquo;Continue to develop the RAPID Programme that is giving local communities in the most disadvantaged urban areas a real voice for change for the better in their own communities.&rsquo;</P>

        <P>As I have said previously in response to the Deputy, most recently in response to his Question No. 35 of 10 June last, I have no statutory responsibility for rural housing or for the operation of local authorities.  Planning permission is primarily a matter for local authorities under the relevant legislation and guidelines issued by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) addresses many of my concerns on issues such as rural housing. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. In this way it seeks to ensure key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the local circumstances of different areas.</P>
        <P>I and officials in my Department continue to liaise regularly with Ministers and with officials in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and with various Local Authorities and other bodies and organisations on issues concerning rural development.</P>

The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal&rsquo;s website under the RAPID section &mdash; http://www.pobal.ie/Funding%20Programmes/Rapid/ Pages/Funding.aspx &mdash; and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information.  The 2010 budget for RAPID will be addressed in the context of the estimates process, which is currently underway. </P>

	<P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a range of employment and education supports available to people in receipt of social welfare payments.  These initiatives are designed to assist people to return to the active labour force.  The main supports available are the back to work allowance, the short-term enterprise allowance and the back to education allowance schemes.  At week ended 30th October 2009, the total number of participants in the back to work allowance scheme was 6,617.   This includes two strands; the back to work enterprise allowance with 4,405 and the back to work allowance (employee) with  2,212.   The employee strand has been closed to new applications since 1st May 2009 but existing participants continue to receive payment.  </P>
        <P>A separate short-term enterprise allowance was introduced on 1st May 2009 for people who qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, subject to certain conditions.  The total number availing of this scheme at the end of October 2009 was 818.  Figures for the back to education allowance are collated on the basis of the academic year.  There were 11,646 people in receipt of allowance for the 2008/2009 academic year.   The figures for the 2009/2010 academic year will be significantly higher with over 18,700 applications approved by the end of October 2009.  The community employment scheme is administered by F&Aacute;S which is under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Figures provided by F&Aacute;S show that there were 21,481 participants in community employment schemes at the end of October 2009.  This figure excludes 1,417 supervisor posts.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. It is intended as a short-term income support to eligible tenants whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs.  </P>
        <P>In order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the Live Register and the current employment situation, it was decided in the context of the supplementary budget to refocus resources on the enterprise strand of the back to work allowance which supports people into self employment.  A new scheme called the sort term enterprise allowance was introduced on 1st May 2009.  Claimants who qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit can gain immediate access the scheme, provided they have 104 contributions paid or have established entitlement to statutory redundancy from their latest period of employment.  It is payable at the same rate and for the same duration as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  The Department is actively considering the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements for those who participate in the scheme.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE). The Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.  Mortgage interest is defined in Section 187 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  In accordance with this provision, a mortgage interest supplement may be paid on the full amount of interest payable, where the loan has been taken out for the purchase, repair or essential improvement of the sole or main residence of a person or to pay off another loan used for that purpose.  Where a loan, or a portion of the loan, has been used for expenditure not associated with the purchase or repair of the sole or main residence of the person, a proportion or all of the interest on the loan is not reckonable for the purpose of mortgage interest supplement scheme.</P>
        <P>Under Article 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Allowance ) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 412 of 2007), a supplement towards mortgage interest may be payable where the Executive is satisfied that the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as it considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs and where the Executive considers it is reasonable to award a supplement having regard to the amount of any arrears outstanding on the loan.</P>
        <P>The Executive advised that mortgage interest supplement has been refused to the people concerned as the qualifying conditions, as outlined above, are not satisfied.  Notification of this decision issued on 7 October 2009.  Question No. 864, which I answered for the Deputy on 3 November 2009, was accepted as an appeal against the decision to refuse mortgage interest supplement to the person concerned and notification of the appeal was forwarded to a designated Appeals Officer of the HSE. The HSE Appeals Office has advised that no decision has been made on the appeal to date.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) advised that rent supplement was refused on the basis that the person concerned has vacated accommodation provided by a local authority, without good cause. Social Welfare legislation provides that it is a condition of entitlement to rent supplement that a person has not vacated accommodation provided by a housing authority or if s/he has vacated such accommodation the Executive is satisfied that s/he had good cause for so doing.  This decision was appealed to a HSE Appeals Officer and the decision to refuse rent supplement was upheld.  The person concerned appealed the decision to refuse rent supplement to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised that it has upheld the decision of the HSE to refuse rent supplement and the person concerned was advised of that decision on 9 October 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, who are also providing someone with full-time care and attention, can retain their main welfare payment and receive a half- rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Similarly, people currently in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance, who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment, can transfer to that other payment and continue to receive up to a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>At the end of October 2009, there were 18,903 people in receipt of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment from the Department. The estimated cost of the half- rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in 2009 is &euro;90 million.  The estimated total cost for carer&rsquo;s allowance (including half-rate) is approximately &euro;480 million in 2009.  It is expected that the combined expenditure on carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance will be &euro;650 million in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers to people needing ongoing care and support.  Considerable improvements have been made in recent years in services and supports for carers. The payment rates for the carer&rsquo;s allowance were increased further in the 2009 Budget by &euro;7 to &euro;239 per week for those aged 66 or over and by &euro;6.50 to &euro;220.50 per week for those aged under 66. Recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance are also eligible for household benefits, free travel and the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.  A couple with an income in the region of &euro;60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as free travel and household benefits.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant was also increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient from June 2008.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes made a range of recommendations relating to the Department of Social and Family Affairs including recommendations relating to the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.   The Department will consider the Report&rsquo;s recommendations as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010.  Decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for Government.  No decisions have been made in relation to the implementation of any of the McCarthy proposals relevant to this department.  Full consideration will of course be given to the impact of all the proposals on the recipients involved. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on budgetary proposals at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  A mortgage interest supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only, to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  Mortgage interest is defined in Section 187 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  In accordance with this provision, a mortgage interest supplement may be paid on the full amount of interest payable, where the loan has been taken out for the purchase, repair or essential improvement of the sole or main residence of a person or to pay off another loan used for that purpose.</P>
        <P>In addition, under Article 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Allowance) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 412 of 2007), a supplement towards mortgage interest may be payable where the Executive is satisfied that the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as it considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs and where the Executive considers it is reasonable to award a supplement having regard to the amount of any arrears outstanding on the loan.</P>
        <P>When considering if the amount of mortgage interest is reasonable to meet residential need, regard would normally be had to the household composition of the claimant and to the appropriate maximum rent limits in operation in that geographical area. In exceptional circumstances, the Health Service Executive may award a supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable by a person exceeds such amount as the Health Service Executive considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs.  Such an exceptional supplement is payable for a maximum of 12 months from the date of the claim.  A review of the administration of the mortgage interest scheme is progressing.  The main purpose of the review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence. The full review should be completed in early 2010.</P>

        <P>Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area, including recreational facilities, public transport facilities and water facilities, including water and waste water treatment facilities, drains and water mains and any matters ancillary to these.  Section 49 of the Act provides for the drawing up of a supplementary development contribution scheme in order to facilitate a particular public infrastructure service or project which is provided by a local authority.  The adoption of development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority and it is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and types of development to which they will apply.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 384 to 386, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Information on tyre flows and the management of waste tyres has long been regarded as inadequate.  To tackle this deficit and put in place a proper regulatory framework, I made the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2007.  These Regulations facilitate the comparison of quantities of waste tyres arising with the amounts placed on the market and tracking the movement of waste tyres from their discarding until they are either reused or processed for recycling.  The regulations impose obligations on persons who supply tyres to the Irish market, whether as producers (e.g. manufacturers, importers including wholesalers, traders and retailers who source tyres outside the State), or suppliers (e.g. wholesalers, traders and retailers who source tyres exclusively within the State) and on the collectors of waste tyres.  Economic operators have the option of either self complying or participating in an approved industry compliance scheme which takes on the administrative burden associated with self compliance.</P>
        <P>Self complying economic operators are required to register with local authorities and submit information on tyre and waste tyre flows in each quarterly period to the relevant local authorities.  Participants in an approved collective compliance scheme must also submit information on tyre and waste tyre flows in each quarterly period to the scheme concerned.</P>
        <P>I approved Tyre Recovery Activity Compliance Scheme Ltd. (TRACS) to operate as an approved body under the Regulations.  An application for a second approved body is under consideration in my Department.  Self compliance does not undermine TRACS.  Similarly, any decision to approve or reject an application for a second scheme will not inhibit TRACS in carrying out its functions.  Indeed the existence of two approved bodies will introduce competition into the market with consequent efficiencies in delivery.  This has been demonstrated by the existence of two separate approved bodies successfully delivering implementation of the EU Directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Waste Batteries.</P>
        <P>Approvals are generally for five years and require an interim review to be conducted.  It is envisaged that the operations of TRACS will be reviewed in 2011.  The results of this review will determine whether TRACS has been operating satisfactorily.  It will also assist in determining whether a system that tracks products from the time they are placed on the market until they reach end of life is effective in keeping waste tyres out of the reach of unauthorised operators or whether it would be more effective to require producers to take direct responsibility for the environmentally sound management of waste tyres.</P>

        <Quest> if there is an exemption from the Government charge for non-principal residences for a person who is in the process of selling their home and has had to move out of this home due to a change in personal circumstances and live in rented accommodation until the house is sold. </Quest>

	<P>The Government has decided to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on all non-principal private residences.  The charge is payable by the owners of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and any other residential property that is not the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence.</P>
        <P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which sets out the detail of the charge, has a starting position of a universal liability in respect of the charge.  It then goes on to exempt certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.  Where a person does not occupy the property concerned as a sole or main residence and is living instead in rented accommodation, he or she would be liable for the charge unless otherwise exempt.  Section 4(2) of the Act provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a person is moving home and acquires a second property within the 12 months prior to the liability date in each year, as long as within six months following the liability date, the second property becomes the person&rsquo;s sole or main residence and he or she ceases to be the owner of the first property.</P>

	<P>The planning code does not differentiate between &lsquo;head shops&rsquo; and any other kind of shop.  The definition of &ldquo;shop&rdquo; in planning legislation refers to a structure for the retail sale of goods, but the nature of those goods is not defined.  It is not a function of the planning system to decide or define the operation of a commercial enterprise and consequently to prohibit certain types of retail outlets.</P>

        <P>The NSS Hub Cluster Sewerage Scheme, which will provide improved wastewater infrastructure to nine villages including Castlemaine, is included in the Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007 &mdash; 2009 at an estimated cost of &euro;18 million.  Kerry County Council&rsquo;s Preliminary Report for the Castlemaine Scheme is under examination in my Department.  The Kerry Villages Sewerage Scheme Phase 1 is also included in the Programme at an estimated cost of &euro;8.7 million and will provide improved wastewater infrastructure to fourteen villages including Brandon.  My Department awaits the submission by Kerry County Council of the Preliminary Report for the Brandon scheme.  Kerry County Council is undertaking a strategic study with a view to optimising the delivery of wastewater infrastructure in up to 90 towns and villages in the county, including Castlegregory.  My Department will consider the Council&rsquo;s Preliminary Report for the Castlegregory Sewerage Scheme in the light of the study recommendations.</P>
        <P>Local authorities were asked in July to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October last.  My Department has commenced consideration of these assessments, which will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environ<Col N="994"/>mental and economic criteria.  It is anticipated that the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 will be published in early 2010.</P>

	<P>Where an applicant for affordable housing is unable to obtain adequate mortgage finance from one of a number of private lending institutions which provide mortgage finance for affordable dwellings, they may apply to the relevant local authority for a house purchase loan.

Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within the appropriate period, the planning authority must also initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners or occupiers.

        <P>As part of their negotiation process, local authorities may agree, at their discretion, periodic rent reviews with landlords in line with the prevailing market conditions at the time.  My Department has issued guidance to authorities advising them to ensure that rent reviews are undertaken where provided for and also advising authorities of the need to obtain value for money and have regard to local market conditions when entering into new agreements.  Overall, I am satisfied that the scheme is providing value for money.</P>
        <P>One of the main objectives for the RAS is to improve the living conditions and standards of accommodation for recipients and, to date, some 4,452 new units of accommodation (i.e. not currently in use for Rent Supplement purposes) have been sourced by authorities, which are generally of a higher standard than the existing Rent Supplement accommodation occupied by the households concerned.  In that context, it is considered that the scheme is delivering value <Col N="997"/>for money, as well as meeting an important social policy goal of delivering better accommodation to vulnerable households.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has supported a number of external reviews of RAS undertaken by the Centre for Housing Research, as well as undertaking an Interim Value for Money and Policy Review of the scheme.  In line with the Department of Finance guidelines on the latter, the completed review has recently been the subject of an external evaluation and will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>My Department is engaging with all relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, on the prospects for carbon sequestrations in Ireland.  The report entitled &ldquo;Assessment of the Potential for Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide for the Island of Ireland&rdquo; was published in September 2008, having been commissioned by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) and Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI).  It quantified potential carbon storage capacity on the island, which is in practice considerably greater than the actual total annual carbon emissions in Ireland from large single point sources.</P>
        <P>The Department has established and chairs an inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Group on Carbon Capture and Storage, which is taking the Report&rsquo;s recommendations further.  Its next meeting is scheduled for late November.  I am aware of five relevant projects and initiatives which directly or indirectly contribute to the development of Irish CCS knowledge, capacity and capability. These comprise three applied projects and two research projects, the latter funded under the &ldquo;Griffith Geoscience Award&rdquo; scheme and run by GSI in my Department.  The three applied projects evolved in part from recommendations made in the report above and are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Clare Basin CCS assessment project, funded and managed by the EPA with technical supervision provided primarily by my Department, including from GSI</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Irish Sea CCS Task Force, an assessment of storage opportunities being pursued by GSI in collaboration with GSINI and the British Geological Survey</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The &ldquo;COSTS4EU&rdquo; research project application for EU funding.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to the &ldquo;COSTS&rdquo; research project, SEI commissioned SLR Consulting Ltd to devise and assemble a trans-national project consortium to advance near term CCS opportunities in Ireland, France and Poland.  This includes private sector partners in Ireland, Poland and France.  The Irish partner consortium includes SLR Consulting as project managers, and Kinsale Energy Ltd as the principal industry partner, along with the ESB.  The Irish component is focusing on the Kinsale Head gas field, as the report identified this as the best near term opportunity for CCS development in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The research proposal was lodged with the EU Framework 7 Research Programme in October 2009 and a decision on its preliminary acceptance, or otherwise, is expected in December.  The two relevant &ldquo;Griffith Geoscience Award&rdquo; scheme projects are as follows:</P>

	<P>There is no commercial arrangement between either my Department or Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), with the company in question to provide zero emission vehicles to the Government.  A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between Renault-Nissan and any Department which provides for information exchange on infrastructure technologies and technical specifications for vehicles.</P>
        <P>The Government has set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020.  An Inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Taskforce on electric vehicles is chaired by my Department and comprises the Departments of Transport, Finance, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, SEI, ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is also joining the Taskforce in light of its statutory responsibilities for the regulated networks.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce will advise on the options and timeframes for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the national roll-out of electric vehicles in a cost effective manner.  Initial estimates for the roll out of infrastructure are between 6 and 18 months depending on the scale of initial deployment.  Global developments will be factored in as the technologies mature.  The Taskforce will very shortly report its initial findings and advise on next steps.  The report will also advise on overall costs and financial implications.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413 and 416 together.</P>
        <P>Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e over the telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre.  The availability of broadband is widely accepted as having a positive impact on economic and commercial activity.  I understand that fixed wireless and satellite broadband is available in the general area of Carrowmenagh, County Donegal, and mobile and satellite broadband is available in the general area of Culdaff, County Donegal.  Details of broadband availability throughout the country are available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  I would add that information contained on this website is provided by the service providers.  In addition details of the Electoral Divisions in County Donegal to be covered by the National Broadband Scheme can be found at <i>www.three.ie/nbs.</i></P>
        <P>The widespread acceptance of the benefits of broadband has motivated the EU Commission to set aside a portion of European Economic Recovery Package (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  I am considering how the provision of broadband services to unserved rural premises can be achieved through an appropriate intervention under the EERP.  My Department is currently considering options for the design of such a scheme.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  Discussions have already commenced with the European Commission on the first step of applying for and securing State Aid clearance.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made to date on restructuring the electricity sector, through finalisation of the Commission for Energy Regulation and ESB asset divestment strategy; when the transfer of the national transmission assets to EirGrid will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Assessment Asset Strategy agreed between the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the ESB in 2007 was designed to reduce the company&rsquo;s capacity share of the all island power generation market to below 40%.  The CER has been closely monitoring ESB&rsquo;s compliance with the terms of the Asset Divestment Strategy.  The necessary capacity reduction has already been largely achieved with the sale by ESB to Endesa Limited of a number of power generation plants.  The ESB is completing further arrangements which will ensure the target is fully met to the CER&rsquo;s satisfaction.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy in relation to the transfer of the electricity transmission network to EirGrid as the national transmission system operator is clearly set out in the Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020 and reaffirmed in the Programme for Government. I have consistently underlined the need for transparent and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing the Government&rsquo;s policy in relation to the ownership of the elec<Col N="1000"/>tricity transmission assets.  That process of engagement is underway.  As part of the process an independent analysis of the relevant issues is being commissioned taking account, inter alia, of EU developments and the all island Single Electricity Market.  I have appointed Mr. Fergus Cahill to chair the process of engagement.  My intention is to have the process completed as early as possible in 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mineral Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) Schemes, which were introduced by my Department in 2005 and 2006, have been instrumental in assisting many of the biofuel producers in Ireland to begin operations.  The MOTR schemes, which will expire at the end of 2010, have been successful in leveraging a significant amount of biofuels into the Irish market.</P>
        <P>With a view to developing a long term guaranteed market, the Biofuel Obligation will be introduced from next year.  By establishing a substantial demand base for biofuels, commercial opportunities will open up for companies already producing biofuels in Ireland and for new players.  There are a wide range of feedstocks available, which can be leveraged into biofuels production and companies are already producing biofuels in Ireland from a number of sources such as recovered cooking oil, whey, wheat, Oilseed Rape and tallow.  The Obligation, by creating guaranteed demand will stimulate the supply of Irish sourced biofuels and will act therefore as an incentive for market production.  No additional incentives are planned.</P>

	<P>My Department has responsibility for foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2005. When considering applications under the Foreshore Acts, including offshore energy projects, the primary role of my Department is to ensure the protection and sustainable development of the foreshore.  A consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts has been under consideration for some time. This is intended to provide a modern, effective and integrated legal framework for the management of the State&rsquo;s foreshore estate in the future. Preparation of these proposals will to take account, among other things, of the EU Public Participation Directive, the principles in the EU Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, the outcome of the EU Maritime Green Paper, the EU Marine Strategy Directive and the EU Roadmap on Maritime Spatial Planning.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for certain foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 including in respect of all energy related developments would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This transfer of responsibilities requires the enactment of new foreshore legislation which <Col N="1001"/>was published on 10th November.  The Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2009 will give effect to the transfer of the functions referred to,  and it is my intention to introduce the legislation to the Oireachtas as soon as possible this term.</P>
        <P>In the interest of efficiency and effectiveness it is considered appropriate that the review of the Foreshore Acts should await the completion of the transfer of the relevant elements of the Foreshore functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This is particularly important in view of the fact that both departments will have responsibility for different aspects of Foreshore management.  I look forward to working closely with the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate modernisation of the foreshore legislative and management framework.</P>

A ground inspection was conducted on 14 October 2009, following issues raised via a satellite inspection of the area declared. This ground inspection confirmed the issues highlighted via satellite i.e. while the person named declared an area of 8.82 hectares, the inspection established an area of 7.64 eligible hectares.  As the level of over-claim is greater than 3% but less than 20%, a penalty of twice the area over claimed is applied, as per the governing EU Regulations.  A letter outlining in detail the findings of the inspection and the implications of same, issued on 4 November.  The person named was offered the right to appeal these findings and has already lodged an appeal.  This appeal is currently being examined. The applicant will be informed of the outcome of the appeal in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 433 together.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department attended the Workshop on Horse Health and Welfare in Ireland held recently at University College Dublin, which was organised by its Faculty of Agriculture, Food Science and Veterinary Medicine and included participants drawn from a cross-section of industry, government, education and welfare sectors.  The initiative for the meeting, which focused primarily on the added value that higher welfare standards and taking ownership of welfare bring to the equine industry, was taken by University College Dublin in the context of its ongoing research into horse health and welfare.</P>
        <P>With regard to the establishment of a multi-agency group for the management of abandoned horses, I have had discussions recently with representatives of the horse industry and welfare bodies in which I was briefed on the possible risk of horse welfare problems developing over the coming months including a risk of abandonment of horses.  Following these discussions I have asked officials of my Department to meet with representatives of the horse industry and welfare bodies in an effort to establish the extent of the problem and possible solutions.  Officials have now met with representatives from the horse industry and through a series of regional meetings with the Early Warning System (sub-group of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council), have engaged with representatives from farming and animal welfare bodies to discuss the issue of horse welfare.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>In addition I have asked Veterinary Inspectors from my Department&rsquo;s District Veterinary Offices to carry out an assessment to identify any potential problems with horses on farms. <Col N="1007"/> Further meetings are being arranged with relevant stakeholders including welfare bodies involved with horses to ensure that the matter is kept under review.  I have also written to my colleague Mr. John Gormley TD the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of the Control of Horses Act 1996.  The ongoing effective implementation of this Act by Local Authorities can assist with reducing potential horse welfare problems developing particularly with regard to those horses that are being abandoned.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any bacterial testing on imported poultry meat having been carried out at my Department&rsquo;s laboratory in Kilkenny.  If the Deputy can provide any further information, I will be glad to pursue the matter.  Responsibility for ensuring the safety of food rests in the first place with the food business operator that places it on the market.  Compliance is monitored by the competent authority in the country of production.  Poultry meat produced in the EU is subject to an extensive range of veterinary controls to ensure its suitability for human consumption.  Any meat entering intra-Community trade must meet the requirements of the legislation in question.  In the case of importation from third countries, products of animal origin for human consumption must have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment, be appropriately labelled and transported and be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation.

Work from a number of other locations will be moved into these regional offices. The Department is holding ongoing meetings and discussions with staff, particularly in the Phase 1 offices.  The overall reorganisation of the Department, of which the local office project is an important part, has facilitated a reduction of over 200 in staff levels to date in 2009.

	<P>I accept that the Irish sheep sector is in need of assistance and, mindful of the particular difficulties being experienced, I have decided on a two-fold approach to help address the situation.  In the first instance and as I announced in March, I have decided to allocate approximately &euro;7 million from the Single Farm Payment National Reserve to 14,000 hill sheep farmers for this year, these being the only additional funds to which I have access in 2009. </P>
        <P>Secondly, from 2010, there will be &euro;25 million in additional funding available in unused CAP funds, designed to target specific sectors and regions in need of assistance. I have decided that &euro;18 million of these funds will be targeted at sheep farmers, both hill and lowland sheep producers. My main priority in allocating these funds, is to ensure that they are used in the most efficient and effective manner for the development of Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Upland Sheep Payment will be payable to farmers who: declared their sheep under the 2007 and the 2008 Sheep Census; declared Mountain Type Grazing under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme; and were eligible for and were in receipt of payment under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  The maximum area payable is 15 hectares of mountain type grazing.  Arrangements in respect of the Upland Sheep Payment will be announced shortly.</P>

	<P>Cattle and sheep prices are collected at livestock marts by officials of my Department on a weekly basis. The prices are collected in order to provide (a) weekly reports of price data to the EU Commission in the context of the market support systems for cattle and sheep and (b) summary prices that are issued weekly to valuers assigned to valuing cattle under the TB and Brucellosis. The price information is also used for Scrapie and BSE valuations. </P>
        <P>With regard to the reporting of cattle and sheep prices to the European Commission, my Department is obliged under EU rules to collect price data on a weekly basis in order to establish average Community prices which are used by the Commission to manage the market <Col N="1012"/>in these sectors. Regarding prices reporting for the valuation scheme, it is important that valuers have access to up-to-date prices for use as a reference when valuing animals removed as reactors. This arrangement was agreed with the farming representative organisations prior to the introduction of this scheme in 2002.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact that the officials involved in the compilation of cattle and sheep prices undertake a range of other duties and, given the short time available, it is difficult to give the precise cost associated with attendance at marts for price reporting purposes. However, it is estimated that, on average over the past 5 years, approximately 19 persons were involved to varying degrees in this activity. It should be noted, however, that, since these officials only spend a relatively small proportion of their working hours on price reporting, the number of full time staff equivalents involved in this activity is considerably less than this.</P>
        <P>The estimated cost of this activity for each of the past five years and to date in 2009 is as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The estimated costs include the proportion of salary and travel and subsistence paid for price reporting as well as payment for hours worked outside normal working hours.  The hourly/salary rate for the staff involved is currently approximately &euro;24.00 for normal working hours. Staff who are required to attend at marts outside their normal working hours, for example at evening sales, are paid an allowance depending on the total hours they have worked outside normal working hours.</P>
        <P>The cost involved in recording cattle and sheep prices must be seen in the context of our obligations to the EU and the need to ensure that payment of compensation under the On Farm Market Valuation scheme, which amounted to approximately &euro;23m in 2008, is based on accurate price information. As part of an ongoing review of efficiencies in my Department, my officials have commenced an examination of the feasibility of obtaining electronic transfer of mart sales price data for non-breeding beef cattle sales directly from the marts. However, it is important that any revised system is capable of reflecting quality differentials and does not undermine the accuracy of the prices reported. Appropriate consultation with stakeholders will be undertaken in the event of changes to the current arrangements being considered.</P>

	<P>My Department has responsibility for the licensing of aquaculture in the State in accordance with the provisions of national and EU law.  Where it is deemed that the proposed aquaculture is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura 2000 site an &lsquo;appropriate assessment&rsquo;, within the meaning of the EU Habitats Directive as transposed into national law, must be undertaken before I can grant an aquaculture licence in any marine area designated as a Special Area of Conservation or marine area designated as a Special Protection Area (a Natura 2000 site).  Any freshwater aquaculture applications are required to secure appropriate planning permission and an effluent discharge licence from the relevant local authority before an aquaculture licence application can be granted. </P>
        <P>My Department and its agencies, working with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, developed a comprehensive plan to deliver compliance with the EU Birds and Habitat Directives for aquaculture within a specific timeframe.  This plan was submitted to the EU Commission for consideration and on 13 May 2009 a meeting between this Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, relevant Agencies and the Commission took place in Brussels to discuss the plan with a view to securing the Commission&rsquo;s support for the approach set down in the plan.</P>
        <P>The Commission advised that it was, in principle, favourably disposed towards Ireland&rsquo;s plan subject to a positive response to the issues raised and further clarifications from the Irish authorities on the details of the plan.  However, it has recently advised that it remains concerned about the planned approach to delivering compliance for aquaculture licensing.   The most recent views of the Commission are being examined by my Department in conjunction the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to responding to the Commission&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>In the meantime my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute, is gathering the necessary baseline data for each Natura 2000 site relevant to marine aquaculture and wild fisheries.  A sum of &euro;1m has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2009 for the collection of this baseline data.  This data will enable the establishment of conservation objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the subsequent assessment of all relevant aquaculture applications in those sites.</P>
        <P>The collection of the baseline data sets and the establishment of conservation objectives for each relevant marine Natura 2000 site will enable my Department in conjunction with technical and scientific advisers to undertake assessment of all applications in due course.   The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is also a statutory consultee to the aquaculture licensing process.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the agriculture appeals office at Kilminchy Court, Portlaoise has written to a person (details supplied) in County Cavan advising that their appeal file has been closed; the reason they are being subjected to constant delay in the processing of their entitlements; the reason his Department&rsquo;s veterinarians are refusing them permission to have their animals tested privately; the further reason almost two years later an investigation has not concluded; and when he expects this situation to end. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 and 451 together.</P>
        <P>This herdowner is the subject of investigation by the Garda and my Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.  The investigation will be concluded as expeditiously as possible.  A decision taken by my Department not to pay any TB compensation on animals removed for slaughter following a TB test carried out in March 2009 was appealed by the herdowner to the Agriculture Appeals Office.  The Agriculture Appeals Office is an independent statutory body and I have no role in relation to its day to day functions. However, I understand that this Office has recently written to the herdowner indicating that it will process the appeal when the Department&rsquo;s investigations are completed.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s decision that TB testing in this herd should be carried out by the veterinary inspectorate from the DVO was taken in the context of the investigation referred to above.  The other matters raised in the letter dated 7 April 2009 have been dealt with in correspondence between my Department and the herdowner and or his solicitor.  I am satisfied that this herdowner has been dealt with in a fair and equitable manner by my officials and any allegations to the contrary are vigorously denied.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that, in general, I am not in favour of schools availing of an internet service outside of the Schools Broadband Programme as under the Schools Programme, connectivity to the internet is routed through a National Broadband Network, which has been developed by HEAnet (the National Education and Research Network provider). HEAnet has established a Network Operations Centre to channel and control the broadband access to schools, and it provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/anti-virus and content filtering. A national helpdesk has been established to interface between the network, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the schools, and to provide schools with on-going advice and assistance. This helpdesk is managed by the NCTE. Schools that use a service provider not contracted to the Department do not have access to these services, protections and support.  There would also be the issue of the Department paying two service providers for a service to the same school.</P>
        <P>I understand that when Phase I of the Schools Broadband Programme commenced in 2005 the range of technologies available in certain areas was very restricted and in many cases a satellite option was the only one available.  However, my Department is currently awarding contracts under the second phase of the Programme and the indications from the recently completed evaluation of tenders are that this will mean enhanced bandwidth for schools.  I wish to inform the Deputy that the school in question is due to get a wireless solution under this second phase with a different ISP, which will bring faster download speeds, and this will be rolled out to the school as part of the overall roll-out plan of that ISP,  in agreement with my Department.  My Department is managing the transition period between the phasing out of the current service providers and the connections to new providers to get schools switched over as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>A major capital project at the school to which the Deputy refers is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.</P>
        <P>The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.  My Department has received correspondence from the school regarding possible progression of the school hall element of the major project.  My Department has  responded directly to the school in this regard with a request for more detailed information on what is proposed.</P>

	<P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for second-level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-<Col N="1017"/>level system.  At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.  The school to which the Deputy refers is a community school and receives funding in the same way as all community and comprehensive schools.  Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive sector are increased on a pro rata basis in line with increases in the per capita grant paid to voluntary secondary schools.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  With regard to funding in 2009, the information relates to grants paid to date, as a number of grants are due to issue to the school before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers was one of ten projects announced in January 2009 to be re-tendered.  Following the receipt and clearance of the revised tender and associated documentation, the project was authorised to go to tender in June.  Following the satisfactory resolution of some issues with the Tender Report, the Board of Management was authorised to issue a letter of intent to the preferred tenderer.  The Department has recently received the Supplementary Tender Report from the School&rsquo;s Design Team.  Upon receipt of some outstanding items, and subject to everything being in order, the Department expects to revert to the Board of Management within days, authorising it to place the contract for the building works.  </P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the distinction between administrative and teaching principals in ordinary primary schools. There were 1,163 ordinary primary schools which had a full-time administrative principal in the 2008-2009 school year.  A further 2,012 ordinary primary schools had a teaching principal. Primary schools with a staffing of a Principal and up to 6 mainstream class teachers have a teaching principal. This is outlined in primary circular 0002/2009 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>Since the start of the 2006/07 school year my Department has introduced further initiatives to assist with reducing the administrative workload of primary school principals. Following the introduction of DEIS in the 2006/07 school year, schools which qualified for the Urban Strand (Band 1 and 2) of the School Support Programme (SSP) are entitled to the allocation of administrative principals on lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally.</P>
        <P>Additionally primary schools with a staffing of Principal plus four or five mainstream class teachers that also have a specialist autism unit established under the approval of the National Council for Special Education, are entitled to appoint the Principal on an administrative basis. The scheme of release time enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative leadership and management functions. The number of days release time allowed varies between 14 and 22 and is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school. Paid substitution is provided by my Department for the days that principals are on release time.</P>
        <P>In the 2005/2006 school year my Department, following consultation with the relevant education interests introduced on a pilot basis, a system whereby a fully qualified primary school teacher may be employed to act as nominated substitute teacher for Principals in a cluster of schools taking release days. Twenty clusters have been established under the pilot scheme.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the school in question had a satellite broadband connection under phase I of the Schools Broadband Programme. The satellite dish was taken down when the school moved to a new building on the same premises and I understand there have been problems since the dish was re-installed.  My Department is currently awarding contracts under the second phase of the Programme and the indications from the recently completed evaluation of tenders are that this will mean enhanced bandwidth for schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school in question is due to get a DSL solution under this second phase with a different service provider, and my Department will ensure that this is rolled out to the school as soon as possible. I also wish to inform the Deputy that on Monday, 16 November I announced grants totalling &euro;22 million which will issue to primary schools before the end of this year. Schools will be asked to prioritise these grants to ensure that there&rsquo;s a teaching laptop and digital projector in every classroom.</P>
        <P>In regard to physical education equipment, a special PE funding package of &euro;6.5 million issued in 2006 to primary schools, and in 2007 a similar package of &euro;3 million issued to post-primary schools. Under these packages, primary schools received &euro;2,000 and post-primary &euro;4,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc. Since 2000 the Department has also provided in excess of &euro;5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Such materials and equipment would normally be expected to last for a number of years.</P>
        <P>In addition the devolved grant scheme for minor works issues to national schools each year. All such schools with full recognition receive a basic grant of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil. This grant is intended to address works required to the physical infrastructure of the schools or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use, including PE and IT related equipment. Around &euro;28m is paid out annually to primary schools throughout the country to <Col N="1022"/>enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>From the details supplied by the Deputy it appears that the qualifications of the person in question, who is qualified to work as a special needs assistant, are not acceptable to my Department as a tutor under the home tuition scheme. The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement and to provide early intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as the tuition takes place outside of school supervision there is a need to ensure that the tuition provider is a fully qualified teacher. However if it is not possible to recruit a tuition provider with a teaching qualification then alternative qualifications are acceptable as an interim measure until such time as a qualified teacher is recruited. A list of relevant qualifications may be sourced on my Department&rsquo;s website on www.education.ie. It is in the interests of children to expect that home tutors funded under this scheme are appropriately qualified tuition providers. It is for this reason that tuition providers will be required to meet the minimum qualification standard. The guidelines to the scheme have in recent years advised of my Department&rsquo;s preference for a fully qualified teacher. However it is important that the parent of the child for whom tuition has been  sanctioned liaises with the relevant officials in my Department in this context, particularly if she is experiencing difficulties in sourcing a fully qualified teacher.</P>

	<P>Claims for the payment for substitute teaching work are submitted by individual schools through my Department&rsquo;s on-line claims system (OLCS). Each school submits details of the absent teacher, the reason for the absence (to determine if it is a substitutable absence) and the details of the substitute teacher for  whom payment is claimed. Once records are verified and saved, these records are uploaded nightly to my Department&rsquo;s payroll systems and are paid in the next payroll run.</P>
        <P>Where a substitute teacher works in a number of schools, each school submits  details of the claims for work in that school through OLCS and all claims are combined for payment in the appropriate payroll. When a teacher starts to work for the first time in a substitute capacity in a school, the school will ask them to fill out a form (copy forwarded to Deputy) which seeks personal details, payment details, qualifications, registration and other relevant information. This information is retained in the school. Schools submit claim details through OLCS for payment. Individual schools can request substitute teachers to complete claim forms for school record purposes. Payrolls have regular closing dates and these dates are known to schools. Schools must submit claims in a timely manner to ensure they are paid at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <P>The Department has a template design for stand alone PE halls. However, the band rating, under the prioritisation criterion, for such a project is 4.1. The published prioritisation criteria were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

        <Quest> the names and addresses of the non-fee paying schools here; the number of pupils enrolled in each; the amount of funding each school receives from the Exchequer; the purpose of that funding; the cost of teachers salaries in each school; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the information requested by the Deputy relates to post-primary schools only and that the Deputy does not require information on teacher salaries for individual schools.  I wish to advise the Deputy that the names, addresses and enrolment details for all second level schools in the 2008/09 school year are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, under the Education Provider Search.  The funding arrangements at post-primary level reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system.  At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.  My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. </P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2009, the standard per capita grant was increased by &euro;14 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;345 per pupil.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;8 per pupil in 2009 in the support services grant, bringing that grant to &euro;212 per pupil.  The cumulative increase of &euro;22 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to &euro;557 per pupil.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example, in the case of a <Col N="1025"/>secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;318,500. The corresponding figure in 2000 was approximately &euro;147,300.</P>
        <P>Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a pro rata basis in line with increases in the per capita grant paid to voluntary secondary schools.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  The total grant to the VEC sector in 2008 amounted to &euro;933.3 million. This comprised of &euro;756.625 million for pay and &euro;176.6 million for non-pay. Teachers&rsquo; salaries accounted for approximately 83% of pay costs.  The total grant to the Community and Comprehensive sector in 2008 amounted to &euro;47.4 million. This comprised of &euro;29.3 million for non-pay and &euro;18.1 million for C&amp;C Non-Teaching-pay. Teachers&rsquo; Salaries in the Community and Comprehensive sector and in voluntary secondary schools are paid by my Department and are set out in the attached table.</P>
        <P>Grants provided to second level schools and VECs in 2008 are outlined in the attached table.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The rationale for the introduction of bursaries would be to address a perceived lack of interest on the part of students in undertaking programmes in particular disciplines.   Some &euro;2.5 million per annum is allocated to the Discover Science and Engineering programme, funded by Forf&aacute;s, to promote the take up of  science, engineering and technology in schools and colleges, as well as an awareness of the importance of these disciplines in wider society.  The latest figures from the CAO show that the number of people accepting third level places on engineering courses this year increased by almost 21% on 2008/09. In addition, the number of computing and science place acceptances are up more than 25%.  This suggests that students are recognising the value of pursuing such disciplines.  The introduction of targeted bursaries will be considered further in the light of industry views on the significant increases in  enrolments that have taken place this year. </P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Framework for Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy committed to the expansion of summer schools in science and engineering with an emphasis on innovation and commercialisation.  As the Deputy may be aware, there is currently a substantial calendar of summer schools in place across higher education institutions, targeted at both second-level and primary level pupils. Summer schools in the area of science and engineering cover a wide variety of activities, ranging from hands-on experimental work, science theory and career advice. These are designed to stimulate interest in science and engineering courses generally. The scope, including funding implications, for incorporating or expanding innovation and commercialisation activities within summer school programmes is being explored by my Department with the Higher Education Authority.</P>

	<P>Since 2003 the Leadership Development for Schools Programme (LDS) has expanded the range of supports and services that it offers to school leaders and over 10,000 teachers from principals to middle managers have successfully completed LDS module programmes such as Misneach, Spreagadh, Forbairt, T&aacute;n&aacute;iste, Cumas&uacute; and Coth&uacute;. This investment has now led us to a point where there are structured professional development opportunities for all school leaders in our system from their point of appointment to day of retirement.</P>
        <P>Both Misneach and T&aacute;naiste are professional development programmes for newly appointed school Principals and Deputy Principals respectively, Spreagadh is a programme for Primary Principals and Forbairt is a professional development programme for experienced school Principals.  Cumas&uacute; is for Leaders in DEIS schools and Coth&uacute; is a programme for leaders in special schools.  All the programmes mentioned consist of various modules which include leadership skills, motivating and inspiring staff in schools as well as self motivation for the leaders themselves.</P>
        <P>In September 2008 LDS, in conjunction with NUI Maynooth, introduced T&oacute;ra&iacute;ocht, a formal training programme for aspiring school leaders. The T&oacute;ra&iacute;ocht Programme was designed in conjunction with the Department of Education at Maynooth and the wider educational partners and responds to the need for motivation and professional development that prepares school leaders of the future.  This Programme has been highly successfully with the first cohort of students scheduled to graduate in March 2010.</P>

	<P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second-level schools are taken at school level.  My Department does not generally approve, commission, sponsor or endorse educational text-books. Books are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has been made in the provision of textbooks and resources specifically for use in Gaeltacht and other all-Irish schools since An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta <Col N="1028"/>agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta was set up in 2002. An  Chomhairle was established to co-ordinate the provision of textbooks and aids to support Irish, to advise on policies relating to Irish in schools generally and in all-Irish and Gaeltacht schools, to provide support services through the medium of Irish and to undertake research in this area.</P>
        <P>An Chomhairle works closely with An G&uacute;m and other agencies to address the deficit in Irish medium resources and materials.  It has published an extensive resource directory on its website (www.cogg.ie) on materials and resources now available to support the teaching of Irish in the curriculum, and the teaching of other subjects through Irish, across primary and post primary schools. A complete list of Teaching Aids and Resources has also been sent to Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna, and a mobile library van provides demonstrations to schools of the resources available.</P>
        <P>With the exception of language subjects, some school text-books and other resource materials are available in Irish for the majority of subjects for Junior and Leaving Certificate.  At Junior cycle, the subjects for which textbooks in Irish are not  available at present include Art Craft and Design, Ancient Greek, Italian, Hebrew Studies, Classical Studies, Technology,  Art Craft and Design, and Music.  At senior cycle, the subjects for which textbooks are not available are French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Arabic, Latin, Ancient Greek, Hebrew Studies, Classical Studies, Chemistry, Agricultural Science, Engineering, Construction, Technology, Design and Communication Graphics and Accounting.   In 2009, my Department allocated a budget of &euro;1.234 million to An Chomhairle.</P>

	<P>I have attached, for the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the most up-to-date list of post primary schools providing the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme and located in the vicinity of  the address of the parent in question.  The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice are respected.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

        <Quest> the reason he is behind targets on capital spending for schools in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The published expenditure figures for the end of October 2009 show that my Department&rsquo;s capital expenditure on primary and post-primary level schools is &euro;367.728 million, which is &euro;112 million behind the profiled, or projected, figure to the end of October.  My Department&rsquo;s total budget in 2009 for primary, post-primary and third level capital is &euro;841 million. Expenditure on the large number of individual projects included in a capital programme of this magnitude is subject to very considerable variation on a calendar year basis. It was in recognition of this that the current framework of rolling multi-annual capital envelopes,  encompassing a carry-over facility of up to 10% of the total amount available in any one year, was introduced. </P>
        <P>The principal area where expenditure is running behind profile is schools&rsquo; major capital projects. These projects comprise new schools, major extensions and refurbishment projects.  The main reason for the underspend against profile on the major schools&rsquo; capital projects is that my announced programme of 78 projects to commence construction in 2009 has been slower to get started on site than initially expected. Another very significant factor is that tender prices obtained for this programme are yielding a reduction of up to 30% compared to prices obtained at the height of the construction boom.  In addition, an extensive programme of smaller-scale schools&rsquo; capital projects  is being delivered, mainly through the Summer Works Scheme which this year includes an energy efficiency component for which in excess of 1,600 schools have now been approved.</P>
        <P>There is a significant amount of capital expenditure programmed for the remainder of 2009. Expenditure trends in recent years bear out the fact that an increased amount of invoices and other claims for payment are made in the final quarter as builders complete projects and schools draw down their capital grant approvals.  The annual grant for minor capital works to primary schools has issued and will be in the schools&rsquo; accounts by the end of this week.</P>
        <P>I am keeping the position under close review and considering all appropriate options regarding the expenditure position. These options include the possibility of carrying forward funding into 2010. As I have already mentioned, if necessary, and in agreement with the Minister for Finance, up to 10% of the overall allocation of &euro;841 million can be carried forward to 2010.</P>
<Col N="1030"/>
        <P>Since I became Minister for Education and Science, I have consistently emphasised my determination to ensure best value for money in capital projects and that the available funding is spent in a prudent way. I am particularly pleased to note the reduction in tender costs for capital projects. I intend to continue to maximise value for money and to ensure that as many schools as possible will benefit from the very favourable tenders that can now be obtained in the construction sector and in this context, my Department is currently finalising a further programme of major capital projects for 2010 which I will announce in due course.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments to the Bill in relation to legal and policy issues which have arisen since Second Stage are being advanced by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Bill makes provision for the transfer of responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector. In the existing budgetary situation, resources are not currently available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in the immediate future. However, it is not possible to say definitively at this point when new administrative arrangements can be put in place and I am anxious, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory  footing, to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for the intervening period. </P>
        <P>Therefore, I am endeavouring to progress to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date.  While the current financial situation may necessitate retention of the existing administrative structures in the immediate term, I am assessing organisational options for the grants administration function in the longer run, with a view to streamlining operations and achieving more effective administrative efficiencies.  Possible options for a more significant aggregation of functions are now being explored in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government&rsquo;s overall programme of public service reform.</P>
        <P>These developments also require consideration of a complex set of legal options in relation to further amendment of the Bill and my Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to explore the issues in that regard. Subject to any technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, I hope to be in a position to have these amendments advanced sufficiently in order to progress to Committee as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>In October 2000, architectural planning commenced for an extension project at the school to which the Deputy refers.  The proposed project consisted of 3 mainstream classrooms, the conversion of the 3 existing mainstream classrooms into ancillary accommodation and a General Purpose Room.  This school&rsquo;s building project was selected to progress and announced under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme 2005.  The school authority was offered funding in the amount of &euro;300,000 to build two mainstream classrooms and two resource rooms.  The school authority accepted this offer and proceeded with the planning of this project, while at the same time appealing the amount of the funding allocation under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the school authority notified the Department that they had decided to withdraw from the 2005 Permanent Accommodation Scheme and requested that the project be considered for inclusion for delivery under the major capital works programme.  At that point, prior to the further progression of a building project at this school, it was deemed necessary to review the long term projected staffing (LTPS).  A school&rsquo;s future accommodation need is determined by the projected staffing levels and ensures that capital funding being provided is sufficient to meet the future need.  It was determined that the LTPS should be Principal +8 assistant mainstream class teachers.  This was notified to the school authorities in January 2007.</P>
        <P>Following a site visit to the school, it was decided that the existing school site could not accommodate a new 8 classroom school and that a new school is required.  The Patron has advised that Parish land to the rear of the existing school site will be made available to accommodate the provision of the new 8 classroom school.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of the current competing demands on the capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>I wish to reassure the Deputy that I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  I have emphasised that the Government decided to continue to provide the Block Grant, which was increased this year. It is targeted as a support to individual pupils to enable them to attend Protestant schools.</P>
        <P>I have made clear that I am prepared to work with the Protestant fee-charging schools to identify particular problems and issues that may be arising in some of their schools, or in respect of some students in their schools, and to examine how these might be addressed in a manner consistent with the Constitution.  In this regard I have met with Protestant educational representatives, including the Church of Ireland Board of Education; Monaghan Collegiate School; the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland and the Committee on Management for Protestant Schools. In addition, my officials have also met with the Secondary Education Committee. I have explained that a simple reversal of the measures taken in Budget 2008 applicable to all Protestant fee-charging schools and determined solely on a denominational criterion was not legally possible.  I believe that engagement between my officials and representatives of the Protestant schools is the best way to seek to resolve the issues that are of concern.</P>

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in her/his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school refuses enrolment to a student. A Section 29 appeal recently took place in respect of a refusal to enrol this child to a school in Leixlip. This appeal was not upheld. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil. A further appeal has been received, regarding the refusal of a school in Celbridge to enrol this child and the appeal has been scheduled for early December.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child has been unable to secure a placement to date. I understand that in this instance that the NEWB are actively assisting the family in pursuing applications to other schools.  I also understand that a home tuition grant has been sanctioned for the child in question and that the National Council for Special Education are in contact with the family in question.  The Deputy will be aware that the Health Service Executive funds speech and language services, respite and dental treatment.</P>
