      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an urgent issue of local and national importance, namely, the removal of staff by the HSE north-east, from Pathways rehabilitation unit in Cavan General Hospital, causing serious trauma and hardship to patients and their families.  This unit has given new hope to many individuals who had suffered from either strokes or accidents and it is vital that units such as this are not the victims of various forms of Government mismanagement.  There are still major consultative meetings that many managers attend to discuss matters pertaining to the aged and disabled, but frontline staff is not a priority and this House can no longer ignore this situation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to the economic viability of the midlands posed by the potential loss of the Alienware plant in Athlone, a subsidiary of Dell, with the 70 jobs there being relocated to Poland, as a direct result of the lack of competitiveness and high costs engendered by the current Government. </P>
        <P>I do not see Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke present, who is always huffing and puffing about what she is doing for Athlone.  Where is she today?</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance, namely, the urgent need to retain SR Technics as a major part of the Irish economy and call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IDA Ireland to support the current proposals to save the 1,135 jobs and ensure that this valuable industry and aviation service is retained in Ireland. </P>

	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 8a, motion re referral to joint committee  of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a Council Regulation and for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between member states and third countries; No. 8b, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a Council Decision concerning the signing of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway and for a Council Framework Decision on the application, between member states of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention; No. 1, the Industrial Development Bill 2008 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage; and No. 13, Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 8a and 8b shall be decided without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to be put to the House today.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 8a and 8b without debate agreed to? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>These are reasonably complex measures that the Minister is requiring us to refer to committee on Wednesday next and return to the House the following day.  The Government is in possession of some of these tor three months. If we take, for example, the first one, the note says that the three-month period in respect of these proposals will expire on 12 April.  Therefore, the Minister has been sitting on it for three months, yet now seeks to have it referred to committee next Wednesday and expects it back in the House the following day.  This is part of a pattern in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is not acceptable.  It is not the way we should treat instruments such as this which have to be approved by the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has advised that this is a matter of negotiation over three months and the views of the Oireachtas will be enormously important. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The negotiations took place more than three months ago. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, if it is a matter of timing in terms of the committee not having sufficient time on Wednesday, I am sure the committee Chairman can facilitate further discussion and analysis if needs be. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a point of order, Ceann Comhairle.  The T&aacute;naiste has misled the House about the content of the matter we have just dealt with in so far as she believes the committee could value our opinion in this regard.  It is not a question of our opinion but rather the fact that this House has to pass it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the law. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the law, so what she has said is wrong. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A point of order, Ceann Comhairle. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Rabbitte have a point of order, because the last contribution was not a point of order? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not correct for the T&aacute;naiste to put on the record of the House that this has been discussed for three months.  It was concluded three months ago and is only being brought to the House, now.  That is my point, so she is entirely wrong. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="883"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order, either.  I call Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a well-paid Minister who should be looking after this.</P>
        <P>Question, that the proposal for dealing with Nos. 8a and 8b, without debate, be agreed to,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I should like to ask the T&aacute;naiste a number of questions on the Order of Business.  Will she say why the Defamation Bill has been lodged for ten months with the committee dealing with justice and related matters?  The Bill was the result of agreement between the previous Taoiseach and the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and was initiated in the Seanad.  It was passed by the Seanad and was introduced in the D&aacute;il by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor.  It passed Second Stage and has been in the committee without movement for the last ten months.  Deputy Charles Flanagan raised this matter yesterday and I stress its importance because we do not want to see it being let drift again, when the Press Council report comes out next week.  There is concern it might unravel completely and that there is now no cover for the publication of judgments given by the Press Council. </P>
        <P>If she can, will the T&aacute;naiste indicate that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will urge the Chairman of the committee to deal expeditiously with Committee Stage of the Defamation Bill?  I hope it might be concluded by the summer.  The agreement worked out in good faith should be followed through in good faith.  For its part, the newspaper industry has abided by its end of the bargain but the Government has not yet followed through.  Will the T&aacute;naiste respond to that?</P>
        <P>The national broadcaster receives the proceeds of the television licence fee.  I understand a grovelling, unreserved apology was issued for a piece of political satire&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order now.  The Deputy asked about the Defamation Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as a consequence of the Government press secretary contacting RTE. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot go into that business.  The Deputy is completely out of order.  He will have to find another way to raise that.<b></b></P>

	<P>On St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day the Minister for Finance did an interview with the <i>Financial Times</i> in which he promised to restrict crony directorship practices through the immediate introduction of legislation.  He referred to the many incestuous relationships in Irish banking and how it had brought down the banks in this country.  He said the matter would be before the Cabinet as a matter of urgency.  Will the T&aacute;naiste advise the House when this legislation dealing with crony capitalism in Ireland and incestuous relationships, as the Minister described them, in Irish business circles will be addressed in legislation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">In light of the fact the Government has acceded to the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, will it now suspend the implementation of the sections of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 which imposed the so-called public service pension levy?  Does the T&aacute;naiste not accept that the engagements currently underway will be meaningless unless that step is taken, that it is critical that the public service pension levy is addressed at the negotiations and that the Government suspends those measures of that Act?  Will she advise if those steps will be taken and if new legislation will be required and will she indicate where the Government now stands in light of this engagement on this matter?</P>

	<P>I would like to ask the T&aacute;naiste about two matters.  The T&aacute;naiste said she is committed to introducing legislation to address the request from the Director of Corporate Enforcement for amendments to existing legislation to strengthen his powers.  What is the current status of that legislation and when can we expect to see it in the House? </P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the status of the covered institutions oversight committee report from the committee to inquire into remuneration in financial institutions?  Does the Government accept its findings?  If so, does it intend to legislate to close the loophole which is allowing for abuses of pension regulations, as have been uncovered in financial institutions?  When can we expect to see such legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The first piece of legislation is from my own Department and I will bring it to Government next week, with a view to having it on the floor of the House as quickly as possible.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I asked.  My question is whether the Government accepts the CIROC report.  If so, does it intend to legislate to close the loophole which has been identified which allows abuses of pension regulations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did not accept all the recommendations and made its own determination as to what it thought was fitting and appropriate.  That view has been expressed and given to all of the members of the financial institutions and they have been requested to abide by the Government decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

	<P>The Taoiseach appeared to be somewhat hurt yesterday when I raised the question of various items of proposed legislation under the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  In view of the fact that there is such a plethora of legislation promised, when is it intended to process the legislation through the House?  Crime is a serious issue in this country at the current time.  It has not gone away and it is a serious matter which needs attention.  Is it intended to extract any one of the proposed pieces of legislation and bring it before the House, as a matter of urgency, with a view to combatting the ongoing serious levels of crime, particularly organised crime, in this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy refers particularly to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not refer to it alone.  There are several Bills.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>All of the legislation will be published on the A list.  If there is a specific piece of legislation I will try to facilitate the Deputy within the time frame.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not adequate.  I will ask the question again.  Might it be possible for the Government, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to set out a priority list?  The current list has been published for the last three or four years.  The issue has been anticipated for three or four years, and some for a longer period.  Crime continues.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Let the T&aacute;naiste explain it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There are seven pieces of legislation under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  They will all be published very quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will they be brought before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>I have one last question for the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy spends most of his time here asking nonsense questions.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question concerns the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own Department.  Legislation is promised by her Department as well.  The collective investment schemes (consolidation) Bill, which I presume is urgent given the present climate, is expected to be published in 2010.  That is not urgent.  It is stated that it is not possible to indicate when the consumer and competition Bill, a very important Bill, will be published.  The transfer of undertakings (pensions) Bill, a very sensitive and pertinent issue at the present time, is to provide a statutory basis for the transposition of the operational pensions provision of the transfer of undertakings EU directive.  It is stated that it is not possible to indicate at this stage when publication is expected.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence.  I suggest the T&aacute;naiste, at the earliest possible date, brings before the House some proposals to bring these important Bills into the House for debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has answered the question himself.  I have prioritised legislation within my own Department.  One Bill, the Industrial Development Bill 2008, will come before the House today.  We also have the compliance Bill, where I have asked all Members of the House to give of their views.  There is also legislation on agency, which must be passed.  I have prioritised those as the three most important Bills within my own Department.  A consolidation Bill on company law, which will take a considerable period of time, is the other priority.  </P>
        <P>The collective investment schemes (consolidation) Bill will be addressed next year.  The consumer and competition Bill will be drafted when I have brought to finality my views as to what legislation measures need to be completed to amalgamate the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  I have not yet decided when the transfer of undertakings (pensions) Bill will be addressed, on the basis of other priorities within my own Department.</P>

The banks have effectively been gambling with the money given to them on behalf of the wards of courts, and that money has been lost through an agency in the Bank of Ireland.  Will the State introduce legislation to ensure the money that is there for the survival of these people is restored by the State given that the courts have gambled the money away through investing it or giving it to an agency to invest?</P>
        <P>Most management companies are owned by builders and developers, some of whom are now broke as a consequence of their excessive greed.  These management companies were like milch <Col N="893"/>cows for developers, offering an additional source of profits.  They seem to have been invented by a small group of developers and they caught on like mushrooms growing in the dark.  People are now in a situation where they cannot sell their houses even if they can find a buyer because there is a lien on the title deed which requires them to make payments to a management company that no longer exists.  The urgency of this situation is greater than ever.  We have been pestering the Government for the past four or five years to introduce legislation.  Will some effort be made to bring forward that promised legislation in the next session?</P>

	<P>It was reported yesterday that the three main Irish banks have negotiated an allocation of &euro;300 million from the European Investment Bank for the purpose of providing credit to small and medium-sized enterprises and that this money is likely to be introduced into the system over the next 18 months.  This allocation merely represents the tip of the iceberg.  Some &euro;30 billion is available but it has taken the banks six months to get &euro;300 million.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill 2008 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Second Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to introduce the Industrial Development Bill 2008 and outline its main provisions.  The Bill provides for the transfer of shares held by Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland and it amends sections of the Industrial Development Acts of 1986 and 1993.  These amendments relate primarily to the statutory limit on aggregate payments by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the enterprise development agencies, and to certain thresholds above which agency grant payments to individual companies require Government approval.  The amendments also seek to address an anomaly that has arisen regarding grants to small companies in parts of the BMW or Border, midland and western region.  Finally, the Bill provides for the transfer of all property of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment held under section 19 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act 1961<i> </i>to Enterprise Ireland.</P><Col N="897"/>
        <P>It is important to stress at the outset that the changes proposed in the Bill are of a technical nature in line with the policy already set for the period 2007 to 2013.  They do not reflect a new policy direction.  Principles and policy for the period are set out in the national development plan and were discussed and approved at political level at that time.  They are also considered annually by the enterprise and small business committee when it examines the annual Estimate and by the Committee of Public Accounts when dealing with the appropriation account or with other industrial development issues.  The agency programmes for the period are also set out in the national development plan and were thus adopted when the plan was approved.</P>
        <P>The amounts and thresholds proposed in this Bill will allow us to efficiently and effectively implement the principles, policy aims and programmes set out in the national development plan for the 2007 to 2013 period.  Whereas the provisions of this Bill are of a technical nature, they are important in that they facilitate implementation of the national development plan<i> </i>and the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal &mdash; Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.<i>  </i>Overall the Bill will allow the enterprise development agencies to continue to respond to the needs of industry, thereby adding to the policies aimed at increasing employment and reducing unemployment.</P>
        <P>The Irish economy is one of the most globalised in the world.  As a consequence, the global downturn created by the current international financial crisis has had a very significant impact.  We have seen significant job losses over the past 12 months as the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets leads to a significant contraction in global demand for goods and services.  The Irish economy is now expected by commentators to contract by about 6% in the course of 2009.</P>
        <P>It is inevitable that we will experience further job losses in the next 12 months.  My Department and its agencies have a vital part to play in ensuring the country is well positioned to progress when the global economy starts to pick up.  Although any job losses are deeply distressing for those concerned and are very regrettable, we still have an historically high number of people at work today compared to a decade ago, with over 2 million people working.  We are still creating high-value jobs across the economy, as evidenced by Hewlett Packard&rsquo;s recent announcement of its intention to create 500 jobs this year in an expansion of its plant at Leixlip, County Kildare, and plans to double the new jobs created with a further 500 positions over the coming two or three years.</P>
        <P>Despite the current global turbulence the Government is committed to maintaining and enhancing our framework competitive conditions and promoting new areas of competitive advantage, including by developing our research and development base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.  Over the period of the national development plan the Government will invest significantly to support the development of the indigenous and foreign direct investment enterprise base.</P>
        <P>Over recent years, economic growth in Ireland has been driven by domestic demand not by international  competitiveness.  As domestic demand has weakened we must look to exports for a sustained economic recovery.  Exporters are and will continue to be critical in the achievement of future economic stability and job maintenance and growth in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>A principal focus, therefore, is on supporting the growth of a cohort of Irish companies with the ambition, leadership and innovation necessary to achieve global scale.  To support industry and the economy as a whole, a targeted focus must be placed on sustaining and creating exports.  In directing this focus, the development agency Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated task force which is actively working to respond to the changed economic environment.  This will ensure that the supports offered to companies are the most relevant and effective in addressing the <Col N="898"/>current realities facing businesses across the manufacturing and internationally traded sectors throughout Ireland.  It is critical that we continue to invest in the companies upon which our economic recovery depends.</P>
        <P>To that end, an enterprise stabilisation fund was announced by the Taoiseach in early March.  This will allow for meaningful additional assistance to be provided to basically sound internationally traded companies that would otherwise struggle to survive the global downturn.  The fund will operate in conjunction with the banks and will supply direct financial support to eligible internationally trading enterprises which are undertaking development expenditure to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets.  The fund will complement the banks&rsquo; commitment to small and medium-sized enterprises under the recapitalisation scheme and should facilitate much of the restructuring needed for viable companies selling on the home market.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland client companies are estimated to have achieved exports gains of up to &euro;1 billion in 2008 despite the unprecedented global economic environment.  That this was achieved in the face of contracting international markets and a negative currency environment is a credit to the tenacity and resilience of those Irish companies that compete for and win new business overseas.  In the coming year, international sales will be hard won and it is innovation, quality and value that will set Irish companies apart from their international competitors.  Continuing focus and investment in these three areas will be crucial. Those companies that combine value-adding, innovative products and services with efficiency and productivity are the ones that will thrive in the face of the challenges of 2009.</P>
        <P>Irish companies continued to invest in research and development in 2008.  Strategic targets for the numbers of companies engaged in research and development projects involving investments of &euro;100,000 and &euro;2 million annually will be met or exceeded.  The year 2008 saw the biggest investments to date in research and development by large companies and a greater number of small companies engaged in high level research and development.</P>
        <P>Building competitiveness in existing industry has become a priority in the face of growing international competition.  The newly established &euro;60 million growth fund is designed to assist Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s small to medium-sized clients achieve greater competitiveness by improving their export potential.  This will be achieved by increasing gross output and productivity while also providing new employment or maintaining existing employment levels in clients throughout all counties.</P>
        <P>Job losses, precipitated by recent factors such as the global credit crunch and economic downturn, are a significant concern.  Job retention and creation is a priority for the Government and Enterprise Ireland.  The agency strives to retain and create jobs in existing companies by improving their competitiveness and access to overseas markets.  It focuses on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in setting up new high potential start-up companies.  Start-ups continued strongly in 2008, with 70 new high export growth potential companies established.  These were in sectors as diverse as life sciences, medical devices, software, services and food.</P>
        <P>With regard to foreign direct investment, the Industrial Development Agency Ireland has continued to be successful in attracting new investment to Ireland, even in the current economic climate.  In 2008, a total of 130 foreign direct investments projects were won, with new investment up 14% on 2007 and the number of new companies investing in Ireland for the first time up 16% on 2007.  There was a 22% increase in research and development and innovation projects, while the overall level of investment secured in 2008 was approximately &euro;2 billion.  More than 8,800 new jobs were created in a variety of sectors, across a range of skills and spread throughout the country.  Regrettably, however, 10,000 jobs were lost in the same period, <Col N="899"/>giving rise to a net loss in 2008 of 1,200 jobs.  Many of these job losses are due to the move from low value manufacturing and we are also seeing an increase in short-term working arising from the credit crunch, for example, in the motor components sector.  At the end of 2008, full-time employment in IDA Ireland-supported companies stood at 136,043.</P>
        <P>It is particularly encouraging to see many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies continue to invest in Ireland in areas such as high-end manufacturing, global services and research and development and innovation projects.  Leading companies investing in Ireland for the first time include GOA, a subsidiary of France Telecom, and Facebook in Dublin, Zimmer in Shannon, PPD in Athlone and Lancaster Laboratories in Dungarvan.  Existing IDA Ireland clients undertaking significant expansions in their manufacturing operations included Cook Medical in Limerick, Coca Cola in Wexford, Genzyme and TEVA in Waterford, Cameron in Longford and Microsemi in Ennis.  A strong growth in research and development and innovation investments included information and communications technology companies such as IBM, EMC, ON Semiconductor and Business Objects-SAP.  Life sciences companies such as Boston Scientific and a part of the Johnston &amp; Johnston company, the cosmetics company Oriflame and financial services companies Citi and Aon also made significant research and development and innovation investments.</P>
        <P>The global economic turmoil makes it difficult to predict the outcome for foreign direct investment in 2009.  Global foreign direct investment will decline and almost all economic commentators are predicting an extremely difficult year in 2009.  At the same time, it is important to recognise that even in turbulent economic times there is still foreign direct investment to be won and our competitors will not be slow in targeting opportunities.  Building on the successes achieved in 2008, IDA Ireland continues to see good opportunities for foreign direct investment and is confident that a number of key project announcements will be made over the next three to four months.</P>
        <P>Maintaining the competitiveness of the enterprise sector in Ireland is a priority issue for my Department and our development agencies.  In order to sustain and grow the enterprise sector, Irish-based enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and to continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.  Our comparative advantage will increasingly lie in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services.  With that in mind, a range of policies are being pursued to enhance competitiveness and improve the business environment for both manufacturing and services.</P>
        <P>Creating the best framework conditions to enable innovation to flourish, which in turn leads to increased productivity and competitiveness, will continue to guide our overall policy approach to tackling the competitiveness challenges ahead.  Current Government policy contains a range of commitments focused on maintaining and enhancing our framework competitive conditions, and promoting new areas of competitive advantage, including developing our research and development base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.</P>
        <P>The national development plan projects a total investment of over &euro;25 billion, with &euro;8.2 billion earmarked for delivery of the strategy for science, technology and innovation 2006 to 2013 to achieve our goal to become a leader in research and development and innovation.  A &euro;3.3 billion investment is proposed specifically to support the development of the indigenous and foreign direct investment enterprise base, while a &euro;13.7 billion investment is proposed on skills development.  Due to the current shortfall in Exchequer resources, the strategy for science, technology and innovation is now running at about &euro;160 million behind national development plan projections.  These reduced allocations will create challenges in ensuring that <Col N="900"/>the benefits arising from the strategy for science, technology and innovation are maximised.  The economic environment is more challenging than we have seen for many years.  However, the implementation of these strategies will ensure Ireland remains a key location for leading edge research and development and the quality jobs it can deliver.  Achieving higher growth rates in productivity than our competitor countries will be important for international competitiveness and securing sustainable wage growth.</P>
        <P>To underpin long-term competitiveness, the Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that we build up the productive capacity of the economy through investing in people.  We are doing this directly through the skills strategy.  We will continue to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and upskilling to improve labour market flexibility.  Where necessary, we will ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, should they need to find alternative employment.  Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability that are more technologically advanced and fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.</P>
        <P>Innovation, and the productivity gains that flow from it, are the foundations for maintaining competitiveness.  The enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department, Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, F&Aacute;S and the city and county enterprise boards, will continue to focus on productivity enhancing investments such as research and development, innovation, better use of information and communications technology, and training and management development.  The next few years can be seen as a period where we seek to reposition ourselves in terms of our national competitiveness and to place ourselves in the optimal position to benefit from an upturn in the international economy as well as from our longer-term investments.</P>
        <P>We must all realise that these are the most challenging of times for our economy.  It is, therefore, vital that the right mix of good macroeconomic and sound enterprise policies are in place to restore our public finances and confidence in our economy.  The Government is committed to taking the necessary difficult decisions over the next few weeks to ensure the economy overcomes the current challenges and is placed on a secure and more sustainable footing.  Through our pro-enterprise policies, ongoing investment in critical infrastructure under the national development plan, low taxes on business and workers, and our balanced regulatory regime, the Government is committed to ensuring that we continue to build an environment for enterprise that remains among the most favourable in the world.</P>
        <P>I will now summarise the main provisions of Bill, which will be examined in more detail on Committee Stage.  It is important, as I said at the outset, to stress that the changes proposed in this Bill are of a technical nature aimed at updating monetary limits in line with the policy already set for the period 2007-13.  They do not reflect a new policy direction.  Principles and policy for the period are set out in the national development plan and were discussed and approved at political level at that time.  They are also considered annually by the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business when it examines the annual Estimate and by the Committee of Public Accounts when dealing with the Appropriation Accounts or with other industrial development issues.  The agency programmes for the period are also set out in the national development plan and were thus adopted when the plan was approved.  The amounts and thresholds proposed in this Bill will allow us to efficiently and effectively implement the principles, policy aims and programmes set out in the national development plan for the 2007 to 2013 period.</P>
        <P>Section 1 sets out a number of definitions relating to specific terms used in the body of the Bill.  Section 2 makes arrangements for the transfer to Enterprise Ireland of shares currently held in 28 companies by Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  Up to 2007, <Col N="901"/>Shannon Development, in addition to its responsibilities in the Shannon free zone, provided various supports, including taking shares, to indigenous companies in the mid-west region.  Following a change in the Shannon Development mandate in 2007, Enterprise Ireland took over Shannon Development&rsquo;s responsibilities in regard to indigenous industry in the region.  Shannon Development holds shares in 28 client companies and it is now necessary to transfer ownership of this equity to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The majority of the 28 companies subject to the draft legislation are designated by the agencies as high potential start-up companies, HPSUs.  The flow of innovative HPSU companies into the economy is deemed critical to the future growth of the economy.  Taking shares in these companies is one of the methods used to provide financial support to them.  Due to the technicalities surrounding the transfer of shares by a shareholder to a third party, it was deemed necessary to enact legislation as the only practical means of effecting this transfer, and of substituting Enterprise Ireland for Shannon Development in the various shareholder agreements and other documents relating to those shares.  Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland are in agreement with this approach.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends the Industrial Development Act 1986 by increasing the thresholds above which Government approval is required on grants paid by the development agencies.  The grant instruments provided for in the 1986 Act which are updated are for use by the enterprise development agencies to support spending by individual industrial companies on building or extending factories, employing additional workers, training workers or carrying out research and development work.  It is important to note that the decision to award a grant and the amount of grant in each case is made by the board of the agency involved.  While the Government must approve larger grants before the agency can finalise the grant agreement with the company, it does not have power to initiate or increase the grant proposed.  The purpose of the requirement for Government approval is to allow Government to monitor the implementation of the scheme and to draw any appropriate conclusions on enterprise policy or on the scheme concerned rather than in respect of a particular case.</P>
        <P>Section 3 proposes an increase in the current thresholds above which Government approval is required from &euro;5 million to &euro;7.5 million in each of the following cases &mdash; employment grants to industry,<b> </b>training grants, power to purchase shares and total investment grants to one<b> </b>company.<b>  </b>I should mention at this point that for the sake of dealing with related provisions of the Bill together a similar threshold increase in respect of capital grants<b> </b>is contained in section 4(<i>b</i>).</P>
        <P>Previously, research and development grants of &euro;2.5 million or more to any one company had to be approved by Government.  The new threshold of &euro;7.5 million reflects the growing importance of research and development activities to the Irish economy and the fact that research and development grants above existing thresholds have become more commonplace.  This increase will ensure the correct number of research and development grants are subject to Government approval.  Research and development grants above the threshold are now quite common and it is considered appropriate to apply the same threshold as applies to other similar types of grant.</P>
        <P>Research and development grants provided by enterprise development agencies to their clients are now a key component of the strategic objective of encouraging companies to move up the value chain.  Such grants help to embed overseas companies in Ireland, thus helping to ensure their long-term survival and growth in Ireland.  They also serve to increase the strategic importance of the Irish operation within the parent group.  When making investment grants, namely, grants towards the cost of building or extending a factory, the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland often use a number of the above grant types in combination, namely, capital and employment grants.  The 1986 Act also contains an aggregate threshold for <Col N="902"/>Government approval<b> </b>in such circumstances, which it is now proposed to amend by substituting &euro;15 million for &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>On resolution of an anomaly in a BMW region by extending the designated areas, the relevant subsection addresses an anomaly that has arisen regarding grants to small companies<i> </i>in parts of the BMW, Border, midland and western, region.  It extends the designated areas in the BMW region to the entire region by adding the counties of Laois, Louth, Westmeath and most of Offaly, which up to now have not been designated areas.  The 1986 Act provides that the maximum capital grant that can be given to a company outside the designated area is 45% of the cost of the assets.  The counties of Laois, Louth, Westmeath and Offaly, apart from the townland of Derrinlough, are not designated areas as defined in the 1986 Act but are in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Under EU state aid law and the Regional Aid Map for Ireland for 2007-2013 approved by the European Commission in 2006, the maximum grant rates for capital assets varies between 0% and 50% depending on the size of the company and the region of the country in which its undertaking is situated.  EU state aid rules permit capital grants for small companies<i> </i>in the BMW region of up to 50% of the cost of the assets.  As a consequence, although EU rules would permit capital grants of up to 50% in these counties, national legislation limits the maximum grant to 45%.  The proposed amendment is to deal with this anomaly and to ensure that small companies in these counties obtain the same treatment as small companies in the remainder of the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Section 4 proposes two amendments to the Industrial Development Act 1993, namely, increasing aggregate grant limits and, increasing the threshold for capital grants referred to earlier under section 3.  This section of the Bill amends the Industrial Development Act 1993 by increasing the existing legislative limit on the aggregate amount of money which can be paid by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Forf&aacute;s and its agencies, Enterprise Ireland, Industrial Development Agency and Science Foundation Ireland for use in discharging their obligations and liabilities.  This increase is necessary because expenditure to date is now nearing the existing statutory limit set in 2003 at &euro;3.4 billion.  It is proposed to increase the limit to &euro;7 billion to bring it into line with spending proposed in the national development plan up to 2013.</P>
        <P>It has been the practice that aggregate spending for these purposes is capped in legislation at a level which is raised from time to time to allow the agencies&rsquo; operations to continue.  The cap ensures that the Houses of the Oireachtas have an opportunity to review policy and spending on industrial promotion.  However, there are also other legislative controls, including the upper limits on individual grants to companies approved at agency level and these are addressed in section 3.  Also, there are further Oireachtas controls, such as the annual Estimates process and the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the Estimates process, the D&aacute;il takes decisions which determine the annual allocation of money to the agencies for the purposes covered by the longer-term legislative aggregate limit set in this section.  In setting this higher aggregate there is no irrevocable commitment that the money will actually be paid to the agencies.  Legislative clearance for aggregate payments up to the level of &pound;7 billion is proposed but annual spending under these headings will still have to be agreed by the Government and voted by the D&aacute;il.  The aggregate grant limit of &euro;3.4 billion currently in place will be reached in April of this year.  It is expected that the new ceiling will be reached in four to five years time on the basis of the programmes in the national development plan.</P>
        <P>Section 19(1) of the Industrial Research and Standards Act 1961 provides that any discoveries-inventions resulting from research carried out by or on behalf of Eolas, Forbairt, Forf&aacute;s and Enterprise Ireland and the Institute for Industrial Research Standards are the property of <Col N="903"/>the Minister.  There are a small number of cases where patents arising from research covered by section 19 were applied for by the agencies and were granted in the names of the agencies rather than in the name of the Minister.  A number of such patent applications are still pending.  Some of these applications-patents and associated intellectual property rights, also covered by section 19, have been licensed to Irish companies carrying out further research based on the applications-patents.  It may create a serious problem for these companies if their title to any new intellectual property rights subsequently developed is shown to be defective.  In some cases, the Irish companies have sub-licensed aspects of the intellectual property rights to other companies.  In most of these cases the licensee will have relied on a warranty that the licensor had good title to the rights being licensed.</P>
        <P>While the provisions of this Bill are of a technical nature overall they will allow the development agencies to respond to the needs of industry, thereby supporting employment and reducing unemployment.  These provisions are important in that they facilitate implementation of the national development plan and the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal &mdash; Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>First, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party I would like to confirm that we will be supporting the Bill.  Obviously, we understand the necessity for the Bill to be concluded by the middle to end of April.  The Minister of State can be assured of our co-operation in dealing with this Bill in the Chamber and on Committee Stage which I understand is scheduled for 1 April 2009.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned in his contribution that the Bill includes a number of different sections and is, in many ways, a composite Bill dealing with various issues.  I have just realised a further section was inserted in the Seanad.  I was not aware of that until now.  Section 2 deals with the transfer of shares from Enterprise Ireland to Shannon Development.  This reflects the changing role of Shannon Development and the manner in which the enterprise functions of same have been passed over to Enterprise Ireland.  Obviously, it makes sense that those shares be transferred from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.  However, this raises questions as to the Government&rsquo;s intentions for Shannon Development as its enterprise and other functions are removed.</P>
        <P>Section 3 relates to the raising of limits on grants from &euro;5 million to &euro;7.5 million without Government approval.  As time goes on it will be necessary to raise thresholds.  Even in a period of deflation it may be necessary to raise thresholds.  It seems a little unusual that this Bill proposes to raise to &euro;7.5 million the threshold above which Government approval is needed for a grant.  It seems that thresholds are being lowered in all other areas of government, in light of the current budgetary situation.  The level of expenditure that can be approved by a local authority has decreased significantly.  My own local authority has been told it cannot approve projects of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;500,000 under the parks improvement or capital works programmes without Government approval.  At the same time, this House is being asked to pass legislation in another area that will raise a threshold from &euro;5 million to &euro;7.5 million.</P>
        <P>When a few years have passed, and we learn more about the grants that will have been awarded by State agencies without Government oversight, I hope we will not regret the decision to raise this threshold.  When that time comes, I am sure Ministers will use the excuse that the awarding of the grant was an operational matter for the agency in question.  They will <Col N="904"/>say they could not have made an input into the process because the amount of the grant was below the threshold set out in the relevant legislation.  If a lower threshold &mdash; perhaps &euro;1 million &mdash; had applied to F&Aacute;S, millions of euro would not have been spent as they were on Jobs Ireland and Opportunities Ireland.  At the very least, Ministers should have had to take responsibility for how millions of euro in taxes were spent in their own Departments.</P>
        <P>The section of the Bill dealing with designated areas seems to recognise the existence of the BMW region in a coherent manner.  It is obvious that the Industrial Development Act 1986 predated the development of the regional structure.  This legislation refers to the entire BMW region as a single designated area, which makes sense to me.</P>
        <P>This legislation provides for an increase from &euro;3.4 billion to &euro;7 billion in the amount the Minister can allocate to certain agencies.  I am not sure that it is necessary to have an overall limit of that nature.  We do not set overall limits in other areas.  For example, we do not limit overall health spending or overall spending under the capital transport budget.  Expenditure in certain areas can continue to increase as the years go by without recourse to this Chamber.  Legislation of this kind would not be needed to spend a further &euro;40 billion on social welfare or a further &euro;12 billion on roads.  I suppose it is appropriate for the D&aacute;il, from time to time, to consider how money is being spent.  The amount of money paid in grants should not be allowed to increase without some form of parliamentary review.  I suppose the flaw in our system is that it does not facilitate proper oversight of the manner in which grants are paid.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas committee system has been much maligned, largely because of the payments that are made to Chairmen and Vice Chairmen, etc.  While such criticism is legitimate, there is a definite role for Oireachtas committees.  They do not have enough power to scrutinise the overall and day to day operation of State agencies.  Parliament would work much better if it could examine how grants are paid to businesses and how they are spent.  For example, we should take an interest in the manner in which equity investments are taken up by Enterprise Ireland and, in particular, the success of such investments.  We get annual reports from the agency.  In most years, representatives of the agency attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  As a Parliament, however, we have not forensically scrutinised the manner in which the &euro;3.4 billion fund has been spent over the years.  We do not know whether it has been spent wisely and fully in the interests of the public.  That is not a criticism of the Government as much as a criticism of our political system.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate to refer to the role of the State agencies in promoting industry.  As I have said, the future role of Shannon Development is increasingly unclear to me.  What are the Government&rsquo;s intentions in respect of Shannon Development?  I would be interested to hear a little more about that later in the debate on this Bill.</P>
        <P>The role of Enterprise Ireland has largely been to promote high potential start-up companies and export companies with significant potential.  When it comes to supporting businesses, there is a definite gap between the work of the country enterprise boards and the work of Enterprise Ireland.  A question can reasonably be asked about the return we get from the money that is invested in Enterprise Ireland.  The return we get from the money we invest in IDA Ireland, as an agency, is clear.  I have yet to see a clear summary of the benefits to the taxpayer, and to the economy as a whole, of the operation of Enterprise Ireland.  Of course there are some examples of successful companies that have been supported by Enterprise Ireland.  I have not seen a convincing academic analysis to the effect that such companies would not have succeeded anyway.  Can we be sure that the &euro;150 million that is spent on Enterprise Ireland every year produces public goods worth &euro;150 million for our people?  Members will be aware that just &euro;50 million of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;150 million budget is spent on business supports.  The remaining &euro;100 million is spent on the agency itself, for example on its training activities.  I <Col N="905"/>have yet to see a convincing peer-reviewed academic analysis of the value of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work, much of which is duplicated by a plethora of other agencies that offer similar supports.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I worked out how much it would cost to support all new Irish start-up companies, regardless of whether they are export businesses or high-potential companies, by exempting them from rates for three years and giving them half-price electricity, water and utilities.  I was working on the basis that at a time like this, when many people have no option other than to set up their own businesses, we should give support of this nature to all start-up companies across the board.  I estimate that it would cost between &euro;25 million and &euro;30 million per annum, or one fifth of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s budget, to provide such support.  I wonder whether it is time for some new thinking in this regard.  Rather than being fixated with high potential start-up companies, export potential and the knowledge economy, perhaps we should consider what the Government can do to support all businesses, from start-up newsagents to companies manufacturing medical devices.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has been considering the future of the county enterprise boards as it reflects on where the economy is going.  Our new policy on the future of semi-State companies is being launched in the Merrion Hotel as we speak.  When my party was in power in the early years of the State, one of the first things it did was to understand that the State has a role in providing an impetus for growth.  We established a number of State companies, including the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, which became agents for growth and development.  Many of the semi-State companies in question have outlived their usefulness.  Fine Gael is proposing today that the existing cohort of State-sponsored bodies be reinvented and that a new group of such bodies be established.  We are proposing that Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte be merged and that the new company be transformed into a bioenergy company, essentially to grow bio-fuel on the bogs.  We are suggesting that the turf power stations in the midlands could be transformed into biomass power stations.  We are essentially advocating the transformation of the old semi-State companies into companies that are more appropriate for modern times.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is also proposing the establishment of a new Irish broadband company, essentially to take over the role that has been abdicated by Eircom.  Such a company could be funded in many ways.  It could be partially funded from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, but also from the privatisation of some of the older companies that no longer necessarily need to be in State ownership.  The most obvious example of such a company is ESB International &mdash; the State gains no particular benefit from its ownership of a company that does not even operate in Ireland.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is another company that could be considered in this context.  My party&rsquo;s idea is to transform some of the old semi-State companies, which have served a role in the past, into new State companies that can provide the kind of industrial infrastructure we need for the future.  I refer to infrastructure like alternative energy facilities and a next-generation broadband network.  This visionary idea will stimulate a great deal of debate.  I hope the press conference is going well.  I should be there, but I am not.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about competitiveness.  The State&rsquo;s entire industrial policy is designed to promote enterprise, industry and competitiveness.  The State agencies have an important role in attracting investment into the State, in the case of IDA Ireland; developing new Irish companies with export potential, in the case of Enterprise Ireland; and improving skills and providing training, in the case of F&Aacute;S and Skillnets.  We should consider how the State can do more to assist industry and business.  State supports, whether provided by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the country enterprise boards, F&Aacute;S or Skillnets, do not in themselves foster a pro-business and pro-enterprise environment.  To develop such an environment, one has to get the fundamentals right.  I have yet to see any sign that the Government plans to get the fundamentals of this economy right.  While it seems that the Government is starting to take <Col N="906"/>action in respect of the public finances, at long last, action is also needed to make Ireland competitive again.</P>
        <P>One can provide as many subsidies to businesses as one likes.  It is easy to forget that State agencies like Bord Bia and Bord F&aacute;ilte are in the business of providing State subsidies.  These are all State subsidies.  This is public money being given to the enterprise and business sector.  Of course, it is appropriate to do that, but none of that will work if one does not have a fundamentally pro-enterprise and pro-business environment in the country in the first place.  What is missing from the Government is a much more comprehensive strategy as to how it will restore competitiveness and make Ireland competitive again.  The Government will not get value for that money if the fundamentals of the economy are not right and the country is not competitive.  Part of that, of course, is a matter of bringing our infrastructure up to 21st century standard and the Fine Gael Party has proposed ways to do that.  The second part is bringing down costs.  These are matters from which we cannot run away anymore.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council identified the three key costs concerns as being property, utility and services.  Property costs are certainly coming down &mdash; there is no question about that &mdash; but they need to come down further.  We also need to take a tougher line, particularly on rents and the provision in contracts that allow for only upward rent reviews, which in my view should be outlawed.  Utility costs are not coming down and that is largely due to a failure of the Government&rsquo;s regulatory system.  ESB prices have come down 10%, but they went up 30% as well.  The same applies with gas.  There has been a real failure of Government and regulation in that regard.</P>
        <P>One obvious step would be to essentially throw out the regulatory system and set a new benchmark.  The Minister should state that within two years we will bring down gas and electricity prices to the EU average and, essentially, demand of ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, both of which are State assets, that they bring down their prices to those levels.  Of course, these companies will argue that it will bankrupt them but it will not &mdash; they will just have to reform and modernise.</P>
        <P>Another area is Government charges which continue to rise.  Rates continue to rise.  Water charges continue to rise.  A much heavier burden of regulation on smaller businesses continues even though there has been a failure to regulate large ones such as the banks.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The final area is labour costs.  We are starting to see labour costs come under control across the economy, but there is no clear plan to do that.  One option that could be useful in the talks which will resume with the social partners is, on the private sector side, to replace the concept for the time being of pay increases based merely on a percentage of salary and move towards a system of pay increases that are essentially profit sharing or employee dividends.  This would involve saying to private sector companies which are making a profit and could afford to give their employees more money, that they should do so under a profit-sharing system, for example, a person could receive a pay increase of between 3% and 5% depending on the profits of the company.  That is a matter that should be considered in the talks.</P>
        <P>As I stated, Fine Gael is happy to support the Bill and I look forward to its speedy passage.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Albeit fairly technical, the Bill deals with the system of supports and incentives that have been fundamental to our industrial development over the years and that, hopefully, will be in the future.</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, that there is and always will be a certain tension between the need for oversight by Government, because we are raising spending thresholds, <Col N="907"/>and the need to allow the agencies flexibility to be able to respond to changing situations.  My concern is that viable projects will come forward that will be able to avail of the higher thresholds, a concern which I am sure many of us share.</P>
        <P>When the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, introduced this Bill in the Seanad she stated that to sustain and grow the enterprise sector, Irish based enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added activities and to continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation, and our comparative advantage will increasingly lie in the production of knowledge intensive industries.  I refer to my brief, tourism, because in no sector is it more true than in tourism that we need to move up the value chain.  This industry is the largest employer in the country, a fact often forgotten, but it contributes only between 3% and 4% to GDP.  It should be a net export service industry but since 2003 income from tourists is less than Irish tourist expenditure abroad.</P>
        <P>In the tourism industry, we need to become much smarter in what we offer and in how we market and deliver the product.  We are simply not getting the contribution from tourism we should in terms of bang for our buck.  We need to not only reduce costs  to attract more visitors, which of course will be a considerable challenge when the tourist market is contracting anyway, but also to add value to the product so that we become a quality destination selling what is a unique holiday and experience for which visitors are willing to pay more.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A value-for-money holiday does not necessarily mean a cheap holiday.  We need to move from providing the sliced pan of holidays to the black olive <i>focaccia</i> of holidays.  Of course, we need the cheap holidays but we also need to move up the value chain if we are to provide quality jobs in the future and if tourism is to become a net contributor to the Irish economy.  As has been stated on many occasions by Ministers, the future impetus for growth, if we are to ever have growth again, will come from the services sector generally.  I often wonder has the Government forgotten that tourism is a service industry giving more employment, as I stated, than any other indigenous industry.  I recently read the Government strategy for services, &ldquo;Catching the Wave&rdquo;, in which tourism hardly got a mention.  I appreciate that the Minister promoting this Bill is not responsible directly for tourism, but she is responsible for employment and for enterprise.  It is not often there is an industry that gives us the opportunity to import new taxpayers, which tourism does, and it is certainly not a gift horse that we should be looking in the mouth.</P>
        <P>The time has come to look again at the structure of State agencies which support the tourism industry.  The current structures lack leadership and cohesion, both of which are vital to an industry which is intrinsically fragmented.  I appreciate the provenance and the motivation behind the separation of the marketing and product development agencies, Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but this arrangement is not serving us as well as a single agency could.  When one adds Shannon Development and Dublin Tourism, not to mention the five regional bodies, it is not possible to have the unity of purpose and single-minded focus which is badly needed.  We must consider if our interests might be better served through a single agency.</P>
        <P>The regional divide, let us face it, is not being closed; it is widening.  Ever fewer tourists and jobs are going west and the economic viability of Shannon Airport is now very much in question.  It is difficult to believe that we are getting the optimal use of funds when there is such a fragmented approach. It is accepted that the region&rsquo;s indigenous manufacturing industries &mdash; this is what the Bill is about &mdash; formerly under the remit of Shannon Development would be better served by the backing of a single nationwide large enterprise body such as Enterprise Ireland and the same sort of move to a single agency would offer similar benefits to the region&rsquo;s <Col N="908"/>tourism industry.  Somebody must be in charge of the multifaceted problems of regional tourism and a body needs to take responsibility.</P>
        <P>This Bill&rsquo;s purpose, technical as it is, aims to equip the State to deal with rapidly changing situations and emerging economic problems, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment must be the spearhead of meeting those challenges and, crucially, of trying to stem the flow of jobs out of the country.  I am increasingly of the view that responsibility for tourism should be within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Somewhere along the way sight has been lost of the fact that this industry is our biggest provider of jobs, and being amalgamated with arts and sport contributes to that view.  Arts and sport  are significant contributors to tourism and they have a significant job content, but State support for them is motivated not solely by commercial or economic considerations but because of their intrinsic value.  We must increase our support for arts and sport and aim to widen participation, but the reality is the policies and the skill sets required to do that are wholly different from those required to produce and sell a modern tourism product.</P>
        <P>In this Bill the level of supports, which reflect European policy as much as our own, are much larger in the BMW region for the good reason that is where industry and jobs are most needed, but it is also where the tourism jobs are most needed.  It is also where there is the greatest potential for expansion.  We already have the basic infrastructure in our natural environment and in recent years there has been great investment in the built environment.  The sight of hotels and restaurants closing around the country, perhaps never to be revived, is tragic and unnecessary.</P>
        <P>I fully support the concept of the State taking shares in high-potential start-up companies and I support increasing the thresholds above which direct Government approval is required by State agencies.  It makes sense that the Cabinet should not have to bother itself except with the larger, more strategic projects and that the grant-aiding agencies such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland should be able to get on with the bulk of such decisions.  Like my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, I find it ironic that we are legislating for this provision today while every other agency in the State, the local authorities, the NRA, Departments, including the Department of Education and Science, as I read in today&rsquo;s newspaper, must get direct approval from the Department of Finance before they can spend virtually anything.  One wonders what that will do to the Department of Finance in terms of clogging up its workload.  If any Department has enough to do, it is the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The thresholds for individual research and development grants are to be raised by up to &euro;7.5 million, representing a trebling of investment.  This is highly desirable and is exactly the kind of business we must chase.  If we get it, it is the kind of business most likely to stay.  Companies involved in research and development are inclined to cluster so there is great potential for us to build on some early successes we have had.  We are already beginning to make a name for ourselves in medical and health technology.  The Bill updates a number of monetary thresholds.  That is its primary purpose, as well as transferring the shares to Enterprise Ireland.  Although the Minister says it does not reflects a change in policy direction, it underpins such a change.  It reflect the fact that we no longer assume we will chase after inward investment on the basis that any job is worth chasing.  We have to target jobs that are higher up the value chain and sustainable.  IDA Ireland and other agencies appreciate that.</P>
        <P>It will take more than generous grants to make Ireland an innovation and knowledge-driven economy.  We must raise the standards in our universities and there is much discussion on that area.  Crucially, we must invest in our schools, and even in preschools, particularly in science and maths teaching for boys and girls.  It is particularly worrying that the numbers choosing the maths and science subjects are still falling because we will never build a smart economy if <Col N="909"/>children do not take up these subjects.  Education is fundamental to a research and development economy.  We cannot begin by giving training grants at company level, welcome as they are.  The kind of training we need for the future must begin in the teacher training colleges and our primary schools.</P>

	<P>I am a late substitute for my colleague, Deputy Penrose.  In the short time I have had to examine the Bill, it seems it is not one of very great moment.  It seems merely to give legislative underpinning to a decision that has already been taken on the change of mandate for SFADCo and a few related technical matters including the raising of the grant thresholds, the bringing of the BMW region into more consistent formation and so on.  However, this debate also provides an opportunity to point out that the weakness of the indigenous sector in Ireland is again highlighted in the present crisis.</P>
        <P>All the reports from Telesis right up to Ahead of the Curve have highlighted the weaknesses in the indigenous sector and that is nowhere more evident than in the Shannon region.  If a major multinational withdraws there is still devastation for the region.  We recently saw the incredible damage the decision by Dell has done to employment there.  Notwithstanding this being identified back in the 1980s by the Telesis report and a number of reports since then, including the Culliton report and Ahead of the Curve, we still have not managed to build an indigenous sector in this country that one would expect in a modern, European state that has been in the business of industrialisation, albeit coming to it late, for a number of decades.</P>
        <P>SFADCo was the first and only attempt at regional development in Ireland.  Although there were costs associated with it, it has made a valuable contribution.  It probably makes sense to give Enterprise Ireland the role on indigenous industry in that region.  Over the years SFADCo went through many changes of mandate and remit and this is only the latest one.  The inherent tardiness in our being able to construct a vibrant indigenous sector is still at issue.  The Minister of State said the Bill has the support of Enterprise Ireland and SFADCo, therefore I presume that it is no longer an issue in the region.  The question is how we make it work.</P>
        <P>I have no great issue with the structures and changes set out.  However a number of issues arise from what the Minister of State has said.  Do we, as he says, have more than 2 million people in work, or has that information come from the word processor before Christmas and does it need to be updated?  Has the enterprise stabilisation fund made available any grants yet?  Is it operable?  The Minister of State claimed the fund will complement the banks&rsquo; commitment to small and medium sized enterprises under the recapitalisation scheme and should facilitate much of the restructuring that is needed for viable companies selling on the home market.  I wonder to what extent the Minister of State and the Department are fooling themselves that SMEs are getting reasonable access to credit lines from the banks.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State cannot construct a position on the basis of anecdotal evidence but some of it is very worrying.  This week I have been dealing with a small company involved in energy-efficient public lighting and which won two significant contracts, as close to blue-chip contracts as one can get, and intended to employ four more people.  However, it required credit of &euro;30,000 for four weeks and was refused by Bank of Ireland.  That is not the only case I have come across, and colleagues on all sides of the House have had similar experiences.  I do not purport to know everything in all these cases about what might be in the bank files and I acknowledge other considerations must be taken into account but it is disturbing when one sees testimonials to quality and evidence of the contracts, some of which are significant, that <Col N="910"/>small amounts still cannot be accessed by companies such as this, as well as the implications that will have for us in the worsening employment climate.</P>
        <P>When he replies I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on the claim that client companies of Enterprise Ireland, EI, chalked up additional export gains of &euro;1 billion in 2008.  We are in the hole we are in not only because revenues from the construction sector have fallen out of the system, but because of what has happened to exports for more than five years.  When the Minister of State refers to &ldquo;export gains&rdquo;, does he mean additional value in excess of the  &euro;1 billion in 2008?</P>
        <P>On the question of his canter over the global economic turmoil and his somewhat tentative confidence that &ldquo;a number of key projects will be announced by the IDA in the coming three or four months&rdquo;, he seems to suggest that the pipeline has dried up and 2009 will be a particularly baleful year, as many of us have anticipated.  I would like him to address this when he replies.  He might also take time out to give me the Ladybird guide to the difference between the growth fund and the new stabilisation fund to which he referred because I am not as familiar with this area as I used to be.  I am not sure I understand the difference.  The latter fund seems to be intended to assist client companies of EI that win export contracts but I do not know if that is the difference between them.</P>
        <P>Several times in his contribution, the Minister of State referred to the investment, changes and developments that have happened in research and development in recent years.  Research and development helps to anchor companies in the State, which is a valuable and important policy objective.  I published the first White Paper ever on science, technology and innovation in 1996.  With all due respect to my colleagues at the time, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Opposition of the day, the amount of attention given to innovation in those days politically or administratively was thin.  I welcome what has happened in the interim, particularly the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland, the development of PRTLI, the significance attached to research in our universities and so on.  However, what assessment has been conducted over the years of the net value in terms of commercialisation and job creation arising from the significant investment in research?  I do not know off the top of my head of any academic assessment of the value for money we are achieving in this area.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because of the focus currently on the initiative by Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Dublin, and their new alliance.  I welcome the direction in which the initiative is going but I am not sure having read reports of the announcement that there is anything new in the initiative other than the co-operation between the two universities but perhaps there is.  I was struck that 30,000 jobs were promised in the announcement, although the statement issued subsequently referred to &ldquo;up to 300 companies and thousands of smart economy-based jobs&rdquo;.  The reference to 30,000 jobs is not in the statement.  I wonder if there is a reason behind that.</P>
        <P>I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday written by Dr. John Scanlan, who is described as &ldquo;the Director of the commercialisation office at NUI Maynooth&rdquo;.  The article is relevant to the Bill and to the role that will be given to EI in respect of the Shannon region.  Essentially, he called for commercialisation to be put on a par with research.  That gear shift is necessary in policy making in this area.  He outlined the mission of SFI, which it was founded in 2000 with the aim of &ldquo;helping build in Ireland research of globally recognised excellence and nationally significant economic importance&rdquo;.  He stated the universities have tended to do quite well with the first part of the remit but perhaps less well with the second part.  He said traditionally it &ldquo;was not seen as their role to commercialise that research or to work with companies&rdquo;.</P><Col N="911"/>
        <P Just="Left">The two university heads referred to the new enterprise corridor between UCD and TCD and the State investing &euro;650 million but I do not know what element will be provided by the private sector.  In any event, it will be a significant investment of public money.  We need to be assured that we are moving in the direction of putting commercialisation on a par with research.  There must be a drive in innovation and commercialisation of research to ensure investment is turned into jobs, ultimately, and that is the purpose of the investment.  I would welcome the alliance that the two universities have announced if it is a statement of a move towards funding universities directly to engage in commercialisation.  It is overdue.  Some of the institutes of technology, the former regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, also do valuable work in this area.  I am not exactly sure where the new alliance was born.  It appears to be less a creation of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or her Department than of the Department of the Taoiseach.  I presume there are good reasons for that.  It is important to get a grip on how we get best value for the significant sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money we are spending in this area, how the investment in research is commercialised to create jobs, how to spread the money and assess it, what oversight mechanisms are in place and so on.</P>
        <P>Dr. Scanlan says that our total research expenditure for 2009 will be approximately &euro;500 million.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, spent approximately &euro;800 million on research in 2008, setting up 20 new companies.  We could spin out companies at the rate of one per &euro;20 million compared to MIT at one per &euro;40 million.  We all hope that one of the companies spun out will be another Iona Technologies, which came from Trinity College, or another Google, which came from Stanford, both of which Dr. Scanlan mentions.  That happens, however, at best once in a decade.  This investment will spawn more conventional small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, but is no less important for that and if we get a new Iona or international company, so much the better.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State tell us in his reply what role he envisages for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, SFADCo?  Has the enterprise stabilisation fund paid out any grants and, if not, when does it intend to commence doing so?  Are the export gains a net addition to exports in the previous year, which is a meaning one could take from the Minister of State&rsquo;s script?  The Labour Party will support the principle of the Bill although there may be some technical matters to discuss on Committee Stage.  Deputy Varadkar made a reasonable point in focusing on the conflict between the project size and approval mandated for some other State agencies and the arrangements we are making here.  It has always been accepted, however, in Irish governance that when IDA Ireland comes calling, it gets what it wants.  I suppose that, to some degree, is because it has performed well on behalf of the State, but oversight is no less important.</P>
        <P>The point about committees is also well made.  The raging fury manufactured outside the House about committees has nothing to do with the number of committees.  Our friends in the media would be quite happy to see 166 committees here provided the chairperson did not receive a stipend.  That is the problem.  The mock fury about how many committees there are in the House is manufactured indignation.  We need committees that are properly resourced and do their job.  Never has that been more relevant than in this case and science investment in particular.  People ought to be informed and skilled to do their jobs.  In a House of 166 Members, it is probably the case that there are too many committees, but we could focus and resource them better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte and the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  We broadly welcome this Bill and recognise that it is largely a technical one to give effect to decisions already made.  I welcome the increase in the grant threshold which is more practical and realistic than the previous one.  We will support that provision.  Another important <Col N="912"/>provision is the proper designation at long last of Louth, Laois-Offaly and Westmeath as part of the Border Midlands and Western, BMW, region.  We have been regarded as part of that area for some time but I welcome its formal designation in this Bill. </P>
        <P>I hope the Bill will bring recognition to indigenous enterprise and enhance the Government&rsquo;s view of that sector because successive Governments made a mistake in not dealing more with it.  The construction sector was the be all and end all.  It has been an important part of the economy for more than a decade, but it is unfortunate that it was allowed to run riot.  I do not want to accuse the Government of ignoring the indigenous sector because that is not strictly true.  Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S have offered substantial support to that sector but, unfortunately, not enough.  Many indigenous enterprises are owner-managed and often the owner-manager is so busy trying to keep up with day-to-day activity that the notion of innovation does not arise because he or she has no time to pay attention to that important element of enterprise.  I know of several indigenous enterprises that operate within the confines of the State and believe that many of them have an export capacity but cannot set their sights in that direction.</P>
        <P>It is more than a coincidence that our two biggest export markets, Britain and America, are English-speaking countries.  That suggests that language is an issue for indigenous enterprise trying to get into the export market.  While I am aware that embassies are diplomatic rather than enterprise entities, although I am sure they report on what is happening in their respective locations, would the Government consider using the embassies to support indigenous enterprise?  I know they have other important responsibilities but an office could be allocated within the embassy to assist indigenous enterprise with, for example, translation.  Another important element would be if embassies were to assist entrepreneurs with information on local regulatory regimes concerning taxation or legal issues that might arise from the Irish enterprise engaging in their respective states.  Such assistance might cost little and would allow significant additional movement by Irish enterprises seeking to gain some of the edge in export.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to find an international customer for anything at present, given the credit crunch, the depression and the lack of economic activity but sometimes that is the best time to get in and get going.  Doing so might enable businesses to get in on a lower threshold, get started and prepare themselves for the upturn when it comes.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised the issue of credit to enterprise.  That has virtually dried up and there are businesses such as small supermarkets that are finding it difficult to stock their shelves because of lack of credit and difficulty with turnover.  The banks are not playing ball.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not playing ball with small and medium-sized enterprises.  People are being laid off needlessly from those enterprises.  I appreciate that capitalisation has come into place only recently but there is no sign yet of that credit squeeze being unplugged and capitalisation flowing out to business.  It has not happened to any of the people who have been talking to me about the difficulties they are experiencing.  The Government must be more proactive in ensuring the banks get the finger out and deal with this issue once and for all.</P>
        <P>A previous speaker, perhaps Deputy Mitchell, referred to the one-stop shop in respect of assistance for indigenous enterprise and entrepreneurs.  I raised this matter more than a year ago because I see a significant gap here.  If a person is even considering starting a business, he or she might go to the country or city enterprise board and have a chat.  Often that person is directed to F&Aacute;S, because a training element might be necessary and, by and large, is given the runaround.</P><Col N="913"/>
        <P>Recently, I came across a businessman who employs seven people.  He is an very enterprising man, has built a very solid business in a five-year period and now has the prospect of doubling his workforce.  He was told by Enterprise Ireland that it could not deal with him because he has only seven employees and its threshold is ten or more.  I had to intervene and point out that if a person from China or Germany turned up with seven employees, wishing to extend within that threshold in a couple of months, that person would get assistance.  However, because this man happens to be Irish he does not get the golden glove treatment some others get.  I am not opposed to such people getting golden glove treatment as long as they produce the goods but our indigenous entrepreneurs and business should get the same.  The Government must direct significant additional focus in that area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad this Bill is being introduced because although it is purely technical in nature, as the Minister pointed out, it gives us an opportunity to discuss various business matters.  The Minister himself did so as did several speakers and that, in itself, is important.</P>
        <P>I also welcome that the anomaly regarding grants to small companies in parts of the Border, midland and western, BMW, region has been dealt with by the inclusion of counties Laois, Louth, Westmeath and most of Offaly as designated areas in that region.   I am particularly glad to see County Westmeath included.</P>
        <P>The Bill shows that various fundings are available now for small companies, or companies geared towards export.  That is all very well and admirable but I wish to take up a point mentioned by Deputy Morgan.  There are very many small companies for which banks are not loosening their purse strings.  People say that politicians do not know what is happening on the ground but we do.  Not a Saturday goes by without two or three such companies approaching me.  They outline their business which might employ three to five people, is thriving reasonably but needs to get cash to advance.  I have a particular business in mind.  The owner, a haulage contractor, was subcontracted by a major haulage contractor to make deliveries to all ten Dunnes Stores outlets in the midlands region.  The moneys for the work he is doing will come in during mid-April when he will start to get regular payments from the main contractor.  However, he must exist until then and the banks have said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  To carry him from now until mid-April he needs a small amount of bridging money similar to what one gets when buying a house.  He has supplied all the accounts, letters from his main contractor, letters from Dunnes Stores, yet he cannot get the bridging finance to enable him to continue.  It is a good little industry.  He employs some people, works hard himself, drives his trucks day and night.  He is at his wits&rsquo; end.</P>
        <P>We were told that the scales had fallen from the banks&rsquo; eyes but they have been clipped firmly onto their eyes.  Recapitalisation has not oiled the purse strings of the banks.  Frankly, I am amazed that despite the fact that one speaks up, makes a case for them and goes to the next layer of accountability, the answer is still &ldquo;no, no, no&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is another instance of a small joinery works which is doing fine.  It may not export but works within its own area of expertise.  It, too, needs some bridging finance to continue.  I do not take up lame ducks because there is no point in doing so as one only wears oneself out.  If one sizes up a situation, sees the books and talks to the people one can recognise who has a chance.  It is those who have a chance for whom I have made representations.  I am dismayed to find they are neither listened to nor heeded.</P>
        <P>People listen to the Taoiseach and other worthy people saying there are funds of &euro;100 million and &euro;50 million, this fund and that one.  When statements are made it appears there are funds but when a business tries to avail of a fund it cannot do so.  That is of considerable interest and <Col N="914"/>is a matter that IDA and Enterprise Ireland should examine.  I shall talk presently about those two bodies.</P>
        <P>I wish there were the same emphasis on retaining jobs as there is on the sexy talk of new jobs.  Of course, it is great when we get new jobs.  In Athlone we have been fortunate to have a most active IDA regional office with most active personnel in it who work day and night to bring in new firms.  One of those firms was mentioned in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  That is very good and we are fortunate to be in the middle of Ireland, located at the end of a most wonderful road.  One sets off from Dublin and before blinking three times one is in Athlone.  The industrialists cannot complain about getting to Athlone and the IDA has built a most magnificent industrial park there.  It is not huge but is beautifully laid out, well appointed and nicely landscaped.</P>
        <P>Businesses are able to set up in the park in a semi-incubation way and can move to other IDA Ireland facilities as they grow.  In the meantime, they can almost immediately begin operating in the hinterland of this excellent industrial park.  I am sure other regions have similar facilities.</P>
        <P>We have had a hair-raising time recently with a certain large firm which was deciding between cutting staff in its Clonskeagh or Athlone operations.  Sadly, the staff in Clonskeagh were let go but the remaining staff in Athlone worry constantly that the call will be made to them someday.  I wonder if a unit could be established between the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to support job retention in advance of redundancy announcements.  Is it possible to constantly monitor firms which were welcomed here with State aid and which are pursuing their paths to productivity?  I am aware that issues arise in respect of intrusion and interference, but it is too late for a firm to send warning signals one week before it announces losses.  A job retention unit would make itself aware of what is likely to happen to a firm rather than waiting to hear the sad news on the local radio station.</P>
        <P>Retention should be as strongly emphasised as invention because otherwise we are being somewhat feckless and IDA Ireland will arrive at a worse situation than this year&rsquo;s net loss of 1,200 jobs.  That figure is reasonable in the present circumstances but it will increase if attention is not paid to retaining jobs and supporting companies in their ongoing training and product development needs.  Aid and support must be available to firms which are struggling to survive.</P>
        <P>The downturn has resulted in a reduction in science and technology funding, although investment is continuing in this area.  This funding represents the future for the jobs and smart businesses we want to create.  Regardless of how this crisis affects us, we must strive to maintain our funding for science and technology.</P>
        <P>In the context of this debate on jobs and development, I am pleased that ICTU and the Government have agreed to embark on another phase of getting to know each other or renewing their friendship.  I have been an advocate of partnership since my time as shop steward in the school in which I taught.  I have always believed industrial relations should be conducted through jaw-jaw rather than war-war.  I do not see the purpose of strikes in these terrible times and was not surprised to hear about the outraged e-mails sent to &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; on Tuesday morning.  Every house in the land is facing or experiencing unemployment.  Thankfully, therefore, the strike has been averted.</P>
        <P>Before I left my bolt hole in the Leinster House 2000 warren for the Chamber, I read once again the ten points of the social solidarity pact.  It is difficult to disagree with any of the points because they are all motherhood and apple pie but I failed to find in them a single solid proposal which would enable us to get over the debt hump.  I was nonplussed to learn that Mr. Begg, who is a very worthy person, is advocating a longer period in which to repay our debts.  That will mean lumping our grandchildren with debt repayments.  I do not approve of this <Col N="915"/>suggestion but I hope it will not be a stumbling block to the parley among the social partners.  We have to repay our debts before the deadline set by the EU because we cannot shirk our responsibilities in that regard.  To advocate that we lengthen the repayment period is to act like Judy Garland in &ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&rdquo;.  There is no merit in the suggestion and it will not produce a good outcome.  A small amount of pain might be spared now, but the suffering will be worse as our borrowings double.</P>
        <P>By and large, however, I am supportive of social partnership.  Elected representatives do not often enough acknowledge the inestimable contributions that the partnership process has made to Ireland&rsquo;s industrial and social relations over the past 20 years.  When we were coming into our glory years, people asked me during my ministerial visits to other countries the reason for the arrival of the good times in Ireland.  I always cited our education system, in which I am a firm believer.  I am aware that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was also a teacher.  Good education is the foundation for whatever way of life one embraces.  The social partnership model is equally important to our success.  It can appear cumbersome at times and one can groan at the long faces that appear after meetings in Government Buildings, but we need negotiations to flourish regardless of the budget&rsquo;s outcome.  I assume that the decisions on the budget have already been made, although we are told that further frenzied meetings are to take place.</P>
        <P>I wish all parties luck in their deliberations, even if the budget will be on paper by the time the social partners get to grips with it. I wish all parties to the talks fair weather and honesty on both sides.  That is what is needed.  I am aware that often people have to throw shapes and say and do things for, perhaps, a wider audience.  At the same time there is no need for that carry-on.  We all know one another well enough now to be able to say, within those talks, that throwing shapes is not enough.  I heard on the radio this morning that there is great social unrest in France.  We constantly hear of strikes in France, with all airports, bus and railway stations closed and many thousands on the streets.  They seem to be able to wear it well, although I do not know how.   I was once in Paris when it was impossible to get out of it, and that was an awful situation.  There is talk of a revolt.  I do not know whether it will be <i>&agrave; la</i> Marie Antoinette, a peasant revolt or whatever, but President Sarkozy had better get his boots on and try to manage matters.  I am quite sure he can do so, as he showed when he visited this country.</P>

        <P>I also believe we need the social partners for another purpose.  I am not deviating, as this is still part of industrial life.  It seems we are to have another Lisbon treaty referendum, even though I had advocated that we could not have another referendum for many years.  However, I now realise that if we do not do so we will be humped.  If we are to have another referendum we need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Yes, we are broad Europeans.  We need the social cohesion which the worker and employer representatives bring to the table as we start to prepare for a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>This is a good technical Bill.  It allows us here to talk about various matters.  There is the fine work done by Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.  There is also the enormous importance attaching to job retention in tandem with the good news about new jobs.  We need to have more industrial parks such as the one at the regional centre in Athlone, as these provide a great focus for industry.  I am also pleased that the social partners have again come on board with the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  At the outset, however, I am disappointed with its contents, since I believe many people living along the Shannon always held Shannon Development and the work it had done in the highest esteem.  In July 2005, the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, said that under the new arrangements, Shannon Development would be given an enhanced regional economic development role, with specific emphasis on addressing the needs for the less developed parts of the Shannon region.  I regret and am worried that Shannon Development is now effectively leaving the pitch, because I do not have confidence in IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in terms of the regional basis on which they are bringing industry into the country. </P>
        <P>Looking at the track records in respect of the announcements and the job creation efforts and endeavours over the last five to ten years, there is a clear indication that the conferring of status on those cities and towns that became the main gateways and hubs for industry was based, in the main, on politics &mdash; with the exception of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  In view of this there is a clear deficit with regard to proper regional development.  Take the four towns of Ballinasloe, Loughrea, Gort and Tuam in County Galway, for example.  Tuam, for whatever reason best known to the person who made the announcement which I believe was political, was classified within the previous categories in terms of gateway and hub towns.  Over the past three years IDA Ireland has made one visit with potential investors to the three other towns.  This was not one visit to each but rather one to the three towns.  Tuam has had a couple of other visits.</P>
        <P>Many parts of Ireland have been forgotten by the IDA, as we have known for a long time.  They have been forgotten because they lie between Galway city and Athlone.  I am sure this example can be replicated in many other areas throughout the country.  It is regrettable.  We look across the Shannon in envy at the development work done by the regional development company, Shannon Development, including as it does the Tipperary and Clare borders nearly as far as Birr.  It is regrettable that this agency is now leaving the pitch because if, as proposed, <Col N="917"/>Enterprise Ireland replaces it, given the share allocations as provided for in this Bill, the same pattern I have outlined will happen.</P>
        <P>The main responsibility of Enterprise Ireland is the support and development of indigenous Irish industries but I believe it has also lost the plot on this.  There are many instances of this, even where it has supported industry.  However, it claims its hands are tied when industries get into trouble, even with companies it has supported from the start-up phase.  When difficulties arise, Enterprise Ireland says, as in the case of a Loughrea company recently, that the only support it can give to an indigenous Irish enterprise is a consultative grant of about &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000, depending on whether it is developing new products.</P>
        <P>In view of the difficulties in which many indigenous Irish industries find themselves Enterprise Ireland is not being helpful.  I am aware that certain industries in east Galway are in difficulty and I have asked Enterprise Ireland to be proactive rather than reactive.  The agency should go into such companies before something happens to determine whether they can be nurtured through the difficult periods they are facing, in terms of industrial development and employment, and helped to a greater extent than heretofore.  State agencies are failing to do this.  As a result of my exchanges with Enterprise Ireland when 180 jobs were lost in Cigna in Loughrea not too long ago &mdash; it was a complete shock to the small town &mdash; I wondered what it did.  It visited a trade fair in New York city from 3 to 16 February 2008 entitled Kidscreen 2008 and TV Bootcamp.  One wonders if it has lost its focus.  Many other visits abroad were undertaken but that one highlights the insignificance of Enterprise Ireland.  This Bill presented an opportunity to restructure the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and to focus on the difficulties in the area of job creation.</P>
        <P>Galway and Limerick are two university cities.  Were it not for the initiatives of the personnel of the universities in those cities &mdash; mainly their presidents and professors in the areas of job creation and research and development &mdash; they would not have received funding from abroad and would not have been able to establish a link between that funding and research and development in existing industries in Galway and in Limerick.  The IDA was irrelevant but jumped on the bandwagon.  The initiatives of the universities and their personnel, who were progressive, have led to many of those industries developing.  The link between the universities and job creation has been tremendous, and I hope it continues.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a need for the Minister to reassess the situation and how those organisations go about their work in job creation.  They are not doing so fairly and they are neglecting the concept of regional development.  Not too long ago when Deputy Richard Bruton was Minister in that Department, he gave a clear directive, not a request, to the IDA to be fair to the regions.  That has all gone wrong.  I hope the Minister will take an initiative, if not in this Bill, in another Industrial Development Bill which will clearly outline that for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>At regional level, the county enterprise board is the only agency which makes a tangible response to requests for help in job creation, albeit in a small way.  Galway County Enterprise Board recognises that need and that there is talent out there and it responds in a positive way.  However, it has been neglected and rubbished by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  That is a regrettable situation.  There must be co-ordination in regard to job creation and industrial policy from here on.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill but I do not welcome it because of the effect, as the previous speaker said, it will have on the future role of Shannon Development.  If one were looking for an example of an instrument of rural development in any part of the world which would create a dynamic in a region, one would <Col N="918"/>decide on Shannon Development as a very good one.  It has worked very well over the years and I will cite a few examples later.</P>
        <P>The Government has stripped it of some of its powers and functions.  I am convinced that because of the reduced role of Shannon Development in the mid-west region, the region is not as dynamic as it used to be.  Shannon Development is now just a property manager.  If it is not broken, why fix it?  The attitude is mind boggling.  Taking north Kerry tourism from Shannon Development and reducing its role to a property manager in Tralee and the Shannon landbank has definitely taken the dynamic out of north Kerry and reduced the visibility of people trying to do something there.  I will refer to that again later.</P>
        <P>I refer to the time Shannon Development was founded in 1959, and it is no harm to mention some of its achievements.  In 1960, it founded the first world industry free zone.  That has been an amazing success and it now employs 7,000 people.  That was as a result of visionaries like Brendan O&rsquo;Regan and others.  It produces sales of &euro;3.5 billion and it has one of the highest concentrations of American businesses in the country.  What thanks did the people who created that get?  The role of Shannon Development has been reduced.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development created its own town, Shannon, and concepts such as medieval banquets at Bunratty Castle.  It was very much involved in setting up the University of Limerick which has been a key economic driver in the mid-west region.  It set up one of Ireland&rsquo;s first business innovation centres.  It set up the national technology park in 1984 beside the University of Limerick.  Shannon Development had the vision to see there was a direct link between technology and universities.  That had not happened in the rest of the universities at that stage because they were still concentrating on the humanities whereas the vision was there in the mid-west region.</P>
        <P>In 1986 Shannon Development set up the Limerick food centre and it also has achievements such as the Doonbeg golf resort.  It set up a series of business and technology parks in a number of locations throughout the region, some 57 in total.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ulick Burke alluded to the IDA&rsquo;s performance in his part of the world.  In the past ten years, the IDA has not been responsible for the creation of one new job in north Kerry.  Reference was made to Aetna in Castleisland, about which the IDA made an announcement last summer.  I do not know if those jobs have come on stream yet.  In a period of five years, the IDA brought only 13 itineraries to Kerry but in the same period, it brought 156 to Cork.  The former Minister was from Cork and Kerry did not have the clout.</P>
        <P>Kerry has been totally neglected by the IDA.  I have said that to IDA people and will continue to do so.  The present administration in the IDA in the region is showing more interest in Kerry but the IDA has shamefully neglected Kerry over the past ten years.  That goes without saying.  It did not even make an effort to bring something into the county.  That is a sweeping statement but it is the reality.</P>
        <P>In County Kerry, Shannon Development, using the funding it gets from its own rental spaces across the region &mdash; there is no Government liability or involvement because it is not taxpayers money &mdash; set up a technology park in Tralee.  It cost &euro;8 million and now employs 300 people within 30 very progressive companies, none of which have closed in recent times.  One company was sold off to an American company two years ago for &euro;130 million.  These companies have links all over the world, with Silicon Valley and elsewhere and are doing very well.  The credit for this lies with Shannon Development, not IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development built a business centre, currently fully occupied, in Listowel, again from its own and not Government money, which cost &euro;1.7 million.  It has created an e-village in Tarbert, which is also operating in County Clare, where people can come and work from <Col N="919"/>their own houses.  It is rigged up with broadband and so on.  As result of its careful initiative and planning it now has HESS Corporation which, it is hoped, will build an LNG plant in the Shannon estuary.  It provided the land and is now working with the HESS Corporation.  The project was ongoing for more than two years.</P>
        <P>This is success.  I have given only a small overview of this dynamic group of people.  It could have been streamlined and nationalised or rationalised.  What has happened to it?  It has been stripped of its powers.  The original idea was that it would be amalgamated with the Shannon Airport Authority and its revenue stream would go into it to keep the airport going.  The airport is very important but compromising the Shannon free development company to buttress and make up for the neglect of the airport over a period of time by the Government was unfair and the wrong approach to take.</P>
        <P>Reducing the role of Shannon Development in this country was a retrograde step for real regional development.  In the 1980s, when we looked at regional development as an instrument to bring up all parts of Ireland at the same time, everybody cited the midwest region as a region all other places should replicate.  The Government has lost sight of regional policy.  It no longer matters.  During the leadership of the former Taoiseach there was only one place which mattered to him and that was Dublin.  That is reflected around the country.  Some of the Deputies from his side of the House would probably accept that.  There was no balance at all in developments across the country.  Perhaps, because of the halt in building and the closure of industries, it may not affect some of the peripheral regions because there was nothing to be closed &mdash; they had all already closed.</P>
        <P>Another area where Shannon Development took a very important role in north Kerry since 1989 is its involvement in tourism promotion and development.  It built a totally new product in Tralee, made it into a tourism town and provided a museum and several other facilities.  It was also involved in a number of initiatives in north Kerry.</P>
        <P>Following very little debate and consultation with the main players, north Kerry was brought into F&aacute;ilte Ireland for tourism promotion and development.  What has happened?  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has no presence to any great extent.  There is no development work, despite the fact it has a representative there who is doing his best.  It took the focus off the area.  As a result, products which were developed through hard work and the efforts of people such as my former team-mate Denis &ldquo;Ogie&rdquo; Moran, who spent hours and weekends promoting tourism products and meeting groups of people, have all now dissipated.  All that good work is gone.  There is no promotion left.  We have products in the area but F&aacute;ilte Ireland is not promoting them to the extent that Shannon Development would have done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are other issues involved in this debate regarding raising grants, which I welcome.  However, reducing its role and consigning Shannon Development to the scrap heap, which I hope will not happen, is bad for the region.  This action by the Government  has taken the dynamic out of the region and has not helped the midwest.  I appeal to the task force, set up under Denis Brosnan, to look again at changing the role of Shannon Development and giving it more of a dynamic leadership role within the region so we could be back here in a few years looking at perhaps redefining its role for the sake of the totality of the region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of this Bill, particularly on our industrial development agencies.  I have heard the criticisms since I have been in the Chamber.  It is important to reflect that the two main agencies, IDA Ireland and <Col N="920"/>Enterprise Ireland, have been incredibly successful in the past number of years.  The role of IDA Ireland in the growth and development of the economy has often been underscored.  The organisation and its staff members have never been given credit for what was achieved during that time.</P>
        <P>We need to reflect, even in incredibly difficult years such as 2008, that 130 FDI projects were won for Ireland by IDA Ireland, an increase on 2007.  Even though in these times of credit crunch that performance will probably deplete this year, we still have talented people and an organisation that has refocused its activities in recent months in order to deal with the change in the climate with which we are dealing.  There was a &euro;2 billion investment in this economy through FDI sourced by IDA Ireland last year.  I share the frustrations expressed by Deputies regarding regional performance.  It is not what it could or should be.  They have developed a comfort zone by going into the large cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway.</P>
        <P>One of my concerns is that the Bill highlights the increase in the designation area for the BMW grant which was done through Europe but not here in Ireland.  Those of us in the west believe IDA Ireland is deliberately using the Government guideline of 50% investment in the BMW region to develop places nearer to Dublin to try and reach that target, but at the same time it is not serving the spirit of what it was intended to.  I hope that changes in the coming days.</P>
        <P>There was some criticism earlier of Enterprise Ireland which is also unfair.  It has a focussed role in supporting specific projects such as start-up companies which would often never get a start in the market place.  Another of its roles which is often unheralded and unheard concerns its attempts to support community organisations and enterprise.</P>
        <P>There is a gap in our industrial policy between the county enterprise board client and the EI client.  We debated this at length but it needs to be addressed.  I hope the Department will produce proposals.  I agree with Deputy Varadker&rsquo;s comments in that the climate in which we now find ourselves requires a change in the designation of start-up businesses.  Every business which is starting up should get some sort of support, be it from the enterprise board or Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has done much good work.  Many of the missions on which it embarks, such as the telefairs to which Deputy Burke referred, are focussed on getting jobs and investment.  Those of us who saw the images from New York last week of the EI-hosted event at which the Taoiseach spoke saw a very focussed event and a group of Irish business people meeting people who matter and have the capacity to make decisions for the benefit of the country.  They are not just on a junket or a St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day holiday.  Enterprise Ireland has a very strong role in this area and is an organisation we probably do not give enough credit to.</P>
        <P>The role of regional policy has been well ventilated in this debate.  There is enormous frustration, particularly among those of us who represent the regions, at the very patchy performance outside the key gateway cities.  Coming from a hub town, I have seen little benefit from the national spatial strategy.  Whether or not it was a political decision, we have seen little practical benefit from it and it may even have become detrimental to us at this stage.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge the global environment within which we operate.  We are competing for industrial investment against cities the populations of which are a multiple of the population of this State.  The days of scattering industry to every corner are gone.  Equally, however, the policy of centralising it in Dublin, Cork and, to a lesser extent, Galway is also unacceptable.  IDA Ireland has consistently challenged Members of this House in regard to the shortfalls that exist in terms of regional infrastructure.  Its hands are tied to some extent.  When <Col N="921"/>visiting delegations are brought to regional areas, they see that the infrastructure is not what it should be.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken action to address this infrastructural challenge in the last 12 years.  Another Member referred to the significant investment in roads infrastructure.  This is evident in my own constituency of Mayo.  The change of Government policy when the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, was at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources allowed Mayo to connect to the gas network, thus offering an alternative to electricity as the sole energy source.  Significant work has also been undertaken on water and sewerage schemes throughout the State.  This work, which the House has undertaken on a cross-party basis in order to develop infrastructure and underpin industry, continues.  We must work in co-operation with the development agencies.  If we meet them half way, they too must begin to address the concerns we have offered in a constructive fashion.</P>
        <P>I welcome the move by IDA Ireland finally to begin development of the enterprise park in Ballina, although I was concerned to hear Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke talking about stone walls and lovely gardens but no industrial activity.  We will deal with that issue when it arises.  There is frustration at the way this project was handled and that it was not done in a more efficient way.  I acknowledge the work done in recent years by Ms Maura Saddington and Mr. Jim Murrin to bring this project to fruition.</P>
        <P>The environment in which the development agencies will have to work in coming years will be incredibly difficult.  One wonders where globalisation stands in the wake of the credit crunch.  The manner in which we have driven our economy in the last 15 years was with the objective of establishing ourselves as a player in the global market, as an economy offering a gateway to Europe and open to all the large international markets.  The focus of our agencies will have to change until such a time as the dust settles on the current global difficulties.</P>
        <P>Section 3 contains provisions relating to the various research and development grants, all of which will have to be refocused.  For example, employment grants must be made less cumbersome and more employment-friendly.  I hope the budget on 7 April will include measures to incentivise employers to retain and recruit staff.  Likewise, training grants must be focused on keeping people at work as well as training those who have lost their jobs.</P>
        <P>A review must be undertaken of the shareholdings vested in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in order to ascertain whether they are still relevant.  Shares were purchased in the 1980s and 1990s in companies some of which no longer exist or are no longer relevant.  This may be constraining the development of these companies.  Those shares will never be cashed and we were never going to strike oil in most of these companies.  This should be done as part of a general bookkeeping and tidying-up exercise.</P>
        <P>Much concern has been expressed about a perceived dilution of the role of Shannon Development.  We in Mayo always looked enviously at the work done by Shannon Development and the attention it was able to secure nationally.  However, it is important that we examine the role of all the development agencies.  It is undeniable that we have a significant number of these agencies on this small island.  With a greater regional focus on the part of the agencies and a more targeted approach to regional development, we may all achieve our objectives in terms of developing our areas.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that the House is fully supportive of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  We all have our own regional concerns and frustrations but we must acknowledge that these organisations have done extremely important work in the last ten years and that their contribution will be vital in the years ahead.  They are best placed to get us through the employment crisis we currently face.  They best understand the international economy and what is required to promote the State as a location for investment.  They have very talented people <Col N="922"/>working both in the State and throughout the world on our behalf.  They are delivering well to their target companies within the powers bestowed upon them under legislation.  We must make that legislation more relevant to the current climate in order to give the agencies a brief that is less restrictive in terms of the types of companies in which they can invest.  The development agencies have delivered well in the past and we can have trust and confidence that they will continue to do so in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I begin by welcoming the Bill but I also take this opportunity to clear up some of the inaccuracies and misinformation that have been generated in the House today.  I am sure this misinformation has arisen because Members have been anxious to put forward the best interests of their constituencies.  However, it is important to set the record straight.</P>
        <P>The role of Shannon Development is a function of this Bill, albeit of a technical nature.  Rather than being reduced, that role is enhanced in many ways by Government policy, particularly in regard to the recent announcement of the creation of a task force to deal with the fallout from the job losses at Dell and associated industries within the region.  The role of Shannon Development is now quite broad and is encompassed within the role of the task force.  Shannon Development will provide the task force&rsquo;s secretariat, with the chief executive of Shannon Development, Dr. Vincent Cunnane, acting as the chief executive of the tack force and Mr. Denis Brosnan acting as chairperson.  They and their colleagues on the task force board represent a dynamic team that will be charged with dealing with the fallout from the significant volume of job losses associated with Dell&rsquo;s decision to move to Poland.</P>
        <P>When discussing the development agencies, we must recognise their tremendous success.  Politicians on all sides sometimes seek, for naked political reasons, to diminish the role of IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland simply because no factory has been established in their parish or village.  This approach belies the tremendous work and great success of our development agencies in attracting foreign direct investment and encouraging indigenous companies to become world leaders in their various fields.  Like Deputy Calleary, I acknowledge the great work of IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland, particularly on the international stage.  It was a great source of pride to this nation to see representatives of these agencies highlighting their work during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities in the United States.</P>
        <P>We must recognise that they are competing against other countries, both near and far, for foreign direct investment.  They do so with great skill and success.  We should not, in focusing too much on parochial concerns, take from the tremendous successes they have enjoyed, many of which have been announced in recent weeks.  Despite the significant global downturn, including the banking crisis and various other pressures, they have been successful in winning foreign direct investment for the State.  It does not always follow that this investment goes to the place one might wish it to go from a political perspective.  Ultimately, however, it is for the companies themselves to decide where on this small island they wish to locate their investment.  There have been numerous examples where companies have been attracted to Ireland and their investment has been secured but they did not necessarily choose the location IDA Ireland or the Government would have liked.  We should be grateful such companies have decided to invest in Ireland rather than Wales, Scotland, Greece or one of the eastern European countries.  There are significant challenges in the current climate but also opportunities.  Our agencies are working hard to meet those challenges and avail of those opportunities.</P>
        <P>The changed role of Shannon Development will be beneficial both to the region it represents and to the agency itself.  From the beginning, Shannon Development has been a pioneering <Col N="923"/>agency which sought to develop new ideas and new enterprises and to take them to the next level.  More recently, it may perhaps have become more of an operational entity, which was helpful neither to its own charter nor to the region it represents.  Its strength and success was based on a pioneering nature and in being dynamic, generating new ideas, assisting and developing new and emerging technologies and manufacturing techniques, and bringing the process to a self-sustaining level.  That is the benefit of an agency like Shannon Development, and there is a tremendous role for it in moving beyond that.</P>
        <P>There was also some commentary here that, under a previous leader, the Government had sought to ignore the mid west or regions outside Dublin.  In my constituency alone there has been investment in the N18 between Limerick and Shannon, the Ennis bypass, the Limerick tunnel, the inter-urban motorways, new terminals at Shannon and Cork and the visitor centre at the Cliffs of Moher.</P>
        <P>The Shannon industrial zone is still the second largest industrial base outside of Dublin and all of the supports which went into developing that infrastructure belies the notion that this Government or any previous Administration led by Fianna F&aacute;il failed in its duty to protect or promote balanced regional development.  It did the opposite; it spent a phenomenal amount of money in developing that infrastructure to ensure the employment base was protected and investment was continued in order to protect that investment.</P>
        <P>Members on both sides of the House have sought to diminish the role of Shannon Development but this would have been a foolish decision, had it been taken.  It was correct to better identify and protect the role of Shannon Development.  It is not possible to change the notion of taking away from a region like the mid west a support or development agency like Shannon Development.  That area is different for others that are effectively greenfield locations.  A development agency is required to protect what is already there.</P>
        <P>The Shannon region has changed over the decades since the inception of industrial areas.  At the outset, the businesses were involved in light engineering, manufacturing and assembly, and that was the profile of the companies located there.  The companies located there at present, and the services and products they provide,  are more high-tech.  We have moved to a point where we are delivering sophisticated IT services, multilingual call centres, high-tech engineering and the development of next-generation microprocessors.   Intel made an announcement recently in regard to developing at nanotechnology level the next generation of microprocessors.  This is one of the most leading edge companies in the world developing the technology in Shannon, which is a tremendous recognition of the foresight of people in Shannon Development.  These include Dr. Vincent Cunnane and Mr. John Brassil, the chairman of Shannon Development.  In recent months and years, Shannon Development has built a close working relationship with the University of Limerick.  Working in such a way, the area can continue to develop into the Silicon Valley of Ireland.  I wish all concerned every success in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is often said that Ireland is no longer competitive or capable of attracting manufacturing jobs.  We are not a low-cost economy and we are unable to do the light engineering.  We are not competitive in assembly or low-grade manufacturing like we were in the past, but we are capable of attracting high end high-tech manufacturing.  The announcement by Zimmer last year is an example, as it develops medical equipment and artificial hip, knee and other joints.  It is a high-tech company and I hope it will help to build a necklace of medical device companies between the Shannon and Limerick regions.  Stryker is already providing a similar manufacturing technology in Limerick and we must work to ensure the region develops a particular skill set in the same way that some pharmaceutical companies are based in the southern part of the country.</P><Col N="924"/>
        <P>Shannon Development is also considering moving from being just an operational base to pioneering the next wave of technologies.  As a result of the proximity to the Atlantic and our desire to become more conscious of green technology with the tides, waves and wind off the west coast, there is an opportunity for Shannon Development to involve itself in developing the next generation of green energy.  Working with the Government and universities in Limerick and Galway, there is a real opportunity to harness the Shannon estuary as a green park.</P>
        <P>These are the types of ideas that must come from Shannon Development, rather than it resting on its laurels and remaining as a property management company.  That is not the ethos of the body, and the management team, along with the board, is very focused on getting back to basic principles and the pioneering charter it had at the outset. That will ultimately lead to sustainable development and will ensure we have companies providing employment in a new economy, recognising the existing demands and requirements.  This Bill takes cognisance of that.</P>
        <P>Some people bemoan the fact that there is movement and change in the Bill.  The changes proposed in the Bill have received strong support from the board and executives.  They see it as the way forward and a way to get back to base principles in starting to develop for the future.  I wish them well in that and I recognise the tremendous work done to date.  I also recognise the significant efforts made by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in working more cohesively.</P>
        <P>I have noticed over the past 12 months a much greater level of cohesion between all the agencies in the region, although there is no doubt there were difficulties for some time relating to demarcation of the roles of Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Shannon Development, for example.  That has been sorted out and the three bodies work well together to the benefit of the region.  They now have a much closer and better working relationship with the Shannon Airport Authority.  If they work together, we can deal with the significant fall-out from the decision of Dell.  If we work together, we can achieve the success we need.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to be able to speak to this Bill.  I welcome many of its elements, including the increased grants and their direction towards research and development, which is extremely important.  Enterprise Ireland will take over the indigenous business remit from Shannon Development in the mid west.  Shannon Development&rsquo;s role has been beneficial to the mid west over many years and it was a blueprint organisation in terms of balanced regional development.  It dealt with foreign direct investment through the Shannon free zone, indigenous industry, tourism and a range of other areas, which worked very well.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has now taken over the indigenous industry remit in the mid-west region.  At this juncture, it is critical that we examine the future role of Shannon Development.  It has a very important role to play in the regional development of the mid west and it can take on the role of integrating all the services in the region through its CEO, Dr. Vincent Cunnane.  Dr. Cunnane has  been also appointed as the CEO of the employment task force, following in the wake of large-scale job losses arising from the decisions of Dell and other multinational companies in the mid west and Limerick.</P>
        <P>It is critical that Shannon Development is retained and given an enhanced role.  Its role in the Shannon free zone is vital with regard to foreign direct investment and tourism and it must become more active in the promotion of Limerick city.  The gateway innovation fund was discontinued.  That fund was vital for the mid west, which sought approximately &euro;100 million for the development of Limerick city and other areas in the wider region.  I ask the Government to consider this fund, which is vital to the region.</P><Col N="925"/>
        <P>With regard to overall development, the Government has established the employment task force under the able and excellent stewardship of Mr. Denis Brosnan as chairman and Dr. Vincent Cunnane as chief executive officer.  I called for a task force as far back as last November for a reason, namely, to be proactive and to deal with the situation that has evolved.  In the past week, Denis Brosnan sent out a stark warning to those in Limerick and the mid west when he said that by the end of this year there will be more than 50,000 people out of a job and on the live register in the region.  Furthermore, unemployment in the region is increasing at a faster rate than in any other area in Ireland at present and we will be looking at approximately 15% or 16% unemployment by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>More than 2,000 people in Dell will lose their jobs in the next 12 months, 450 of them by the end of April.  It is ironic that when the 1,900 manufacturing job losses were announced by Dell, the local Minister, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, stated that negotiations where under way between Dell and the IDA, on behalf of the Government, that would bring 750 high-end jobs to Dell in Limerick.  However, in the past week, we find it has been announced that, at a minimum, 100 jobs in the high-end area are to go.</P>
        <P>The one issue of which I have been repeatedly critical is that no representative from the IDA is on the task force.  The task force was established in the main because of foreign direct investment jobs being lost to Limerick and the mid-west region.  I cannot understand why the IDA is not on the task force but the way the IDA has operated in the mid west and Limerick shows a lack of commitment to the region.  If one compares Limerick to the other cities in Munster &mdash; Cork and Waterford &mdash; Limerick received 374 IDA-backed jobs in 2008 in comparison to nearly three times that number in Cork, which received almost 1,000 jobs, and Waterford, which received nearly 600 jobs.  IDA-backed jobs only increased by 39 in a four-year period up to 2006 in Limerick and, furthermore, there were no new start-ups in Limerick between 2002 and 2004 and only one new start-up in 2005 and 2006.  In 2007, 150 IDA-backed jobs came to Limerick and, as already mentioned, 374 in 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a grossly inadequate response from the IDA and the Government when one considers that the live register figures for Limerick at end of February were 17,223 and, of those, nearly three quarters relate to Limerick city and its hinterland, almost 12,000 people.  The Government and the Minister need to give a commitment, first, that the IDA will join the employment task force headed up by Denis Brosnan and Vincent Cunnane and, second, that the IDA will designate Limerick and the mid-west as a priority area.  The figures do not suggest this is the case, given that Cork got nearly 1,000 new jobs through the IDA in 2008, Waterford got almost 600 and Limerick just over 370.</P>
        <P>While it was known the Dell jobs in Limerick were at risk, it took the Government at least two months to set up the task force I called for back in November.  People were being told by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, on the day they were losing their jobs that the Government through the IDA had secured 750 high-end jobs with Dell.  The people of Limerick and the mid west deserve better.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, must ensure that the IDA joins this task force and that we see a flow of jobs because we have seen no jobs in 2009.  We need to see real commitment from the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My understanding is that the employment task force headed up by Denis Brosnan is due to make an interim report to the T&aacute;naiste in the first two weeks of May, little over a month away.  It is critical that this interim report be elevated to a report that is actionable and that, whatever recommendations are made, the resources are put in place.  Denis Brosnan, who is universally regarded as one of the greatest businessmen of his generation, is telling the Government there will be 50,000 unemployed in the mid-west by the end of the year and an unemployment rate of 15% to 16%.  We need action and resources, and the report needs to be published.  I under<Col N="926"/>stand it will be presented to the T&aacute;naiste but it should be published because there is nothing to hide and we need transparency.  We have a problem in that job losses in the mid-west and Limerick are escalating at a rate that no other region is experiencing in terms of acceleration and scale.  It is critical, first, that the Government would insist or order the IDA to become part of this task force and, second, that it would ensure the IDA makes Limerick and the mid-west a priority area.</P>
        <P>With regard to grants, we are members of the EU and, while I believe in the open market, I am also aware of the situation where the Polish Government was able to give Dell approximately &euro;50 million to locate in Lodz in Poland, which certainly had an effect in terms of the Irish operation.  I expect this will be examined at European Commission level to ensure this country is able to retain its comparative advantage in terms of bringing IDA-backed jobs and foreign direct investment jobs into the region.  Shannon Development has a key role to play in terms of jobs in the Shannon free zone.  Many people living in Limerick work in Shannon, as they have traditionally done.  This is why the mid west must be made a priority region for industrial development by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To conclude, it is important we increase the grants that are available to industry, particularly in the area of research and development.  The Bill will be scrutinised in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I welcome the increase in research and development grants and the increase in the limited grants being given to industry.  However, I want to take two warning shots.  First, Shannon Development must be retained and given an enhanced role in terms of development for the region, particularly with regard to the Shannon free zone, tourism and the development of industrial parks.  Any dilution of its role will be resisted by Limerick and the mid-west.  Second, Enterprise Ireland is doing great work in the region but it needs to be given extra resources to prioritise where people are losing their jobs in companies like Dell.  There is a wealth of expertise in these companies that could be utilised to set up small businesses.  This needs to be co-ordinated between all the agencies, including Shannon Development, the IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the city and county development boards in terms of providing funding to enable people to set up in business.  Feeding into this would be Tuas Nua, the retraining agency.</P>
        <P>In terms of the task force, I am aware of the fantastic work Mr. Denis Brosnan and Mr. Vincent Cunnane, along with members of the task force, are doing.  The task force, while great, does not include a representative of IDA Ireland and this needs to be rectified.  I ask the Minister to state that this will be rectified immediately.  I would also like IDA Ireland to commence looking after Limerick and the mid-west.  Limerick has gained only one third of the number of jobs gained in Cork and half the number of jobs gained by Waterford.  There were no new IDA Ireland start-ups in Limerick between 2003 and 2004 and only one between 2005 and 2006.  Also, Limerick gained only 151 new jobs in 2007 and 274 in 2008 with no new jobs for Limerick in 2009 so far.  The Government must acknowledge that IDA Ireland has neglected Limerick and the mid-west.  This needs to be remedied.</P>
        <P>The task force has a vital role to play.  I would like the task force&rsquo;s interim report, when published, not only to be presented to the Minister, but also brought before the House for discussion.  Furthermore, resources must be put in place to enable it to be an actionable report.  Eighteen months is too long to wait for a final report given the circumstances now presenting and the resultant loss of high end jobs.  Negotiations must be ongoing between IDA Ireland and companies like Dell to retain existing high end jobs and to secure further such jobs.  I would like a response on this matter from the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We were led to believe by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, following the announcement of the loss of 1,900 manufacturing jobs in Dell, that negotiations were already <Col N="927"/>under way with Dell and IDA Ireland on behalf of the Government for 750 high end jobs.  We were told this on the same day as 1,900 workers in Dell were told they would lose their jobs during the forthcoming year.  The Government needs to show commitment to Limerick and the mid-west.  The way to do this is to provide resources, based on the report from Mr. Denis Brosnan, Mr. Vincent Cunnane and the task force which will be produced in the first or second week of May.  IDA Ireland must give priority to the Limerick region and Shannon Development must be given an enhanced role in terms of regional development for the mid-west and Limerick regions.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing from the Minister that real commitment will be shown by way of resources in terms of the development of Limerick and the mid-west.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This Bill seeks to put on a legal footing a policy decision taken two years ago that responsibilities for indigenous industry held by Shannon Development be transferred to Enterprise Ireland.  This has been happening at an operational level for some time.  This legislation gives legal effect to that decision and transfers shares and assets in various companies from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.  As the decision has been taken, I have no quarrel with the main thrust of the Bill.  The legislation also deals with a series of miscellaneous items which, although interesting, are not central to the policy and can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about Shannon Development&rsquo;s contribution and commitment to the region down through the years, which has been strong.  Since its establishment, with Dr. Brendan O&rsquo;Regan as the first chief executive, Shannon Development has contributed a great deal to the economic life of and job creation in the region.  It has been innovative.  For example, the Shannon free airport concept has been imitated all over the world.  It was, in its early days, a great driver for jobs.  It created innovative measures such as castle tours.  Places like Bunratty Castle and other castles in Clare became magnets for the tourism industry, particularly tourists from the United States coming to Ireland through Shannon.  This, too, was imitated throughout the world.</P>
        <P>It was the first Irish region to establish strong links with the local university.  It developed a strong IT industry in the Plassey Industrial Park and Shannon Airport with links to the university being the essential component.  It is time now for more innovative thinking in this region.  It is with some regret that Shannon Development&rsquo;s role has been diminished.  While Enterprise Ireland is a worthy State organisation, nobody is jumping up and down applauding its success in maintaining or creating jobs in indigenous industry.</P>
        <P>We have a serious problem in Limerick and the surrounding regions.  The level of unemployment in the region is serious.  Following the announcement of redundancies at Dell, workers there remain at work.  The first redundancies are expected in April.  Some 1,900 people, with a further 100 added following last week&rsquo;s announcement, are to lose their jobs.  In addition, the sub-supply companies have announced redundancies of 600 to 700 workers.  Mr. Denis Brosnan, following a preliminary look at the task facing him as chairman of the task force, has estimated that by Christmas 50,000 people in the Limerick region will be unemployed.  This will make the region the worst affected by unemployment.  We are not an independent republic.  The unemployment levels in Limerick are a subset of what has been happening nationally.  There is a serious jobs crisis nationally which is also reflected locally.  I merely make the point that the incidence has struck harder in the Limerick region than anywhere else.</P><Col N="928"/>
        <P>The difficulties of manufacturing industry in Ireland have been well recited as has our lack of competitiveness in comparison to Asian and European countries.  Obviously, if one can get competent workers who will work for &euro;4 per hour in Poland, one will find it hard to pay them &euro;12 an hour for working in Limerick, which is one of the key problems.  There is a further issue I would like to address this afternoon.  Leaving aside manufacturing industry, the problems of which we are all aware &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness will be aware of this &mdash; hundreds of jobs are being lost week after week in our economy, including in the retail sector, garages, the entertainment industry and in small businesses.</P>
        <P>These jobs are not being lost owing to a lack of competitiveness.  There is no one, except one other pub down the street, competing with my local pub.  People are not going to Poland or India to drink or for a weekend away in a hotel.  These job losses can be put down to two crises, the fiscal crisis and the banking crisis.  So far, the Government has failed to deal adequately with either of them.  The issue is one of confidence.  I know of many people who are as well off this year as they were last year.  They may even be better off than they were the previous year but they are afraid to go out to dinner in a restaurant at night.  People fear something dreadful is going to happen and believe they need to keep their money in their pockets and their savings in the bank.  People are not spending.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman will say how many 09 registered cars he has seen in County Louth?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those who usually buy new cars can just as easily afford to do so this year as they could last year.  It is a question of confidence.  It is up to the Government to commence the task of restoring confidence.  We have already had several budgets.  I hope next month&rsquo;s budget will restore confidence.  Confidence is seeping away because the Government is handling this crisis in an uncertain manner.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A plan is needed if we are to deal with the fiscal situation.  When the Taoiseach announced earlier this week that he would implement the Brussels agreement on the debt-GDP ratio between now and 2013, he said he would ensure that Ireland adheres to its stated target, which is to limit borrowing to 9.5% of GDP, this year.  I understood at that stage that a four-year plan was to be put in place, but the Taoiseach drifted away from that position when he spoke in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  It now seems that the relevant figure will drift upwards from 9.5%.  I suggest that he is giving himself some elbow room, so that he will not have to hit the people so hard with tax increases or spending cuts.  However, his actions are creating the impression that the Government does not know what it is doing.  If the target is 9.5%, the Government should say that it will stick to 9.5%.  If it intends to drift up to 9.9%, that is well and good.  We know why that would be done.  If the debt-GDP target were to drift from 9.5% to 10%, that would give the Government an additional &euro;900 million to play with.  When Ministers are sitting around the Cabinet table, it would be useful for them not to have to make cuts of almost &euro;1 billion, or raise that much in taxes.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach is creating uncertainty.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, said on television last Sunday night that a shortfall of up to &euro;6 billion, rather than &euro;4.5 billion as previously suggested, will have to be made up.  Neither the Minister nor his advisers were able to explain it.  We were given a confusing explanation of what is going on.  I suggest that the Minister was confusing the effect of the budget over a nine-month period, which will amount to &euro;4.5 billion, with the effect of the budget over a 12-month period, which will amount to &euro;6 billion.  When he was pressed, he could not explain it.  As we try to encourage people to invest in the economy by buying houses or cars or by supporting the entertainment <Col N="929"/>industry, it does not help that one member of the Cabinet, at least, does not have a clue what is going on.  He proved in public that he does not know the difference between the nine-month effect of a measure and the 12-month effect of that measure.  It is another example of the kind of behaviour that is sapping confidence.</P>
        <P>The inability of the Government to deal with the banking crisis is also sapping confidence.  The introduction of the guarantee scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of the other banks helped to stave off a collapse.  They kept the show on the road, but they have not restored confidence.  Real action to sort out the banking situation has to be taken around the same time as the budget.  The inability of the banks to provide working capital to businesses is costing jobs day in, day out and week in, week out.  I have spoken to people from big industries and small industries.  A representative of one of this country&rsquo;s major co-ops told me it cannot get working capital from the banks this year on a 12-month basis.  The banks wanted to negotiate a flat-rate working capital arrangement in February.  They will not admit that people in the milk business have to pay for an awful lot of milk in June and July, and therefore need a great deal of additional working capital in those months.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The co-op to which I refer is one of the biggest in the country.  It will have to let people go if the banks do not give it working capital.  They are not getting it, however.  There is no confidence in the sector.  When we have been trying to explain the jobs crisis, we have concentrated on the lack of competitiveness in Irish industry.  However, I suggest that more jobs are being lost because confidence is lacking as a consequence of the inability of the banks to provide working capital to sound firms that used to get it in the past.  That must be dealt with as well.  If we are to restore confidence and protect jobs, tough action should be taken in the forthcoming budget to resolve the fiscal crisis.  We may need to nationalise Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland or take a majority stakeholding in them.  I understand that the Minister for Finance is seriously considering the bad bank concept.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  We need to resolve the fiscal crisis by taking action in the banking sector.  We cannot afford the kind of stimulus plan that is being implemented in other countries.  We do not have the resources to do what is being done in the United States, for example.  We need to invest in certain sectors to stimulate them and increase confidence.  In my home city, for example, the Government is regenerating the bad areas.  Four major housing estates are already half-knocked down.  If the construction phase of the redevelopment were to be commenced, some 1,500 people who have been made redundant could immediately go back to work.</P>
        <P>I have already spoken about the lack of 09-registered cars on the roads.  It is time to introduce a new scrappage scheme.  The big advantage of such a scheme is that it would cost nothing.  It is clear, taking into account the current rates of VRT and VAT, that the average tax take on each car must be approximately 48%.  I suggest that between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000 should be made available as part of a scrappage scheme, as the Government would subsequently get almost &euro;15,000 on every &euro;30,000 car that is sold.  A scrappage scheme would be a self-financing mechanism.  I accept that this measure would encourage imports, but I suggest that in light of the <Col N="930"/>way cars are being sold at the moment, we could afford to tolerate a small level of importation of cars.  This scheme is necessary to try to keep people in garages working and to get cars sold again.  People want to change their cars, but they are afraid to spend the money they have.  A scrappage scheme might encourage them to start spending.</P>
        <P>I propose that a similar scheme could be introduced to assist businessmen who are prepared to export some of this country&rsquo;s over-supply of cars.  It is not that long ago since boatloads of cars were coming into this country from Japan.  I understand that India, where people drive on the left hand side of the road, is in a position to take cars from Ireland and the UK for the use of its emerging middle class.  I estimate that 400 million Indian people might soon be in the market to purchase second-hand cars.  It is possible that an export market from Ireland to India could be developed.  Our forecourts, which are full of cars that cannot be sold, need to be cleared out.  If one tries to trade in one&rsquo;s car while buying a 09-registered car, half of all garages will not quote one a price.  They will sell one a car on a cash basis but they will not do a trade-in.  The pressure on the domestic motor trade has to be relieved.  The lack of confidence in the marketplace is clogging everything up.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to consider providing a couple of million euro to promote home holidays.  Too many hotels were built all over the country.  Holiday homes are lying idle and hotels are empty at a time when people are wondering what they will do for the summer.  If home holidays were promoted &mdash; perhaps hotel packages could be offered to Irish families &mdash; things might start working along the west coast.  If we create a bit of activity, we will help to restore confidence.  Much of what is happening in the county at the moment is self-inflicted.  In the absence of consumer confidence, people will continue to save rather than start spending, which will leave us in desperate shape.  We cannot afford a big stimulus package.  It is possible to use small amounts of money as seed capital to get activity going in different sectors.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is not the answer for those out of work.  It would be a good idea for the Minister of State to remove every barrier in the social welfare code and in employment law that prevents unemployed people from going for education and training.  People who want to improve their skills should be encouraged to do so.  I have seen various estimates of the amount of money each unemployed person costs the State.  I have seen Government figures suggesting that the cost is &euro;20,000.  I have seen other Government figures suggesting that it is closer to &euro;15,000.  Regardless of the exact figure, it seems to me that unemployed people who improve their skills in regional technical colleges, while receiving social welfare payments, will be in a much better position to help themselves, their families and their country in the future than people who are signing on the dole and drawing welfare but not upskilling in any way.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to put in place a four-year plan to solve this country&rsquo;s fiscal problem.  It needs to be a plan to which everyone can stick.  Initiatives need to be taken to restore a real banking industry here and to make credit lines and working capital available to small businesses.  If such initiatives help to restore consumer confidence, people will begin to spend again.  If a seed capital mechanism is used to kick-start activity in certain sectors, people will begin to spend again.  One would still have job losses in manufacturing industry, but the Minister of State will be aware that located down along the main streets of every provincial town in Ireland are takeaways, small restaurants, coffee shops, bookies&rsquo; offices, pubs, auctioneers&rsquo; offices and building societies.  They employ a great many people who are losing their jobs at present.  It is happening every week and it is not even reported in the newspapers.  Every Friday four and five people are let go, and in some towns the figure amounts to a couple of hundred in the week.</P>
        <P>There is a way to stop this and it is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to do so, but my main concern is about the Government.  I exempt the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness from this, because I know from our days on the Committee of Public Accounts that he is far-seeing, <Col N="931"/>listens to ideas and is innovative.   However, there are Cabinet Ministers who are like rabbits caught in the headlights of a car, paralysed in inactivity.  They have a fatalistic approach to the country which amounts to, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be rooned,&rdquo; said Hanrahan, &ldquo;Before the year is out.&rdquo;, but what can we do about it?</P>
        <P>There are things that can be done.  It is predicated on getting the fiscal package right and getting the banks working properly.  If the Government gets that much right, and it takes the innovative steps I  and others suggest, it could stop this and we might get people back to work again.  At present, we are going down hill so fast it is scary.</P>

        <P>I compliment Deputy Noonan on his practical, constructive and positive contribution and I want to build on a couple of the points he made, particularly in the context of County Louth.</P>
        <P>The first point I will deal with is the figures for unemployment.  A year ago there were 7,941 unemployed in County Louth and today there are 14,524.  The following goes to the heart of Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s point.  Of those 14,524, there are only 262 who are on the back to education allowance and 189 on the back to work allowance.  That shows the failure of the system to encourage people to go back to work and to go back to education.  Of those 14,524, there are 4,655 under 25 years.  There is a failure of Government policy in this respect and I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Noonan.  We must change the way we think about these matters.  We must open all doors to get people back to work and back to education.  We have many queries.  There have been some changes.  One of the changes was that if one got a redundancy package and took the first available opportunity, one could get the back to education allowance, but in some cases that does not happen due to technical reasons.  Throw away the red tape and let the people back to education.</P>
        <P>Being from a Border county, it is important to say this.  I can speak for the main street in Drogheda, in particular, and I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk, can speak as well for the main streets in Drogheda, Ardee and Dundalk.  In Drogheda, there are 27 vacant premises in what was called the golden mile, the business centre of the town in terms of retail and bank activity.  At this stage the traders and the business people of West Street in Drogheda and in the town centre are seeking a meeting with the local authority to discuss the fact that they cannot pay their rates.  They are not getting the income and more businesses will close.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to look again at what is happening in local government, and particularly in terms of ratable valuations.  In the past the centre of a town was a much better location for generating income than it is at present, and that is why such rates are higher.  The nearer one&rsquo;s business premises is to the centre of the town the more rates one pays.  However, with out of town shopping, shopping centres and commercial activities now on the outskirts of towns, the focal point has changed to some extent and we need to re-evaluate how these centre-of-town business premises are rated.  We need to consider issues such as a mandatory rates cap, a rates reduction and a rates holiday.  Businesses in the centre of towns, particularly in the Border counties, a theme with which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk, will agree, are being put to the sword.  They are being put out of business because they cannot pay their staff and they cannot pay their rates, and hundreds of thousands of shoppers are going across the Border to buy products in towns such as Newry and Banbridge.  All the activity is going north of the Border.  The Government is not doing enough to tackle this serious issue in the Border counties.  This applies everywhere, but it is particularly bad in Border counties.  The Minister of State should examine that issue, meet with the chambers of commerce and the people involved in <Col N="932"/>the commercial and business activity and ensure there is a new policy to get shopping back into the counties from where the people come, and to address, in particular, the issues that are driving people across the Border.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another issue the Government needs to address is a simple matter, the planning system. If, for example, a new business of a different type sets up on West Street in Drogheda, one must apply for what is called a &ldquo;change of use&rdquo;.  A change of use application can take up to three or six months to process.  In one case recently in County Louth, because there were objections of a commercial nature, it took up to 12 months for a person to open the door of a new premises in an area designated and used for hundreds of years as a business centre.  Why does the Government not examine ways to fast-track planning issues, particularly around the change of use of business premises located in business areas?  The process should be much simpler. One should be able to notify the local authority of one&rsquo;s intention to change the use of a business premises in a business area, stating the nature of the new business and, within a month, one should receive a letter to proceed.  There could not be objections related to noise, for instance, in what are generally designated areas for businesses.  There should be an open-door policy to let people in provided they meet the  business criteria, for example, that their businesses are not noisy, dusty or smoky.  Once the business meets the general designation needs, it should be allowed to locate immediately.  That would certainly create jobs and free up availability.</P>
        <P>Not enough is being done by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, on cross-Border trade.  There is no agenda to change the situation for business people south of the Border.  She should be much more proactive in this regard.  With respect, there is a <i>laissez-faire</i>  attitude to the issue &mdash; let it happen, we can do nothing, we will bury our heads in the sand and maybe it will all go away.  It is not going away; it is getting worse.  The Government should meet  the business people, change the VAT rate, change the way rates are levied on businesses in those areas and think outside the box about how we can make these matters easier and better for people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another problem arises for those who shop south of the Border when they deal with retailers such as Tesco and Marks and Spencer.  I acknowledge that Tesco recently announced a change of policy on its sterling and euro mark-up, but that is not good enough because it has been ripping off millions of euro from Irish shoppers south of the Border over the sterling difference.  Marks and Spencer do it in my home town.  I challenged the company recently because the sterling price was on the product.  Allowing for the euro, the product should have costed approximately &euro;6.50 but it cost approximately &euro;8.  People are being ripped off.  People shopping in some of these stores south of the Border are bringing with them, not just money or their Laser cards, but a calculator because they are concerned about being ripped off.  Worst of all, suppliers from different parts of the country who may already have a business arrangement with some of these companies, particularly Tesco, are being asked to put up front in some cases hundreds of thousands of euro, or tens of thousands of euro for a smaller supplier, before that arrangement is renewed.  This affects employment and good employers who supply to Tesco.  The retailer says if the suppliers do not come up with that money by the close of business this week, it will not renew their contracts.  That is happening and must be investigated with a hands-on approach.  Representations have been made through the political system on some or all of these matters.</P>
        <P>When people approach one with a problem about creating employment one wonders whether to telephone the IDA, Enterprise Ireland or the county enterprise board.  Sometimes the agency one telephones says another agency is responsible and one goes from Billy to Jack.  It is my personal view, not my party&rsquo;s view, that all the agencies should be amalgamated into one job creation agency, a one-stop shop with one telephone number.  That organisation could allocate <Col N="933"/>responsibility for issues internally.  It makes no sense to have them split and wastes money and resources.  We are not focused enough on how we can address all the employment creation problems people may have and to open up the blockages in a one-stop shop way.</P>
        <P>The Government comes across as being unable to make a decision.  It brought forward the budget and it did not work.  It blamed international circumstances.  We have had a very long lead-in time to this budget that will happen early next month.  Cabinet meeting after Cabinet meeting is reported in the press.  However matters are drifting and the Government is not showing the leadership, clarity of thought and decisiveness it ought to.  Excluding the present Minister of State, Ministers are arrogant, out of touch and, as Deputy Noonan said, are like rabbits caught in the headlights of cars.  The people are deeply unhappy with how this country is being run.  While everybody acknowledges that there is a worldwide economic crisis, only one country has gone from boom to bust so quickly.</P>
        <P>The Government predicated its expenditure over recent years on the sale of housing and property, which ultimately had to fall.  It was the biggest con job of all.  We often talk about pyramid selling and somebody at the end being caught.  This country has been caught in the pyramid selling of houses.  The people at the bottom of the ladder are the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs as a result of Government policy in this area.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has been on air recently telling the Opposition it should not tell the truth, that the world is listening to what we are saying.  The world was listening to us and reading about what this Government did during the boom times.  The world was listening when former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s stories were being recounted in the national press about the money being put in different safes and changing from sterling to euro and back again.  The world listened to reports of all the rank planning corruption there was in the political system, all those who appeared before tribunals and some who will still appear.</P>
        <P>It is a shame and a disgrace that this country has been run by the Minister of State&rsquo;s party for 18 of the past 20 years.  I do not direct these remarks at the Minister of State personally.  The people want and need a change.  The only solution is a general election.  The Government has lost its mandate.  It is at sea in dealing with the economic crisis, is refusing to face reality and is missing out on the fundamental, practical and realistic suggestions people such as Deputy Noonan have put before us today.  I look around here and the only speakers I hear are from the Opposition.  I do not know why that is, but it is a shame.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is timely that this Bill comes before the House as it gives everybody an opportunity to speak on a very pressing issue.  I expressed my concerns on this on the Order of Business in the last few days.  Our constituents are telling us about it.  We need an opportunity to speak about restoring confidence in the economy.  One of the things hampering this economy nationally and internationally is a lack of confidence.  Previous speakers have mentioned that various factors have led to this erosion of confidence.  One of these, unfortunately, is the fact that despite the best efforts of the Opposition and several Irish economists over the past ten years, nobody wanted to take any precautions against what might happen when the economy levelled out.</P>
        <P>For some unknown reason the message was brought forward again and again that the fundamentals were right.  However, as the Minister sitting opposite well knows, the fundamentals have not been right for nearly ten years.  The whole thing was gone crazy.  It was like a circus, a show ground.  Everybody had their go.  Everything was go.  Every light was green.  The problem is that when all the lights go green together, there is a crash.  This is not new.  People should not say, as they have done that nobody knew and we did not see it coming.  I cannot understand why people did not see it coming because I, in my small, humble way, put down parliamentary <Col N="934"/>questions to the relevant Ministers eight years ago asking them to address the issue of competitiveness in the economy.  At first there was a slight recognition that there was a problem, but that eventually went away.  It was boom time, we were all having a party, the Government wanted to party on, and this is where we have ended up.</P>
        <P>The problem is that when reality dawns and suddenly people realise that measures must be taken, everybody gets frightened.  People have been frightened for a number of reasons.  One is that Government failed to manage.  It is as simple as that.  There is nothing complicated about it.  There are statistics available everywhere through the IDA and the various development authorities all over the country which showed trends over the past number of years.  Somebody convinced the Government, and it convinced itself, that we had become a high wage economy.  Some Ministers were saying this.  We were into high-tech business and value-added products of the future.  We did not have to worry about where we were or where we were going.  We were going to put it up to everybody else.</P>
        <P>This was absolute rubbish.  Once any country relinquishes its grip on manufacturing, a slackness on the grip on service areas automatically follows as night follows day.  Any country in the world which has had a slackening in competitiveness in manufacturing will shortly afterwards find itself in difficulty.  This has happened over the past ten or 15 years in various other economies in Europe and outside it.  I cannot understand why nobody seemed to recognise this was going to happen here.  Was it because we are the Irish?  Are we special, a race apart, a chosen people?  I do not think so.  It should have been common sense to see what was coming.</P>
        <P>We have two options.  We can live in cloud cuckoo land, or we can take serious steps to recover lost ground.  We can become competitive again, restore confidence in manufacturing and in those providing services and encourage competition within this economy that would be beneficial to our consumers and exporters as they compete for market in the world space.</P>
        <P>In the past number of years the trends have shown that our exports were beginning to slip on international markets because they were not competitive.  This has been looming and well flagged.  We could not compete.  Everything comes back to competitiveness.  I echo the comments of previous speakers that the Government has a job to do, which is not to destroy the economy because that would have a further devastating effect.  It must restore confidence, ensure competitiveness and, at the same time, encourage the population to support the measures that must be taken.  The line emanating from the Government parties is tough decisions must be taken, hardship must be imposed and there will be no gain without pain.  However, their policy is all pain and no gain on the basis of all the steps taken over the past six months.  Who told the Government parties to proceed in the fashion it has?  Did they not know their proposals would have a negative impact?  If billions of euro are extracted from the economy, there will be a vacuum, which will lead to further erosion of confidence and tightening of the domestic markets.</P>
        <P>Many commentators said we should await stimulus packages, which will resolve everything.  A similar crisis occurred in the 1930s following the era known as &ldquo;The Roaring Twenties&rdquo;.  Everything was allowed to run riot in the 1920s, following the First World War.  Confidence was restored and everybody was happy to spend.  Then there was a massive economic crash with major implications. Many people say the crisis was resolved by President Roosevelt&rsquo;s inspirational New Deal and the Hoover plan.  However, tragically and harshly, a war in which approximately 60 million died addressed the crisis.  Was that not a high price to pay to restore confidence in the global economy?  That happened because in the 1920s everybody thought everything would be easy and they would not have to work and so on.  They could dream and get paid for it.</P><Col N="935"/>
        <P>The crash happened and nobody, sadly and understandably, wanted to give up what he or she had because one cannot take from people readily and expect to be applauded for it.  The war diverted people&rsquo;s attention.  Suddenly it dawned on them that they were in a tight spot and they had to concentrate all their energies on the major danger on the horizon.  That massive onslaught and human tragedy has been forgotten and nobody wants to hear about it anymore.  Hopefully, we will learn from history and we will not have to go through that process again.  Stimulus packages did not work in the 1930s when several attempts were made.  When the war happened, everybody recognised they would have to survive together or not at all.</P>
        <P>The Government parties must inspire the people at this time.  They must lead and encourage them to bring them along.  The Opposition has an important role as well.  Our job is to challenge and to be in the Government&rsquo;s face at every opportunity to make it stand up its case and not to acquiesce.  I do not want to hear lectures from Government Members about the Opposition bringing forward proposals.  They have access to consultants and massive Departments.  They claim we have been allowed access to Exchequer returns and, as a result, we should know what we are talking about.  They have been looking at the figures for the past six months and every week they have come up with different conclusions.  What are they looking at?  They expect the Opposition to be suddenly inspired following a quick &ldquo;now you see it, now you don&rsquo;t&rdquo; examination of the figures.  It is about time the Government parties got real.  What are they at?  This is a serious problem, which does not require such frivolity.  The time has come for the Government to put its hand up and say, &ldquo;We are very sorry.  We got it wrong.  We misled the people.  We could have told it differently.  We saw it coming and we did not tell you&rdquo;.   The situation will be much worse if they did not see it coming.</P>

	<P>The economy and the budget were debated yesterday.  I question their relevance to industrial development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a preamble.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Chair&rsquo;s assistance on the path to national recovery.</P>
        <P>From hereon in, it will be important that we can rely on the information we are given and draw up plans, make projections and act on the basis of that information.  I presume it is in order to refer to the competitiveness of the economy and the investment required to create employment for the people the Acting Chairman and I represent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That is totally relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>During the Celtic tiger era, approximately 1,000 jobs a week were created, inflation was low and confidence was high but the reverse is the case now.  Approximately 1,000 jobs a week are being lost, confidence is non-existent and while inflation, thankfully, is low, one can never depend on it.  A number of commentators suggest it is too low.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Confidence and competitiveness are necessary for job creation and there is also a need to encourage manufacturing industry.  Investment in value added products is positive and important, as it generates employment.  Everyone would like a high wage economy but a medium wage economy can offer medium and high wages.  The two groups, employees and investors, can coexist without difficulty but, in a high wage economy, nobody is happy unless everybody has high wages.  Why did nobody recognise that?  Provision has been always made in every other economy for investment in manufacturing.  Perhaps it is not as lucrative for investors but manufacturing generates jobs and keeps money flowing in the economy, which is the problem we face currently.</P><Col N="936"/>
        <P>Deputies Noonan and O&rsquo;Dowd referred to the need to generate movement in the economy.  Strange things are happening of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  The lending institutions, which have the power to move the economy forward, are sitting on their hands, particularly in respect of small businesses which can give some employment in manufacturing or services and keep the wheels of the economy turning.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a business man in the past few days who has been dealing with the same financial institution for as long as it has been around, but in order to renew his overdraft he had to produce his passport and various other credentials.  He requires a substantial overdraft to run his business.  He had to go to the ends of the earth to reassure the financial institution that he was genuine.  Was that not rich given the recent history of some of the financial institutions?  It is difficult for hard-headed business people who have been working all their lives to provide jobs for themselves, their families and others in their communities, to be asked by someone who in their eyes has no credibility to comply with certain requirements before according them a particular status.</P>
        <P>The local planning process obstructs job creation and investment in jobs.  That has been always the case as my colleagues across the House know.  It might be timely to remind the local authorities of the need to encourage investment, to get things moving, even in a small way.  Every little helps.  I cannot understand why there is not greater emphasis on this because local authorities have a meaningful role through the county development boards and their other ancillary facilities and services.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd referred to the markup in various supermarket chains.  The Minister of State may wonder how that relates to industrial development but it all relates to jobs.  I met somebody in the past couple of days who found that by importing spare parts directly, instead of purchasing them here, he could save 50% of the cost.  I did not believe that but I checked it and found that it happens regularly.  Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd and Noonan compared markups in the commercial area.  It appears that we are at a serious disadvantage, allegedly because of currency fluctuations, and higher costs that we cannot identify.  We can contend with higher wage and transport costs although we do not welcome them.  Where are the hidden costs that cause some imports to be so much more expensive when sold commercially here?  The Government might initiate some inquiry into this important area.</P>
        <P>The biggest job losses have occurred in the housing bubble that burst.  I know the Minister of State will tell me that has nothing to do with the Industrial Development Bill but it could mean 100,000 jobs.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said repeatedly that we must return to traditional banking and lending practices.  Let us for God&rsquo;s sake go back to them and start selling some of the houses at affordable prices.  Instead of hankering after the luxury we lived in for the past six to eight years at the peak of the boom, we must try to sell the products we have now which in turn will lead to further job creation in the housing market and the manufacturing and services areas too.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies Varadkar, Rabbitte and Morgan and all the other Deputies who contributed to this debate.  It was a very worthwhile and interesting debate on the Bill as was the journey on which Deputy Durkan brought us for the past 20 minutes. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a very important journey. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It may bore him somewhat that I must return to the sections of the Bill but if he waits he will find that interesting too.  The comment that all of the debate <Col N="937"/>came from the other side of the House was not exactly accurate.  There were several contributions from this side as there were from the Opposition, expressing the same level of interest.  </P>
        <P>In respect of section 3, I too support the Oireachtas committee system.  It is a great place to scrutinise legislation in detail and to deal with annual reports on money granted and spent under legislation passed, and the records of Enterprise Ireland, the county enterprise boards, my Department and other Departments.  Maybe it should be used much more in respect of this type of legislation.  There is oversight and scrutiny.  I was a member of the Committee on Public Accounts under the chairmanship of Deputy Noonan.  It is extremely important to take time at that level to scrutinise every aspect of a Department&rsquo;s expenditure.  Those checks and balances exist in the committee system.  It is a matter for us to use it.</P>
        <P>The Shannon development agency exists for grant purposes, to manage tourism-related property and so on.  Mr. Martin Cronin, the chief executive of Forf&aacute;s, is a member of, and available to, the task force to which he responds on behalf of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Science Foundation of Ireland and F&Aacute;S.  He has an input relevant to these bodies and feeds information to them from the task force.  I hope that functions well.</P>
        <P>I was asked about proof of job creation and maintenance by county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland.  I was a member of a county enterprise board since they were first set up by former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds.  This week in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown we recalled that over that 15-year period the board supported 800 projects with &euro;7.6 million in grants, creating almost 1,000 jobs.  The same can be said of enterprise boards in my constituency and elsewhere.  That is relevant for the micro and SME sector.  They have expanded their activities to provide mentors and courses for upskilling management and staff.  They engage constantly with chambers of commerce and other business agencies or representative groups.  They are a positive feature of any local economy.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s remit takes in the county enterprise boards.  There is now a seamless transfer of companies through that system right up to Enterprise Ireland level.  A company can achieve this, as was demonstrated recently in a presentation by 71 high-potential start-up companies.  The majority had come through the county enterprise board system and ended up as high-potential start-up companies.  They launched their products and services recently at an exhibition attended by banks and other investors interested in supporting such companies.  Enterprise Ireland invested approximately &euro;22 million over the range of companies taking part and, on top of that, &euro;169 million was leveraged.  There is potential within the 71 companies to create 1,000 jobs over the next three years.</P>
        <P>That is a measure of the activity of enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland in this area.  This story is told, not by politicians or Ministers, but by the market and by business people who, unlike many in this House, must put their money where their mouth is.  They have to stand up every day and take on the banks in the current environment, as was mentioned in the debate.  They must go to foreign places to create that marketplace, and access to it, in order to sustain jobs at home.  There is a successful side to the economy and what is going on, even now.  This is relevant to research and development and to job creation but is particularly relevant to the successful story that Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards can tell.</P>
        <P>Foreign direct investment was mentioned, as was the notion that the indigenous sector is weak.  The indigenous sector has created approximately 800,000 jobs.  If one includes Enterprise Ireland and foreign direct investment, each body has created almost 150,000 jobs.  That is a good representation of the jobs being created by all those bodies.  Each one makes an effort and I believe they give value for money.  They give Ireland international representation and they create those jobs in a very confident way, bringing other jobs back to Ireland by way of foreign direct investment.  They sustain and create such jobs through Enterprise Ireland and its activities.  There is a lot going on and a strong engagement with Enterprise Ireland and the <Col N="938"/>enterprise boards is required to understand that success story.  Let us not lose that story in the course of this debate, while acknowledging these are challenging times.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke and others made points about the banks.  I spoke about this matter in the Chamber yesterday during another debate  We recapitalised the banks and they tell us they will make &euro;100 million available for enterprise and to create seed capital funds and so on.  We have oversight now in that we can look into the banks and see exactly what are their lending criteria.  Many more millions of euro have been made available through the European Investment Bank and are now included.  Money should be made available to the micro and small and medium-sized enterprise sectors in this country to encourage them to do business and to bridge the gap between these very difficult circumstances and the success that can follow after this downturn begins to pick up.  We can play a role in the global market.</P>
        <P>This message clearly has to go to the banks.  I do not mind saying this, either as a politician or in my role in business.  Strong evidence has been given in this House and outside that banks are not lending freely.  We do not want them lending as freely as they did hitherto but within normal banking criteria.  They are not lending as they should to the business sector.  As Government, we must say to them that we want a clear line of action between the banks and the SME sector and business.  We want them to ensure that businesses are able to continue and to create jobs while sustaining their current jobs.  The group formed to examine the banks&rsquo; lending criteria must take a firm hand.  The banks are not lending the way they should.  I have plenty of evidence of this from my business, from other business people and from stories that have been told in this House.  We must continue to put pressure on the banks to ensure they deliver in a sensible way to sustainable businesses.  These must not be locked out and when businesses approach banks for loans or new facilities we must ensure they do not walk out without the new facilities but with increased interest rates and bank charges.</P>
        <P>I agree with the former chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Michael Noonan, and with Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, who made very worthy suggestions about kickstarting various sectors of the economy.  I made the same point as Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd with regard to local authority charges and fees.  We need to examine them.  Each political party in this House must talk to its representatives on local authorities and we must again consider a radical overhaul of the funding of local authorities.  I have no difficulty with that.  That is what we should be doing.  As businesses continue to reinvent themselves quickly to catch up with the market and play their role there, Government, in turn, must make similar decisions to support that course of action.  Like businesses, it must make decisions in real time.  That is a challenge for Government.  Governments do not operate that way.  They usually chase the problem and then try to deal with it.</P>
        <P>That is the radical shift we need to see here, just like the one we should see in the debates in this House, namely, acknowledging what is said by opposing parties.  I did this last night in response to Deputy Coveney.  A contribution can be made in that way.  I am thankful for the Opposition&rsquo;s support for this Bill which will shift it through the House and through Committee Stage.  Our new approach will benefit the work of Enterprise Ireland, the IDA  and the other agencies.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke of tourism and adding value to it.  I was at an exhibition in Scotland recently that was visited by 37,000 people in one day.  The challenge for us in this part of the country is to encourage an all-island approach.  When Tourism Ireland or Enterprise Ireland take that approach &mdash; in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s case working with companies from Northern Ireland &mdash; there is an added curiosity abroad about what we are doing here.  There is greater support for the package of companies we have on offer and for their services and products <Col N="939"/>abroad.  There is an almost immediate forthcoming in terms of support and purchasing.  We must trade more on this factor.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked some specific questions.  The &euro;1 billion I mentioned refers to the 2008 export performance as against the 2007 performance.  He spoke about research and development and the commercialisation that arises from that.  This week I launched a guide to good practice in innovation and product development processes which describes what commercialisation is about.  We must explain what we do with research and development, how we commercialise our product or service and how it is funded to get to the marketplace.  There is a need for support in research and development but also in commercialisation.  The latter involves internationalising a company in order to sell its product abroad.  That means the high-potential start-up and all it entails.  The document I launched explains this.  I hope it will encourage Government to continue funding not only research and development but all the steps required afterwards to bring a product to the marketplace and make it happen for the company involved.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte also asked about the figure of 2 million persons at work, to which I referred.  That is the latest figure.  The next figure might be short of 2 million but whether it is above or below that line it is a hell of a lot different from the 1.1 million it was some time ago.  We are starting from a different base.  I offer that information as answer to his question.  The article on commercialisation in <i>The Irish Times </i> concerns the same issue and the same answer applies.</P>
        <P>Deputy Morgan mentioned the use of embassies abroad.  The greatest success Enterprise Ireland meets abroad is when the embassy and the agency offices work together.  I saw this done in Russia and one sees it constantly in London across the sectors.  The embassy staff are involved and the embassy building is used.  Business people are there working on behalf of, and for, Ireland abroad, attracting new markets.  That work goes on constantly within Enterprise Ireland on their trade missions abroad.</P>
        <P>In answer to Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s question regarding interpreters and assistance for companies in accessing markets, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA maintain a number of offices throughout the world which can offer these services.  They offer particular assistance to companies wishing to enter difficult markets.  The most recent example of this is Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s first toe into the Latin American market, which helped Irish companies to win orders worth &euro;25 million.  We expect to build our way into these markets from this base.  Irish food companies such as Glanbia and the Kerry Group are operating very successfully and employ some 5,000 people in the region.  The accumulated value of goods and services sold in Japan during this period was &euro;60 million.  There is huge potential to internationalise relevant research and development conducted in Ireland in the area of food, technology and farming.  We can also attract companies back to Ireland as foreign direct investors because we are seen as an innovative, creative and enterprising nation.</P>
        <P>Further collaboration is needed between Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and academia.  We must persuade large and small companies to engage with third level students so that they understand what is required by the market and can thereby meet their educational and employment needs.  County enterprise boards are expanding that engagement to secondary level and I would like to see a similar engagement at primary level because otherwise we will not serve the next generation well in terms of building a knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>I look forward to discussing the Bill further on Committee Stage and thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

	<P>In my contribution to Second Stage of the debate on 5 March, I spoke about the background to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, homelessness and the quality of new local authority estates.  Today, I wish discuss the issue of housing for the Traveller community.  The legislative framework for Traveller accommodation is set out in the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998.  Section 7 of that Act requires housing authorities to adopt Traveller accommodation programmes in their functional areas to accommodate the needs of Travellers.  The culture of the Traveller community must be recognised and local authorities must be committed to promoting equality and inclusion for travellers.  Living accommodation based on needs and family circumstances of Travellers is essential and should cater for the expression of their culture.  It is important for all of us that the Traveller culture is maintained in its original form.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Traveller families to settled estates should be done with the agreement of immediate neighbours and tenants because past experience has shown that many problems arise when this does not happen.  Allocating a dwelling to a household is an executive function but, notwithstanding this, it is important that the executive consults elected members, officials of the relevant health authorities and other interested parties who possess a wealth of local knowledge.  In cases where this does not happen, the results are self-evident.</P>
        <P>This important Bill aims to improve services and develop sustainable communities.  It provides local authorities which enhanced powers to deal with anti-social behaviour.  I welcome the significant amendment to the definition of &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; as set out in section 1(1) of the Housing Act 1970 to include, under four different headings, violence, threats, intimidation, coercion and harassment or serious obstruction of a person, behaviour which causes any significant or persistent impairment of a person&rsquo;s use or enjoyment of his or her home and damage to or defacement by writing or other marks of a property, including a person&rsquo;s home.</P>
        <P>The provision of one-off housing for persons or families should always be an important element of housing policy in order to allow personal and family needs to be considered separately.  This is particularly true in rural Ireland, where many sons and daughters have been forced to live in towns and settlements far from their parents and roots.  The time has come when we should consider maintaining people from rural areas in their own communities, particularly those who live in isolated areas or who have elderly parents.</P>
        <P>Section 11 replaces section 56(2) of the Housing Act 1966 and empowers the housing authority to provide and maintain services ancillary to housing developments, including roads, <Col N="941"/>shops, playgrounds, places of worship and sites for schools and other facilities.  It is important this section is also applied to the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and projects undertaken through public private partnerships on behalf of housing authorities.  These provisions will ensure that all future developments provide essential services.</P>
        <P>The screening regulatory impact assessment prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the Bill states that the scheme aims to source good quality rented accommodation, provide greater housing security for persons with long-term housing needs, reduce dependency on supplementary benefit allowances and long-term housing benefit, secure a greater social mix through the geographical disbursal of housing needs and contribute to better value for money for the State in the provision of long-term housing solutions.  I hope these worthy aims will be achieved.  In essence, the scheme proposed in the Bill addresses many of the concerns expressed by NGOs in the housing sector regarding rent supplements.  They claim that rent supplements provide no security to tenants, subsidise poor standards of accommodation and create unemployment traps due to conditions on employment.  Under the rent allowance scheme, rent is assessed under local authorities&rsquo; differential rent schemes for other forms of social housing.  The RIA identified the following as barriers to initial take up of the rental accommodation scheme introduced in 2004 &mdash; the poor quality of some private-rented accommodation; the unwillingness of some landlords to join RAS; households living in overcrowded conditions; and a shortage of supply for particular types of accommodation in some areas at reasonable rent levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another issue addressed under section 39 is the resale of properties.  Section 39 lays out the resale conditions of the scheme.  It allows for resale at any time, so should not act as a barrier to future housing options or be inflexible regarding changes of circumstances.  In relation to resale and repayment of a portion of the value to the housing association, section 39(7) allows that where the purchaser has made &ldquo;material improvement&rdquo;, this may be taken into account in calculating the proportion repayable.  The Bill provides the housing authority with first refusal to purchase the property on resale, and gives it power of approval for any other potential purchaser.  This power can be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to refuse resale to those who have engaged in anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>Although there is no specific provision in the 2008 Bill providing for a review of the incremental purchase scheme, the RIA states that the scheme will be subject to a pilot phase in a number of housing authorities before being implemented more broadly.  The pilot phase will be managed and reviewed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Thereafter the Department will continue to monitor and review progress in implementing the scheme.  Another issue is the sale of flats.</P>
        <P>The proposed incremental purchase scheme does not apply to the sale of new flats or apartments.  Section 36(2) specifically excludes from the incremental purchase scheme the sale of any dwelling that is &ldquo;a separate and self-contained apartment in a premises, divided into 2 or more apartments, which would require arrangements for the upkeep of common areas, works or services other than by the purchaser&rdquo;.  Perhaps this is an area that needs to be kept under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill provides a modern framework for delivering social housing.  The legislation in this area dates back over 40 years and the Bill will give effect to the social housing reform measures that are detailed in the policy document published in 2007, &ldquo;Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities&rdquo;.  That document set out a vision for the development of the Irish housing sector over the next ten years.  It looks at delivering quality sustainable housing in a strategic manner.  It also looks at building sustainable communities and improving the quality of life for all. </P><Col N="942"/>
        <P>Food and shelter are a basic human necessity and the Government has an obligation and a duty to assist those who are unable to help themselves.  Fianna F&aacute;il in government has a proud tradition of looking after the less well off and the enactment of this Bill carries on that tradition.</P>
        <P>The priority afforded to housing by this Government was articulated in Towards 2016, the national development plan and the Government&rsquo;s statement on housing policy, &ldquo;Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities&rdquo;.  The Bill sets out the role of housing authorities in providing housing services, including the provision of social and affordable housing support, across a range of schemes for the purposes of meeting a household&rsquo;s need.  It puts housing services plans on a statutory footing and also ensures that stakeholders are given the opportunity to comment on draft plans.</P>
        <P>While the Bill does not alter fundamentally the distribution of housing functions across the different levels of local government, it provides for better planning and integration of services by providing for housing services plans which take a broader strategic perspective at county and city level.  The Bill ensures, when assessing local housing needs, that attention will now be paid to the national strategy.  This is to ensure that communities are built that meet the diverse needs of the residents, are safe and inclusive, well planned and well run.</P>
        <P>The Government commitment under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, was to achieve 27,000 social housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo; over the three year period 2007-09 as a whole, not 27,000 in each of the three years.  In terms of delivery, we set out to reach the first one third of this 27,000 unit target &mdash; or 9,000 starts &mdash; in 2007, the first of the three years in the target period.  By end-2007, the target had been exceeded with a total of 9,061 starts achieved across the local authority and voluntary and co-operative housing programmes and the rental accommodation scheme.  Last year saw significant delivery under the main housing programmes.  The target is a further 9,000 social housing starts this year, which will be a remarkable achievement in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of course the financial crisis means that more people than ever will require housing assistance.  In 2009 &euro;1.54 billion in funding was secured for social housing as well as an additional &euro;80 million under the capital loan and subsidy scheme for voluntary housing projects.  To further meet demand, recently a new long leasing initiative was launched, under which authorities will procure properties on long term leases of ten to 20 years to meet demand for social housing.  A fund of &euro;20 million has been made available and will, I hope, help reduce waiting lists for social housing.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran, has said he expects that through this measure at least 2,000 additional homes will be leased this year.</P>
        <P>There are measures and funding in place to ensure that the Government supports the less well off and is committed to meeting their housing needs.  Of course the recession means there is a greater demand for social housing while public finances are under greater pressure than ever.  This Bill, however, is evidence of a commitment to addressing these needs and to putting them on a better legislative footing.</P>
        <P>As regards some of the initiatives, the home choice scheme is an excellent measure, but the &euro;40,000 income limit is somewhat restrictive in rural areas and is holding people back.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about this on a number of occasions.  People in rural areas find it difficult to reach that &euro;40,000 income target.  The scheme has great potential, but many of those who could avail of it at a lower income scale can now buy three-bedroomed semis in rural areas for &euro;140,000 or &euro;150,000.  They do not need &euro;280,000, so perhaps the officials and the Minister of State might have a look at this.</P><Col N="943"/>
        <P>As regards affordable homes, from my experience in respect of the areas I represent, the scheme has worked well in certain areas while not so well in others.  The take-up was not sufficient, for instance, as regards some 12 affordable houses built in my home town &mdash; and that was in the good times when house property prices were running high.  The local authority had to take them back into its stock and allocate them to people on the housing list.  The scheme will work in towns close to the centres of population such as county towns or even seaside villages, but in my experience not in the small villages.</P>
        <P>The shared ownership scheme has been excellent and has worked very well.  When I was a local authority member I had contact with a good many people who got onto the housing ladder under that scheme.  After two or three years people who avail of the scheme normally buy out their properties.  At least they have been able to get onto the housing ladder because of the scheme.  In recent times, however, I notice that some people have availed of the scheme whose circumstances have improved.  I know of two cases where a person is paying half mortgage and half rent, and because circumstances have improved the rent now nearly comes to &euro;300 a month.  Taking the two payments together, those people now find themselves paying more that they would have had to pay, with a straight mortgage.  I wonder whether the Minister of State might take a look at that, perhaps, with the local authorities.  The numbers are not large, but nonetheless such people are trapped into a situation whereby they are probably paying up to &euro;600 a month, whereas they might have to pay less with a straight mortgage from a local authority.  They would not then need to pay rent, and whatever is being paid comes straight off the mortgage balance.</P>
        <P>As regards voluntary housing agencies, I was involved in a local organisation which built 28 houses for elderly people.  It was a fantastic scheme and those people came in from rural areas to live in the town.  We were very fortunate that the site was close to a nursing home, the church and railway station.  It has given those people a new life and as they move on, new people move in.  However, families living in these voluntary housing scheme houses cannot, unfortunately, buy their homes.  Irish people like eventually to buy their own homes but the tenants of these houses are unable to do so.  Perhaps some way should be found to give them the opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>People are delighted to get such a home.  They get that home because they face certain financial circumstances.  However, when their circumstances improve, their rents go up.  However, they are in a catch-22 situation because even though their circumstances have improved, they can never own their homes.</P>
        <P>As a public representative, I know there are many single fathers who, for one reason or another, find themselves homeless.  They are not regarded as a high priority by the local authorities, although I know it is very difficult to house everybody.  There should be some policy in respect of such people.  Quite a few of them, perhaps through their own fault, find themselves with no home, in particular people who are unemployed.  They find it difficult to get accommodation and they are very low on the needs scale in local authorities.  Sometimes they can find it very difficult to get rent allowance.  Will the Minister of State consider doing something to alleviate some of the pressures on those people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is long over due.  I am glad it has come to the House to be debated.  The issues raised in it are very important and in a constituency such as the one I represent, many of them are hugely important and need to be addressed immediately, if that could be done.  We have a long waiting list for social housing and we have the same problems with management companies that prevail in many other areas.  There are issues around anti-social behaviour, which I wish to address specifically, and homelessness.  In <Col N="944"/>fairness, all these issues are addressed in the Bill but they could certainly be identified in the area I represent.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the purchase of local authority flats has not been addressed.  I welcome what the Minister of State said, that the Attorney General will comment on it and this will be available before the Bill goes through the House.  Much of the local authority housing in my constituency is represented by flats from the Liberties to Kilmainham to Inchicore and so on.</P>
        <P>The issue of the purchase of flats has been on the agenda for a long time for these people.  Many of them have been tenants for many years and have paid much rent over that time.  They feel discriminated against in comparison to perhaps other members of their family who have a local authority house and an entitlement to purchase it.  There is an urgency about giving these people the opportunity to purchase their flats, if they so wish.  I understand there are legal problems but these must be overcome as quickly as possible.  I hope that happens before the Bill goes through the House.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the issue of anti-social behaviour because, unfortunately, it has been particularly relevant to me in the past couple of weeks as a result of specific incident.  It is a problem which plagues many communities and I welcome the fact that it is being addressed, to a certain extent, in the Bill.  I do not want to identify a particular location or area, because that would be unfair, but I want to identify ongoing anti-social behaviour of a very serious nature in my constituency which is causing quite a number of problems.</P>
        <P>It reflects a combination of landlord greed, inaction by various authorities, social deprivation and drug-related problems.  When one packages together all those problems, one can clearly see that we have a huge difficulty in trying to address this issue.  The houses are privately owned and rented.  The people renting them have multiple social problems and, unfortunately, they have attracted to the area many more people with similar problems.  Drugs and alcohol, prostitution and violence have been reported to me as ongoing problems in that immediate area.</P>
        <P>There are two sides to this problem.  First, the tenants must be considered.  Who inspects the apartments and decides that funding is to be made available from the State coffers to pay that landlord to provide these absolutely appalling bedsits, which is the only way to describe them?  What agency should inspect them?  The level of inspection is very low &mdash; I believe approximately one in ten properties is inspected.  This is simply not good enough because this problem is ongoing.  It allows the landlord to collect his rent on a regular basis because it is paid by the State and it would appear that no questions are asked.  The poorest and the weakest are being allowed to live in effective squalor.  They suffer from drug or alcohol addiction and, as I said, prostitution and violence are not uncommon.</P>
        <P>The second aspect to this scenario is that the neighbours who live in the vicinity are also exposed to the consequences of this appalling behaviour on a regular basis.  They are intimidated, the area is strewn with rubbish, the gardens are rat infested, their children are afraid and the elderly will not go out in the day, never mind in the evening.  It is no exaggeration to say that they live in fear of their lives.  I admit it is a slightly extreme example but everything I have said is absolutely accurate.  I would be happy to provide the Minister of State with more detail on this and would welcome his intervention, which might be very worthwhile.</P>
        <P>Arising from that is the next issue of homelessness which I am happy is being addressed in the Bill.  An argument could be put forward by many who are aware of the situation, and with some validity, that at least these people have accommodation.  If these bedsits and flats are closed down, where will these unfortunate people go?  That raises an issue around the services provided for these people, including providing them with backup for their alcohol and drug <Col N="945"/>addiction problems and with a decent level of accommodation.  Unfortunately, all these issues are linked.  There is some validity in the question that if this block of houses is closed down and these people are thrown out, where will they go?  That is part of a major social issue as well as the homelessness issue.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I appreciate the issue of homelessness is a complex one.  The reasons for it are complicated and cannot simply be dismissed or sorted out in one fell swoop.  Nevertheless, they must be addressed.  Homelessness arises for a variety of reasons.  There is a social responsibility to minimise the effects of it on the poorest and the weakest.  The official figure shows the number of homeless stands at approximately 5,000, but it is likely to be significantly greater than that because estimating the numbers at any given time is almost impossible and many of these people are under the age of 18.  There are two issues there &mdash; the number of homeless and the fact many are under the age of 18.</P>
        <P>The issue of homelessness has been on the agenda.  Many people have written reports on it and there is an endless number of documents on it.  The failure is the lack of any comprehensive approach to addressing it.  I refer to the effort made after Christmas to provide temporary accommodation for homeless people.  This was driven by the temperature.</P>

	<P>The restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s public finances to a stable and sustainable footing presents a significant challenge, but one the Government is determined to meet.  Already steps have been taken to meet this challenge but the deterioration in the domestic and international economy has demonstrated that there remains a need for further action.</P>
        <P>Many countries are facing challenging budgetary positions.  This week the European Commission, when opening the excessive deficit procedure for Ireland, also did so for Greece, Spain and France, while the UK and Hungary have had a procedure open for some time now.  I have already stated current indications are that economic activity in Ireland will be very weak this year and the publication of today&rsquo;s annual growth figures for last year underlines this point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Lower levels of economic activity will obviously have implications for future tax revenue receipts and, consequently, the borrowing requirement.  Internationally, the latest prediction by the IMF forecasts that global economic activity will contract by between 0.5% and 1% this year.  This would be the first decline in activity in 60 years.  For advanced countries, which constitute a large part of our export markets, GDP this year is projected to decline by over 3%</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Our position as a small, open economy means that we attract a high degree of international attention, particularly from the markets on which we are increasingly dependent for borrowing because of our budgetary position.  These markets need to have confidence that we will take the necessary budgetary measures to restore the public finances to a sustainable footing.  We cannot look outward for solutions.  The primary source of our recovery must be found from <Col N="946"/>within.  We will have to adjust our cost base, improve our competitiveness, restore order to the public finances and revitalise the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The addendum to the stability programme update, published on 9 January last, forecast total tax receipts in 2009 of approximately &euro;37 billion.  However, in light of the continuing weakness in the Exchequer returns, my Department now anticipates that there could be a shortfall of up to &euro;3 billion on this figure. This would mean that only &euro;34 billion in tax receipts would be collected in 2009, representing a year on year decline of over 16%.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0" Just="Left">In light of this, the Government decided to announce further measures to stabilise the budgetary situation.  This will involve the introduction of additional taxation and expenditure measures in 2009 to address the continued deterioration in the public finances.  The supplementary budget will be presented to the D&aacute;il on 7 April and will set out a multi-annual plan to restore stability to the public finances.  The scale of the challenge we face means that all options must now be on the table, including action on both current and capital expenditure, as well as revenue raising measures.</P>
        <P>The Government has already taken significant action to restore stability to the public finances and the supplementary budget will continue this process.  Taking action now will ensure that confidence in our public finances can be restored and that we are positioned to take advantage of a recovery in the international situation when it occurs.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, in formulating the supplementary budget in the context of what is best for the economy, the Government will seek to be as close as possible to the general Government deficit target of 9.5% of GDP.  Regarding the details of what will be presented in the supplementary budget, it is not the usual practice to speculate in advance on the content of any budget and I do not propose to deviate from this practice now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, the Government has sought to engage all parties in our efforts to address the difficulties in the public finances.  With this in mind I have made my Department available to the Opposition on an unprecedented scale by arranging for officials to brief the main Opposition spokespersons on the latest available figures and on the emerging position.  The Opposition has also been asked to submit any proposals it may have to the Department of Finance for costing by officials.  I am open to considering what further information that can be made available can be put into the public domain in advance of the supplementary budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that context, I have noted that during this week&rsquo;s pre-budget debate Deputy Bruton outlined proposals on dealing with the structural deficit.  I believe that there is some common ground between us and I would be happy to engage further with him in the next week.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the Government&rsquo;s commitments to the EU couched in terms of the budget deficit or what is commonly known as the structural deficit, which makes allowances for the stage of the business cycle one is at?  What information has changed which led the Taoiseach to withdraw from the commitment he was very categorical about in early March that 9.5% of GDP would be the borrowing target?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give the House more information than we have seen to date so that we can have an intelligent discussion about the options that face us?  Will we see what happened on the last occasion, where the Minister came in with budgetary announcements and promptly had to do U-turns on many of them because they had not been subject to proper scrutiny or teased out?</P>

By convention, I am not made aware of what has been discussed by Deputy Bruton and my Department and I can assure him I have every confidence in the protocols it follows that it provides him with all the information it can regarding these matters.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has only to request the information he seeks from my Department and it will be made available to him.  The one item which cannot be disclosed to him relate to the preparations for the Government itself because the Government, under the Constitution, is entitled to confidentiality in the exercise of its deliberations.  I do not know if the Deputy has made such a request because my Department does not disclose to me what its discussions with him have been.

        <P>I wrote to the Minister on 13 March and have had no reply to any of my requests for information.  The notion that we are being brought in to engage in an intelligent debate is entirely spurious.  We can go to the Department to get proposals costed, as we could in a general election.  That is nothing.  It does not tell us anything about the state of the economy.  It does not give us the Minister&rsquo;s revised forecasts for tax, the economy or spending projections.  It does not tell us about the costs of different proposals which have been developed by Mr. McCarthy and his colleagues.</P>
        <P>If the Minister wants an intelligent debate, that is the sort of information which should be here on the floor of the House.  Let us subject it to scrutiny and try and make the best decisions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have arranged for the Deputy to meet with myself and an official today so that information, in so far as it can be provided, will be provided.  I am prepared to engage with him on a political basis regarding matters which cannot be disclosed by my officials.  I cannot go beyond that at this stage.  I received the Deputy&rsquo;s letter earlier this week, I have been considering it and have arranged a meeting.  I will endeavour to meet him and the Labour Party spokesperson, from whom I received a letter dated 23 March today, on the same basis.  That is as far as I can progress this matter.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned in the House the day before yesterday the fact that in his estimation the structural deficit accounted for approximately 8% of the total borrowing requirement this year and that was the position in January.  My Department is revising that estimate.  None of these calculations stand still, as the Deputy, who is an economist, well knows.  The calculations made in December are not relevant in April.  The commitments made in the addendum in early January were based on a December analysis which, in light of the economic deterioration and the worsening economic conditions, no longer holds for today.</P>
        <P>The science of economics is much like the science of meteorology.  One is predicting future weather patterns.  The patterns have changed since the addendum for growth was produced.  Even this morning the disclosure that there was substantial economic decline in the latter part of last years changes our assessment of a number of positions, as the Deputy is well aware.  I <Col N="948"/>am willing to discuss these matters with him and I am also willing to provide from within my Department the information which will enable him to make choices and options.  I am prepared to discuss any choices or options he wishes to put to me.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will set out and explain the economic priorities he identified to a newspaper (details supplied) including his proposal to clamp down on crony capitalism as reported on 17 March 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[12684/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards economic priorities, there has been extensive discussion in the House of all aspects of the economic position.  In my interviews with the media over the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period I did not say anything that I have not said before.  As Deputies will know, Ireland has been the subject of much unfavourable comment in some foreign media and my concern was to counteract that by presenting a more balanced view of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Regarding corporate governance, I explained my belief that the Government should tackle the issue of cross-directorships in financial institutions.  By that I mean that situations where there appears to be a reciprocal distribution of directorships between companies, albeit not on a formalised basis, should be appropriately restricted and controlled to ensure that good corporate governance is not prejudiced.  I also indicated a concern about the ability of financial institutions to select, as chairpersons, individuals who have had extensive executive responsibilities within the same institution.  Again, this could lead to weaker governance and should be controlled.</P>
        <P>I will be discussing the development of these ideas and how best they can be translated into practice with my Cabinet colleagues shortly.  The Government will also, of course, be considering how these issues may be relevant beyond the financial services sector.  These are important issues and require careful study.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime the Government has considered provisions to deal with certain specific things that have come to light, including new requirements in relation to loans to directors and connected persons.  However I believe it is also necessary to consider the issue of corporate governance from a wider perspective.</P>
        <P>I would favour a review to be carried out by the Company Law Review Group which would consider the revision of the existing combined code on corporate governance.  Deputies might wish to note that the UK  recently announced an independent review of bank corporate governance including the balance of skills, experience and independence required on boards, the effectiveness of board practices and the role of institutional shareholders in engaging effectively with companies and monitoring of boards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  A front-page article in the international edition of the <i>Financial Times</i> on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &mdash; exactly a year after the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day massacre in regard to Anglo Irish Bank shares &mdash; stated that Ireland is planning to introduce tough legislation to clamp down on &ldquo;crony capitalism and excess bank lending&rdquo; in the wake of the property bubble that has &ldquo;hammered&rdquo; its leading banks.  The article refers to a statement by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that there is a problem in all small countries in that there are &ldquo;too many incestuous relationships&rdquo; within their financial systems.  This is an extraordinary statement for a Minister for Finance to make about his country&rsquo;s banks.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister include in his definition of &ldquo;incestuous relationships&rdquo; the relationship of Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick to the Irish Nationwide Building Society in regard to the warehousing of loans of &euro;122 million?  Would he include in this definition a situation where the board of the <Col N="949"/>Irish Nationwide Building Society, even after it had been guaranteed by the taxpayer to the tune of billions of euro, paid out a bonus of &euro;1 million to its chief executive officer and persisted with pension arrangements for this individual which appear to amount to some &euro;27 million?  We should bear in mind that one quarter of this pension will be tax free and that most of the pension arrangements involve further mitigation of tax, particularly in regard to estate duty taxes and inheritance taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a particular concern that large companies &mdash; particularly banks, for which I bear ministerial responsibility &mdash; are overly reliant on a small circle of persons for appointments to their boards.  It is important, in the long-term interest of the companies themselves and in the interest of the public and stakeholders, that there should be an opportunity for new voices to be heard and fresh thinking to be deployed.  Where a relatively small group is meeting and working together over time, an accepted way of working and viewing issues tends to become established.  Many of us could produce examples from different areas of life where it was a newcomer or outsider who first identified something that was missed by all the insiders.</P>
        <P>Clearly, in a relatively small company, the number of suitable people for promotion to senior positions will be always limited.  However, I am of the view that we must do more to encourage boards to bring in those with a wider range of views and backgrounds.  I am also of the view that alignments between bank directors and other companies &mdash; in other words, cross-directorships &mdash; are not helpful to the proper management of the banking system.  That is why I have raised this specific issue.  It is one of the lessons we must learn from the events we have witnessed in the past year.</P>
        <P>The circumstances of the loan between Mr. FitzPatrick and the Irish Nationwide Building Society are under investigation by the regulator.  We must await its report, which I have no doubt will establish the facts, as it has established the facts in regard to other matters.  In regard to Mr. Fingleton&rsquo;s pension arrangement and the payment to him of a bonus, we must distinguish between the two transactions.  My Department is in correspondence with the Irish Nationwide Building Society on the matter of the bonus payment.  I have also asked for further information about it.  It seems the bonus arrangement was sanctioned before the guarantee was given but paid afterward.  I want to be in a position to assess my options in regard to that bonus payment to see whether it can be recovered, first by the society itself, or, in the absence of a power in the society to do so, what options are available to me as Minister to deal with it on foot of the guarantee arrangement.</P>
        <P>In regard to the pension fund, again, the full facts will have to be established.  From the limited information available to me on the basis of such conversations as I have had with the two directors appointed at my request to the board of the Irish Nationwide Building Society, the value of the amount transferred into the pension fund in the first instance is substantially less than the figures quoted.  The current value of the pension fund has substantially diminished with changes in stock values.  That being said, this matter requires further examination and establishment of the facts before further assessment can be made of the options open to the institution and, in default of such an option, the options available to me as Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister not agree that the best way to break up an incestuous relationship is to get rid of some of the parties to the relationship?  Does the Minister accept that he has shown himself to be extraordinarily slow in bringing about change in the bank boards and that such change is a critical measure in terms of showing international bond holders that we are serious about bank reform?</P><Col N="950"/>
        <P>The Minister introduced the legislation guaranteeing the financial institutions at the end of September.  Since then there has been much talk from both the Minister and the Taoiseach about due diligence.  Some of us have even begun to believe it is a person.  Where was the due diligence when it came to discovering that this chief executive officer and others had accumulated extraordinary entitlements at a time when they were coming cap in hand to the Minister, on behalf of the taxpayer, to bail out their institutions?  Why did &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; not step into the frame, from wherever she was, to point out that this guarantee arrangement is subject to an oversight, which is a common arrangement in business deals?  Did the Minister have the benefit of legal advisers when he offered the guarantee and left himself absolutely naked in regard to the rights &mdash; very expensive rights from a taxpayer&rsquo;s point of view &mdash; that were accumulated by the chief executive officers and board members not only of the Irish Nationwide Building Society but also of Anglo Irish Bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refute the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that there has been little change in the management of the six institutions which were guaranteed as and from 30 September 2008.  In the less than six-month period since then, there has been a change of chairman or chief executive officer, or both, in five of those institutions.  There have been substantial changes in the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  This represents a significant amount of change in the leadership personnel of the six institutions in the period since the guarantee was given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no change in the largest institution.</P>

	<P>I am not willing to get into personalities on the floor of the House.  I am making the point that there has been substantial change in the board management structure of five of the six institutions since the guarantee was given.  The Attorney General, the legal adviser to the Government under the Constitution, was present throughout the discussions on the guarantee.  Lest there be further misrepresentation of my position, let it be clear that neither the chief executive officer of the Irish Nationwide Building Society nor the then chairman of Anglo Irish Bank made any representations to me whatsoever in connection with the guarantee.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I received the report of the covered institutions remuneration oversight committee, CIROC, on 3 March.  It was common knowledge that remuneration levels for senior bankers based on salary, bonus, pension and other payments were high long before the Government guarantee.  Some of the relevant material was in the public domain.  The CIROC was established as part of the guarantee scheme for the covered institutions and its report has provided additional specific details in regard to remuneration levels in the banks.  The committee reported that with the exception of the Irish Nationwide Building Society, where the chief executive officer was paid a prearranged incentive bonus of &euro;1 million for 2008, no bonuses have been or will be paid to chief executive officers and senior executive management teams in respect of their performances in 2008-2009.</P><Col N="951"/>

        <P>Recent detailed disclosures in regard to the remuneration of the chief executive officer of the Irish Nationwide Building Society require investigation.  I wrote to the acting chairman of the board on 12 March stating that I considered the payment of the bonus to be potentially a breach of the guarantee scheme and seeking an immediate reply as to what the board intended to do.  While the reply to that letter indicated that the payment concerned was contractually committed before the Government guarantee, I have asked that the two directors appointed by the board nominated by me should review all these issues and that I should receive a report within one month.  I have also requested the board to brief me next week on its plans for the society, including the review of management and board personnel.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the guarantee scheme, two non-executive directors nominated by me were appointed to each of the covered institutions.  In nationalising Anglo Irish Bank, I have ensured an overhaul of the board.  Also, under the terms agreed on the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland I can appoint up to 25% of the board members subject to the finalisation of the recapitalisation proposals announced in February.  As the Deputy will be aware, there have been changes of chairperson and CEO in Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life &amp; Permanent and EBS.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Was this bonus paid prior to the appointment of the Government-appointed directors?  Was the payment of the bonus brought forward to a date earlier than when the person in question was entitled to receive it?  The year end for Irish Nationwide Building Society is 31 December and Mr. Fingleton would appear to have been paid the bonus well prior to that date.</P>
        <P>It is unusual, as I see no great difference between this case and that of the CEO of Irish Life &amp; Permanent, whose removal was far more forceful as the Minister indicated his expectation that the board would live up to its responsibilities.  When it did not, the Minister asked the members to meet him and made certain that Mr. Denis Casey stood down.  Why is the Minister not taking the same line with Mr. Fingleton?  A Government guarantee scheme has been put in place but if it had not been, would Irish Nationwide have been able to pay the bonus?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a number of interesting questions.  With regard to the position of the two directors appointed to the board of the society at my request, neither held the office of director at the time of the payment of the guarantee or execution of whatever arrangement was arrived at to promise the bonus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the bonus be paid?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the date to hand in my brief today.  On receipt of detailed information I will be in a position to advise the Deputy.  He will appreciate I do not have the information at this stage.  The two directors were not members of the board at the time when any payment was made, so they are entirely strangers to this transaction.</P>
        <P>In regard to the position of Mr. Casey and Irish Life &amp; Permanent, I went to great lengths during those board meetings to make clear that I would not be drawn out on whether I had indicated to any directors or the board my attitude regarding his status.  It is correct for the Deputy to draw the comparison but I behaved in exactly the same way on this occasion.  It is not appropriate for a Minister for Finance, in his communications with a board or directors while meetings of the board are pending, to express a view about what a board should do.</P>
        <P>I made it clear on television at the time that it was quite impossible to do so given the possible legal exposures for the State.  I am sure Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell would appreciate that as a deputy Opposition spokesperson on Finance.  A Minister for Finance who has guaranteed insti<Col N="952"/>tutions should not put himself into a position where he exposes the State to any liability by injudicious comments about what should or should not be done by the boards, which have the responsibility of performing their duties in the management of these societies and banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister sees no great difference in the cases, will he now tell the board members of Irish Nationwide Building Society that he expects them to live up to their responsibilities?  Will he pursue every legal avenue to ensure this &euro;1 million bonus is repaid to Irish Nationwide by Mr. Fingleton?  Will he, if necessary, introduce retrospective legislation or a form of legislation like that being brought in by President Obama relating to AIG?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made it clear in my reply that all options will be considered.  In the first instance it is a matter for the society and its board to investigate these transactions and see what options are available to the society.  In default of any action by the society I will, on legal advice, see what options are available to me.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his revised forecast for the numbers and rate of unemployment for end of year 2009; the way this forecast compares with the forecast unemployment rate for the EU as a whole; and if he is considering measures to stem the rate of job losses.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[12767/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest forecasts for EU labour market developments are those published by the European Commission in January.  At the time, the European Union unemployment rate was forecast to average 8.7% this year.  On a survey basis, the latest data show a sharp contraction in employment in the final quarter of last year &mdash; employment in this quarter was over 4% lower than in the same quarter a year earlier.  In the addendum to the stability programme update published in January, unemployment was forecast to average 9.2% in 2009.  The assumed end-year figure was for an unemployment rate of around 10%.</P>
        <P>The quarterly national household survey was published last month.  Unemployment on a survey basis rose from 4.5% in the final quarter of 2007 to 7.7% in the same quarter of last year.  Although not designed to measure unemployment, live register figures give an indication as to more recent developments.  On this basis, when account is taken of seasonal factors, the number on the live register rose by 33,000 month-on-month in January, and by 26,700 in February.  The implied unemployment rate, using this measure, in February was 10.4%.</P>
        <P>My Department will publish revised unemployment projections in the forthcoming supplementary budget and these will involve a significant upward revision to the January forecasts.  The sharp increase in unemployment is the most worrying aspect of the economic downturn and I want to assure Deputies that the Government is doing all in its power to limit the loss in employment.</P>
        <P>First and foremost, we are working to generate the conditions necessary for an economic recovery, which includes the restoration of order to the public finances.  We have brought in additional fiscal measures and will bring in more in the forthcoming supplementary budget in order to put the public finances on a more sustainable structural path.  This will help restore international confidence in Ireland as a place to invest.  We are working to improve competitiveness through investing in infrastructure and in education and skills.  The recent pension levy in the public sector will also have a favourable impact on competitiveness through a positive demonstration effect.</P><Col N="953"/>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, we have taken measures to get credit flowing.  For example, as part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, the extra capacity will be available to small and medium-sized enterprises. Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>We are also taking measures to ensure those losing their jobs have access to retraining.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in conjunction with F&Aacute;S are working together to respond quickly and effectively to the rising numbers of people who are now unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister was disturbed to see the latest GDP figures published today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>They show that compared to the same quarter last year, GDP has fallen by 7.5%, with investment falling by 30.5%.  The consequences of these trends are extremely worrying.  Reflecting that, we are seeing unemployment numbers rising by 1,000 per day.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that it is not sufficient for the Government to chase down the economy with further tax cuts?  There must be a positive investment plan designed to protect and create employment.  Fine Gael has today put forward proposals for such a plan, which would make investments on a commercial basis that would not draw on the Exchequer.  Will the Minister consider the need for such a programme so that parallel to the fiscal correction, we can have a genuine job strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that the protection of existing jobs and the retraining of those who do not have jobs must form the cornerstone of our job strategy.  We already have programmes in place to protect businesses already providing employment through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We already have training and retraining arrangements in place.  We must examine how appropriate and focused these are in current circumstances.</P>
        <P>I also agree with Deputy Bruton in that there is clearly a shortage of investment funds available for the Government for the implementation of the national development plan.  In that context I will examine any constructive proposals for alternative financing for important public projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s willingness to do so as we have put forward a detailed programme that focuses on key arteries that are vital to long-term competitiveness, like the communications and power networks.  The Minister has indicated we have strategies to protect jobs but if we are seeing an attrition rate of 1,000 jobs lost per day, it does not sound like the strategies are very effective.  Is the Minister considering specific proposals designed to help employers get through a very difficult period and protect jobs in the short term?</P>

        <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I am examining various proposals but Deputy Bruton will appreciate that these matters are not easy to resolve because the reason for the drop in the numbers in employment is the international downturn which has impacted severely on a small <Col N="954"/>open economy such as ours.  There is clearly a global banking crisis which is not unique to this country.  There was a pre-existing housing contraction which impacted on the construction industry before the global downturn began, but it is now clear that we are in a global downturn and this has had a severe impact on our small, open economy.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The measures open to the Government in these circumstances are limited but one of the most important initiatives that has been taken is that taken by businesses and workers themselves, namely, their willingness to take pay reductions to maintain the competitiveness of the goods and services they provide and to attend to their cost base.  That is being done in many private enterprises in Ireland and it is being done by the State as well.  It is essential the State does this in order that the general competitiveness of Ireland can be improved on the global stage.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has agreed the recapitalisation terms to be offered to Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, and these terms will be put before shareholders of the two banks in the coming weeks; indeed, in the case of Bank of Ireland, I understand they will be put before a general meeting of the bank tomorrow.  The recapitalisation package will provide &euro;3.5 billion in core tier 1 capital for each bank.  The State will receive preference shares with an annual coupon of 8%, as well as warrants for the purchase of shares in five years&rsquo; time at predetermined prices.  The terms of the recapitalisation include a bank customer package which includes additional capacity for mortgage and small and medium-sized enterprise lending.  The Government is in discussions with the other covered institutions concerning their respective capital positions.</P>
        <P>With regard to impaired loans, the Government is conscious that in current market circumstances there is a need to bring greater certainty and transparency to the operations of systemically important financial institutions, in particular in regard to specific asset classes currently perceived as carrying a higher than average risk.  Irish financial institutions have very little exposure to the sort of complex financial instruments which are weighing on the balance sheets of many banks internationally.  However, Irish institutions have engaged in lending for land and property development, and construction, which has exposed them to a specific risk at a time of falling property prices and difficult economic conditions.  The Government, therefore, announced on 11 February, along with its recapitalisation programme, that it would examine options for risk mitigation in this area.  This work is currently under way.</P>
        <P>In this context, I have asked Dr. Peter Bacon and the National Treasury Management Agency to report to me on the management and reduction of risks of bank balance sheets.  I have seen the initial report prepared by Dr. Bacon for the NTMA.  The proposals, with ongoing work at EU and European Central Bank level, will inform the considerations and any decisions the Government may take in this area.  I will bring forward proposals in this area as a matter of priority.</P>
        <P>As with all of the actions taken by the Government to address the issues faced by the banking sector, a key objective in the consideration on impaired assets will be to ensure that any State involvement will protect the interests of the taxpayer.</P>

Will the Minister explain, if he is considering setting up a toxic bank, what will be the cost to the taxpayer in terms of write-downs on developers&rsquo; loans?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no proposal to establish what Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell described as a toxic bank.  No such proposal is among the options being considered by the Government.  The position of the Government is that the Cabinet has been briefed in an informal way about the nature of the options involved.  The Government&rsquo;s consideration of this matter has not gone beyond that and, as I indicated in my reply, I will be bringing proposals to the Government in due course following a detailed consideration of the report from the NTMA and Dr. Bacon.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the position of the banks.  Discussions have not been entered into with any of the guaranteed institutions or other institutions on any formalised basis in regard to this.  I cannot and am not briefed to answer in regard to what contacts have been made between Dr. Bacon and-or the NTMA in the context of the preparation of his report.  It may be that he has made informal contacts with different financial institutions for the purpose of assembling the information and making the assessments he makes in his report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Minister intend isolating what is now familiarly termed toxic debt?  If I might make a proposal, when the Minister is examining considerations, Fine Gael has put forward a position which is, effectively, that instead of setting up a toxic bank, one would allow the toxic debt to remain in the existing banks and set up fresh banks, which would cost the State less.  The Minister still has not quantified what will be the cost to the taxpayer of dealing with the situation in regard to toxic debt and of ensuring funds flow to small businesses.  Will the Minister give consideration to the Fine Gael proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell insists on using the expression &ldquo;toxic debt&rdquo;.  Toxic debt in banking discussion generally relates to the kind of paper instruments which were generated in the United States and were common in the United Kingdom banking sector &mdash; derivative instruments and the like.  They do not exist to any substantial extent and, in fact, exist to a minimal extent in the Irish banking sector.  As I pointed out in my reply, the exposures of the Irish banks relate to property, which is not a toxic asset and has a residual value.  It is important the Deputies understand this.  It is accepted by most international analysts and by those who examine these questions.</P>
        <P>The continued use of the phrase &ldquo;toxic&rdquo;, while popular from a political point of view, does not characterise the nature of what we are dealing with here.  We are dealing with substantial exposures to property loans where moneys were advanced in the context of falling asset prices.  The various options being canvassed at the NTMA and analysed by Dr. Bacon are being analysed in that context.  No final decision has been made by the Government on this matter and, as I indicated in my reply, any final decision will take into account and be based on the best interests of the taxpayer and the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister expect to make the decision on this?  The Minister refers to not using the term &ldquo;toxic debt&rdquo;.  We can call them under-performing or non-performing loans.  When one is talking about write-offs of 60%, they are highly toxic.  The Minister continuously tells us that the world is looking in on us.  The world is looking at the Minister also.  These are regarded as toxic debts.  When will the Minister deal with the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that the credit default swaps with regard to Ireland narrowed dramatically in the past week or two.  The market judgment in that particularly specu<Col N="956"/>lative market &mdash; a market for which I do not have great regard, although it is worth noting since it was recited at length in the House in recent times &mdash; is that these particular instruments have now narrowed where Ireland is concerned, and, therefore, the level of speculative, crazed gambling on the future of this country has disappeared somewhat.  One of the reasons it has disappeared is because of the recent visit to Ireland of the President of the European Central Bank and the clear and unequivocal position he took that Ireland is a member of the eurozone, like any other member.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated I will bring proposals to the Government in due course but, as Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell would expect, the interests of the taxpayer have to be safeguarded in any analysis we are conducting of this question.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he has requested a report from the regulator of credit unions on the ability of the sector and of individual unions to manage the problems thrown up by the crisis in financial institutions. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12523/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies will recognise, the current serious difficulties in the financial sector and the accompanying economic downturn are affecting all financial institutions, including credit unions.  On account of the reduced availability of credit in the banking system, credit unions are now experiencing an increase in demand from their members for loans.  There has also been some increase in bad and doubtful debts and, as is the case across the whole of the financial sector, there have been losses on credit union investments.  It is not surprising that this combination of trends has led to a situation where credit unions generally have reported a decline in profits for 2008. </P>
        <P>However, it is important to note that the Registrar of Credit Unions has highlighted that of the 419 credit unions registered in the Republic, only a handful are experiencing significant difficulties at present.  The registrar is continuing to work closely with the boards of these credit unions.  Very close oversight, monitoring and controls over these credit unions by the registrar is intended to assist them in addressing current issues and to ensure their long-term stability and sustainability.  The registrar reports regularly to the regulatory authority to ensure early identification and response to any significant issues relating to the credit union movement or any individual credit union.  In addition, the registrar briefs my Department on these matters on an ongoing basis and my officials keep me fully informed of relevant developments in the credit union sector.   I did not, therefore, need to request a specific report from the registrar on the issue raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions using the powers available under the Credit Union Act 1997.  This rules-based legislation provides extensive powers of direction to the registrar to ensure the financial soundness and safety of credit unions and to protect credit union savers.  The registrar can also issue regulatory direction and prohibition orders to credit unions in regard to a broad range of issues, including <Col N="957"/>investments, raising of funds, loans, assets and liabilities ratios and the composition of their assets and liabilities.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not provided on the floor of the House. </i></P>
<P el="0">He has extensive powers of inspection and investigation of credit unions as well as broad supervisory powers, including to appoint, suspend or remove a person as a director of a credit union or to remove auditors.  A number of offences are also provided for in the Act.</P>
        <P>The extensive powers currently available to the registrar under the Act are important in ensuring that the regulatory system is robust and effective and in particular safeguards members&rsquo; savings.  The rules-based approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act has clearly served the credit union movement well, as is demonstrated by the small minority of credit unions which the registrar is currently monitoring closely in the current environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will set out the extent to which credit unions hold seriously impaired assets such as bank shares.  I understand some have held the securities which the Minister describes as toxic.  Perhaps the Minister will give an indication of whether a problems arises in terms of credit unions that hold significantly impaired assets.  Also, is he satisfied with the robustness of management standards in credit unions?  The Minister indicated that only a few have significant difficulties.  Has he received a report on the robustness of the management and protection systems to deal with any incidents in respect of individual credit unions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On difficulties in individual credit unions, the registrar briefs my Department on a regular basis on the general position within the credit union movement.  The credit union movement is in a relatively strong financial position with solid liquidity and reserves.  The registrar has highlighted that of the 419 credit unions registered in the Republic, only a handful are affected by these difficulties.  He continues to work closely with the boards of those credit unions that are encountering problems.  Close oversight, monitoring and controls over those credit unions by the registrar is intended to assist them to address current issues and to ensure their long-term stability and sustainability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of savings in the credit union movement, which total approximately &euro;14 billion, has the Minister given any consideration to a proposal by a number of people in the credit unions that credit unions be permitted to hold a national community savings bond via the National Treasury Management Agency?  This would offer an alternative and safe savings mechanism for the credit unions as opposed to some of the types of product which, as Deputy Bruton stated, were aggressively sold to credit unions.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister agree that credit unions represent a type of back to basics banking service at local level and that the importance of credit unions is significant now that people are experiencing difficulties?  The Central Bank has stated that the figure for personal sector lending in Ireland was, at the end of the last quarter of 2008, &euro;172,000 million.  The high level of personal debt is causing huge problems for this country.  Would the Minister consider a credit union community savings bond with the National Treasury Management Agency on the same lines as the recovery bond proposed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?  People want to save with the Government in a safe way.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards any bond which the National Treasury Management Agency might enter into with the credit union movement, I am open to any proposals.  I am also certain the NTMA would be open to any proposals formulated in that regard.  I would examine them with great care because the Government values the enormous contribution which the credit union movement makes in the provision of credit and basic bank facilities throughout Ireland.  However, I would point out that it is difficult as Minister to develop a consensus <Col N="958"/>among the credit unions as not all credit unions are affiliated to the league.  Also, even within the league there can be diversities of view in regard to particular issues.  However, if any credit union expresses an interest in respect of such a bond, I will examine it.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s more general question which I appreciate does not arise directly on this question in regard to the provision of some form of savings bond by the National Treasury Management Agency for general investment, I am again open to the suggestion.  However, I point out that the rates at which we obtain funding on world markets might be less than that which would command interest among investors.  Also were we to offer such products through the post office or directly from the NTMA, an issue would arise in terms of the extent to which we would be simply transferring deposits from the banking system to the State banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The credit union movement, which operates in every corner of Ireland, is fantastic.  In terms of ensuring they are robust, I refer to a question raised by Deputy Bruton in regard to whether the registrar and Financial Regulator have carried out an investigation of credit union investments?  This would provide certainty and security to the movement.  Perhaps the Minister would respond on that specific matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the legislative framework set out in the legislation, the primary function of credit unions is to offer savings and loans services to their members.  Due to significant growth in the credit union movement in recent years there has been a significant amount of resources for investment by credit unions to generate a return for members.  Strict legislative control exists under section 43 of the 1997 Act which restricts investments to those trustees are authorised to invest in under the trustee authorised investment legislation.  </P>
        <P>The registrar has powers to give a regulatory direction to a credit union if he deems it appropriate in the interests of its members to limit investments of a specified class or description.  Of course, it is the responsibility of the board of directors of each credit union to ensure that the investment policy is prudent and responsible and conforms to what is permissible under the Credit Union Act.  To assist the boards, in October 2006 the registrar issued a detailed guidance note on investments to help safeguard the risk profile of credit union investments and to ensure that members&rsquo; savings continue to be protected.  This is the basis for the monitoring of the investment activities of credit unions by the registrar.</P>
        <P>Following the changes in financial market conditions for investments since August 2007, the registrar has initiated a process, including consultation with stakeholders, with a view to revising the existing investment framework.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will publish the latest comparison of price before and after tax between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; and the tax difference on excisable products between the two jurisdictions which currently apply. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12579/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the periodic informal survey of cross-Border prices undertaken by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Office of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; periodic informal survey, which provides a snapshot of the retail prices for the main excisable commodities observed in market outlets in Dublin and Newry, was most recently carried out on 21 January 2009.  A summary of the results of that survey and of a number of other surveys since February 2007 are published on Revenue&rsquo;s website at <i>www.revenue.ie/en/about/publications/index-cross-border-price-comparisons.html.</i></P><Col N="959"/>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
        <P>In brief, the 21 January 2009 survey, when the euro to sterling exchange rate used was 0.9267, which is reasonably close to the current exchange rate, shows in particular that alcohol and tobacco products were considerably dearer in this State than in Northern Ireland.  The price of petrol was about the same, auto diesel was cheaper in this State, while that of home heating &mdash; kerosene and diesel &mdash; was dearer.  Of course, not all of the differentials can be accounted for by differentials in tax or excise treatment.  Some of them reflect different prices being charged for the same product between the two jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>It has to be recognised that we have a long-standing policy, for sound health and social reasons, of applying high excise rates to alcohol and tobacco products.  Our excise rates on such products are higher than those in the UK, which has also followed a policy of imposing high excise rates on such products.  Consequently, Ireland has the highest excise rate on wine in the EU.  It should be noted that the difference between the excise rates that apply to wine in this State and in Northern Ireland is somewhat smaller than the difference between the rates that apply to other alcoholic products.  Ireland has the second highest excise rate in the cases of beer and spirits.  The difference between the prices of beer and spirits on either side of the Border is wider than the difference between the price of wine.  Excise duty on beer has not been increased since budget 1994.  Excise duty on cider has not been increased since budget 2002.  Excise duty on spirits has not been increased since budget 2003.  Excise duty on wine was increased in last year&rsquo;s budget by 50 cent, inclusive of VAT, per standard bottle, having remained unchanged since budget 1994.</P>
        <P>Ireland charges the highest excise rate on, and price for, cigarettes in the EU.  The excise rate on cigarettes, inclusive of VAT, has been increased in the last three budgets by a total of &euro;1.30.  As Deputies will be aware, there are ongoing demands for the rate of excise on cigarettes to be increased by significantly more.  Any further increases in the rate of excise on tobacco will have to be considered in the context of the law of diminishing returns that applies to tax increases.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">Due to our high excise rates and higher VAT rate, taxes contribute to our higher prices for alcohol and tobacco products.  Non-tax costs also contribute to our higher prices, however, especially in the case of beers, spirits and most wines and, to a lesser extent, in the case of cigarettes.  In the case of beer, non-tax cost differences are high.  The overall price differences for cans and bottles of beer varies from 55 cent to 76 cent.  Excise duties and VAT account for between 21 and 24 cent of the difference.  Non-tax trade costs account for the remainder of the difference.  In the case of petrol, following an excise increase of 8 cent per litre, inclusive of VAT, in budget 2009, the price per litre is broadly the same in both jurisdictions, as is the tax take and the non-tax cost.  Auto diesel is approximately 15 cent per litre cheaper here, due to lower taxes.  As I have already said, the price of kerosene is higher in this State due to higher taxes and, particularly, higher non-tax costs.  Overall, diesel for heating purposes is dearer here despite the tax take being lower than in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>In comparing indirect tax, we must remember that taxation strategies generally reflect the political choices made by Governments to meet their specific needs and requirements.  In this regard, Ireland has focused on achieving a low taxation economy, especially in the area of direct taxation, which includes income tax and corporation tax.  This has delivered significant advantages for Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  In ensuring a relatively low level of direct taxation on income, we have had marginally higher indirect taxation.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I emphasise that the considerable weakening of sterling relative to the euro has had a far more significant impact on changes to relative prices between this State and <Col N="960"/>Northern Ireland than any tax changes, including those made in the standard VAT rates.  For example, sterling has weakened by 36% since early August 2007, and by 18% since early October 2008.  The extent of the depreciation of sterling can best be illustrated by cross-Border comparisons of petrol prices.  In January 2004, petrol in this State was approximately 27 cent cheaper per litre than in Northern Ireland.  Prices are now broadly the same in the two jurisdictions.  I use petrol as an example because the Irish and UK excise rates have moved by broadly similar amounts over the last five years.  It is clear that exchange rate movements, rather than tax changes, are driving price differentials.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a further cross-Border price survey is being undertaken.  In line with usual practice, the results of the survey will be posted on the website of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for getting out of the traps a little too fast earlier.  I got out of my seat as quickly as people are crossing the Border to spend money.  I accept that the Minister will say that the contents of the forthcoming budget are private and confidential until the Budget Statement is made.  Will he consider providing some type of stimulus package in the budget?  Sweden has introduced a 0% VAT exemption in the case of domestic housing services.  Germany has put in place a &euro;2,500 scrappage scheme for cars.  Similar incentives and tax initiatives are being offered in various countries.  Will the Minister consider reducing the 21.5% VAT rate?  It deserves serious consideration in light of the Minister&rsquo;s acknowledgement that &euro;700 million has left the Irish economy since the last budget.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister pay particular attention to the price of certain goods, such as baby products?  A Cow &amp; Gate baby food product that costs &euro;12.64 in Tesco in Letterkenny costs just &euro;7, on average, in Sainsbury&rsquo;s in Derry.  Will the Minister consider reducing the rate of VAT that applies to certain items, such as baby products?  He should incentivise people to buy certain products, such as building materials, ecologically friendly products, garden plants and trees.  We need to use our imagination and creativity.  The reality is that in certain parts of the country, such as my home county of Donegal, the Exchequer is not getting any revenue from the 21.5% VAT rate that was introduced by the Minister last year.  Nobody is selling cars.  People are not buying products.  There is not much point in collecting 21.5% of nothing.  Will the Minister consider this imaginative and creative proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Deputy McHugh for tabling Question No. 7 and thereby allowing me to correct certain matters that were misrepresented in a recent newspaper article.  A report on the implications of cross-Border shopping, which I commissioned on foot of a request made by Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, was published recently.  The report establishes that in 2008, the value of cross-Border shopping was between &euro;350 million and &euro;550 million.  It estimates that the potential loss in Exchequer revenues as a consequence of cross-Border shopping, taking VAT and excise yields into account, was between &euro;58 million and &euro;90 million in 2008.  In addition to the VAT and excise loss, there was a possible corporation tax revenue loss, tentatively estimated at between &euro;15 million and &euro;24 million.  It should be noted that all estimates for corporation tax revenue are provisional and should be seen as indicative of the potential loss involved.  If the exchange rate remains close to current levels throughout 2009, it is estimated that the volume of cross-Border shopping in 2009 will be worth between &euro;450 and &euro;700 million.  It has a remote connection with the VAT rate in this jurisdiction &mdash; it primarily relates to the differential price arrangements between the sterling and euro areas.  The estimated loss of VAT and excise receipts to the Exchequer resulting from that will be between &euro;72 million and &euro;112 million.</P><Col N="961"/>
        <P Just="Left">I assure Deputy McHugh that I will examine any proposal that might help to stimulate the economy.  Two crucial points should be noted in that context.  Differentials in prices between Northern Ireland and this State do not always relate to the tax treatment of those items.  Some differentials are rooted in the comparative underlying prices of products in the two jurisdictions.  It is important that we address those underlying factors in other ways.  It should be noted that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s stimulus package, which involves the reduction of the top rate of VAT in that jurisdiction to 15%, has not succeeded in stimulating the UK economy.  It is clear from newspaper reports today that the measure in question has brought the UK into a position of some fiscal exposure.  Rather than reversing that country&rsquo;s economic decline, the stimulus package has brought about the depletion of the tax base in the UK.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I came into the Chamber to ask the Minister for Finance a single question.  Having listened to him, I am reminded of the lines of a song:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">There are more questions than answers</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">And the more I find out the less I know.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Do I understand correctly that the figure of &euro;700 million to which the Minister referred is the putative loss to the economy &mdash; the gross loss, rather than just the VAT loss &mdash; in a full year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  That has been said on many occasions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned a newspaper article on this important matter.  Many people think cross-Border shopping, which is hurting many people, does not involve people outside Deputy McHugh&rsquo;s part of the country.  The traders in Balbriggan could tell Deputies that it is also affecting people in my constituency of Dublin North.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that it is not all about tax.  If it is clear that our VAT rates are causing a problem, we should reduce them.  Specifically, I have twice asked the Taoiseach to consider reducing the VAT rate that applies to the cervical cancer vaccine from the higher rate to the lower rate.  An increase of 10 cent in the price of wine, cider, spirits or beer would meet the cost of a reduction.</P>
        <P>I accept that the law of diminishing returns applies to tax increases.  I am sure some officials from the Irish Cancer Society would love to meet the Minister.  I am sure he would look after them.  The society has proposed an increase of &euro;2 in the price of a packet of cigarettes, principally to reduce consumption.  Such a move might cause the law of diminishing returns to apply not only to the tax take but also to the number of heart attacks and cases of cancer.  Will the Minister remove cigarettes and other forms of tobacco from the consumer price index?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  If he is concerned about the impact of shopping in Northern Ireland on his constituents and on various sectors of our economy, he must realise that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s major pull factor is the sale of alcohol and cigarettes.  All traders in Border counties will advise that fundamental point.  If I propose an increase in excise duties on 7 April for the approval of the House, Deputies will have to carefully assess the impact such a measure would have on Exchequer revenue and on the degree of shopping that takes place outside this jurisdiction.

A question on the number of visits people make to Northern Ireland is to be included in the quarterly national household survey.  It is important to get an accurate scientific handle on this phenomenon.  The evidence available to us to date, which is subject to correction, suggests that the purchase of cheap alcohol is the primary pull factor.  I accept that the other main pull factor &mdash; the price of baby products &mdash; was mentioned by Deputy McHugh.  We are beginning to identify the precise products that are creating concern.</P>

Although sterling and the euro are very close, one can pay up to 40% more because the differences in sterling are not being passed on, particularly by the high street chains and the large grocery multiples such as Tesco.  They can talk all they like about price reductions but the women of Ireland know that the price reductions are not being passed on.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister ever go shopping?  Would he take his Cabinet colleagues with him shopping?  Would he say to people in Ireland, and get RTE to follow him and broadcast it on the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo;, that there are many products in the Republic to which no VAT applies and still we are paying more for them than we are paying for them in the North of Ireland where VAT is actually applied on a wider basis?  In order to instill some confidence and encourage people to go back out shopping for value, could he crack the whip?</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will request the consumer director of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to examine the extent to which banks have backed their fixed rate mortgages by long dated securities, in order to establish whether the penalty for switching from fixed rate commitments could be reduced. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12537/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the redemption fee or breakage costs applied by mortgage providers in circumstances that a customer seeks to break a fixed rate mortgage to avail of lower variable interest rates.  At the outset, as much as fixed rate mortgages provide certainty and security to mortgage holders, it is clear that many fixed rate mortgage holders are tempted to switch for a better deal when interest rates are low.  In circumstances that many households are faced with significantly increased financial pressures, the current environment of very low interest rates clearly highlights to many fixed rate mortgage holders the saving that would be available if they benefited from a variable interest rate.</P>
        <P>Securing a better interest rate is only one part of calculating the benefits of switching.  As the Deputy&rsquo;s question indicates while a fixed rate mortgage offers stability in monthly repayments, one of the biggest drawbacks is the prospect of a financial penalty incurred when the fixing period is broken.  It is important to make the point that these redemption fees are also a feature of markets such as France and Germany where long-term fixing is the norm.</P>
        <P>The issue of early repayment was analysed in detail in the report of the Mortgage Funding Expert Group established by the European Commission in its report published at the end of 2006.  The expert group highlighted that from a lender&rsquo;s perspective if a consumer repays a mortgage loan earlier than scheduled the mortgage lender will not be able to generate the expected interest and fee income and therefore will incur a loss.  If the mortgage lender has <Col N="964"/>raised funding with a stated maturity and coupon specific costs will arise, the availability of an early repayment option to the mortgage borrowers, therefore, has a direct connection with the lender&rsquo;s profitability and therefore has a value and cost.  If this value is conferred on the borrower the cost has to be borne by the lender.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The expert group agreed that prepayment should be compensated and the compensation formula should be clearly established, transparent and easy to understand for consumers.  A majority of the expert group believed that all relevant lender losses should be covered in order to ensure the provision of low cost loans.  The European Commission committed in its White Paper on Mortgage Integration to assess the costs and benefits of different policy options for early repayment, including the level of compensation.</P>
        <P>Under the domestic legislative framework interest-related charges are market determined on the basis of commercial considerations and neither I nor the Financial Regulator would have any statutory role in this matter.  The Deputy will recognise that direct regulation of interest-related charges would represent a very significant intervention in commercial conduct which could not be justified unless there was significant evidence of substantial market failure.  There are significant benefits for both individual householders and for the stability of the housing and financial sector overall from greater take-up of fixed rate mortgages.  I do not believe, therefore that it is wise to embark on any course of action which could impact adversely on the cost and availability of fixed rate mortgages in the future.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I should add that I understand that the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s consultative consumer panel has shown a particular interest in the low take-up in fixed rate mortgages in Ireland as compared to other EU member states and has commissioned research on this issue.  I share the panel&rsquo;s assessment that it is important for us to examine how we can ensure greater stability in our housing market in the future through greater stability and predictability in mortgage finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is missing the point of the question.  The question was whether he would arrange an examination of the financial institutions to see to what extent they have entered into these long-dated security commitments that would justify them imposing these penalties of &euro;20,000 for people to switch.  My point is that with the taxpayer now underpinning much of the banking activity, if there is not reasonableness in these charges we should move to get rid of them and give some people relief.</P>
        <P>If there is a genuine commercial penalty we can understand why that would be the case.  We need to investigate our banks holding long dated securities because my impression is that long dated securities are almost impossible to get.  I suspect that they are not holding them and that the justification for the penalty does not stand up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise the issue, but the consumer director is independent in these matters and has sufficient powers to investigate the matter on her own initiative.  I understand that as she is already aware of the level of charges &mdash; and should the Financial Regulator feel that such charges do not represent recovery of funding costs &mdash; the cost structure can be fully investigated under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  In those cases the charges would need to be approved by the Financial Regulator in advance.</P>
        <P>The statutory presumption is that these breakage charges relate to the cost of funding the advance that is made to the borrower.  Financial institutions use formulae for calculating these <Col N="965"/>charges and the formulae contain parameters relating to the cost of the original fixed-rate loan and to the new or refunded loan.</P>
        <P>The terms applying to the redemption of a fixed-rate mortgage held with a particular financial institution operating in the Irish market are as follows.  The charge is applied to a fixed-rate loan where during the term of the fixed-rate period the full loan is repaid early, or a lump-sum repayment over the multiple of &euro;1,200 per annum is made, or the loan is converted to a variable rate loan or another fixed-rate loan.  In these circumstances the customer must pay a sum equal to the lesser of six months&rsquo; interest charge or the economic breakage charge.  There is a formula for the calculation of the economic breakage charge which is a multiplier of the redeemed amount multiplied by the original cost of funds less the current cost of funds multiplied by the time remaining until the end of the fixed-rate period and divided by 365.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Would the Minister ask the director of consumer affairs in the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to undertake an investigation of this?  Like the previous question on shopping, what we are looking for is positive signals where a consumer is in a fixed-rate mortgage.  The Minister must remember he told me yesterday that at the end of December last there was &euro;147 billion in house mortgage finance in this country.  I do not know whether he knows how much of that is in fixed-rate mortgages and for what duration.  While everything is so flat and today&rsquo;s figures for the drop in spending are so bad, the Minister must identify actions which will show consumers and mortgage holders that there is hope for them, that something that has worked out as being very unfair in the current climate can be investigated and addressed fairly rapidly.  That is how we will start to generate consumer confidence and get people spending again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns of other Deputies about this matter.  We are all aware of individuals who see the very low interest rates that now obtain and contrast the high interest rates which they are locked into by agreement with the financial institutions.  It is a matter for the consumer director to examine at all times, whether the strict legal position is being observed.  I certainly will seek confirmation from her that such is the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes was established to examine the current expenditure programmes in each Department and to make recommendations for reducing public service numbers so as to facilitate the Government&rsquo;s task of returning the public finances to a sustainable position.</P>
        <P>The special group began its work in December.  Each Department was asked to prepare an evaluation paper for the special group setting out an analysis of expenditure programmes and identifying possible savings options.  The relevant areas in the sectoral policy division of the Department of Finance are also preparing material for the group&rsquo;s consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To date, the special group has met with 11 of the 15 Departments scheduled for review.  The group is considering the outcome of each of these meetings and following its meetings with the remaining Departments and other entities, will finalise its work when all relevant savings options have been explored.</P><Col N="966"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister implied that although the group is finalising its proposals at the end, the Minister is receiving them as they are done, Department by Department.  To what form of evaluation will these reports be subjected?  Does he regard them as part of the deliberative process of the budget and, therefore, not available to the House?  Can he make them available to the House so there can be a debate on the potential for savings in the management of key Departments?  Finding efficiencies and savings is not the unique interest of Government.  It would be useful if the Oireachtas committees in each of these areas had access to these reports earlier rather than later.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider what Deputy Bruton said, but to date I have not had the benefit of a detailed report on any of the Departments concerned although an amount of work has been done.  Deputies will appreciate that the individual reports in different Departments have to be finalised, but regarding the forthcoming budget I arranged to meet the chairman and to be briefed by him in general terms on possible areas of saving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of some of the information we have received and information in the public domain, I am concerned about the operation of the group on the capital programme.  In general, it has been indicated that the 2009 capital programme is approximately &euro;8 billion and that &euro;6 billion of that is committed or contracted for in some formal way.  We have had some breakdowns in the information service and during briefings from the Minister&rsquo;s officials, but we have no information on what are the projects.  One would not have to be a genius to work out that the uncommitted &euro;2 billion is most at risk.</P>
        <P>I am most concerned that the uncommitted &euro;2 billion includes a very high figure for education.  Large numbers of school building programmes have not been subject to full commitment because of how the schools building programme works.  From talking to principals and others, I understand that is over &euro;600 million.  In terms of generating construction activity, it is far more important to spend the &euro;600 million on schools than some of the committed projects under the &euro;6 billion, because that will give jobs to construction workers on a wide basis throughout the country.  It is really important that we have some answers.  Otherwise, one could spend on commitments which generate very little in jobs and reflation of local economies.  That is where the Opposition needs information on the strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In this context, &ldquo;committed&rdquo; does not mean politically committed but legally committed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I mean contractually; I am not talking about politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly, but it is not a budgetary option available to a Government to break a contract with a contractor engaged in a capital project.  There could be a substantial exposure for the State in the sums which could be recovered by damages and penalties were the State to breach a contract which is contractually committed in the public capital programme.  In examining the scope for any savings, I assume the officials are identifying the areas for the Deputy which are not contractually committed as these are the areas available for any reductions.  Where there is a contractual commitment, it is not open to us to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>However, many of the schools are not, and that is where one will get employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that the bulk of the areas that are not contractually committed tend to be the smaller roads in the Department of Transport, schools, water projects and social housing projects in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because these projects are smaller in scale.</P>

Has the Government imposed any embargoes on recruitment in the public service?  Some people seem to be working under embargoes while others do not.

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Transport with responsibility for road safety, Deputy Noel Ahern, for being in the House.  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the national roads programme and road safety, particularly in light of an extremely serious road accident that occurred in my constituency in Slane, County Meath, <Col N="968"/>on Monday.  The accident involved a lorry, delivery truck and seven cars which collided on the main N2 road in the centre of the village.  Some seven people and a young baby were brought to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and, thank God, nobody sustained serious injuries.  My thoughts are with those caught up in the incident and the garda&iacute; and emergency services who performed wonderful work on the day.  However, this accident highlights yet again the need for a review of road safety on the N2 and in particular the urgent need for the NRA and the Minister to proceed with a bypass of Slane.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that yet again the front page headlines of the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> describe an accident in Slane.  I have another newspaper article from 1 September 2002 whose headline is: &ldquo;Yet another road accident in Slane.&rdquo;  As most people know, Slane is an elegant hillside village of outstanding natural beauty overlooking the Boyne.  Many of the problems, although not all of them and not those this week, are caused by the N2 bridge over the River Boyne.  This is a very historic village, proud to be associated with Francis Ledwidge and many other people from St. Erc down through the ages.  However, over the past 40 years Slane has become choked with heavy traffic and this affects the social, community and commercial life of the village.  More than 20 people have lost their lives at Slane bridge.  There are accidents there on a regular basis.  There was an accident on Monday in the centre of the village and only a few weeks ago there was another accident at the bridge.  Accidents happen all the time and there will be more.  I am glad I am speaking today in the absence of deaths or serious injuries there this week.</P>
        <P>Residents and I have been in regular contact with the NRA and the Minister for Transport to ensure that the Slane bypass progresses.  However, residents are not entirely happy with progress on the issue.  The NRA has kept in touch with me on the issue and it has completed some studies and reviews, but it is time for shovels, spades, JCBs and earth movers to get this job under way.  The argument in favour of it is utterly compelling.  According to the census, people in my constituency are more likely than people anywhere else to own a car and to use it for daily commuting.  That is a fact.  This has clear implications for transport provision and infrastructure in the community.  While that shows the need for even more public transport than we have, it has implications for road safety.  Meath has the fastest growing population of any county outside Dublin.  It has grown by more than 22% in the past seven years.</P>
        <P>When complete, the Slane bypass would enable motorists to bypass Slane and also remove rat-running traffic from surrounding county roads.  However, the M1 connects very conveniently to Ardee for traffic which needs to go north of Ardee up to County Monaghan and beyond, but that traffic does not use the M1.  There are issues for the NRA and Meath County Council to discuss outside this Chamber and I would like the Minister to bring that to their attention.  There are arguments to ban lorries from the village at certain times of the day and the Minister may refer that to the NRA because that is an issue for it.</P>
        <P>A large amount of money has been allocated for roads, as has just been discussed, and it is very important to keep building and planning our roads with the primary objective of reducing carnage, preventing accidents and allowing communities such as Slane to grow, prosper and celebrate, and to develop the important heritage they have in that village.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for raising the matter.  The Government already has a policy which provides for priority to be given to safety in our road networks around the country.  This is reflected in the significant amounts of funding provided for our national road network in recent years.  In the three years, 2006 to 2008, almost &euro;5 billion was invested in capital projects related to the national road network, with a further &euro;1.44 billion being invested this year.  All this funding is resulting in significant improvements being made to our road infrastructure, which is most <Col N="969"/>readily seen in the work under way on the major inter urban, MIU, routes between Dublin and Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and the Border.  The MIU between Dublin and the Border has been completed and work is under way on the remainder, with sections along those routes open to traffic.</P>
        <P>All five routes will be open to traffic by end 2010.  In addition to enhancing prospects for economic development, particularly in the current economic environment, stimulating increased tourism and improving access within regions, better roads also deliver significant safety benefits.  High quality dual carriageways and motorways are proven to be seven times safer than the roads they replace.  By opening more than 150 km of new roads in 2009, we will make a significant contribution to the safety of our national road network.  The National Road Authority, NRA, also uses part of its annual funding allocation to identify and improve sections of road, which are the scenes of accidents.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the recent road accident in Slane.  Specific projects are a matter for the NRA rather than the Minister but &euro;500,000 has been allocated this year by the authority for the planning of the Slane bypass.  Planning of the project must be approved before it can be constructed.  Funding will be considered but that will depend on the economic climate at the time.  However, significant funding has been allocated to the planning side this year.</P>
        <P>Bigger and better roads are only one aspect of improving road safety.  A tangible difference can be made only if each and every road user takes personal responsibility and drives carefully and at a speed appropriate to the conditions.  Much work has been achieved to improve driver behaviour and training through the work of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in the past few years and the road safety strategy, which was approved by Government in October 2007.  It contains 126 different actions or initiatives under the headings of education, enforcement, engineering and evaluation with a number of different agencies having responsibility and target completion dates.</P>
        <P>The strategy&rsquo;s primary target is to reduce road deaths to not more than 60 per million of population by the end of 2012, which equates to an average of 21 road deaths per month or 252 deaths per year.  The average number of road deaths per month in 2007 was 28 and last year the number reduced to 23.  The first two months of this year were good but this month, up to last weekend, was bad.  This week was better but, up to last weekend, this month was the worst so far this year.  The strategy is being successfully implemented across a range of agencies and there has been a sustained reduction in the number of people killed on our roads.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system and the introduction of mandatory testing of drivers for alcohol, coupled with high visibility enforcement by the Garda, have lead to significant reductions in fatalities.  The increased levels of enforcement measures by the Garda has led to a change in attitude and a visible change in behaviour, an improvement in driving habits and a reduction in the number of people who senselessly drive while intoxicated.  The lowest number of road deaths on record, at 279, occurred last year.  Records began in the late 1950s.  The worst year was 1972 when 670 people were killed.  Both injuries and fatalities must be considered in conjunction with the overall population and the number of vehicles on the road, both of which have increased in recent years &mdash; 1 million additional vehicles in ten years.  Injuries and fatalities relative to population and vehicle numbers have declined noticeably in recent years.  In the past decade fatalities as measured against the number of vehicles have more than halved, which is the result of a combination of both the road safety and road investment programmes.</P>
        <P>While the number of fatalities has reduced, the loss of even one life on our roads is one too many and it is a tragedy.  I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.  Driving through Slane village <Col N="970"/>is a particular problem.  Money is being spent on the planning of the bypass this year and, as soon as that is ready, the project will be in the pot for completion.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter on the Adjournment.  I deplore the Government decision to halt the building of 78 major road schemes, including the N2 Dublin to Derry primary route from Clontibret, County Monaghan, to the border with County Tyrone.  This involves the essential bypass of the village of Emyvale, which is vital primarily for safety reasons, as the volume of traffic passing along the 8 km stretch between Monaghan town and the Border at Moy Bridge through the village remains life threatening.</P>
        <P>This latest roads debacle is another example of the gross mismanagement of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments over the past decade and more.  Through the early years of the Celtic tiger, the Government presided over a scandalous situation where contractors for major roads were allowed to run hugely over budget and well over time at massive expense to the State.  There clearly was a massive rip-off by some of those so engaged.  Eventually the Government got its act together to some extent and major road projects were finally required to be completed on time and on tighter budgets, following a massive uproar about the waste of public money.  Now in straitened economic circumstances, the Government wants to halt these important and essential projects.</P>
        <P>The news that the road scheme I have cited, along with 77 others, has been halted with immediate effect will be greeted with dismay by many people.  The most disappointed, undoubtedly, will be the people of Monaghan town, north Monaghan and Emyvale who suffer daily the real dangers and many difficulties associated with traffic along this route.  They have been promised by Government on several occasions that this work would be carried out.  This road scheme is essential to the entire economy of County Monaghan and the wider Border region, as it is an essential piece of transport infrastructure.  It must be remembered this is the crucial link between Derry and the north west and Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What presentation is this to the people of Six Counties, as we seek to encourage people of traditional Unionist outlook of the benefits of an all-Ireland approach to our shared needs in the future?  The first introduction to many driving south is this outrageously dangerous stretch of roadway.  Where stands the planned co-operation with the Department of the Environment in the Six Counties?  The N2 upgrade was to link up with the A5 upgrade north of the Border and the Government was to make a significant contribution to the works in counties Tyrone and Derry.  Where stands that commitment?</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision not only in regard to this north Monaghan project but all 78 projects across the State is ill-conceived as it will lead directly to increased redundancies and will be another blow to the already depressed construction industry.  I call on Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party to reverse this retrograde move in the interest of motorist safety, in the first instance, with jobs also much to the fore of my thoughts as I make this case.  It is not only a question of job creation but of sustaining those who still happen to have employment in roadmaking works around the country.  These projects were a lifeline for many of those people who moved from one scheme to another.  This is the most short-sighted proposition that this Government has put forward in recent times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not need to close the door on infrastructural development but to realise that this is the optimum time for making real investment in infrastructure, recognising that money is cheap, that there is a readily available labour force willing to take up job opportunities in construction <Col N="971"/>projects.  Now is the time to move on with these development projects, to sustain jobs, create work and be in a position throughout the island to avail of new opportunities that will present themselves when the economy turns, sooner hopefully than many suggest.  There has been a real failure to invest, particularly in the Border counties, the midlands and the west.  This is another indication of the Government&rsquo;s failure to recognise the importance of the Border counties and the link to the north west of the island, counties Donegal, Derry and Tyrone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that the roads programme has almost been cancelled is nonsense.  This year, the Government provided a budget to the NRA of nearly &euro;1.5 billion, one of the largest single annual investments in road infrastructure in the history of the State.  This investment programme represents an average investment of &euro;120 million per month in Ireland&rsquo;s national roads.  That is a huge investment and allocation of resources.  The Deputy&rsquo;s comments to the effect that the programme has been almost halted are nonsensical.</P>
        <P>The figures I have quoted demonstrate this Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing for an infrastructure that will allow this country to take full advantage of the upturn in the economy when it comes.  The current economic climate and the difficult and rapidly worsening position of the Exchequer have had an impact on the Government and the NRA&rsquo;s ambitious plans for the development of the road network that this country needs.</P>
        <P>In view of the severe constraints on Exchequer finances, and in light of the forthcoming budget, the Government has now re-prioritised all national development plan expenditure for the rest of this year to concentrate on employment intensive projects.  Every Department in receipt of NDP funding has been asked to ensure that no new contractual commitments are entered into before sign-off by the Department of Finance.  This will allow the Government to have maximum discretion in future allocations.  There is no halting of the programme.  The Departments could work ahead on the programmes in the NDP but the situation has changed and it is important for the Department of Finance to be able to keep an eye on what is happening and approve individual sign-offs.  That does not halt anything, that is good management, controlling the situation and keeping an eye on the resources and signing long-term contracts accordingly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NRA is so far advanced on the delivery of the major inter-urban routes, with all five routes now either under construction or open to traffic that most of its funds for 2009 are contractually committed.  Approximately &euro;50 million of the allocation is not committed.  This money will finance a range of other projects around the country, including the Castleisland by-pass, which will be the only major construction project to start this year.  That is the way the work has flowed because the continuing work, such as the M50 around Dublin, and other massive projects, is contractually tied.  As soon as that work is finished next year the budget will be available for other projects to be approved.</P>
        <P>My Department has written to the Department of Finance outlining the expenditure programmes its agencies propose to undertake for the remainder of 2009 and seeking that Department&rsquo;s sanction for those programmes.  This includes the NRA&rsquo;s proposed programme of minor roadworks on both national primary and national secondary roads, as well as planning and preparatory works on a range of other projects.</P>
        <P>I expect that the Department of Finance will respond to my Department about these matters following the budget on 7 April.  The total capital provision for regional and local roads is &euro;468 <Col N="972"/>million of which approximately &euro;95 million is already committed.  The Department of Finance recently sanctioned expenditure of &euro;150 million and local authorities will be advised immediately following the supplementary budget what projects can proceed under this restored sanction.</P>
        <P>Further information is available about the roads under construction but it is not fair to say that 70 roads have been halted or anything like that.  The Department of Finance wants to give specific approval for major contracts before they go out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The situation has changed.  There is a shortage of money.  It is important that somebody at the top approves the contracts.  That does not mean that work has been stopped.  It is a case of the Department of Finance having an overview of the situation.  Most of the money for this year is contractually tied so there are no cutbacks there.  When the five major inter-urban routes are finished next year other routes will be lined up for approval.</P>

      <sTitle>Planning Issues.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Transport for coming to the House to deal with these matters.  I am disappointed, however, that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has neither attended here whenever this matter has been raised, nor in his constituency when local meetings have been held over recent months.  It shows a certain contempt for the people who elected him but I suppose I would say that. </P>
        <P>There is an urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to at the minimum postpone the section 25 process for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority&rsquo;s proposed planning scheme for the Poolbeg peninsula.  It has raised ethical concerns about banks, commercial interests, developers and the authority and the complex web of relationships between these individuals and corporate entities.  This is a significant scheme which will have a profound effect on people not only in the Sandymount and Ringsend area but in the city.  There has been no provision for transport and other infrastructure to support this massive scheme.</P>
        <P>The premise of the scheme is worrying.  It will allow the Dublin Docklands Development Authority become its own planning authority for a vast tract of land which is an important public amenity.  Anyone who lives in Dublin city probably uses or has used it.  It is also an area of significant flooding that affects the canal and the Dodder, Tolka and Liffey rivers.  This is not merely a local issue but is very much a city-wide one.  It is also a matter of national concern, for a number of reasons that I will outline.</P>
        <P>Three fiascos are currently connected to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  One is the Becbay investment scheme in the Irish Glass Bottle site, a greatly questionable endeavour involving a number of people.  The CEO of the authority until last month, Mr. Paul Moloney, stated that no interest has been paid since last June on the loan of almost &euro;300 million put forward to purchase the IGB site.  This raises a very significant question with regard to the solvency of the DDDA and Deputy Phil Hogan raised the matter at the relevant Oireachtas committee.  There are major concerns among the public and they have not been answered by the Minister.  The matter has not been dealt with and we have not had any meaningful clarification.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us bear in mind that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was established by my very fine constituency colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, the former Minister for Finance in <Col N="973"/>the Fine Gael-led rainbow Government of 1994-97.  It was done as part of a rejuvenation scheme for the city centre, based on commercial intent but also to offer a very important social dimension for the area.  What has been happening in the DDDA over the past number of years has deviated so far from those original objectives that serious questions must now be answered.</P>
        <P>There is the issue of the newly appointed chairman of the DDDA, Mr. McCaughey, who was appointed by the same Minister, Deputy John Gormley.  Mr. McCaughey was forced to resign in recent days as a result of what can only be described as very questionable behaviour with regard to payment of taxes.  This raises significant questions over the judgment of the Minister and how much of a handle he really has on what is going on in the various authorities under his Ministry, particularly the DDDA.</P>
        <P>There is the very important issue of the links between the recently nationalised Anglo Irish Bank and the DDDA.  Two directors of the authority were directors of Anglo Irish Bank at the time of the Becbay deal, a very serious conflict of interest.  According to the DDDA&rsquo;s last annual report, it paid &euro;964,648 to companies that had direct links with three of its directors.  One such was Arup Consulting, one of whose directors was a member of the DDDA board; another relates to PricewaterhouseCoopers; and we are very much aware of the Anglo Irish Bank connections.  These are major questions of public interest and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, must get to the bottom of them before he gives any sanction to, or stands over this project going ahead.</P>
        <P>In any case, this project is not viable because it is proposed on the basis of completely flawed planning grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall try to give the Deputy the factual position on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but if I may, I will keep away from the politics of Dublin South-East.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy knows, the authority was established under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997, to lead the physical, economic, social and cultural regeneration of Dublin&rsquo;s docklands.</P>
        <P>Section 24 of that Act requires the authority to prepare a master plan for the docklands area, setting out objectives for its social and economic regeneration.  The authority&rsquo;s most recent master plan was adopted only a few months ago, in November 2008, following a comprehensive public consultation process.  It envisaged the development of the Poolbeg area following the preparation of a comprehensive planning scheme.</P>
        <P>The authority has now prepared and published a draft planning scheme for the Poolbeg peninsula under section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act.  The draft plan details how it is envisaged that the area covered by the plan should be developed, and sets out policies in respect of land use, distribution and location of development, overall design, transportation, the development of amenities, and conservation.  Copies of the Poolbeg plan<Col N="974"/>ning scheme and the related environmental impact statement are available for inspection at various locations throughout the docklands.  The closing date for submissions is 9 April.  I am sure the Deputy knows this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That follows a consultation period of 62 days.  The final draft planning scheme will be submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, for his consideration later this year.</P>
        <P>It is entirely a matter for the authority to prepare a draft planning scheme and to carry out the necessary consultations.  In accordance with the Act, once a draft planning scheme is finalised and submitted to the Minister, and, following consultation with the Minister for Finance and consideration of any objections from Dublin City Council, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has the option, at that stage, of approving the draft planning scheme, with or without modification.  That is when his formal role, in accordance with the Act, comes into play.  The Minister has no function in the preparation of the planning scheme prior to its submission for approval.</P>
        <P>As provided for in section 18 of the Act, the authority, which is self-financing, has since its establishment, engaged in extensive business transactions including the purchase, management, development and sale of lands in the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The authority, through its involvement in a joint venture company, Becbay, made a significant investment in the acquisition of the Irish Glass Bottle, IGB, site in Poolbeg.  The authority&rsquo;s involvement in Becbay, and the position of certain former directors of the authority, who were also directors of Anglo Irish Bank, with regard to the decision making process leading to the acquisition of the IGB site, were the subject of extensive debate with DDDA officials at the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 10 February.  I am sure the Deputy attended.  The DDDA advised the committee that the process was conducted in full compliance with the authority&rsquo;s code of conduct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has the responsibility to investigate these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister expects to be in a position shortly to announce the appointment of a new chair of the authority.  It will be a matter for the chair, the board and the executive of the authority to ensure that the completion of the drafting of the Poolbeg planning scheme, and its subsequent implementation including development of the IGB site, is closely managed in the interests of the sustainable social and economic regeneration of the area.</P>
        <P>I hope I have outlined for the Deputy the Minister&rsquo;s role, in accordance with the Act.  He will have the say in the decision making process when it comes to him but that has not yet happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  I hope that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has better luck with his second stab at the appointment.</P>

      <sTitle>Institutes of Technology.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>In February 2006 Waterford Institute of Technology made a formal application to the Department of Education and Science in pursuit of university status.  The submission embraces constituent campuses throughout the south east.  There was an expec<Col N="975"/>tation by the institute at the time that a body of national and international education experts would be set up to adjudicate the merits of the institute&rsquo;s case and then report to the Higher Education Authority.</P>
        <P>More than three years later, I tabled a parliamentary question last Tuesday, asking the Minister for Education and Science to request the Higher Education Authority to recommend, as provided for under section 9.1 of the Universities Act 1997, the membership of a body to include international experts and national experts for appointment by the Government.  This body would advise the Higher Education Authority  whether Waterford Institute of Technology should be established as the university of the south east.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s reply was clear.  He stated there are no plans to advance any of the current applications for university status before the strategy group on higher education reports.  The Minister has asked the group to report to him with a two-decade roadmap for the development of the sector before the end of the year. There is no guarantee that it will report on time and if previous adherence to timeframes around the Waterford Institute of Technology application is repeated, it could be quite some time before the report is produced.</P>
        
        <P>The Minister stated that applications have been received for designation as universities from Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and Cork Institute of Technology.  Dublin already has three universities and Cork has one.  In addition to universities, Limerick and Galway have institutes of technology.  Waterford and the south-east region are alone in not having a university.  When we compare the five major cities in terms of spending on third level education, Dublin&rsquo;s spend is more than 11 times that of Waterford, Cork spends almost four times as much and Galway and Limerick have three times Waterford&rsquo;s spend.</P>
        <P>One tactic used by Fianna F&aacute;il to delay commencing the statutory process of assessment for the WIT application announced by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in advance of the 2007 general election was that a preliminary assessment of the submission would be made by Dr. Jim Port, a UK-based independent consultant.  This was a ploy to get Fianna F&aacute;il through the election by giving the impression that something real was happening on the application.  Dr. Port&rsquo;s report was finally published in February 2008.  In it, he described the Waterford Institute of Technology application as a serious one that raised a number of issues for the Government but contained nothing inherent to prevent its consideration under the existing process.  Dr. Port found that WIT has an academic maturity and activity profile in degree and postgraduate training, research and scholarly activity which overlaps with institutions in the Irish university sector and other western countries.  He felt that WIT fulfils many of the broader roles of the university, especially in terms of supporting the regional economy and cultural development and knowledge transfer.</P>
        <P>There is a brain drain from the south east, with some 7,000 students at any given time studying in universities outside the region.  Many of these will never return to live in the region.  There is a regional deficit in fourth level education provision and under capacity in research and development.  If the south-east region is to be part of Ireland&rsquo;s smart economy, it must have a university.</P>
        <P>I am demanding that the statutory process on the WIT application be initiated immediately.  This will not cost a great deal of money or impinge on the work of the strategy group.  I call on the Government to end its cynicism and evasion and the dishonest ploys which have been repeatedly to avoid progressing the application by WIT for university status.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P><Col N="976"/>
        <P>Applications have been received from three institutes of technology, namely, Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and Cork Institute of Technology, for designation as universities.  These applications raise significant issues regarding Government policy towards higher education, in particular regarding the existing roles of universities and institutes of technology, which have distinctive missions, provide different levels and types of academic programmes, fulfil different roles in the community and have separate academic and governance structures.</P>
        <P>Waterford Institute of Technology is a very important institution and makes a significant contribution to education generally and the economic and social well-being of the south-east region.  It has an excellent track record of industry collaboration, particularly in the areas of applied research and curriculum design.  The Government wants to see Waterford Institute of Technology further develop its strengths in these areas in line with the objectives of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for science technology and innovation.</P>
        <P>Since the applications for university status were received, there have been significant changes in the legislative and regulatory framework governing the institute of technology sector.  The Institutes of Technology Act 2006 provides for the creation of a unified management structure framework for higher education in Ireland by bringing the institute of technology sector under the remit of the Higher Education Authority.  The legislation also extends significant managerial and academic autonomy to the institutes, with a view to facilitating further development of their roles.</P>
        <P>In its review of the Irish higher education sector conducted in 2004, the OECD found that the differentiation of mission within the sector contributed significantly to Irish economic growth and recommended that no further institutional transfers be made to the university sector.  Building on the reform agenda that has been under way since the publication of the OECD report five years ago and in recognition of the critical role that the higher education system plays in generating the skills, knowledge and innovation on which Ireland&rsquo;s future competitive advantage depends, the Government believes it is time to develop a new national higher education strategy which will provide a road map for the future development of the sector.</P>
        <P>The process to develop a new strategy was launched by the Minister last month and is being led by a high level steering group which draws on national and international expertise and includes representatives from business, community and student interests as well as senior Government officials.  The strategy process will examine how well Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system is performing, how it ranks internationally, how well existing resources are being used and how the system can be reconfigured to meet the challenges it will face over the next two decades.  The process is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  Pending its completion, there are no plans to advance any of the current applications for university status.</P>
        <P>I have a feeling that I read a reply on the same issue one year ago.  The situation appears to be evolving but I do not think the intention is to mess up Waterford.  It is important to formulate long-term Government thinking before making a final decision.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may wish to note that the decision whether an institution operating in Ireland passes on ECB interest rate reductions to customers is primarily a commercial decision for the institution concerned.</P>
        <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware, I have publicly indicated that I expect institutions to pass on funding cost reductions to their customers as appropriate, including in particular to those purchasing properties on variable mortgages and to small and medium-sized enterprises. This is important to help support sustainable growth and employment in line with the objectives of the Government guarantee scheme and the Government&rsquo;s recapitalisation programme.</P>
        <P>For example in the case of mortgage interest rates, I understand that in general credit institutions differentiate between mortgages of owner occupiers and residential investors for the purposes of setting mortgage interest rates. I have been informed by the Financial Regulator that all of the covered institutions have fully passed on each ECB interest rate cut to owner occupiers since the bank guarantee scheme was introduced and that this will be so for the latest ECB cut announced on 5 March 2009.</P>
        <P>However, it must be borne in mind that credit institutions are not primarily funded from the ECB but from a variety of sources and the cost of much of their funding has been significantly above ECB rates over the last year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that many lenders are conducting extensive advertising campaigns, showing that competition is a real factor on the mortgage scene.  The existence of that level of competition in the mortgage lending market is sufficient, I believe, to ensure that credit institutions will reduce their rates where possible in order to remain competitive and retain their share of the market.</P><Col N="978"/>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that a balance must be achieved by Government between influencing private banks through the bank guarantee scheme and other financial support incentives while at the same time being seen to have a hands-off approach to the day to day running of these institutions which must operate on a strictly commercial basis.</P>

	<P>I am conscious of the decline in the motor industry in Ireland and internationally due to the contraction in economic activity.  I and my officials have had meetings with representatives of the motor industry on the matter.</P>
        <P>In the case of second-hand cars a special VAT scheme is in place in Ireland.  This special scheme was introduced in 1994, following strong representations from the motor industry, as a derogation under the VAT Directive.  The scheme contrasts with the Margin Scheme, which operates in most other Member States.</P>
        <P>The special scheme allows motor dealers, at the time of purchase, to claim credit for residual input VAT which is considered to be included in the cost of acquiring a second-hand car from a customer.  When the car is subsequently resold, the VAT is chargeable on the full sale price of the car or on the original purchase price paid by the dealer, whichever is the higher.  This is necessary because the dealer has already been granted a credit in relation to the residual input VAT incurred.  The special scheme allows dealers the maximum benefit by allowing an immediate deduction of residual VAT at the point of purchase.  The VAT credit already allowed on second-hand cars must, despite the industry&rsquo;s view, be seen for what it is, i.e. money advanced to dealers by the Exchequer which they are only repaying when they resell the second-hand cars.</P>
        <P>Under the Margin Scheme, garages and dealers would account for VAT on their profit margin only, i.e. on the difference between the cost of acquiring and selling the second-hand cars involved.  Under the Margin Scheme, there would be no entitlement to a deduction on the acquisition of the car and consequently the question of a VAT clawback would not arise.</P>
        <P>Although with the changing economic circumstances dealers have found themselves selling traded-in second-hand cars at a loss, which is increasingly giving rise to clawbacks of VAT situations for dealers, it is not possible to write-off the VAT credit already allowed to the dealers on second-hand cars. In this context the Revenue Commissioners have however granted concessionary treatment which allows dealers to postpone payment in respect of the clawbacks over the past number of months until 19 May 2009.</P>
        <P>The motor industry has made calls for the introduction of a Margin Scheme for second-hand cars in conjunction with the writing-off of the outstanding VAT credits already provided to dealers in respect of second-hand cars.  I am not opposed to the introduction of such a Margin Scheme, but not on the basis that the outstanding VAT credit already provided to dealers in relation to their existing stock of second-hand cars would be written-off in full.	</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy.  Insurance costs reflect a broad range of factors, including for example, the level of cover, the number of claims, legal and administration costs, the cost of fraud as well as the overall cost level in the economy. </P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the Financial Regulator that while the non-life insurance market performed well up to the end of 2006, market sources indicate that much non-life business was written at a loss in 2007. This trend continued in 2008, but the companies were still willing to write business at a loss in order to maintain their market share.  They were able to do this as a result of the reserves they had built up during profitable years.  However, the situation could not go on indefinitely and indications are that firms are now taking action on pricing to underpin their financial positions.</P>
        <P>In the current difficult trading climate, there is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the long-term sustainability of the insurance industry and at the same time making sure that the consumer obtains good value for money.  I am particularly conscious of the impact of a significant increase in premiums for both the consumer and business and it must be a priority for  insurance companies to ensure that insurance cover is provided as competitively as possible consistent with long term commercial sustainability and viability.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that like all financial service providers, the insurance industry is also affected by the continuing stress in the financial markets and the recessionary pressures in the economy.  This is likely to be one of the reasons for increases in areas such as motor insurance.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, the recent upward trend in insurance prices reflects a range of factors outside the control of the industry.  It would not, therefore be appropriate from a policy perspective to seek to intervene in the commercial conduct or decision making of insurance firms in the absence of clear evidence of market failure in respect of which there is scope to address from a national perspective.</P>

	<P>The Addendum to the Stability Programme Update, published on 9 January last, forecast total tax receipts in 2009 of approximately &euro;37 billion.  However, in light of the continuing weakness in the Exchequer Returns, my Department now anticipates that there could be a shortfall of up to &euro;3 billion on this figure.  This would mean that only &euro;34 billion in tax receipts would be collected in 2009, representing a year-on-year decline of over 16 per cent.</P>
        <P>Economic growth has also continued to weaken and lower levels of economic activity will obviously have implications for future tax revenue receipts.</P>
        <P>In light of this, the Government decided to announce further measures to stabilise the budgetary situation.  This will involve the introduction of additional taxation and expenditure measures in 2009 to address the continued deterioration in the public finances.  The Supplementary Budget will be presented to the D&aacute;il on the 7th of April and will set out a multi-annual plan to restore stability to the public finances.  The scale of the challenge we face means that all options must now be on the table, including action on both current and capital expenditure, as well as revenue raising measures.  The Government has already taken significant action to restore stability to the public finances and the Supplementary Budget will continue this process. <Col N="980"/> Taking action now will ensure that confidence in our public finances can be restored and that we are positioned to take advantage of a recovery in the international situation when it occurs.</P>
        <P>The Government has sought to engage all parties in our efforts to address the difficulties in the public finances and with this in mind I have made my Department available to the Opposition on an unprecedented scale by arranging for officials to brief the main opposition spokespersons on the latest available figures and on the emerging position.  The Opposition has also been asked to submit any proposals they may have to the Department of Finance for costing by officials and I am open to considering what further information that can be made available is put into the public domain in advance of the Supplementary Budget.</P>

	<P>Proposals for Voluntary Early Retirement (VER) are being developed at present for the public service.  However, I would point out that VER has to be seen in the wider context of the problems facing the public finances, and the related requirement for greater control and discipline in regard to public service numbers generally. </P>
        <P>The programme of rationalisation of State agencies, which I announced in Budget 2009, is relevant in this regard.  Work on implementing the rationalisation measures is now proceeding across all relevant Government Departments, and the broad approach to identifying and addressing staff surpluses may arise for consideration in particular areas.  The options for redeployment of staff generally within the civil service, and across the wider public service, are issues that logically fall to be considered in advance of the question of VER, and indeed my Department is considering these issues proactively at present.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes was established to examine the current expenditure programmes in each Department and to make recommendations for reducing public service numbers so as to assist the Government in its task of returning the public finances to a sustainable position.  The potential staff savings identified by the Special Group, and the mechanisms for addressing any surpluses, will likewise fall to be considered by the Government in due course in the context of an overall approach to controlling public service numbers, including any possible role for VER schemes in this regard.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide a reliable estimate of the number and value of cigarettes smuggled into Ireland in each of the past three years due to the fact that there is no proven method for determining this figure.</P>
        <P>Estimating the tax gap or the amount of tobacco tax lost as a result of smuggling is particularly difficult because of the multiple factors that have to be taken into account.  For instance, a drop in the overall tax take may be partly due to a decline in smoking levels as a result of the various anti-smoking campaigns. Increased legal purchase of duty paid cigarettes in other EU member states for personal use is also a factor, particularly in the context of low cost air travel and more frequent foreign holidays.  This, of course is perfectly legal in the context of the EU principle of freedom of movement.  Consequently the only reliable information available which I can give to the Deputy is the quantity and value of contraband cigarettes intercepted and seized by Customs and also the volumes of cigarettes on which duty is collected each year.</P>
        <P>Details of the above for each of the past three years are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Revenue is aware of a variety of methodologies that are used internationally by the tobacco industry and some Customs and Revenue Administrations for the purposes of estimating the quantity and value of cigarettes smuggled into their jurisdictions.  The variety of factors taken into account include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />national estimates of the overall number of cigarettes consumed each year</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />estimates of the quantity of cigarettes brought into the State legally by cross- border  shoppers</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />surveys of empty (discarded) cigarette packs conducted at periodic intervals throughout the country</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the volume of cigarettes on which excise duty is charged annually the number of cigarettes seized by customs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is evident that the only precise information that Revenue can confirm are the last two items listed above i.e. the volume of cigarettes on which duty has been collected and the actual quantity of cigarettes seized.  The remaining factors require a significant level of speculation and extrapolation.</P>
        <P>While the various estimates published in the media are at best speculative and are likely to include cigarettes purchased duty paid in other Member States brought into the State for personal consumption, the significant increase in the number of cigarettes seized in 2008 and the reduction in duty paid deliveries suggest that the overall level of smuggling may have increased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While Revenue is not in a position to estimate the volume of smuggled cigarettes it very tentatively estimates that about 20% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland may be untaxed in <Col N="982"/>Ireland.  This however includes substantial quantities of legitimate personal imports from other EU Member States and should be treated with caution.</P>
        <P>Turning to the question of resources available to Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service to combat cigarette smuggling, enforcement staff are deployed at all key ports and airports in the State for the purposes of detection, interception and seizure of both contraband cigarettes and drugs.  Staffing at these locations is subject to continuous review and staff numbers deployed at these locations are often augmented by additional staff from other areas particularly where specific operations are organised.</P>
        <P>Maritime freight and passengers arriving from high-risk countries are targeted on the basis of risk analysis which is carried out by specialist intelligence teams.  Customs relies heavily on intelligence from other Customs Administrations and receive valuable assistance and co-operation from the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF.  There is also close co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and multi-agency operations continue to be mounted where appropriate. Revenue also liaises with the Office of Tobacco Control.  In addition, Revenue receives close co-operation and information from the legitimate tobacco manufacturers and has regular meetings with these companies along with the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee (ITMAC).  The international agreements signed by Ireland along with other Member States and the Commission with Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International are also utilised.</P>
        <P>Staff carry out checks and searches at inland premises for contraband that may have evaded controls at the point of importation.  Customs also utilise the latest scanning technology and tobacco detector dogs to assist them in detecting contraband.  A Mobile Container Scanner was acquired two years ago and is normally based in Dublin where it is used to scan both accompanied and unaccompanied freight.  The scanner is also deployed in the other major ports as the need arises.  A procurement process to acquire a second Mobile Scanner is currently in train. Smaller baggage/parcel scanners are also located at the four major airports in Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock. Similar scanners are located at the ports of Rosslare and Ringaskiddy and at Portlaoise Mail Centre for screening mail.  In summary, while overall staff numbers in Revenue are being reduced, in the context of the Government decision on expenditure controls, the number of staff engaged in front line enforcement work in tackling smuggling and protecting tax receipts is being maintained and the position is being kept under review.	</P>

	<P>I am satisfied with the procedures in place to conduct economic forecasting in my Department.  </P>
        <P>Even in a normal environment, it must be noted that short-term economic forecasting is not an exact science, given the many dynamic components which make up the economy.  But we are not in a normal environment &mdash; conditions in the global economy are unfolding at a rapid pace, and this reflects the fall-out from the unprecedented financial market turbulence last September.  As a result of this, the uncertainty associated with forecasting is heightened to an almost unprecedented level, not just in Ireland but in almost every country in the world.</P><Col N="984"/>
        <P>This fact of how uncertain the global economic situation is can be seen by the frequency by which organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, OECD and EU Commission have reversed their forecasts for the global economy. The current global situation was not foreseen a year ago and it largely reflects a dramatic intensification of financial market difficulties since last September.  The impact of this on the global economy is evolving.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach, which is similar to others, is to identify the most likely outcome and then to identify the various risks &mdash; both domestic and international to this projection.  The majority of current difficulties were identified as risks in both Budget 2009 and in the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update published in January.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 30 together.</P>
        <P>The transactions to which the Deputy refers, between Anglo and IL&amp;P, are currently under investigation and I can not comment on those.  However, I understand that these were exceptional due to the materiality of the transactions and the involvement of a non-bank subsidiary.  I am not aware of any similar such transactions between Anglo Irish Bank and IL&amp;P.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there are ongoing financial transactions between Anglo Irish Bank and other financial institutions, in normal trade.  Such transactions include transactions between Anglo and the bank referred to, in Question 12455/09, during 2006 and 2007.  I am assured by the Financial Regulator the transactions with the bank are not similar to the IL&amp;P transactions on the grounds of the materiality level of the transactions and the fact that there was no involvement of a non-bank subsidiary.</P>

	<P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established on 2 April 2001 under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055. </P><Col N="985"/>
        <P>I have no plans to liquidate the Fund.  The Government announced on 11 February 2009 that it had agreed the recapitalisation terms to be offered to Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, under which the Government would provide &euro;3.5 billion in Core Tier 1 capital for each bank through the purchase of preference shares.  The announcement stated that the recapitalisation is to be funded from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, with &euro;4 billion being provided from the Fund&rsquo;s current resources and &euro;3 billion by frontloading the Exchequer contributions to the Fund for 2009 and 2010.  These investments will remain part of the Fund and the return earned on them will accrue to the Fund.  As the Deputy will be aware, the recently-enacted Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 provides for the necessary amendments to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to enable this proposal to be implemented.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>I am bringing proposals before the Government to introduce new structures for banking regulation that will provide for the integration of Central Bank responsibilities with regulatory and supervisory functions, new standards of corporate governance and a new approach to enhance consumer protection.  These changes are designed to restore Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and are consistent with the emerging international agenda for reform in the financial services sector.  The structural changes and a substantial increase in regulatory capacity will lead to a more effective and efficient financial services regulatory system which will be aligned to the best international standards.</P>
        <P>There is growing and extensive international literature on the causes of the financial crisis and identification of issues that need to be addressed on the supervisory front, to which I do not propose to add.  I particularly welcome the report of the de Larosi&egrave;re Group, prepared at the request of the President of the European Commission and published on 25 February 2009.  The De Larosi&egrave;re report provides a thorough analysis of the origins of the current financial crisis and, while acknowledging there is room for debate on the relative importance  to be assigned to regulation in relation to the crisis, nonetheless sets out clear recommendations for reform of financial services  regulation and supervision, which I welcome.  The proposals I am bringing to Government are fully consistent with its central proposal for action at national level to strengthen the link between macroeconomic surveillance and macro prudential supervision.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for administering the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions provided under the Credit Union Act 1997, with a view to the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability of credit unions generally.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will recognise, the current serious difficulties in the financial sector and the accompanying economic downturn is affecting all financial institutions, including credit unions.  On account of the reduced availability of credit in the banking system credit unions are now experiencing an increase in demand from their members for loans.   There has also been some increase in bad and doubtful debts and, as is the case across the whole of the financial sector, there have been losses on credit union investments.  It is not surprising that this combination of trends has led to a situation where credit unions generally have reported a decline in profits for 2008.</P>
        <P>I am aware of recent media reports regarding difficulties with which the Registrar of Credit Unions is dealing in a small minority of credit unions.  Following the Government&rsquo;s decision last September on the extension and increase in protection available under the Deposit Guarantee <Col N="987"/>Scheme, all credit union savers can be reassured that their deposits and shares to the total maximum value of &euro;100,000 are safe and secure.  The credit union movement as a whole is in a relatively strong financial position with solid liquidity and reserves.  The Registrar of Credit Unions has highlighted that, of the 419 credit unions registered in the Republic, only a handful are affected by these difficulties.  The Registrar is continuing to work closely with the boards of those credit unions that are encountering problems.  Very close oversight, monitoring and controls over these credit unions by the Registrar of Credit Unions are intended to assist them in addressing current issues and to ensure their long-term stability and sustainability.</P>
        <P>In addition, it should be noted that the Irish League of Credit Unions maintains a savings protection fund in excess of &euro;105 million which is available to help stabilise the position of any credit union that encounters problems.  The Department of Finance also is actively considering proposals in consultation with the representative bodies for credit unions for a central liquidity fund using the surplus liquidity in the credit union movement as a whole to support credit unions that may experience any temporary difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Registrar of Credit Unions is of the view, and I am in full agreement with him on this point, that there is no reason credit unions cannot survive and prosper in the present financial environment.  He has advised credit unions that the focus of day-to-day management within credit unions must be to ensure that adequate liquid resources are always available for operational purposes and that surplus funds should be held in liquid form.  Credit committees in credit unions should be given clear limits on the total funds available for the granting of loans, bearing in mind the availability of liquid resources.  Easy access to liquid funds must be a priority.  Lending criteria must be based on carefully researched factors and on conservative estimates of the ability and commitment of the potential borrower to repay a loan.</P>
        <P>The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions using the powers available under the Credit Union Act 1997.  This rules-based legislation provides extensive powers of direction to the Registrar to ensure the financial soundness and safety of credit unions and to protect credit union savers.  The Registrar can also issue regulatory direction and prohibition orders to a credit union in relation to a broad range of issues including, investments, raising of funds, loans, assets and liabilities ratios and the composition of their assets and liabilities.  He has extensive powers of inspection and investigation of credit unions as well as broad supervisory powers, for example, to appoint, suspend or remove a person as a director of a credit union or to remove auditors.  A number of offences are also provided for in the Act.</P>
        <P>The extensive powers currently available to the Registrar under the Act are important in ensuring that the regulatory system is robust and effective and in particular safeguards members&rsquo; savings.  The rules-based approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act has clearly served the credit union movement well, as is demonstrated by small minority of credit unions which the Registrar is currently monitoring closely in the current environment.</P>

	<P>As part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December <Col N="988"/>commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator.  The banks will make quarterly reports, with the first report to end March 2009 to be submitted by end April 2009.</P>
        <P>Government Departments and State agencies have engaged with banks and business representatives in a variety of settings on issues surrounding the flow of credit for business.  A formal structure for those contacts on an ongoing basis will be finalised shortly.  An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives, is also under way.</P>
        <P>A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February and took effect on 13 March.  This code will apply to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.  Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.  This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, a &euro;100 million environmental and clean energy innovation fund has been established by each of the recapitalised banks.  A quarterly report to the Financial Regulator of the loans made and the purposes for which they have been made will be required.  The banks have also agreed to each provide &euro;15 million to a new seed capital fund with Enterprise Ireland.  The banks funding will be matched as appropriate by funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed and Venture Capital Programme and/or by funding from other national or international investors. It is expected that much of these funds will be utilised by SMEs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited the Shannon Callows last year and met with those affected by the flooding.  I am conscious of the <Col N="989"/>very serious impact on both farming and the environment in the area.  Due to exceptionally heavy rainfall, the problem in 2008 was more severe than the normal summer flooding in the Callows.  The extremely flat gradient of the river, together with the environmentally protected status of the location, makes it very difficult to devise a cost-effective solution.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works carried out some clearance of vegetation in the area, which, although not sufficient to prevent the flooding last year, is generally acknowledged to have improved the situation.  This work was carried out with the agreement of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and in consultation with other stakeholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Farmers Association requested that dredging be undertaken to remove accumulated silt, which they believed was reducing the capacity of the channel through the &ldquo;New Cut&rdquo;.  The Office of Public Works, having carefully studied the matter, was not convinced that the proposed silt removal would yield any further substantial relief of summer flooding in the Shannon Callows.  It was, nevertheless, in recognition of the conviction of landowners that dredging would be effective, in light of the hardship, which the summer flooding causes, and in the absence of any better short-term solution prepared, subject to resolution of significant environmental issues, decided to undertake a limited amount of silt removal as a pilot scheme to demonstrate the efficacy or otherwise of the measure.  It has not proved possible to date to resolve the environmental concerns and I regret that, in the light of the current budgetary constraints, it is no longer possible to justify undertaking these further works where the economic benefit cannot be clearly demonstrated.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, the Office of Public Works has no plans for further works in the immediate future.  OPW will continue to monitor the situation and will be willing to consider any works, which can be justified economically and environmentally.  The preparation of a Catchment Flood Risk Management Plan for the Shannon, which I expect will commence within the next 12 months, will build on previous reports and may present an opportunity to examine the problem on a comprehensive basis in the whole catchment context.</P>

In the context of the six-month review of the guarantee scheme to be completed by mid-April 2009, the Government will examine how the scheme could be revised, subject to European Commission approval and consistent with EU state aid requirements, to achieve a reduction in risk overall, including by supporting longer-term bond issuance by the covered institutions.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy is referring to a recent economic forecast produced by Ulster Bank in which they anticipate a very large contraction in growth with unemployment rising to the levels mentioned in the question. </P>
        <P>I would point out that there is a wide range of economic forecasts produced by a variety of financial institutions regarding the likely outcome for this year.  In this regard, the market consensus at end-February was for GDP to contract by 4&frac12;% this year and by 1&frac34;% next year.  The market is forecasting unemployment to reach 13&frac12;% by the end of next year.  The consensus is also for house prices to decline by an average of 10% this year and by 5% next year.</P>
        <P>My Department will publish revised economic growth and labour market forecasts in the supplementary budget next month.  Irrespective of what the forecasts are, it is clear that a large fall in economic activity is in prospect and that unemployment is going to rise substantially.  Figures published this morning by the Central Statistics Office give an indication as to the scale of the difficulties.</P>

	<P>Information is not collated centrally on a routine basis on the number of direct and indirect jobs that would be created as a result of Exchequer capital investment.</P>
        <P>However, my Department has recently completed an exercise on the labour intensity of infrastructure investment more broadly.  This exercise found that, with a few exceptions, the labour intensity of capital projects falls within a range of 8-12 direct jobs created per &euro;1 million expenditure.  It also found that &ldquo;minor&rdquo; works tend to be more labour intensive in terms of direct jobs created than major new build projects.  Both of these findings would be broadly supported by the academic studies that were consulted as part of the exercise conducted by my Department.</P>
        <P>Of course, as well as taking account of the impact on employment, any decisions in relation to capital investment will also consider the extent to which that investment enhances the productive capacity of the economy and generates economic returns over the longer term.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Financial Regulator that Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited (an Irish licensed credit institution) advised it on 18 February 2009 of matters in relation to the mispricing of trades in their London branch.  Authorised officers of the Financial Regulator attended on site in the London branch in the days following this contact.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has also informed me that Merrill Lynch/Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America is Merrill&rsquo;s parent company) have employed independent external expertise to investigate the circumstances in conjunction with Bank of America&rsquo;s corporate audit and have agreed the scope of this investigation with the Financial Regulator and the UK Financial Services Authority.  The Financial Regulator is also liaising with Bank of America/Merrill&rsquo;s parent US regulators on this matter.  The Financial Regulator is receiving daily updates on the progress of this investigation.  While this investigation continues, the Financial Regulator is not in a position to comment further on the matter.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to National Lottery funding is that receipts from the sale of National Lottery tickets are deposited in the National Lottery Fund in the Central Bank.  A portion of these funds is transferred by my Department into the Exchequer over the course of each year on the basis of the projected surplus for that year.  The monies transferred into the Exchequer are entered as non-tax revenue and, as such, form part of the general pool out of which expenditure is financed. </P>
        <P>Since 2005, the total allocation for subheads which had formerly been funded entirely from the proceeds of the National Lottery has exceeded the funds available from the National Lottery.

        <P>Since 2005, the total allocation for subheads which had formerly been funded entirely from the proceeds of the National Lottery has exceeded the funds available from the National Lottery.  The total amount of funding is determined in the Estimates process, and is paid out of the general pool of revenue of which National Lottery proceeds form part. Subheads that, prior to 2005, were exclusively funded by National Lottery funds are now funded by a combination of National Lottery and Exchequer funding. It is not, therefore, possible to indicate the percentage of National Lottery funding which was included in the allocations provided in the subheads relating to sport which are part-funded by the National Lottery in the Vote for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P>Funds from the National Lottery as a percentage of the total allocation for all subheads which are part-funded by the proceeds of the National Lottery amounted to 52% in 2007 and 57% in 2008.

        <P>It is my view that recent detailed disclosures in relation to the remuneration of the CEO of the INBS require investigation.

While the reply to that letter indicated that the payment concerned was contractually committed before the Government guarantee I have asked that the two directors appointed by the board nominated by me should review all of these issues and that I would receive a report within one month.

	<P>Based on the latest information available at the end of last year my Department set out its expectation that the Consumer Price Index <Col N="995"/>(CPI) would fall this year by -1.0% but that Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation would be slightly positive, at &frac12;% for 2009 as a whole. These forecasts were contained in the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update published on 9th January this year.</P>
        <P>Since then, inflation data for December, January and February have been released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). In addition the ECB has cut interest rates by a full percentage point significantly impacting on the CPI index, while falls in regulated energy prices have also been announced. Furthermore, the weakening economic climate has led to a fall-off in price pressures across a range of sectors. My Department now expects CPI inflation to be lower then previously expected in 2009 and could average around &minus;3&frac34;% for the year as a whole. HICP inflation is expected to be negative too, averaging around &minus;1&frac12;% for 2009 as a whole.</P>

	<P>The primary objective of the Government is to secure and maintain the financial and economic position of the State. Significant steps have been taken to achieve that objective including the Bank Guarantee Scheme and the recapitalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s two main banks. An essential element of the recapitalisation scheme, which I expect to be implemented in the very near future, anticipates the banks involved increasing the level of credit available throughout the economy. As part of the recapitalisation measures, the recapitalised banks have committed to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator. An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed <Col N="996"/>shortly. Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis. I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has also worked closely with my Department to introduce two new codes. The code of conduct for business lending applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner. The second code covers mortgage arrears and is designed to ensure that mortgage lenders take action to assist householders who are in arrears and will apply to all mortgage lenders, including banks, building societies and retail credit firms.</P>
        <P>The question of issuing specific directives to the banks does not arise at this point in time. I fully expect that the banks concerned will meet their commitments under the recapitalisation scheme to increase the level of credit available nationally. Compliance with those commitments will be monitored by the Financial Regulator, the independent review of credit availability referred to above and by the State&rsquo;s appointees on the recapitalised banks.</P>

If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator. The banks will make quarterly reports, with the first report to end March 2009 to be submitted by end April 2009.

	<P>As a general rule, the State&rsquo;s relationship with the banks following their proposed recapitalisation will be managed through two conduits. Firstly the NPRF Commission will hold the shares on the State&rsquo;s behalf and develop a shareholder/company relationship with the banks.  Also arrangements will be put in place to monitor closely the commitments made by the banks in relation to the recapitalisation and to monitor the State&rsquo;s interests as a stakeholder.</P>
        <P>Secondly, I will appoint 25% of the members of the Boards of these banks. Initially this will involve two extra Directors as there are already two Directors appointed from panels nominated by myself to each of the banks to be recapitalised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the latest information available at the end of last year my Department set out its expectation that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) would fall this year by -1.0% but that Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation would be slightly positive, at &frac12;% for 2009 as a whole. These forecasts were contained in the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update published on 9th January this year.</P>
        <P>Since then, inflation data for December, January and February have been released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). In addition the ECB has cut interest rates by a full percentage point significantly impacting on the CPI index, while falls in regulated energy prices have also been announced. Furthermore, the weakening economic climate has led to a fall-off in price pressures across a range of sectors. My Department now expects CPI inflation to be lower then previously expected in 2009 and could average around -3¾% for the year as a whole. HICP inflation is expected to be negative too, averaging around -1&frac12;% for 2009 as a whole. My Department&rsquo;s forecasts for inflation will be published on April 7th with the Supplementary Budget.</P>
        <P>While prices are currently falling and will on average do so this year, it is important to stress that this is not expected to continue. The reason we have entered a short period of declining prices is mainly due to large falls in mortgage interest rates as well as the fall-back in the sharp increases in energy and food prices last year. It is generally expected that both CPI and HICP inflation will be positive in 2010.</P>
        <P>The current and prospective easing in inflation will have both positive and negative effects. It will lead to an increase in households&rsquo; purchasing power, helping all but especially those on tighter budgets, and this is to be welcomed. In addition, in recent years price levels in Ireland have risen to some 20% above the rest of the euro area, which has damaged our international competitiveness. Inflation continuing below the euro area average should help us to regain some of the price competitiveness which we have lost in recent years.</P>
        <P>That said, falling prices also means an increase in the real burden of debt so I would not like to see a prolonged period of declining prices. In the case of mortgage debt, the Government has put in place supports for households experiencing difficulties in meeting mortgage payments. For example, the Mortgage Interest Supplement provides assistance where the mortgage relates to the sole place of residence. In addition, the new mandatory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, incorporates a requirement for the lender to wait at least six months from <Col N="998"/>the time arrears arise before taking legal action. In addition, the recapitalised banks have assured the Government that in the normal course they will make every effort to avoid repossessions, as indicated by the low level of repossessions by them to date.</P>

	<P>In the context of the normal December Budget day decisions for both expenditure and taxation, monthly profiles of projected receipts and expenditure are generally published by my Department by the end of January every year. However this year, against a difficult and deteriorating economic background, it has proven necessary to revise the fiscal forecasts, initially in the context of the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update which was submitted to the European Commission on 9 January last and now in the context of the Supplementary Budget to be published on 7 April. Consequently, the publication of the monthly profiles has been delayed this year. I expect tax and expenditure profiles to be published by my Department shortly after the Supplementary Budget.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2009, I announced 30 rationalisation decisions that will reduce the number of State agencies by 41.  The specific details with regard to reductions in numbers and the requirement for new legislation is a matter for the relevant Departments responsible for each of the rationalisation proposals.  The general policy approach is to create efficiencies, including staffing efficiencies, through streamlining the delivery of public services, removing duplication of functions and promoting Departmental and Ministerial responsibility.  The requirement for new legislation arises from the individual circumstances of the bodies, for example where the functions of statutory bodies are being changed or the body abolished. The assignment of staff to work outside of the agencies is in general a human resources/industrial relations issue and does not normally require new legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current vehicle registration plate numbering system in the State does not lend itself to the creation of a market for the purchase and transfer of personalised number plates. In order to create a successful market, the current system would need to be redesigned or augmented by a parallel plate numbering system.</P>
        <P>The registration plate in place under the current system allows members of the public and car buyers to ascertain, at a glance, both the year and county of registration of a vehicle. It is <Col N="999"/>seen as a simple and effective registration plate system which is indeed the envy of many European registration authorities, including the UK. A move to a more complicated plating system, using variations of letters and numbers, could create confusion without providing any real benefits.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A move to introduce a parallel system for personalised plates would also require inter-agency agreement, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Transport and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; and would necessitate legislative and administrative changes.</P>
        <P>The small size of the Irish car market, the potential for confusion and increased tax evasion, as well as the costs of administering such a scheme, raise considerable doubts as to whether any real overall benefit would accrue to the State if a personalised vehicle registration system was introduced. These difficulties are compounded by potential additional problems in the management of the national fleet and the identification of vehicles in connection with road traffic accidents and offences.</P>

	<P>There are considerable uncertainties regarding the economic impact of any fiscal measures, given that it is unknown how economic agents will react to the various policy changes.  In addition, the composition of the fiscal package would be important, as different policy measures would have different economic impacts.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the economic impact of fiscal measures can be estimated in broad terms.</P>
        <P>A fiscal package designed to raise &euro;4.5 billion in 2009 is the equivalent of about &euro;6 billion in a full year and would amount to around 3&frac12;% of GDP for 2009 as a whole. Taking account of a number of factors such as the potential for significant &lsquo;leakages&rsquo; through imports and some <Col N="1000"/>impact on price rather than on the quantity of output it is estimated that GDP growth would be around 1&frac12;% lower than would otherwise be the case on foot of these measures. Broadly similar pro rata rates apply to the other amounts.</P>
        <P>However, there is potential for considerable variation on the macroeconomic impact depending on the exact nature of any fiscal package. Furthermore, account of the potential for enhanced consumer and investor confidence and greater future certainty that such a package may have would also have to be considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to the unprecedented crisis in global financial markets has been structured and considered.  The series of measures taken to ensure the stabilisation of the Irish financial system since last September evidences the proactive stance taken by the Government.  In deciding policy approaches, the Government has taken advice and consulted with the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the National Treasury Management Agency and its legal and financial advisors.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that following a drain on liquidity in the Irish banking system in 2008, the Government, through the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008, guaranteed all the deposits, covered bonds, senior debt and dated subordinated debt (lower tier II) of seven Irish banking institutions (covered institutions).  This very important initiative by the Government was designed to protect the Irish financial system and to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy caused by the turmoil in the international financial markets.</P>
        <P>The Guarantee scheme (the scheme) has proved successful in safeguarding the stability of the Irish banking sector and in restoring its liquidity position in order to support its normal lending activities.</P>
        <P>As I have emphasised on several occasions, the scheme imposes very strict conditions to ensure that balance sheet growth is measured and in accordance with prudent banking practice, that risk is properly measured and managed.</P>
        <P>In addition to what is contained in the scheme, the Financial Regulator has instigated a series of regulatory measures to take account of the changed environment, including an increased focus on the management of credit and liquidity risks of the banks.</P>
        <P>Among the actions the Financial Regulator is taking are the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the recruitment of an additional 20 senior supervisory staff with banking experience to be placed on-site in key banks to monitor developments;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />requiring banks to set out new business plans focusing on the need to reduce their risk profile and how their models of banking are sustainable in the new environment; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />enhanced reporting obligations in relation to capital, asset quality and individual large loans to supplement daily liquidity reporting requirements.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As the Deputy is aware, in early January the Government nationalised Anglo Irish Bank.  Anglo Irish Bank is a major financial institution whose viability is of systemic importance <Col N="1001"/>to Ireland. The Government has made clear that it will ensure its continued viability as a going concern.</P>
        <P>In view of the continuing turmoil in global financial markets the Government decided on 11 February, on a comprehensive recapitalisation package for AIB and Bank of Ireland which will reinforce the stability of our financial system, increase confidence in the banking system here, and facilitate the banks involved in lending to the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government is also in discussions with other covered institutions (Irish Life and Permanent, EBS and INBS) concerning their respective capital positions and is reviewing the guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>In the context of the six month review of the guarantee Scheme to be completed during April 2009 the Government will examine how the Scheme could be revised subject to European Commission approval and consistent with EU State aid requirements, in ways which include supporting longer-term bond issuance by the covered institutions. This would be in line with international and EU trends where the average term of State cover for bond issues extends beyond 2010.</P>
        <P>Irish institutions have engaged in lending for land and property development which exposes them to specific risk at a time of falling property prices and difficult economic conditions.  The Government will examine proposals for the management and reduction of risks within financial institutions with respect to these specific exposures, having regard to international developments.  I will be carrying forward this work to produce proposals as a matter of priority.</P>

	<P>As far as safeguarding the interests of individual borrowers is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for effective and efficient regulation of the financial services sector. Much progress has been made in this regard over recent years, through such measures as the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman and the publication of the Financial Regulator Consumer Protection Code (CPC) in August 2006.</P>
        <P>The CPC, which came into full effect from July 2007, represents a major step in promoting the interests of consumers in that it obligates the regulated entities that it covers to act in the customer&rsquo;s best interests, to seek appropriate information about the customer, to ensure that the products and services provided are suitable for the consumer, to treat their customers fairly and have adequate procedures in place to handle complaints. These obligations are additional to the statutory prior information and warnings required under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has prioritised the provision of information for consumers about the potential risk of excessive debt and has also drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs. It has also developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products.</P><Col N="1002"/>

</table>        <P FLI="0">In the context of the supplementary budgetary measures to be announced on Tuesday, 7th April my Department will be publishing revised projections.</P>
        <P>On foot of its report on Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary position last month, under Article 104 of the Treaty which governs the operation of the excessive deficit procedure of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission has now adopted proposals for a Council recommendation to Ireland.  This is part of the normal operation of the Pact whenever the General Government Deficit of a Member State exceeds the reference value of 3% of GDP as did that of Ireland and of a number of other Member States in 2008.</P>
        <P>The proposed recommendation invites Ireland to reduce the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2013.  This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy.</P>
        <P>Following a meeting of the EU&rsquo;s Economic and Financial Committee on 26th and 27th March which is being is attended by officials of my Department, the proposed Council recommendation will be among those considered by the Ecofin Council next month.  As is normal in these circumstances, I have been in regular contact with the Commission and with my European colleagues with regard to the position of the public finances.</P>
        <P>Council recommendations are intended to support and encourage the Member State(s) concerned in its pursuit of necessary, if difficult, budgetary measures to reduce the deficit below 3% of GDP in a timeframe taking account of the economic background.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the support of the Commission and Council for the overall budgetary strategy of restoring stability to the public finances, while taking steps also to maximise short-term economic activity and employment and improve competitiveness.</P>

	<P>The National Treasury Management Agency has successfully issued two new bonds (totalling &euro;10 billion) in 2009 and this week it launched the first of a series of auctions of long-term bonds. The auction was nearly three times oversubscribed. In common with other euro sovereign borrowers benchmarked against Germany, Ireland&rsquo;s cost of borrowing has increased. There are a range of factors that influence the cost of borrowing on the international market &mdash; the bank guarantee being one of them. However, it should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s cost of borrowing has fallen recently from the levels recorded earlier in the year.</P>

	<P>There is provision in Paragraph 22 of the Scheme that I may review the guarantee charging model every six months.  I expect that the <Col N="1004"/>first of these reviews will be completed during April 2009.  The review process will require advice from the Central Bank, Financial Regulator and the NTMA.</P>
        <P>The thinking behind the Charging Model is set out in some detail in the Annexe to the Scheme. The charge is calculated by reference to the composition of the covered institution&rsquo;s average month-end covered liabilities during the preceding quarter.  Each covered institution pays its share in accordance with its risk profile and the guarantee charging model, subject to the estimated cost to the Exchequer being fully recouped.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that Irish bond spreads have widened against the benchmark German bund over recent months.  There are complex factors at play, many not specific to Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, in regard to Ireland, the fiscal performance is and will continue to be a key issue.  In this regard I have outlined at length the necessity to bring public spending and revenue into better balance.</P>

	<P>There is no universally accepted definition of the term depression, but my own view is that the experience of the 1930s in many countries is an accurate description of the term.</P>
        <P>In Ireland after a very long period of sustained growth we are now experiencing a deep recession. As a result living standards will decline significantly and we will all have to adjust our expectations of what can be achieved. The figures published by the Central Statistics Office this morning provide an indication as to the scale of the downturn currently underway.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the downward adjustment, the Deputy should note that economic activity and income levels in Ireland remain comparatively high by international and historical standards. Furthermore, we must remember that recessions end and that we must now prepare ourselves to be best able to take advantage of the global economic pick-up when it emerges.</P>

	<P>As I have noted previously, the Government&rsquo;s approach to recapitalisation has been structured and considered and based on a detailed assessment of the institutions concerned.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine the capital position of the institutions covered under the Guarantee Scheme. This examination included an assessment of the level of impairment of assets under various stress scenarios. A further assessment of the market values of land and development assets was carried out by Jones Lang LaSalle to complement this work. Following the completion of the Government&rsquo;s due diligence exercise, which is currently being finalised, the proposals will be put to EGMs of both banks over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The recapitalisation of the institutions in question addresses both the expectations of international markets on the Irish bank&rsquo;s capital levels, and strengthens the ability of institutions to cope with impaired loans in conjunction existing reserves and retained profit from performing loans and other trading activities.</P>
        <P>The share price of an institution reflects a broad market assessment of a business or sector and the objective of the recapitalisation is not to support the share price but to support the stability of the institution concerned. The current depressed share prices of banks internationally indicate an uncertainty over the future operation and earning potential of banks globally and this is no different for the institutions referred to by the Deputy. In this regard the Government has indicated that it is committed to ensuring the stability of the Irish financial system and protecting systemic institutions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Treasury Management Agency has advised me that the main reasons for the increase in the forecast cost of servicing the national debt for 2009 are the increase in the estimate for the 2009 Exchequer Borrowing Requirement and the higher interest rates currently prevailing on Government bonds.  The current elevated yields on Irish Government bonds reflect both global factors which are affecting all euro sovereign borrowers benchmarked to the German bond, and national specific factors, which would include the state of the public finances and the bank guarantee. I understand that it is impossible to quantify the specific impact that each of these diverse individual factors have on the borrowing cost. The NTMA notes that the cost of borrowing for Ireland has fallen recently from the levels recorded earlier in the year.</P>

	<P>The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 in conjunction with the Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Transport Activities) Regulations 2004-S.I. No. 817 of 2004 provide that the maximum average working week of 48 hours and the rest periods and rest breaks provided for in that legislation apply to taxi drivers who have employee status.</P>
        <P>Section 33 of the 1997 Act provides that if an employee, such as a taxi driver with employee status, works for two employers he or she may not work more than an average 48 hour week aggregated between the two employers. Section 33 also provides that it is an offence for the second employer to require an employee to work in excess of these hours between both employers and also for the employee to so work between both employers.</P>
        <P>Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, on which the 1997 Act is based, applies only to workers or employees and does not apply to the self-employed. Accordingly, as it was enacted to transpose the terms of the Directive, the 1997 Act does not apply to the self- employed.</P>
        <P>In addition the 1997 Act is employment rights legislation and in common with the wide range of such legislation enacted over the years only applies to workers or employees.</P>
        <P>The rationale for the Working Time Directive and the 1997 Act applying to workers or employees only and not to the self- employed is that employees or workers would be vulnerable to any pressure from their employer to work long hours in excess of the maximum average 48 hour week set out in the Directive and 1997 Act, unlike the self-employed who are in a position to control their own working hours. In the circumstances there are no proposals to amend the 1997 Act.</P>

Their work is a very important part of regular short and medium term analysis of what our economy requires to stay competitive.  The National Development Plan 2006-2013 underpins competitiveness by improving our infrastructure stock and putting in place advanced capital programmes for our future needs.  Of the numerous steps taken to enhance competitiveness since 2001, I would like to highlight some introduced by my department, in particular:</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Further details of strategies are included in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Reports.</P>
        <P>To offset the competitive threat from lower wage economies, in recent years my department has implemented a series of policies to encourage a move to higher productivity levels and the production of higher value added goods and services.  Maintaining our low rate of corporation tax, has been of particular value in attracting Foreign Direct Investment.</P>
        <P>In common with many other developed economies, we continue to invest in the &ldquo;knowledge economy&rdquo;. Over the past ten years we have reshaped the infrastructure for research and innovation with strong investment in centres of research excellence, enterprise incubators in universities and many new programmes to help ordinary firms commercialise new ideas. Our policies have led economic activity into new areas, opening up new and sustainable sources of competitive advantage such as life sciences, biotechnology, services and related research, development and innovation.  That commitment has delivered successes in terms of our international reputation and our ability to compete for internationally mobile research-related investment.</P>
        <P>Our long-term commitment to investing in and supporting science will, I am confident, bring an additional dimension to our competitiveness as well as taking us to a new level of innovation and entrepreneurial activity.</P>

	<P>Under the Framework for Economic Renewal we are taking a number of measures across Government to address competitiveness objectives. A key element of the Government&rsquo;s current strategy to develop the enterprise sector is to encourage increased levels of investment in research, using more technology in product development and encouraging more innovation.  &ldquo;Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy&rdquo; sets a clear agenda to help manage this change.</P>
        <P>I believe that our economic prosperity exists to a significant degree on our capability to build &lsquo;high tech&rsquo; &mdash; &lsquo;high value&rsquo; businesses that can compete successfully from an early stage in global markets. In order to be competitive and to increase exports, Irish companies must focus on improving productivity, investing in research and continue applying innovative solutions to every facet of their business process. I believe that our success in stimulating business to do more R&amp;D will be a key determinant of our future economic well-being. Our development <Col N="1010"/>agencies are assisting companies to this end. Agencies are also focused on helping companies to identify and drive down costs to sustain existing jobs and generate new employment and economic growth for Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Implementation of the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing will strengthen the manufacturing sector to maximise its potential and exploit new opportunities.  I will shortly be announcing the membership of the Manufacturing Forum who will oversee implementation of these recommendations.</P>
        <P>Our competitiveness priorities also include a strong focus on skills, education and training.  Lifelong education fundamentally supports advances in productivity, upon which our competitiveness depends. I will shortly be announcing an implementation plan for the National Skills Strategy.</P>
        <P>We are committed to support the development of environmental technologies in Ireland in order to achieve a win-win situation of improved competitiveness and environmental performance. Emerging sectors such as Environmental Products and Services have significant potential and will be targeted.  Both IDA and Enterprise Ireland have recently established an internal team to identify enterprise opportunities for Ireland in the newly emerging clean /green sectors.</P>
        <P>We know that services innovation is as vital as technological innovation as a key driver of performance.  We are committed to assist business in realising their potential for non-technological innovation through the development of new business models, customer-interfaces and service-products, as an invaluable source of business, as well as, national competitiveness.  We want to successfully reach those services companies that traditional RTD innovation policy has not. Ongoing implementation of the Services Strategy will be important in this respect.</P>
        <P>Our investment in R&amp;D places the higher education system at the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development strategy for the coming years.  Science Foundation Ireland is working on developing initiatives to forge closer links between Ireland&rsquo;s higher education institutes and industry to drive the R&amp; D agenda.  I believe it essential that we continue to maintain the best possible conditions across all policy spheres for supporting and sustaining innovation.</P>

	<P>My Department and F&Aacute;S have been continually monitoring the trends in apprenticeship. A number of measures are being put in place to assist apprentices who have become redundant in completing their apprenticeship. These measures are providing assistance to over 2,600 redundant apprentices. These include the following. </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S Employment Services Division is focusing on assisting redundant apprentices to source employment, in order that they can complete their apprenticeship by receiving on-the-job training and undertaking the associated competence based assessments.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The scheduling rules for off-the-job training were amended to permit redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships to the next off-the-job phase. This change in the scheduling rules has permitted 428 apprentices to attend phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job <Col N="1011"/>training in 2008 and 398 apprentices attended off-the-job training in the term January 2009 to March 2009.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The scheduling of apprentices for term 3, commencing on 6th April, 2009, is expected to provide for at least 700 apprentices to attend Phase 4 and Phase 6 off-the-job training in the Institutes of Technology.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />115 redundant apprentices are currently attending phase 2 training and a further 47 are expected to be called to attend training over the next number of weeks.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme will provide for up to 500 places during 2009 and currently there are over 90 redundant apprentices placed with eligible employers.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S and ESB Networks have agreed to the placement of 400 redundant electrical apprentices during 2009/2010, for redundant apprentices at phase 5 and phase 7.  The first group of 22 apprentices commenced their on-the-job placement with ESB Networks on 23/3/09.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />L&eacute;argas provided part funding for redundant apprentices for the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing and Brick &amp; Stonelaying to be placed with employers in Germany to complete their phase 7 on-the-job assessments.  Twenty redundant apprentices are currently in Germany placed with German employers.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A handbook/travel guide is in development for apprentices who gain employment overseas</P>
        <P FLI="0">My Department and F&Aacute;S will continue to monitor the situation and trends closely and will work with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that redundant apprentices will have every opportunity to complete their apprenticeship and gain a craft qualification.</P>

	<P>The State makes a significant investment in training measures for both employed and unemployed. The amount of funding invested in those in employment has increased significantly over recent years and has been used to facilitate a broad range of upskilling programmes, ranging from basic literacy and numeracy to specific skills or support to build the management capabilities and skills within companies to help them achieve their business goals. Such upskilling for those in employment is provided through the various agencies of my Department together with Skillsnet Ltd.</P>
        <P>In order to meet the challenges of the changing economy there will be a policy emphasis on activation and training for the unemployed. This includes a focus on those most recently unemployed, where additional opportunities for training and re-skilling are being provided. In the current economic climate it is important to ensure that such people can avail of relatively immediate upskilling to best position themselves to re-enter employment with improved skills.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>Persons under 55 years of age who fulfil the criteria for CE may be eligible for a maximum of 3 years participation on the Scheme.</P>
        <P>It is not my intention to change the rule for those under 55 years, however, the operation of the Scheme is being kept under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.</P>

        <P>Betting duty is payable by the bookmaker. If a bookmaker were to establish an on-line betting operation within the State, the bookmaker would be liable to pay betting duty. In general, however, the charge to pay duty does not apply to on-line betting because virtually all providers of such a service are based outside the State. A similar scenario occurs in the case of bets carried out by telephone. This is not unusual since these types of operations tend to locate in jurisdictions that have extremely low levels of taxation.</P>
        <P>As I stated during the Finance Bill process, it has been my intention to widen if possible the tax base on which betting duty would be applied. One obvious option in this regard is to include bets placed on-line or over the telephone with companies outside the State. However, it is clear that there are very serious legal difficulties surrounding this option which my officials are exploring on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>Under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective, Ireland has been allocated &euro;750 million of EU Structural Funds for the period 2007-13: of this &euro;458 million has been allocated to the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) Region and &euro;292 million to the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) Region. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF), which sets out the strategy for using these Funds, was approved by the European Commission in July 2007.  The BMW and S&amp;E European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and National European Social Fund (ESF) co-funded Operational Programmes implementing the strategic priorities in the NSRF <Col N="1014"/>were approved by the European Commission on 16th October and 6th November 2007 respectively.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;151m has been allocated under ERDF for smaller Territorial Co-operation Operational Programmes, e.g. the INTERREG Programmes for Ireland/Northern Ireland/Scotland and Ireland/Wales and the PEACE III Programme.</P>
        <P>The Structural Funds programmes are co-financed both from the EU Funding and nationally allocated Exchequer funds.  The EU Regulation (EC No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006) sets out the general provisions for the ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund.  This states that the contribution from the funds at the level of operational programmes under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment and Territorial Co-operation objectives shall be subject to ceilings of 50% and 75% respectively.</P>
        <P>Following the negotiations with the Commission on the content of the BMW and S&amp;E ERDF Operational Programmes, the Commission decisions dated the 16th October 2007 approving the Operational Programmes set the maximum co-financing rates for each of them at 40%; that is the Exchequer will fund 60% and the EU ERDF contribution will be 40%.   The Commission decisions in relation to the INTERREG and PEACE III Operational Programmes set the maximum co-financing rates at 75% and 67.54% respectively.</P>

Planning permission for such use was granted in May 2008.  However, in the current financial climate, there are no immediate plans to progress further with this project.  The situation will, nevertheless, be kept under review in the light of the developing financial picture.  A number of bodies and organisations have expressed an interest in the past in acquiring the property in the event that it is deemed surplus to State requirements.  Should it be decided that this is the case, the normal procedure would be to dispose of it by way of public tender.</P>

	<P>Charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT <Col N="1015"/>registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.  Accordingly, it is not possible under EU law to change the current VAT treatment of charities.</P>
        <P>Even if funds were available for grant-aiding charities and other voluntary groups, it is not clear that the most appropriate use of Exchequer funds would be to relieve VAT as opposed to supporting their activities using other criteria, as is already being done, which provides a more focused approach.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that I recently published the report by the Covered Institution Remuneration Oversight Committee (CIROC) which recommended reductions in prevailing base salary, bonus and pension levels for chief executives, chairpersons and ordinary board members that the Committee considered to be, in many cases, markedly excessive. The Committee report, that with the exception of the Irish Nationwide Building Society where the CEO was paid a pre-contracted incentive bonus of &euro;1,000,000 in relation to 2008, no bonuses will be paid to chief executives or the senior executive management teams in relation to performance in 2008/2009.</P>

	<P>I have been informed that no general research has been carried out over the past ten years by either the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners regarding the extent and breakdown of wealth as opposed to income.  However, all of an individual&rsquo;s assets and liabilities are declared in a number of specific circumstances &mdash; for example:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />after the death of an individual, on an Inland Revenue Affidavit, which is a document that is required to be delivered to the Revenue Commissioners and certified by them in order to obtain a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration; or</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />if an individual is required to submit a Statement of Affairs regarding an investigation by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, an individual is asked to list chargeable assets acquired and disposed of during a year on their annual tax return.</P>
        <P>Asset values increase and decrease over time and in the context of recent economic circumstances, they may have declined considerably in many cases. Thus, if the value of an asset or of an individual&rsquo;s wealth is measured at a particular time there is no guarantee that the asset value or the individual&rsquo;s wealth will remain at that level or increase from that point.</P>
        <P>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company when they dispose of an asset (CGT) or acquire an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT).  The rate of both these taxes was increased from 20% to 22% in the last Budget and Finance Act.  All taxes and potential taxation measures are constantly reviewed in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill.</P>

	<P>The position is that public servants are in general liable to pay the pension-related deduction introduced in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.</P><Col N="1017"/>
        <P>University research staff are liable to pay the deduction because they meet the key qualifying conditions under the Act, which is to say that they are public servants and are members of a public service pension scheme.</P>
        <P>I am aware that some university research staff hold fixed-term or non-permanent posts, and may on that basis have concerns about their job security. Certain concerns in relation to the pay rates of such staff have also been articulated.  However none of these facts or concerns bear on the liability of the staff in question to pay the deduction.  In this regard it is worth noting that fixed-term and non-permanent workers across many areas of the public service are paying the deduction.</P>
        <P>In this general connection, the Government has moved to make fixed-term university researchers pensionable, and has thus significantly improved the attractiveness of a research career. It should also be noted that, even for relatively short periods in such posts, pensionable service is accrued.</P>
        <P>It may also be transferred in the future to any public service employment. If the service is not transferred, section 6 of the Act provides for a refund of the deduction in certain limited circumstances, essentially in those cases where, on leaving employment, the pension scheme member has not accrued sufficient service to build up a benefit in any public service pension scheme.</P>

However no such fund exists for life companies.  The compensation fund for non life insurance companies was set up under Section 2 of the Insurance Act 1964 (the Act). Section 3 of the Act provides that monies from the Insurance Compensation Fund can be used to pay, subject to certain conditions, monies to consumers in respect of parts of their claims and to support the administration of the insolvent insurance company on a going concern basis. </P>

	<P>In broad terms, there are three strands to the Government&rsquo;s approach to stimulating the economy.  Firstly, we are putting the public finances <Col N="1018"/>on a more sustainable path, in order to restore domestic and international confidence in Ireland, thereby promoting Ireland as a sound place in which to invest.  Secondly, the Government&rsquo;s package of measures for the Irish banking system, including significant steps to maintain the stability of the financial system and those taken under the recently announced recapitalisation initiative, will serve to stimulate credit supply and consequently economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Finally, we are implementing measures to restore competitiveness.  For instance, we are maintaining capital investment at relatively high levels of national income.  We have also introduced a pensions levy in the public sector which, in addition to helping re-balance the public finances, will have a positive impact on national competitiveness.</P>
        <P>More generally, the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal launched by the Taoiseach last December sets out our agenda over the next few years of how we will re-orientate and reprioritise the business of Government to achieve the goal of building a Smart Economy, which will help underpin our future.</P>

	<P>It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has issued a statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applicable to all mortgage lenders to assist consumers in arrears difficulties.  The Code requires that all genuine arrears cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her obligations. Where an arrears situation continues, the lender must examine each case on its individual merits and explore with the borrower various alternative repayment measures.  A lender may only apply to the courts to commence enforcement of legal action for repossession six months from the time arrears first arise; and must not seek repossession of the property until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment schedule with the borrower or his/her nominated representative.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s statutory Consumer Protection Code has applied to credit institutions since 1 July 2007 and was extended to other lenders on 1 June 2008, following the introduction of legislation which provided for the regulation of sub-prime lenders by the Financial Regulator.  The Consumer Protection Code contains &ldquo;Know the Consumer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Suitability&rdquo; requirements, which must be followed by both lenders and intermediaries at point of sale.  A mortgage lender will have to demonstrate that it has gathered sufficient information from the consumer to allow it to provide a recommendation to that consumer.  The mortgage recommended must be suitable to the consumer having regard to the facts disclosed by the consumer.  A written statement setting out the reasons why a mortgage product/selection of mortgage products offered to the consumer are suitable must be given to the consumer.  Mortgage intermediaries must submit to a mortgage lender a signed declaration that it has had sight of all original supporting documentation including banks statements, P60/certificate of earnings and other supporting documentation evidencing the consumer&rsquo;s identity and ability to repay.</P><Col N="1019"/>
        <P>As part of feedback issued by the Financial Regulator in 2007 to mortgage lenders following a survey of the mortgage sales process, the Financial Regulator indicated that factors such as, but not limited to those set out below should be considered when assessing suitability in relation to mortgage products:Purpose of borrowing, type and length of loan, attitude to fixed/variable interest, age of consumer, savings track record, LTV, employment, income, repayment capacity.</P>
        <P>If a consumer has a complaint about his/her mortgage a complaint must first be made directly to the lender.  If the consumer is dissatisfied with the outcome of his/her complaint he/she can then refer the matter for further investigation to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The two banks participating in the recapitalisation programme have each committed that they will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence  until after 12 months of arrears appearing, where the customer continues to operate reasonably and honestly with the bank. The recapitalised banks, have in addition, assured the Government that in the normal course of events they will make every effort to avoid repossessions.</P>

It requires regulated entities to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers and the integrity of the market.  The Code also requires each mortgage lender to inform consumers, in writing, of the status of their mortgage accounts as soon as possible after the lender becomes aware of the arrears. </P>

        <P>The Financial Regulator is currently carrying out a further examination of mortgage lenders to ensure that they are in compliance with the specific provisions of the Consumer Protection Code and the Consumer Credit Act. The examination will also review the application of the residential mortgage arrears and repossession procedures and practices in place in mortgage lenders, as advised to the Financial Regulator in 2008, to ensure that consumers are being treated fairly, and will seek an update on the implementation of the &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; outlined in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s letter of 16 December 2008.</P>

	<P>The primary objective of the Government is to secure and maintain the financial and economic position of the State. Significant steps have been taken to achieve that objective including the Bank Guarantee Scheme and the recapitalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s two main banks. An essential element of the recapitalisation scheme, which I expect to be implemented in the very near future, anticipates the banks involved increasing the level of credit available throughout the economy. As part of the recapitalisation measures, the recapitalised banks have committed to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator. An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly. Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis. I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has also worked closely with my Department to introduce two new codes. The code of conduct for business lending applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner. The second code covers mortgage arrears and is designed to ensure that mortgage lenders take action to assist householders who are in arrears and will apply to all mortgage lenders, including banks, building societies and retail credit firms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The economy&rsquo;s competitive position has deteriorated in recent times. This deterioration has been driven by wage increases in excess ofproductivity and a rate of inflation above our euro area peers. Notwithstanding the fact that for most of the last 12 months our rate of inflation has been lower than the euro area, our price levels are still some 20% above the euro area. Regaining our competitive position &mdash; which as a small open economy is critical to our economic success &mdash; will require each of us to play our part and work towards this end. </P>
        <P>For its part, the Government has, and will continue, to support competitiveness.  To this end, the Government is committed to maintaining a pro-enterprise environment, and has implemented policies aimed at improving competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market. For example, last October in Budget 2009, I re-affirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the 12&frac12; per cent rate of Corporation Tax. The subsequent Finance Act contained a number of very significant changes to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme aimed at encouraging further R&amp;D activity here. In addition, the Government is continuing to prioritise productivity-enhancing investment under the National Development Plan, subject to available resources. This applies to both infrastructural investment as well as investment in education and skills.</P>
        <P>The Government introduced the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, called &ldquo;Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy&rdquo;, in December 2008 which sets out a clear roadmap for Ireland&rsquo;s move back to economic growth and prosperity.  The Cabinet Committee for Economic Renewal is driving this strategy and we will continue to pursue policies that will build on our strengths, address our weaknesses and maximise economic activity and employment.</P>
        <P>In addition, the public service pension-related deduction recently instituted in the light of the pressures on the public finances should have a demonstration effect in the private sector which will have a beneficial knock-on effect for competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Government has announced plans for a Supplementary Budget on 7th April in order to ensure stability in the public finances. This will have a positive impact in terms of restoring confidence in the Irish economy and, in turn, boosting our attractiveness as a location for inward investment.  I would also point out that, by undertaking the necessary adjustments now, the Government will avoid having to take more injurious action in the future. In this way, Government action is supporting the long-term competitiveness of the economy.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that economic forecasting in my Department is as soundly based as it can possibly be.  The Deputy will note that even in normal <Col N="1022"/>circumstances short-term economic forecasting is not an exact science, given the many dynamic components which constitute an economy. We are not now in normal economic times and the frequency that all other forecasters, national and international, have revised their forecasts points to the unusually high degree of uncertainty that exists. </P>
        <P>Following the extraordinary financial market developments last September, the global economy has entered uncharted waters, and in this new environment virtually all economic forecasters &mdash; the world over &mdash; are finding it difficult to make accurate projections.</P>
        <P>Analysis published alongside the 2006 Budget showed that my Department&rsquo;s macro-economic forecasts over the period 1997-2004 were amongst the most accurate of those produced by the major domestic and international economic forecasters.  Since then, my Department has continued to perform well in terms of macro-economic projections.</P>
        <P>In early January when my Department published its forecast it was one of the most pessimistic forecasts available. Since then most other commentators have reduced their forecasts reflecting international economic data that have become available.</P>
        <P>The approach taken by my Department is to identify the most likely outcome and to outline the main risks &mdash; both upside and downside &mdash; to this. This is in line with other organisations that produce regular forecasts on the Irish economy.</P>

	<P>I met with representatives of the association referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question on 17 February last.  The specific issue they highlighted was in relation to the conclusions drawn in a recent Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which was conducted by my Department. This recommended that, when amending the Insurance Mediation Regulations (S.I. No. 13 of 2005), the existing regulatory regime should be maintained for accountants that perform insurance mediation business on an ancillary basis.  However, the RIA also made a number of recommendations which were aimed at making the existing Approved Professional Body (APB) regime more transparent. In particular, the RIA recommended that the current benchmark for determining ancillary business should be reviewed.</P>
        <P>The association referred to had argued strongly against the retention of the existing APB regime during the RIA process.  On the other hand, the accountancy representative bodies argued the contrary position equally strongly. In those circumstances, it was appropriate that particular emphasis should be given to the position of the Financial Regulator, in view of its roles in regard to the supervision of insurance intermediaries, as well as its statutory responsibility for consumer protection.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s assessment was that the current APB regime delivers effective regulation in a rigorous, independent and professional manner.  The Financial Regulator confirmed to the Department that there is no evidence that the APB supervisory regime is less effective than direct regulation by the Financial Regulator.  As far as the impact on consumers and the rights of citizens are concerned, the assessment of the Financial Regulator is that customers are best served by the retention of the present APB arrangement for insurance mediation.</P><Col N="1023"/>
        <P>At our meeting referred to earlier, the association disagreed with this conclusion and, consequently, I offered to ask the Financial Regulator to re-examine its assessment.  The Financial Regulator is at present analysing the counter arguments put forward by the association and I await the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s further assessment with interest.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a self-employed individual making provision for retirement will generally do so by way of contributing to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and/or Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs).  The pensions tax legislation already facilitates the inclusion of an ill health early retirement option in these pension products.  The relevant legislative provisions are sections 784(3) (b) and 787K(2)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Specifically, the legislation allows benefits to commence before age 60 where an individual becomes &ldquo;permanently incapable through infirmity of mind or body of carrying on his or her own occupation or any occupation of a similar nature for which he or she is trained or fitted&rdquo;.  In order to access benefits under these provisions the pension administrator must have received medical evidence that the individual satisfies the medical criteria.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware it is not the practice to respond to Parliamentary Questions on the possible inclusion or otherwise of specific matters directly in advance of a forthcoming budget.  However, The Government is conscious that in current market circumstances there is a need to bring greater certainty and transparency to the operations of systemically important financial institutions, in particular in relation to specific asset classes currently perceived as carrying a higher than average risk.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Government is examining proposals for the management and reduction of risks within financial institutions with respect to these specific exposures, having regard to international developments.  As part of this work I have asked Dr Peter Bacon and the National Treasury Management Agency to report to me on the matter.  I have seen the report prepared by Dr Bacon for the NTMA.  The report will inform the Government&rsquo;s ongoing considerations, along with ongoing work at EU and European Central Bank level.  I will be bringing forward proposals in this area as a matter of priority.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to reviving the economy consists of three broad strands &mdash; improving competitiveness, stimulating credit supply in our financial system and putting the public finances on a more sustainable basis.  Given <Col N="1024"/>the deterioration in the public finances in recent months, the focus of the 7 April Supplementary Budget will be on measures to put the public finances on a more sustainable path.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>More generally, the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal launched by the Taoiseach last December sets out our agenda over the next few years for how we will re-orientate and reprioritise the business of Government to achieve the goal of building a Smart Economy, which will help underpin our future.</P>

	<P>The Supplementary Budget is to be presented to the D&aacute;il on the 7th of April. The Government has already taken significant action to restore stability to the public finances and the supplementary Budget will continue this process.  In relation to the details of what will be presented in the Supplementary Budget, it is not the usual practice to speculate in advance on the content of any Budget and I do not propose to deviate from this practice now.  However, all options are on the table, including action on both current and capital expenditure, as well as revenue raising measures.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information available is in respect of income tax relief allowed for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) for the income tax year 2005. RACs and PRSAs are available to the self-employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes.</P>
        <P>The information is set out in the following tables, which provide the number of cases, amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for RACs and PRSAs for the various income ranges.  The information is based on income returns contained in Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 98.5 % of all returns expected.  A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the setting up of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and of registration boards for certain designated health and social care professionals; and the designated professions under section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 for which established boards have been set up in view of the fact that this Act was signed into law on 30 November 2005. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 <Col N="1027"/>health and social care professionals.  This new system of statutory registration will apply to the twelve professions regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed and is the first time that fitness to practise procedures will be put in place for these professionals on a statutory basis.  The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance to twelve health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include, on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system by regulation over time, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The first step in the implementation of the system was the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, launched in March 2007.  The Council has now recruited a Chief Executive Officer in May of last year and is currently putting in place a suitable organisational structure.  The Council has examined which professions from within the designated twelve are most suitable for early registration and has decided to appoint the first two of twelve statutory Registration Boards, provided for under the Act.  The Social Workers Registration Board and the Physiotherapists Registration Board are the first two registration boards prioritised for registration in 2009.  It is proposed that two additional registration boards will be established by the end of 2009 and a decision regarding the order of roll-out of these additional boards will be made by the Council in due course.</P>

	<P>The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  The Appeals Officers must investigate each appeal independently, these investigations can require additional reviews by the Health Service Executive and the Scheme Administrator and certain appeals present a high level of complexity.  In addition a high percentage of appellants have requested an Oral Hearing with an Appeals Officer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over ceased on 31st December 2008, and with effect from 1st January 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 or over is &euro;700 (gross) per week (&euro;36,500 per year) for a single person and &euro;1,400 (gross) per week (&euro;73,000 per year) for a couple.</P>
        <P>Any savings and similar investments up to &euro;36,000 (single)/&euro;72,000 (couple) will be disregarded when assessing means and only interest from savings or similar investments above these figures will be considered as income.  The relevant portion of savings and similar investments will be assessed on the income calculated at a notional interest rate (currently 5%), based on the prevailing interest rates at the time of application.  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE) Central Application Unit will review the notional rate on a quarterly basis.</P><Col N="1029"/>
        <P>Alternatively, where an applicant wishes to have the actual interest from savings/investments considered, then the HSE will apply this approach and use the most beneficial option in favour of the applicant, subject to submission of the appropriate certificates from the relevant institutions.  In the case of &ldquo;longer term&rdquo; investment accounts, where the interest is only applied at the end of a fixed period, if the applicant so wishes, the HSE will only take account of the interest earned on the date the investment matures.</P>

        <P>I am currently examining the Commissions findings and recommendations and I am consulting with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, on the report&rsquo;s findings in the context of consumer protection policy generally.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 244 of Thursday 15 May 2008 and the written Reply to that Question.  The person concerned arrived in the State on 3 December 2003 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 14 March 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Following consideration of his case, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 3 July 2006.  This Deportation Order was formally served on the person concerned by letter dated 11 August 2006. This communication also notified the person concerned of the requirement that he present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 29 August 2006 to make arrangements for his removal from the State.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, on 14 August 2006, the legal representative of the person concerned requested that the Deportation Order made in respect of the person concerned be revoked, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  Following consideration of this request, the Deportation Order was affirmed on 17 October 2006.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 14 November 2006 and was also notified of the requirement that he present himself at the Offices of the Garda National <Col N="1034"/>Immigration Bureau on 23 November 2006 in order to make arrangements for his removal from the State.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently submitted an application under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006) requesting that the Minister consider an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State from the person concerned.  Following consideration of this application, the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18 March 2008, that the Minister had decided to exercise his discretion to allow the person concerned to make an application for Subsidiary Protection.  This application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>Pending the determination of the Subsidiary Protection application, the Deputy can be assured that the Deportation Order will not be enforced.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 5 June 2001 in the company of her guardian and was initially included as part of her guardian&rsquo;s asylum application which was lodged on 6 June 2001.  This asylum application was the subject of a formal refusal decision on 22 May 2003.  Subsequently, on 11 December 2003, the Minister signed Deportation Orders in respect of the guardian and the person concerned.  The person concerned became &lsquo;of age&rsquo; during the course of the asylum process.</P>
        <P>Judicial Review Proceedings were initiated in the High Court on behalf of the person concerned in early 2004.  These Proceedings were subsequently &lsquo;settled&rsquo; with the consequence that the Deportation Order made in respect of the person concerned was revoked and she was enabled to make a separate asylum application in her own right which she duly did, on 19 February 2008.  The person concerned gave birth to a child in the State in 2005 and this child was included on her asylum application.  The asylum application was refused following consideration of the case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 29 July 2008, that the Minister proposed to <Col N="1037"/>make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 31 May 2004.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 May 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Representations were received on his behalf.  Following consideration of his case, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 4 May 2006.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 19 May 2006 requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on a specified date in order to make arrangements for his deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>The person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court with the consequence that the Deportation Order was revoked on 17 July 2007 and the person concerned was invited to submit fresh representations as to why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned and, following consideration of these representations, the Minister signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned on 29 August 2007.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 18 October 2007 requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on a specified date in order to make arrangements for his deportation from the State.  This Order was subsequently revoked following the submission of further representations on behalf of the person concerned, through his legal representative.  These representations will now be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the immigration Division of my Department that the person in question made a Family Reunification application on behalf of his wife and son in January 2005.  The application was forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.  This investigation was completed and the Commissioner forwarded a report to my Department.</P>
        <P>A decision on the application was made on the 1 October 2007 refusing the request and a letter outlining the reasons for the refusal issued on the same date to the applicant.  A copy of this letter was subsequently issued to the applicant&rsquo;s solicitor on the 21 July 2008.  There is no provision under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 to appeal the decision of an application for Family Reunification.  Each application is processed on its own merits and the decision reached is based on the information submitted.</P>
        <P>If the person in question has significant new information it is open to them to submit a new application for Family Reunification to my Department.</P>

	<P>The allocation of judicial resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the Presidents of the Courts.  I am guided by the Presidents as to the need for additional judges, subject to Exchequer constraints.  It should be noted, however, that judicial numbers have been significantly increased in recent years.   Fourteen additional judges were appointed under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act 2007: six to the District Court, four to the Circuit Court and six to the High Court.  Furthermore, three additional District Court judges have recently been appointed following the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008.  These additional judges constitute a significant increase in judicial resources and should positively impact on delays throughout the courts system.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 the judges allocated to the court jurisdictions have increased as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">There are a number of reasons why groups do not draw down the funding they have been granted.  For example, some groups may decide that the project is no longer necessary, viable or a priority for them.  Others experience capacity issues in relation to their ability to implement the project.  Issues also arise in relation to compliance with public procurement rules, planning permission and access to additional funding to complete the project or to meet other undertakings.  All projects are kept under review and where appropriate, offered support.  Where it is agreed that a project will not proceed or draw down the full amount of funds approved, procedures, including consultation with the project promoters, are in place to decomit the funding approved.</P>
        <P>With respect to 2009, I have no proposals to make any further allocations to specific measures until information is available on the value of funds liable to transfer from financial institutions later this year.  Details of the individual grants and organisations that have been approved for support from the Fund are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.pobail.ie.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to questions number 43 on 4th March and questions numbered 304, 305 and 306 on 10th March 2009 concerning the suspension of this Programme.  </P>
        <P>To date, nearly 500 applications have been received.  Of these, around 250 have been either recommended for funding or found to be ineligible or incomplete.  Six applications were withdrawn.  The remaining projects are currently at different stages of the appraisal process.  Going <Col N="1043"/>on experience thus far, I would expect that about three-quarters of these outstanding applications would be recommended for funding.</P>
        <P>However, as I have previously outlined, it will not be possible to fund all successful applications given the current economic circumstances and the need to prioritise funding for other areas of activity. Of the &euro;9 million provided for the programme 2008, some &euro;4.2 million was drawn down by projects and to meet the costs of administration. Outstanding commitments to projects at year-end amounted to nearly &euro;2.5 million. The Deputy will appreciate that organisations draw funding over a period of months depending on progress on the delivery of a particular project.  Any funds not drawn down are used to meet the cost of other organisations awarded allocations under the Programmes.</P>

	<P>The person concerned made a claim for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance at Finglas local office on 10 December 2008.  His application was forwarded to a social welfare inspector on 17 December 2008 so that an assessment of his means could be conducted.  The claim papers are with the inspector.  All the required documentation has been received from the person concerned.  The present position is that the assessment of means will be completed by the middle of the week.  The claim will then be submitted to a deciding officer for decision before the end of the week and the person will be advised of the outcome.  The reason for the delay in conducting the means assessment is that the Live Register has increased significantly in recent months in the Finglas office.  The absence of an inspector due to illness also contributed to the delay.  All efforts are being made to ensure cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  If a person feels that he or she has insufficient means to meet his or her needs, it is open to him or her to apply for supplementary welfare allowance.  This allowance is administered by the Health Services Executive through the community welfare officers at local health centres.</P>

	<P>The Department supports the Government&rsquo;s policy of aiming to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world-class payments environment in Ireland.  Our payment strategy is designed to ensure that cost-effective arrangements are in place for making payments to social welfare customers by using a range of payment options and to ensure that new payment facilities are made available to customers as they arise.  The Department is implementing a three-year strategy to change paper-based payment instruments to electronic payments at post offices, banks and other financial institutions, including certain credit unions that have financial regulatory approval.  Some 84% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their post office or financial institution.  The remaining personalised payable order books will be changed to electronic payment by the end of September 2009.  Plans are under way to change cheque payments to electronic payment at a post office or a financial institution over the next 12 months.  Of the 1 million payments issued each week, a small number is made by manual cheque.  A facility to make such payments by an electronic system is being investigated.</P>

	<P>A range of education and employment supports are available to people who are in receipt of welfare payments.  These initiatives, including the back to work allowance and the back to education allowance, are designed to assist and facilitate people on such payments to return to the active labour force.  The back to work allowance scheme is designed to assist and encourage the long-term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force.  The scheme&rsquo;s two strands are the back to work enterprise allowance for the self-employed and the back to work allowance for employees.  The allowances provide a monetary incentive for long-term social welfare dependants and make their return to work financially attractive and viable.  This scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period of time has always been a feature of it.  While those who have been unemployed for a short time are not the main focus of the scheme, its qualifying conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the changing economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>The national employment action plan, which has been in operation since 1998, is the main welfare-to-work measure of the Government.  It has proven successful in helping people on the live register to get back into employment.  It is a preventive strategy that provides for systematic engagement of the employment services with the unemployed.  The operation of the action plan involves the referral to F&Aacute;S of people on the Live Register who have been unemployed for a certain period.  Everyone who is approaching three months on the Live Register is referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to job placement or an offer of training.  F&Aacute;S employment services, together with local employment services, have put in place measures designed to provide increased capacity for the increase in referrals and the increased number of unemployed people who are seeking job search assistance voluntarily.  The implementation of these measures has increased the monthly capacity of job search services from 6,500 to 12,250 persons <Col N="1045"/>per month.  Arrangements also exist whereby people who are employed for up to three days in a week may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in respect of the remainder of the week, subject to being available for full-time work.  It may be noted that if there is an employment relationship between a worker and an employer, that relationship may dictate that the full range of rights and protections afforded to employees, including minimum wage, will apply.  The Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and F&Aacute;S to improve the services available for progressing people who depend on social welfare progress to education, training and employment.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, is the main Government-funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday, at lo-call number 1890 283 438.  Budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie</i>.  In 2009, almost &euro;18 million has been provided to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.  Six additional full-time and part-time staff have been allocated to the local services.  The capacity of the telephone helpline has been strengthened.  MABSndl, which is the national support company, has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to assist the local services in managing their increased caseloads.  Some 252 money advice staff are employed throughout the country in the MABS.  Dublin north-east MABS has four money advice staff at present.  Applications for funding for additional staff are being kept under review should further funding become available for additional posts.  There are no plans to transfer civil servants to the MABS at this time.</P>
        <P>All MABS companies, including Dublin north-east MABS, operate an appointment system for meeting clients.  Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the telephone helpline and to the MABS website.  Over 90% of callers to the helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor.  Some 10% of callers are referred to the local MABS for appointment.  In addition, the helpline is assisting local services, including Dublin north-east MABS, to manage their appointment lists by providing an initial preliminary MABS service to clients and ongoing support while they await their appointment with their local money advisor.  The MABS advises that people coping with debt difficulties should take early action.  An approach to the MABS can be the first positive step in addressing debt difficulties.  The MABS provides a high quality personal service to members of the public that helps many to cope with and overcome the burden of indebtedness that can have such an impact on their lives and those of their families.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The HSE has advised that the people concerned are living in local authority housing and therefore have no entitlement to rent supplement.  They should contact the local authority with regard to any concerns they have about their rent payment.</P>

	<P>Workers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts as either employed or self-employed contributors. All workers, both employed and self-employed, are obliged to pay PRSI contributions as a percentage of their personal reckonable income. </P>
        <P>The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work.  This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable.  Self-employed people aged between 16 and 66 years are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.  These contributions provide entitlement to a range of contingency-based payments under various social insurance schemes.</P>
        <P>PRSI Class S contributors are entitled to the following payments:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Widow&rsquo;s or Widower&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (Contributory);</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Bereavement Grant.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s payments. Neither are they covered for Injury Benefit which is one of the benefits available under the Occupational Injuries Scheme. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to benefit payments, and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.</P>
        <P>A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>There are no immediate plans to expand coverage for Class S contributors. However, they may qualify for the means tested Disability Allowance if the illness/injury is expected to last for at least one year.</P>

	<P>Defined benefit (DB) pension schemes are required to comply with the funding standard provision set out in the Pensions Act.  This funding standard requires defined benefit pension schemes to maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities. Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years. </P><Col N="1048"/>
        <P>The Government is conscious of the pressures on employers sponsoring pension schemes, and scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds over the last year.  While 81% of DB pension schemes satisfied the funding standard at the end of 2007, it is estimated that in excess of 90% of DB pension schemes are in deficit at the moment.</P>
        <P>As the deputy is aware, in recognition of the current market difficulties and the challenges facing pension trustees, the Government recently announced a number of short-term measures aimed at easing the pressures on many DB schemes.  I believe that these measures will assist schemes currently in difficulty and will help to ensure the best outcomes for the scheme members.</P>
        <P>However, it must be acknowledged that in the current economic climate, a certain number of companies will cease trading and this may have an impact on their  pension schemes.  In the case of the company referred to by the Deputy, it is understood that the employees&rsquo; DB pension scheme is currently in deficit.</P>
        <P>Employers who provide DB pension schemes have no legal obligation to make up any shortfalls that arise in their funds.  However, many employers have been willing to contribute towards such shortfalls.</P>
        <P>It is Government policy to support the continuation of DB schemes where possible.  The recent measures announced by the Government will ease the pressure on underfunded schemes by allowing more time to recover recent losses.</P>
        <P>My Department, together with the Pensions Board, will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the underfunding of DB schemes.  In addition, the Government is currently considering a number of options in relation to the ongoing security of occupational pensions.  Any decisions in this regard will be made in the context of the National Pensions Framework which will be finalised shortly.</P>

        <P>Clients mostly lived in rented accommodation, with 24% living in private rented accommodation and 21% in rented local authority accommodation.  People with mortgages made up 34% of clients and 7% lived with parents.</P><Col N="1049"/>
        <P>The total owed by new clients in February 2009 to creditors, based on the debt they had when they first came to the MABS, amounted to &euro;46.2 million, which works out at an average amount of &euro;13,700 debt per client.  Of the total amount of debt 65% was owed to banks/financial institutions, 15% was owed to credit unions, 2% was owed in respect of utilities bills and 2% was owed to moneylenders.</P>

	<P>The enterprise stream of the back to work allowance (BTWA) scheme is designed to assist people, who are long term dependant on social welfare payments, to take up self-employment.  Participants receive a tapered percentage of their social welfare payment over a four year period for those who become self employed and they may also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.   </P>
        <P>To qualify for the back to work enterprise allowance scheme, the person must receive approval from a partnership company or one of this Department&rsquo;s local facilitators before taking up self-employment.  The person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specified length of time immediately prior to commencing the self-employment.  For a person on a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment the qualifying period is 24 months.  The person referred to by the Deputy has been in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit since September 2008 and, consequently, does not satisfy the eligibility criteria of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The conditions of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstances.</P>

        <Quest> the steps he has taken to opt out of Article 9(1) of the Water Framework Directive that requires the recovery of water charges by Member States starting from 2010, that this will include Ireland having to charge domestic charges, unless Ireland makes a case in writing for opting out of charging for domestic water charges to the European Commission by December 2009; if he will ensure that Ireland formally requests that it opt out in time by December 2009, particularly in view of the fact that he sought a clause providing that member states could opt out from charging for domestic water when the Water Framework Directive was being negotiated by member states; if he will explain what is meant by the statement by the Government to the Commission that he is merely reflecting on the implementation of Article 9; if this statement means he intends that Ireland will introduce water charges from 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Water Framework Directive was adopted on 23 October 2000. Article 9(1) of the Directive requires Member States to take account of the principle of the recovery of the cost of water services, including environmental and resource costs.  However, Article 9(4) of the same Directive stipulates that a Member State will not be in breach of the Directive if it decides, in accordance with established practices, not to apply these provisions where it does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the Directive&rsquo;s objectives.  </P>
        <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions Act) 1997 removed the authority of water services authorities to levy charges for water services on domestic users.  The Water Pricing Policy, subsequently agreed by the Government in November 1998, requires local authorities to recover the full cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes.  There is no requirement, therefore, for the Government to take steps to opt out of Article 9(1) given that the established practice at the time of the adoption of the Directive was not to levy charges on domestic users.</P>
        <P>Under the Directive, the island of Ireland is divided into eight River Basin Management Districts.  Management Plans for these districts must be published no later than 22 December 2009 and submitted to the European Commission within three months of publication.  The Management Plans must include details of cost recovery, in accordance with Article 9.  Draft River Basin Management Plans for the eight River Basin Districts in Ireland were published in December 2008 by the respective management authorities.  	</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Water Pricing Policy requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from non-domestic users of these services.  The Policy exempts domestic users from charges for water services.  As such, landowners are only levied with charges if they are engaged in commercial activity on their property, for example, farming.  The policy makes no distinction between different categories of non-domestic users in the application of charges.  However, where a supply serves both the domestic and business needs of a consumer, a domestic allowance is applied by the local authority.  </P>
        <P>To encourage water conservation, Section 54 of the Water Services Act 2007 includes a general duty of care for owners and occupiers to keep water distribution systems leak-free &mdash; this duty applies to both domestic and non domestic consumers.</P>

        <Quest> if his Department will review the boundaries of the bog land included in special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas as a measure to alleviate the distress caused to private individuals who have for generations cut small amounts of turf for their own use on the margins of these areas; and if his Department will engage in meaningful discussions with those peoples representatives particularly in view of the crisis in price and supply of other fuels. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Bogs are important natural habitats and are home to unique ecosystems containing rare flora and fauna. Both blanket bogs and raised bogs are protected habitats under European and Irish Law and representative samples have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the Habitats Directive or Natural Heritage Areas (NHA) under the Wildlife Acts. Ireland has some of the most ecologically important bogs in the European Union. In 1999, when the first of these sites was designated for nature protection, all commercial cutting on these bogs was stopped and the then Minister granted a ten year grace period for those who were cutting turf for their personal domestic use to find alternative sources of fuel.</P>
        <P>Blanket bogs, which occur predominantly on the Western seaboard but also in Wicklow and the midlands, can tolerate a certain amount of turf extraction without compromising their value as habitats. It is envisaged that cutting on Blanket Bog SACs and NHAs can continue, except in very sensitive areas, under the current restrictions, which prohibit commercial extraction and the use of &ldquo;sausage&rdquo; machines. Raised bogs occur predominantly in the midlands. There are over 1,500 raised bogs in the State and only 139 of these are designated for nature protection as SACs or NHAs. The continued cutting of turf, by hand or machine, and associated drainage on these designated raised bogs is incompatible with their preservation. Even with the restrictions in cutting that were introduced in 1999, over one third of the best bog habitat on these sites has been lost in ten years. It is clear that more needs to be done if we are to meet our obligation to protect this important habitat.</P>
        <P>The Habitats Directive imposes a legal obligation on the State to take measures to ensure the protection of this essential and irreplaceable part of our natural heritage. Therefore, in the light of the scientific evidence of continuing damage to these valuable habitats, it would not be appropriate to review the boundaries in these areas as suggested in the question.  Rather, it is <Col N="1053"/>necessary to put arrangements in place to provide for more effective protection of these habitats, which will necessitate the transition to a cessation of turf cutting on the small number of raised bogs which are designated.  My Department will establish an interdepartmental working group to consider how best to achieve this and to assess the resources that will be required. This group will consult with interested parties and representative groups, and report back to me later this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall area of land designated for nature conservation purposes constitutes 14% of the terrestrial area of the State. The location and amount of land designated follows on from the application of scientific site selection criteria that have been determined to meet the requirements of the European Union Birds and Habitats Directives for sites of European importance i.e. Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation respectively. Similarly, scientific criteria were applied to the selection of sites of national importance as Natural Heritage Areas. I am not aware of any basis for the 1% figure referred to in the Question.</P>

	<P>The school&rsquo;s application for Major Capital Grant Aid has been assessed in accordance with the prioritisation criteria, and has been assigned a Band rating of 2.1.  The Department approved funding for the purchase of an 80 sq m classroom for the school on its existing site in 2007. Emergency funding was granted to the school in December 2008 for ceiling repairs.</P>
        <P>The Department is aware of the accommodation needs of this school and, on foot of a technical inspection some time ago, is satisfied that the proposed 2 acre site is suitable for a new school building.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>
        <P>However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  In that context, it is a matter for the school authority as to whether or not they acquire the 2 acre site from Fingal County Council at this time.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. </P>
        <P>Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. A pupil&rsquo;s level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school. This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.</P>
        <P>The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support and conveys decisions directly to schools without recourse to my Department.</P>
        <P>I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</P>

	<P>A Notification of Intention to apply for recognition of a new primary school in the Tallaght/Firhouse area has been received from the Patron Body for Educate Together.  </P>
        <P>I have recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation. It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be completed and revised arrangements will be in place within a two year time frame.</P>
        <P>In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupils numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools. This means that new schools will not be established for reasons <Col N="1057"/>unrelated to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.</P>
        <P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards and Dublin 24 will be included in this process.</P>
        <P>Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</P>

	<P>I met with representatives of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland on 10 March. This was a historic meeting and was the first time that members of the Orange Order had sent a delegation to discuss an educational issue within this state. </P>
        <P>I briefed the representatives on funding arrangements for Protestant schools and the background to the decision in the October budget to remove ancillary grants from fee-paying Protestant schools.</P>
        <P>I outlined the background to the block grant, which is expected to be &euro;6.5 million in this school year. It covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned. Applications for assistance are made by parents to the Secondary Education Committee which, on the basis of a means test, distributes  the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice. I confirmed that there were no changes to this grant and that I would be willing to consider increasing it when the public finances permit.</P>
        <P>We discussed also the meeting I had with representatives of the Church of Ireland Board of Education, led by Archbishop John Neill, on 13 November last, at which I expressed my willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to my Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals  and sustaining the dispersed schools that they wish to attend. The Bishops are to respond on how the funding I am continuing to make available might best be deployed to meet the needs of their schools. I can advise the Deputy that I recently received correspondence from the Secondary Education Committee who have sought a meeting with my officials to progress the matter.</P>
        <P>I emphasised to the representatives of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland that I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos. The meeting was constructive and I expressed my willingness to schedule further meetings if it would be considered helpful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost of school transport, a service delivered by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department, have been increasing arising from a range of issues such as: ensuring a comfortable and safe transport service for over 135,000 children daily travelling to and from school (breakdown by county not readily available), measures to ensure the highest standards including the phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both primary and post-primary services, providing all children with an adult seat each;  the addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity shortfalls arising from the decision to provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all dedicated school buses with safety belts;  increased demands to meet the needs of special needs children; parental choice.</P>
        <P>In order to minimise the overall impact of these charges on families, the increases will apply to the 55,000 eligible post primary pupils and children availing of concessionary transport.   Primary school transport remains free of charge for over 54,500 children.  Parents will be offered the option to spread the amount due over two payments payable in July and December.  A maximum family payment of &euro;650 will apply.  Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card.</P>
        <P>The overall spend on school transport in 2009 is now estimated to be &euro;194m &mdash; a reduction of &euro;2m in the revised allocations as a result of efficiencies.</P>
        <P>Taking into all the factors outlined, it is not envisaged that there will be a reduction in the annual charge system, the estimated expenditure or the level of charges.</P>
        <P>My Department has also commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme which is to be completed before the end of the year.</P>
