      <P>I desire to call attention to the situation in Wexford. I think the position is very well known to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. W.T. COSGRAVE (MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a memorial from the Wexford Corporation, under the seal of that body, signed by the Mayor and Town Clerk. The industrial situation there is very serious.  The facts are that large stocks of manufactured goods have accumulated, for which there is little prospect of immediate sale.  It would appear that the ordinary business slump has been accentuated by the fact that, owing to the assaults on property throughout the country, there has been a corresponding limitation of business and a tightening of the purse strings by practically every company that can avoid development of business.  A proposition has come from Wexford, that the extension of the waterworks might be undertaken at an estimated cost of about £10,000.  And this is at present under consideration, with a number of other requests of a similar nature from practically the entire country.  I have intimated to the President that I will put a proposition before him shortly for expenditure of a huge sum of money to enable employment to be given in constructive work throughout various parts of the country, where unemployment is very acute.  It is hoped to be able to guarantee the contribution or loan being raised by the local authority in question and to distribute the burden as fairly as is possible under the circumstances.  This memorial is at present under consideration with others. And, as I have said, I hope to be able to put a scheme before the President in this and other matters very shortly.</P>
      <P>The following is the memorial in question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>To the Ministry of Local Government of the Provisional Government of Ireland.</i>&mdash;The Memorial of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of Wexford.</P>
      <P>Respectfully sheweth:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Memorialists act as a Corporate Body under the powers of a Charter of Incorporation obtained from the Crown under date of 27th July, 1846, this being the last of several such Instruments obtained from the date of the first one in A.D. 1318.  That Wexford had, 1911, a population of 11,531, an increase of 363 in ten years, and there is substantial reason for the belief that a present-day census would show the population to be well over 12,000.  That as an industrial centre the town is remarkable for the production of agricultural implements, containing as it does three foundries for the manufacture of these articles.  That at the present time, these Works have had to be <Col N="293" /> closed down, owing to the fact that they are over-stocked, with the result that there are 1,750 workmen thrown idle, and have been for several months past, of these 960 are receiving Unemployment Benefit from the Labour Exchange, 500 have no further claim on the Exchange, and in addition to these there are 300 non-insurable cases of unemployment of workmen throughout the town.</P>
    <P>That relief of privation in the form of employment is a pressing necessity.  That Memorialists are seriously troubled in mind at the prospect before the town, as they have no means at their command to provide employment unless a sympathetic and paternal Government will come to their assistance. That reckoning on such assistance being forthcoming, Memorialists have engaged the services of a firm of Civil Engineers to make a report on the most efficient and economical means of increasing the water supply to the town, a very urgent and much-felt want, and these experts recommend that the storage capacity of the Reservoir should be increased from 22 million to 40 million gallons, that the cheapest way of doing this is by way of raising the height of the dam by somewhat over five feet, and thickening the embankment sufficiently to resist the consequential increase of pressure; that the cost of executing the requisite engineering works would be, approximately £8,500, and that it would be necessary also to purchase out two acres of land to be let in with the Reservoir.  That Memorialists, in the exceptional circumstances of the case, hereby approach with confidence the Ministry for Local Government for a Grant of £10,000 for the relief of the unemployed, and submit that the money, by being applied to the purpose of affording a plentiful water supply, is certain to confer a lasting and never-to-be-forgotten favour on the town.  And your Memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray.  The Corporate Seal of the Borough of Wexford affixed hereto, by direction of the Municipal Council this 21st day of April, 1922.&mdash;(Signed) R. Corish, Mayor of Wexford.  W.A. Brownie, Town Clerk.</P>

      <P>Well, A Chinn Comhairle, I do not think that ever an Executive were so convicted out of their own mouths as the Executive of Dáil Éireann were convicted by the reports that have been read.  The present position is due absolutely to the policy which the Executive, by a very small majority, has got the Dáil to accept-Anybody who understood at all the feelings of the people of this country might have known that an agreement such as that which was proposed could not be accepted by the people of this country with the feeling that it was going to bring peace or stable conditions to the country.  At the time, I pointed that out clearly.  Now, we have those reports there, throwing upon us the blame for conditions which have been brought about indirectly by their policy and directly by the methods by which they are trying to put that policy into effect. The President, in his statement, made here says:&mdash;&ldquo;Dáil Éireann has been obstructed and flouted by a section of the Opposition.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I say that Dáil Éireann has been obstructed and flouted by the Ministers.  At the last Session of Dáil Éireann, when, in order to maintain the authority of Dáil Éireann, I said that unless Ministers acting in any executive capacity here in Ireland accepted definitely that they would be responsible to this House, I for one, would not sit here.  The President took the attitude of accepting responsibility on their behalf.  But immediately that was accepted by the President, the Minister of Finance, said when asked a question &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;  This is the Official Report I am quoting from.  Mr. Griffith said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I asked that the Official Report be furnished us here.  I have at present a report.  I understood I was reading from the Official Report. But here it is as it is in the paper, and we can have it corrected to-morrow if there is anything the matter with it.  In this report we have:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Griffith: What I said on the night I was elected President of this body remains&mdash;that I would maintain it until the election was called.  There is no question whatever about that but if this body is going to be made the means of harrying those in the Provisional Government with little questions and little obstructions, I protest against this body being used for that purpose.  Every Minister here is a Minister for Dáil Éireann.  As a Minister for Dáil Éireann he is going to see that the Provisional Government works in harmony with Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. De Valera: Hear, hear.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly: And responsible to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Collins: Certainly not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Kelly protested against that answer but that answer was only in line with the answer we had received from the Minister of&mdash;I will have to specify him by name because I don't know in what capacity he is acting, the so-called Provisional Government or Dáil Éireann, Mr. Kevin O'Higgins.  He also took up that attitude, and so did Deputy Hogan.  Now these answers in that position were a definite repudiation of the authority of Dáil Éireann.  They were a definite repudiation of the sovereign authority of this Assembly. That attitude was not taken up until recently.  It is that attitude that has been responsible for the whole condition of the country from the start.  I tried, as one member here, to maintain the authority of this Assembly over the whole question of administration, legislation and all the rest in the country. I maintain, therefore, that the primary flouting of the authority of Dáil Éireann, and the obstruction of Dáil Éireann, has been by the members of the present Executive of Dáil Éireann.  It is said that efforts have been made to seduce the Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am going to make my own speech.  It is said here that British troops are evacuating our country.  Are they giving up the principal ports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="MR. DE VALERA MR. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make my speech.  Are they evacuating the six counties&mdash;North-East Ulster?  British troops are not, in the proper sense, evacuating the country; and by this Treaty you give them the right for ever to remain or come back if there is a question of war between England and a foreign State.  It is said here, that the position in North-East Ulster has been aggravated by the action of the Opposition. I say it has been aggravated because of the Boundary Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obviously the policy of that minority of Ireland, who are a majority in that area, or part of that area, to maintain those six counties by military force despite any decision that the Boundary Commission may arrive at.  They <Col N="295" /> are entrenching themselves in that policy. And the policy of the Ministry has been to perpetuate the cutting-off of these six counties&mdash;to make that perpetual. We were told here yesterday that &ldquo;the Provisional Government came into existence as a consequence of the approval of the Treaty.&rdquo;  The Provisional Government, as a Government, could not come into existence.  It was not in the power of this assembly to ratify that Treaty, notwithstanding the words used by the President of this assembly, referring to the approval of this agreement as ratification.  This Treaty is not ratified. It is not in the power of this assembly to ratify it, and therefore the Provisional Government, as a Government, could not come into existence as such.  This assembly had no power to give away the Government of the country to any hands but its own.  I refer to this assembly and not merely the Cabinet.  For, again, it is not the procedure here at all to regard the Cabinet as the Government of the country.  Every member here, whether on the Cabinet side or on the minority side, is a member of the Government of Ireland, and it is not in the power of any section to give away the rights of the minority, to give away the sovereign rights to any other body.  Everything in these Articles of Agreement that would be consistent with the maintenance of the sovereign authority of this assembly could be done.  But anything that would be inconsistent with that could not be done and is illegal.  And every time the Provisional Government acts as a Government it is a usurpation.</P>
    <P>I see here that they are to uphold and assert the right to a free expression of opinion and freedom of election.  We have been fighting all the time for a free election, for free self-determination for the Irish people.  But this is not a free choice.  Read up the speeches that were made by members on the majority side. See in how many of these is the question of a threat of immediate war brought in as a basis for their decision.  Therefore, it is not we who are interfering with the right of the Irish people to freedom of election, and freedom of the expression of their free will as to what form of Government they should have.  It is the British Government, by force, that is doing it.  And those who point to the action of their fellow countrymen, who are consistent now as in the past, and try to bring odium upon that action, try to turn their backs upon what deserves the term of odium&mdash;the British Government itself.  It is these who are preventing freedom of election in the proper sense.  Recently, the Labour Party issued a Manifesto in which they reminded the members of this assembly of their duty as a Government.  There is a paragraph in that on which I cannot lay my hands now.  I have referred to it in several speeches, but this unprejudiced Press took good care that the principal things I wanted to say would not be reported.  I agree with that paragraph and practically with the whole of that Manifesto.  I agree particularly with the paragraph which points out that every member in this assembly is responsible for the Government of this country and every member has a duty now to perform to the Government of this country, and every member who does his duty can conform to that and see that there will be a Government which will insure stable conditions, which will end this present position of a divided Army.  That position has been brought about definitely by the action of the Executive.  Since the last night on which this agreement was accepted by the majority here, I pointed out that the one thing was to see and to keep the Army intact.  And, personally, as the outgoing President, I met the Divisional Officers of the Army, and I asked them to give to the new control the same loyalty that they had given to the old so long as the Army was preserved intact as the Army of the Republic.  The national safety demanded that.  But the Executive, anxious to present the country with another <i>fait accompli</i>, another Free State in existence, and all Free State Army in existence, and all the rest of it, quite forgot the fundamentals of this whole situation, the fundamentals which have for 750 years been the basis of this fight between Ireland and Great Britain: They proceeded at once&mdash;instead of looking ahead, seeing what the necessities of the present situation demanded&mdash;to build up this Free State Army, with the present result.  Remember how the Army had been formed: how they had come first of all as a Volunteer force, how it was under their own Executive they had first entered the fight, how, when asked to take the oath of allegiance to Dáil Éireann, they insisted that the members of Dáil Éireann themselves, take the same oath of fealty to the Republic.  If <Col N="296" /> you remember that up to even as late as last September that independent Executive governing body of the Volunteers was in existence, you will understand the question better.  All these realised that the time had come for them to see to it that they would not be seduced and that they would not have the Army of which they were part used for any purpose but for the purpose for which it was originally formed.  And it is that which brought about the present situation. I say then, regarding the proposals of the Labour Party, that we are the government of the country, that the members of Dáil Éireann should take over the government of the country and arrange, as we arranged before, for proper co-operation and proper working in harmony with the Army Executive. And it can be done.  We can do it and I hope that after the exhibition&mdash;I don't like to call it by a harder name than this&mdash;in the Dáil, the members of Dáil Éireann will take over the Government of this country, and not let it run into chaos.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="MR. MCENTEE MR. MCENTEE">
      <NameTxt>MR. MCENTEE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal principally with the statement of the President, that the position in North-East Ulster has been aggravated by the action of the Dáil, and the action of those who imposed the Belfast Boycott.  I am very sorry that the President of Dáil Éireann, in order to make a little Party capital, should be ready to try to trade on the miseries to which our fellow-Catholics and our fellow Republicans in North-East Ulster are subjected.  We cannot agree that the position in the North-East has been aggravated here in the Dáil, because the facts do not bear out that.  The facts flatly contradict the President's statement.  What are the facts?  Generally, they are these: that, in order to make effective the English policy of partition in this country, the Government of Sir James Craig, acting with the connivance and co-operation of the English Government, has carried on what is practically a campaign of extermination against the Nationalists in the six counties.  That campaign has been practically continuous now since July 1920, but at certain notable periods it has been intensified. For instance, immediately after the signing of the Treaty&mdash;when the Delegates of Dáil Éireann, who were returning to London on December 4th to break on this question of Partition, since the then Chairman of the Delegation flatly refused to break on the question of the Crown&mdash;there was for a moment, a lull in the murder campaign in Belfast.  All that full continued during the time of the Dáil debates on this Treaty.  But no sooner had the Chairman of the Delegation succeeded in getting the majority of the members of the Dáil to accept the principle of partition, than the murder campaign broke out.  And it broke out with intensified fury.  It continued from that until immediately before the Chairman of the Provisional Government met Sir James Craig in London.  Then for a day or two it ceased, while negotiations were going on.  And then no sooner had the Chairman of the Provisional Government signed that Pact with Sir James Craig, whereby it recognised the Ulster Government and recognised Partition as an accomplished fact in this country, then the persecution broke out again with intensified fury.  And it continued in that way until the English Government, taking advantage of the situation which was created in Belfast by the massacre of the McMahon family on Friday 24th March, called to London its servants, the Provisional Government. And with them went the President of this Dáil.  A further Pact was entered into.  This time the President of the Dáil went one step further.  Having accepted Partition himself, he now entered into a Pact whereby, under the plea that it was made in order to safeguard their interests, he could seduce the Republicans of North-East Ulster to partition from their anti-Partitionist view.  They were to get them to betray the integrity of their country by getting them to join the Ulster Constabulary. That is a very significant fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, when the war was raging here in this country, a member of this Dáil had urged that the people of Ireland, in order to protect themselves from the fury of the Black-and-Tans, should join the Black-and-Tans, what would have been his fate?  The President of Dáil Éireann who was first elected to Parliament in order to protect his country against partition, now tries to get the Nationalists of North-East Ulster to make partition an accomplished fact.  Again, the persecution, after this significant pact, breaks out in North-East Ulster.  With <Col N="297" /> what object?  I say, in pursuance of the policy which the Chairman of the Provisional Government has agreed upon.  Certain members of the English Parliament who could not come to this Dáil to take the oath of allegiance were prepared to go to England to take the oath of allegiance to the English King.  They were now about to conclude a further pact whereby members who were elected to the Ulster Parliament in May of last year are about to enter the Ulster House of Commons.  They have not done all that very willingly, and they have not done all that very wittingly, but they have been forced to do it as the inevitable consequence of the Treaty. And if the position in North-East Ulster is worse to-day than it was three months ago, it is not because of the opposition here in this Dáil, but it is because the members of the Provisional Government, and those who signed the Treaty, have been between the nutcrackers&mdash;between Craig in Belfast and Churchill and Lloyd George in London. Between both of them they are being forced now to make partition a reality in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to give a specific contradiction to the statement the President made.  He stated that the intensification and the aggravation of attack upon the Nationalists in North-East Ulster were due to the attitude of the Opposition in this Dáil.  What are the real facts of the situation?  On March 18th 1922, nine days before the Volunteer Convention was held, there were six Nationalists murdered in Belfast and sixteen wounded.  On March 23rd, four bombs were thrown and one Nationalist was shot.  On Friday, March 24th, the McMahon family were murdered in Belfast.  The Convention of the Volunteers was held on March 27th.  How, then, can the President of the Dáil substantiate his statement, that the position in Belfast has been aggravated by the Opposition in this Dáil, and particularly by the re-imposition of the Boycott? How could there be any aggravation of the case, so serious had it been already? Remember this, that though the Volunteer Convention declared the Boycott, it was not until some days later that any steps were taken to re-impose the Boycott.  Now we are told&mdash;at least it is insinuated&mdash;that the efforts of the President of the Dáil and the Chairman of the Provisional Government to save the Nationalists of the North, are being frustrated by the attitude of those who stand, as he did, for a united Ireland. We are told that all these Pacts that were made in order to save the Nationalists were rendered nugatory by our action.  What are the most significant facts in connection with that? The Pact was signed on the 30th March. On the following Sunday, before anything was done in regard to the Boycott, seven more murders took place in Belfast. We know how Sir James Craig has kept every Pact he has made with the Chairman of the Provisional Government, and with President of Dáil Éireann, since the first one.  I suppose the members of the Cabinet are considering now, since there is a lull in Belfast, that it is time to make another Pact, in order that the massacres may be again intensified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMacSwiney" hpid="MISS MACSWINEY MISS MACSWINEY">
      <NameTxt>MISS MACSWINEY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call attention to one statement of the President, that when he was elected President he undertook to keep the Departments functioning.  I remember, the day before the election, I myself asked him if he would undertake that no man who had sworn his oath to the Republic and was appointed Minister of Dáil Éireann would be appointed also to the body that was to subvert the Republic.  He would not give that promise.  At the time he was elected President of Dáil Éireann, he was obliged to declare that Dáil Éireann was the Government of the Irish Republic. He has not kept his promise to keep the Departments of Dáil Éireann functioning. He has declared that, only for the Opposition, the condition of the country would be peaceable.  No member of this Assembly who stands true to the Republic has done one single act or said one single word inconsistent with the Government of the Republic, and, because of acts and words from the other side, I maintain that the report of the President is not correct.  With regard to Belfast, I wish I had time to read for the House some of the statements made in 1914 and 1915 by President Griffith himself with regard to Mr. Redmond and his attitude towards Partition.  The position in Belfast is the direct result of the Treaty.  And the murder campaign there carried on is carried on by and with the direct consent of Lloyd George. It has happened according to plan, but a little too soon.  All the murders were to take place if the Treaty had been accepted after the Republic had been <Col N="298" /> turned down.  When the Boundary Commission was set up, the murder campaign was to break out in Belfast, and that would enable Lloyd George and Company to say to the world &ldquo;See what those Irishmen are doing; didn't I tell you it was a religious war?&rdquo;  All these things we have tried to fight.  And one of the things we have tried to fight is that cry preached, that the war in Ireland is a religious war between North and South.  It is not.  After all the efforts that we have been making to destroy that campaign, President Griffith and Mr. Collins go to London, meet Craig and Churchill and there they make an agreement by which half the Special Police would be Catholic, giving their official Irish sanction to the lie which we have tried so hard to fight, that this war in Ireland is a religious war.  They have played consistently into the hands of the English since they signed that disgraceful Pact in December, and nothing has proved that so much as the state of affairs in Belfast. For every evil that has happened, and will happen in the country, as a consequence of that Treaty, the blame must be laid by the Irish people&mdash;as it will be laid by the Almighty God Himself&mdash;on those who signed that Treaty.  I see President Griffith and the other side laughing.  I suppose it is part of the Anglicisation of the present Ministry to laugh at the name of Almighty God&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is the Treaty that has been the cause of the murder campaign in Belfast.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann the sovereign assembly representative of the people reassembles on Tuesday next.  The members of that assembly have a solemn responsible duty to perform.  To their charge has been committed the task of safeguarding the lives and liberties of the people, not to the Ministers not to the Army but to the rank and file of the members of the Dáil.  It is for them to assert the sovereignty of the Dáil over all other councils or Governments in Ireland.  It is for them to unite the army and bring it under a simple command which might defend the nation and its liberties against foreign intervention. The army was enrolled for this purpose and for this purpose <Col N="299" /> it should be maintained.  The country demands that the Dáil should assert its authority and accept the responsibility of governing or confess its impotence and make way for the people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I ask liberty to emphasise a point because I raised it and got a very specific answer when the same subject was under discussion at the last session of the Dáil.  This question of subordination of Dáil Éireann was under discussion and some Minister&mdash;I think it was Minister of Publicity on the other side&mdash;gave a dubious answer as to his responsibility to this Assembly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="MR. O'KELLY MR. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>MR. O'KELLY:</NameTxt>
      <P>And Mr. Griffith gave to that question the answer that he held that this was the sovereign authority in Ireland, the sole governing body in Ireland, and he reiterated that no other Government had a right to function, as against Dáil Éireann, as the Government in the country.  Now, I asked a question&mdash;were the Ministers to be responsible to Dáil Éireann?  The President did not give an answer, a definite, straight answer, to that.  The Minister of Finance did.  He answered &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;  And I called attention to his answer, and called attention to the fact that his answer differed so diametrically from the answer given by the President of the Dáil that one supposed Government of this country was speaking with two voices.  That point was emphasised later by the answer given to a similar question put to the Minister of Economics and I think to the Minister of Agriculture.  Both these gentlemen repudiated the sovereignty of this assembly and told us they would not be responsible to this sovereign body. I maintain that the trouble that has arisen since in this country is due primarily to the unsatisfactory answering and to the repudiation by the Minister of Finance of his President. He repudiated not alone the President but he repudiated the sovereignty of this assembly and, thereby, gave a lead to those in this country who wished to set up a usurpation&mdash;another Government to function in the place of Dáil Éireann in this country.  Now, what has happened?  The disorder that has since arisen, I maintain, is the result of that. I think now that disorder has had the effect of bringing them to see the error of their ways, to quote the phrase used by one of the other members with reference to Mr. de Valera on another memorable occasion.  If this report in the <i>Independent</i> of Tuesday 25th April is correct, the Minister of Finance&mdash;I am sorry to say he has not remained&mdash;now agrees that there is one sovereign assembly in Ireland and that that assembly is Dáil Éireann.  Well, that is something gained, if he will only act up to his words, and if those who repudiated Dáil Éireann a short time ago will be as wise as he is and act up to his words and act up to his policy which he there outlined for them.  He said one thing that is not correct.  He is reported as saying that the Provisional Government was set up by Dáil Éireann as an interim arrangement to give effect to the vote of Dáil Éireann in approval of the Treaty.  We all know that Dáil Éireann did not set up a Provisional Government. This is a point where he shows his good judgment and wisdom for he says &ldquo;the Provisional Government exists because...&rdquo;  That is not the point; the Provisional Government has no power as far as Ireland is concerned. He is reported as quoting Mr. de Valera, and in answer to that Mr. Collins says &ldquo;The Provisional Government exists because Dáil Éireann approved of the Treaty, and because of that only.  That is the authority of the Provisional Government and that only.&rdquo;  I want to know then if this statement of Mr. Collins&mdash;&ldquo;We know that the authority here in this country is Dáil Éireann and is not any other authority or Government&rdquo;&mdash;is to be accepted as the policy of the Executive?  If that is definitely and clearly understood, I believe that having that published, not alone in the words adopted but in the action taken <Col N="300" /> by this Executive to maintain that Government as the sovereign authority in this country, would go a long way to prevent the disorder of which the President complains&mdash;and rightly complains&mdash; in his report.  I personally do not stand for anything but freedom of speech (Hear!  hear!).  Now here or anywhere or at any time.  President Griffith laughs, but I defy him or anybody else to prove that I ever stood for anything else in any time during my career, which is longer than most members here.</P>

There is a constitutional method and if the Anti-Treaty Party remained true to that, we would have no trouble in Ireland to-day.

      <P>As to Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, I am in a position to bear out everything that he has said&mdash;that he has stood for free speech and free elections&mdash;but I regret that his new-found companions are not able to stand up here and say they agree with what he says.  I disagree with the Deputy when he states that the primary cause of the present conditions is the statement of the Minister of Finance. And I say that the Anti-Treaty Party&mdash; those people who got their positions from the people&mdash;are the cause of it.  I furthermore say that it is not this Dáil who are the government of this country. It is the people, and from the people you derive whatever authority you have got and not an inch more (applause).  I am very glad to see I have made so many converts.  I am very glad that I am able to bring to the true fold those erring brothers who have so long taken the wrong paths, and I am glad to see that they are now coming to realise&mdash;they will realise it sooner or later&mdash;that they will not and cannot flout the will of the people in this country without being made amenable to the people for it.  We were told that it is due to certain members of the Executive that this turmoil has occurred.  There is a perfectly natural, constitutional method of dealing with any members of the Executive who misconduct themselves.  And it is a matter for regret that there is so much ineptitude and so much inexperience on the part of the Anti-Treaty side that they are incapable of seeing it.  There is a method of moving a vote of want of confidence, so that any Minister they wish could be excluded from the ranks. I think that the ex-President is at least long enough in public life to understand that that procedure is better than turmoil and slaughter and fratricidal strife throughout the country.  Is it an excuse for the delinquencies of a member here, or a member of the Cabinet that people should be shot in the country?  Is that the argument they have got, and is that the excuse they have to give to the people of Ireland?  Never in the whole course of my public life have I heard such nonsense as I have heard here. One member stood up and said we didn't keep the various Departments of the Dáil functioning.  That was repeated by every member on the other side, but not a single one of them has mentioned a Department that is not functioning. The Department that I represent has shown a very much larger amount of work done for the last three months than <Col N="301" /> in all its previous existence.  And let those of you who oppose the Treaty remember that it would not be possible to do that if the enemy was here.  And well you all know it!  Is it with the authority of Dáil Éireann that one of your members stands up and proposes an illegal levy down in his county or that a member of this Dáil sees a man of proved pluck, the Secretary of a Co. Council, who braved the Black-and-Tans, faced with a revolver by a member of the I.R.A.?  Is that a constitutional Government, and is that to be stood over by the ex-President?  Is it according to the law of Dáil Éireann that such things as that are done?  I have never heard of its being condemned.  If we have a constitutional way of settling things, let us settle them.  If the ex-President thought he was doing right when he brought the Army under the Minister for Defence, what about the ex-President's somersault in sanctioning and condoning, or attempting to condone, the new disorder that has occurred?  One thing I have to tell these people&mdash;every one of them&mdash;is that they are bolstering up something that is fizzling out.  And well they know it.  What about the coup you were to bring off?  Have you got powers of limitation to impose upon the Press and the people of Ireland?  If you think this is the place to announce them you are here now in great numbers and you are called upon by the people to answer for the delinquencies you have committed.  I see some members of the opposition laughing; it is very amusing indeed.  Perhaps Ireland and the people of Ireland are a joke, according to the Anti-Treatyites.  Very well, the people will give them the answer when they come before them.</P>

There was direct repudiation and denial of the sovereignty of the Dáil then and that direct repudiation came from Mr. De Valera himself.  I will tell you what it was.  You all remember that we had debated this for days and days and that the Dáil had given its decision on the Treaty.  After it had given its decision, as it had a right to do, Deputy de Valera allowed his friends to put forward his name here for re-election as President. He admitted that, if he was re-elected, he proposed to form his Government from the minority of the House.</P>

      <P>Every cloud has a silver lining, and I am very glad to see a return to sanity.  I am very glad to see that here to-day Mr. de Valera told us that the Dáil was a sovereign assembly; it is only a step further to get to the sovereignty of the people.  It is wonderful when people are in power how they delegate authority to themselves and, when they are not in power, how they try to take that authority away.  When the Opposition were in control, they did away with the Executive in the Army and decided to take the Volunteers under control of the Dáil; not alone that but under the Dáil Cabinet's control.  To-day we are told that the Dáil itself is the Government of the country.  Of course it is, and of course it was.  But when the Opposition was in power it was the Cabinet.  They want it different to-day, because some people would rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.  The night before Mr. de Valera's famous letter was published, wherein he advised the people not to have the Treaty, I advised him, in the presence of Mr. Brugha and Mr. Stack, not to send that letter to the Press.  I said it was for the Dáil to decide that; that it was not the Dáil Cabinet sent them to London and I said that the Dáil Cabinet should not have asked them to report to the Dáil Cabinet at all but that they should have reported to the Dáil itself.  You all remember that the Debate here on the Treaty all turned on the one point&mdash;that the plenipotentiaries did not come back and report to the Dáil Cabinet.  Now we are told to-day that the Dáil is a sovereign assembly.  That is an admission, anyhow.  I would recommend the Deputies here to-day to admit that the people, the sovereign people, are the people that ought to decide this whole issue, and the sooner it is put to them the better.  While we are coming here and squabbling for power, people are being slaughtered all over the country. Let the people decide and decide quickly, and let all this squabbling end.  We are making a disgrace of ourselves.</P>

If the Provisional Government has acted against Dáil Éireann, it is quite legitimate for the Ministers responsible to be called to account.  As I said before, we are not going to allow this policy of obstruction to work on a perfectly false basis.  Mr. de Valera states that we, on this side, are responsible for the turmoil in Ireland.  The men responsible for the turmoil in Ireland are the men who, having been defeated in the Cabinet on the issue of the Treaty, and having been defeated in Dáil Éireann on the issue of Treaty, having stood up and said there was a constitutional way of settling our differences&mdash;after all that, went out and used the weapons of intimidation in an attempt to divert the Irish people from giving their verdict on that point.

      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT GRIFFITH:</NameTxt>
      <P>We were sent there to arrange how best the aspirations of Ireland could be reconciled with the community of nations known as the British Commonwealth; not an Irish Republic.  That is what we were sent there for.  Mr. de Valera has pretended to the Irish people that somehow he didn't know what was going on or what happened in London.  Every night from Hanns Place a special courier was sent to Mr. de Valera and everything that happened was conveyed to Mr. de Valera.  Now Mr. de Valera is suggesting to the Irish people that somehow he was kept in the dark.  I say at once, and now&mdash;because events may happen to us through Mr. de Valera's friends&mdash; that I brand that as a falsehood.  He knew everything that was going on. That is all I want to say on this subject. Those people have got up here and professed themselves die-hard Republicans. Why didn't he send Lloyd George in July 1921 a simple statement that we would negotiate on no other basis but the recognition of the Republic?  Why did he withdraw that basis and send us there?  We went there, and fought there, and we won there.  And when I was going to London Mr. de Valera said to me &ldquo;There may have to be scapegoats.&rdquo; There is a member here on the Opposition side who heard that remark. I said I was willing to be a scape-goat to save him from some of his present supporters' criticism; and Mr. Collins and myself were willing to be scapegoats so long as Mr. de Valera got what he wanted and so long as Mr. de Valera's face was saved.  That is the inner history of what happened.  And the reason I am referring to it is this because of something that has happened and is happening within the last two weeks. In the last two weeks an attempt was made on the life of my colleague Michael Collins.  (&ldquo;Shame&rdquo; and laughter from some Deputies).  Yes; there is laughter there; you are going to hear something more of it.  In this present week there is a paper <i>Poblacht na hÉireann</i>, edited by an Englishman who has spent his life in the Military Secret Service of England&mdash;I will give Childers' record if necessary.</P>

      <P>I will give you your record to-morrow, Childers. Now the editor of this paper is Erskine Childers, T.D.; assistant editor, Frank Gallagher; Manager, Joseph McDonagh. Some gentlemen laughed here when I referred to the attempted assassination of my colleague and friend&mdash;Michael Collins.  When recent incitements were made about &ldquo;wading through blood&rdquo; we were told they meant nothing.  We know what they mean, and we are not going to let gentlemen ride off on this thing when they inspire dupes and young and impetuous boys to do what they want done.  Now here is the article, &ldquo;The A.B.C. of It&rdquo; it is called:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When A and B were at war, and wanted peace, A entrusted C on its behalf to negotiate with B, and C's instructions were in writing as follows, so that there could not be any mistake in either memory or understanding:&mdash;&lsquo;The complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed will first be submitted for A's consent.&rsquo;  One day A was much surprised by C returning with the treaty complete and signed without having submitted it.  &lsquo;I assure you,&rsquo; said C, &lsquo;it is the best that could be got.&rsquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said A, feeling pleased, &lsquo;the best that could be got must be a good treaty.  Let me see it.&rsquo;  A had confidence in C. The first clause enacted that A must cease to exist, the agent having negotiated the extinction of his principle, with an option as to suicide quite in the classical manner. &lsquo;Is this the best you could get?&rsquo; asked A.  &lsquo;It is indeed&rsquo; replied C, and it wouldn't be so good but that I happened to catch B in one of his best moods.  I'd prefer that first clause a little less exacting but read on and see how ample are the compensating provisions in the other clauses.  They even enable me to become guardian to your children when you are dead, and to take control of all their property.'  While A studied the compensating clauses, C announced a national triumph, got loud cheers and proceeded to invent a new constitution as dictated by the enemy and without any place in it for A.  Having read through, A said: &lsquo;Can I constitutionally execute a provision by which my own execution is exacted?  For instance many of the provisions are such as could only be carried out after my death and it is assumed that I must carry them out while I live.  Does not this make a constitutional difficulty?&rsquo;&lsquo;Not at all&rsquo; said C, &lsquo;the thing is simple.  First of all you transfer to me all obligations, apart from the first clause.  Then you execute the first clause yourself, since nobody else can.&rsquo;  Meantime A's children began to ask &lsquo;What about Daddy?  We'll not have this treaty executed.  Let us rather execute the man who signed it for us behind our backs&rsquo;.  At the time of writing, C was still alive, but his numerous offspring were growing more and more determined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I say that that is a deliberate incitement to the assassination of the plenipotentiaries and they won't get off with it.</P>

      <P>I have spoken here in answer, because I know what is going on; I know that this atmosphere is being prepared.  The Irish people will not be deceived as to the motives and objects of the men on the other side if they proceed with this policy.  I have only to say this: these Englishmen, who are only backers of Englishmen, who think they are going to prevent the Irish people from expressing their views on the Treaty will not do it; they won't be able to do it.  The Irish people's answer to them is our answer to them, and it was Curran's answer to the soldiers of England&mdash;&ldquo;You may assassinate us but you won't intimidate us.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Very well.  All the correspondence, all the memoranda of the negotiations, are available and in the hands at present of the present Executive of Dáil Éireann.  There are in this country men who are able to weigh evidence.  I demand, as a right, that this evidence of my position in these negotiations be sifted judicially and that the full correspondence be published. On a former occasion, the Minister of Finance suggested it was to be published and we waited a long time.  I suggest that a judicial committee shall be set up to sift this evidence and that necessary witnesses be examined before them.  In the early secret session of Dáil Éireann this matter was gone into.  You realised and he realised at the time that a body like this is no body by which you can sift evidence and I demand as a right that such a body be set up and also I demand as a right that the correspondence dealing with this Treaty be published. Dáil Éireann at a secret session got certain documents&mdash;one of these documents is No. 7&mdash;of my negotiations as President with the Chairman of the Delegation. I have repeated here what I said in the private session because what I said then has been misrepresented. This is the first paragraph of that note of October 25th.  It is a memo of Arthur Griffith and it reads:&mdash;&ldquo;I have received the minutes of the 7th session (that is the 7th session of the meeting of the delegation in London) and your letter of the 24th.  We all here are at one (that was the majority of the Cabinet&mdash;but when a <i>fait accompli</i> was presented to them one member of the Cabinet definitely turned over and another member afterwards turned over) we&mdash;that is the Cabinet in Ireland at the time and I want you to note the date, October 25th, &mdash;all here are at one that there can be no question about asking the Irish people to enter into arrangements which would make them subjects of the Crown or admit allegiance to the British king. If war is the only alternative, we can only face it, and the sooner the other side is made realise that the better.&rdquo;  Is there any ambiguity there?</P>

The delegation took over to London with them a rough draft of the treaty on that line.  The object of the negotiation was to try if by discussion with the other side, a settlement on these lines could be made out.  And on October 25th&mdash;six weeks or so before the Treaty was signed and eleven days after they went to London&mdash;they got a definite expression from me and the other members who were at that time the majority of the Cabinet&mdash;they got a definite expression of opinion, a definite decision &ldquo;that we all here are at one, that there could be no question of our asking the Irish people to enter an arrangement which would make them subjects of the Crown or demand from them allegiance to the British King.

      <P>If there is a proposal about their being published, I would wish to say that when I was reading the second part of that, the remark about the national interests, which is a wise one, I felt before here that it is exposing your position and the position of the Government of Dáil Éireann which ought to be a sovereign assembly and a sacred assembly, and that it should not be done.  But there is no other way, unless you appoint a Judicial Committee.  These unworthy charges should not be allowed to pass without there being some means left to those who are attacked of defending themselves.  I held a responsible position. I held, and I hold, that, after all, I did my duty in that position.  I hold I am to-day defending what I regard as an honourable position, defending the sovereign rights of the Irish people&mdash;the sovereignty of the Irish nation.  And it is not fair that those who are in that position should have to bear, without an opportunity of vindication, the remarks made by the President, that a position had been given up by me or that I had used him unworthily.  My own position is this&mdash;I have stated it here in the private session of the Dáil&mdash;that having a conception of this external association, and the larger ministry of Dáil Éireann having set up that as the basis of the negotiation it was alleged by members of the Cabinet that I myself changed so to speak the foreign policy of the Republic or did my best to have it changed, when with the idea of the Republic there was associated a foreign policy which was not essential to the safeguarding of the country.  The word Republic denotes not merely sovereignty but independence.  What I changed was the idea of foreign policy in connection with the Republic.  And I used here, in the private session of Dáil Éireann, the words that &ldquo;I helped to batter down the walls of the isolated Republic.&rdquo;  I maintain that I defended the sovereignty of the nation and after the day the chairman of the delegation came back&mdash;my criticism is here in the notes&mdash;I criticised this on the grounds of giving away the sovereignty of the Irish nation, that it was inconsistent with the sovereignty and unity of the Irish nation.  These remarks are down in black and white in the secretaries' record of the proceedings of the Cabinet meeting.  I deny that I have treated the members of the delegation in the manner that has been suggested.  I say it is an infamous suggestion and I would not be fit to be alive if I had done that. I have said here in Dáil Éireann definitely that my position was that if there was something which I thought the Irish people should take under the circumstances&mdash;while I personally could not be myself the sponsor of anything less than that for which my comrades had died, with which I associated isolation to a large extent, as well as the sovereignty of the country&mdash;if there was something less than that, whilst I myself could not take it, yet I would never do anything to stand in the way of the Irish people accepting it.  But I am now in this particular case standing against this Treaty because I don't believe the Irish people should accept it.</P>

      <P>I want to make a suggestion.  The honour of this assembly, the honour of the nation and the honour of the men in this assembly should be of grave concern to us all. And I suggest, in view of the regrettable incident that has just passed, that a Judicial Committee of Inquiry be set up by this House to investigate the charges made by the President of the Republic against Mr. de Valera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Eoin MacNeill">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on behalf of the assembly. You will remember that&mdash;I think it was at the first of your private meetings when you were discussing this Treaty&mdash; I warned you that you were allowing the discussion to pass from the merits of the policy of the proposal that was before you&mdash;whether it be in your judgment a right one or a bad one, or an indifferent one&mdash;to a discussion on the merits and actions of persons and individuals.  Now the suggestion has been made of a Judicial Inquiry.  Every person who is criticised&mdash;every person who is incriminated&mdash;is endeavouring to have himself defended.  But it was not to hear charges or to make charges against any individual, no matter how highly placed, that we were sent here.  It was not to decide such charges either.  Now, I am not leaning one hair's breadth on one side or the other and I am not thinking of one side or the other in what I am saying at present.  We were not sent here as followers of either one man or another man.  The responsibility that has been thrown upon us here is not to decide upon the merits of that man or this man or whether that man or this man has acted rightly or whether that man or this man has acted honourably or dishonourably.  The one thing we have to deal with is this great and crucial decision that is before the Irish people.  I say nothing on one side or the other with regard to that but I ask every member of the Dáil not to allow any personal matter to come in or be brought between us and our responsibilities to the nation.  It is not a tendency of ours any more than in any other assembly to do this.  These personal questions arise in every assembly in the world and the people who are mainly interested, the principal parties, naturally, cannot escape from attaching great importance to them. But we know the critical state of our national affairs at present and I hope that every single one of you will insist that we confine ourselves to the national issue.  And if the other issue is to be settled it can be settled.  There can be a proper means of settling it.  Let not that be done hastily.  In two or three years or ten or twenty years time it will be all the same what person was right or what person was wrong.  It will not be the same as regards decisions taken in the interests of the country.  I am not suggesting that when charges are made that there should not be every possible opportunity of defending them.  But I ask the Dáil to agree with me that this personal question shall not be allowed to take up their attention at the time when great national interests are in such a crucial stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with every word you are saying.  But this question unfortunately is not a personal question. It is the main argument apparently of the other side for getting their Treaty accepted, that I am in the same boat as themselves.  Therefore this is an argument for the acceptance of this Treaty, and I want this matter examined because I believe it would be helping to an honest national decision.  On that ground again, I ask that there be no further drawing of red herrings across the national issue, and that a Judicial Committee be appointed to examine into this question.</P>

      <P>As I had been Minister for Foreign Affairs during the large portion of this time, there is a part of this report to which I strongly object. It is part, unfortunately, of the present policy of the Executive to try to win their way by the natural anxiety of our people to preserve the credit of our nation and, as far as possible, to let minor matters of importance go.  As <Col N="312" /> far as our anxiety to preserve the credit of our nation abroad is concerned, in the report the following appears:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The spectacle of fierce disunion at home, its manifestations abroad, particularly in the United States of America, and at the time of the Irish race Congress in Paris, the publicity given by the foreign Press to reports, true and false of violence in Ireland have shocked many of the friends of this country abroad and have given an appearance of justification to the persistent propaganda done by England during the war. If we are to retrieve the splendid position we held, we must take steps at home without delay to prove that we are a nation and not a rabble.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is further, in the statement made by the President, which is supposed to cover the reports, the suggestion that Opposition, to whom the President attributes the present condition of affairs, is also responsible for, as he says, the position in the U.S.A. I want to say about that, that the members of the Republican Party went to America after repeated invitations by the organisation in America which stood for the ideal of the recognition of the Republic.  The delegation from the other side was sent over with no constructive proposal but to destroy any work which they might try to do there.  There is a reference to the Irish Race Congress in Paris.  I would like to ask whether the report of the Committee which was set up by Dáil Éireann to examine into that question is available&mdash;that is the report of the special committee.</P>

If certain members, when the Congress ended, made charges which they did not make during the Congress, that is not to be taken as an exhibition or manifestation of the forces of disunion. I think it is not right to be defaming our people by reports of this sort.  I am against further things myself in this report.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word or two on the general character of this report, apart from the question of the details.  I have never seen a report from anybody representing Ireland in foreign countries, or from any Minister connected with Irish propaganda in other countries which began by an insolent attack on the Irish people themselves.  From this document, which is presented to the Dáil and given to the Press, it will be rightly assumed that the Irish people themselves have to admit that they deserve the slanderous stigma that they are not a nation but a rabble.  I think this document shames the men who issued it and, in particular, the man who is responsible for it.  I think it is a gross insult to the Dáil and not only that but to the Irish race at home, and the Irish people abroad, that a responsible Minister should produce a thing like that, which could be used readily as an instrument of England to belie and belittle Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that evidence reaches me from all sorts of people&mdash;from our own people abroad and from our friends&mdash;that our prestige abroad is not at all what it was. The men who have been our representatives on the Continent during recent months can well bear that out in whatever country they have been.  Now this report was carefully worded, because I did not want to have foreign affairs made a question of Party politics.  It was carefully worded but, dealing with the motion, I say that we have unhappily gone a long way to losing the position we held in the estimation of the world abroad.  People are constantly writing home, or reporting on their return to Ireland from abroad, that it is positively painful to have to discuss Irish affairs with foreigners.  I mentioned the U.S.A. particularly and specifically because I have been reading Irish-American <Col N="313" /> papers, as well as some American papers, and there is no question but that the bitterness which we have seen displayed in Ireland is nothing to the bitterness which some of our friends across the water are indulging in.  The bitterness in the U.S.A. is worse than it is here.  Things are less clearly understood there than they are here.  The effect of the disorder in Ireland, in whatever country it is reported, is deplorable upon the good name of Ireland&mdash;absolutely deplorable.  You must remember that this happens at a time when the foreign Press has been well trained to give extended reports about Ireland&mdash; much more than about any other small country.  I could read sheaves of cuttings on this matter and anyone who has been abroad lately will bear me out. That is why I asked the members of this House to give serious consideration to this matter.</P>
      <P>I have been asked one or two questions which I think should have been put in the form of questions in the ordinary way about Mr. O'Kelly and Mr. Boland and Mr. McCullough.  If the gentlemen concerned wish those questions raised &mdash;I don't know whether this is raised with their authority or not&mdash;I will be glad to answer them.  If these questions are put on the paper in the ordinary way, I shall be glad to deal with them. I may, in conclusion, call attention to the fact that the Bishops of Ireland, who are in a position to know what is being said abroad, allude in the statements published this morning to the danger of dragging the fair name of Ireland in the mud.</P>

I understand it is the policy of the Government to maintain the Republican Courts and see that they are carried on, during the present time at any rate, in the same manner as before the discussion on the Treaty.  Now, some one has sent me a cutting from a newspaper published in Co. Wicklow in connection with the calling of a Court of which Mr. Joseph Lynch is Registrar.  The advertisement for this Court is headed &ldquo;Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann.&rdquo;  Is that done with the knowledge or sanction of the Minister of Home Affairs, or is it in accord with his policy, as agreed in this House, that the Republican Courts would not function under any other authority?</P>

      <P>Tá aon cheist amháin agam le chur agus is mar gheall ar an Píléirí é sin.  I regret, a Chinn Comhairle, that the question in regard to police matters has not been more satisfactorily dealt with in the report from the Home Affairs Department.  In view of the circumstances of the country at the moment, the police question is one of the most serious, if not the most serious, especially in certain areas. Under the old system, the most the Dáil was able to do in the matter of providing an effective police force was to supply one officer for a Brigade area.  In the meantime, events have taken place <Col N="314" /> which have removed any other police force, or any other method of supplying protection for life and property.  It seems to me that no matter what limitations may be urged, in the matter of dealing with the necessity for an effective police force, at least Dáil Éireann could have taken some steps which would have been an earnest to the country that they were serious in the matter of doing all they could as a Government to supply the people of the country with effective police protection. I would like the Minister of Home Affairs, in his reply, to let the House know what steps, if any, he has taken to deal with that.  I instance as my particular concern, the city of Cork. What protection has he given or does he propose to give, to the citizens of Cork now more than they had, say, two or three years ago?  Does he think that one police officer for the Brigade area, which includes the City of Cork, as well as a huge area outside the city of Cork, is sufficient to constitute an effective police force?</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. P.J. RUTLEDGE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister of Home Affairs if he devotes any of his time and uses his Department to try and force citizens into the British Courts.  If the Courts of the country&mdash;the Courts of Dáil Éireann&mdash;are functioning, why is he trying to drive people unwillingly into British Courts?  Why does he not allow them to come into and appear in the Irish Courts?  I refer now to an instruction he has issued to Registrars in the country, to the effect that in certain cases they must go into British Courts. I presume the answer of the Minister of Home Affairs will be that there is no legislation to deal with the matter. Against that, I put before the House the case of a gentleman named Mr. Meredith, who I understand was appointed a Republican agent and who was, I believe &mdash;at least he was before the Treaty&mdash; functioning as a Republican Judge through the country.  I would like to know under what authority this gentleman recently acted in Waterford. Although there was no legislation or no provision made by this Assembly, and nothing to enable him to deal with it, there was a particular case which he proposed to deal with in a certain way at Waterford a short time ago.  In conjunction, I presume, with the High Sheriff&mdash;probably the British High Sheriff&mdash;or by some other method, a Grand Jury was called.  That was one of the systems we were supposed to think so ill of in times gone by.  A Grand Jury was called, and, worse than that, it was publicly stated by the Republican Judge in this so-called Republican Court that this was a Free State Court functioning in Waterford.  I am mentioning that particular case on the grounds that if the only argument that can meet the question of why people are being drawn against their will into British Courts is that there was no legislation by this assembly, what rule or what legislation gives permission to persons to call a Grand Jury&mdash;recalling what was an aristocratic system and trying to perpetuate it in the country.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, there were a number of complaints about the Courts. There were a good many in the area I come from.  It seems to be the set policy of certain Judges in certain areas that the Republican Courts should not continue to exist, but should make room for some other system that may come along afterwards.  With regard to the policing of the country, the remarks of the Lord Mayor of Cork could well apply to other parts of the country.  Trouble has arisen also about decrees.  The reason in regard to the policing of the country is because the police force has been disbanded to make room, I suppose, for some other force that the Minister is trying to bring into existence.</P>
      <P>Now, I would like to ask a question in regard to the appointment of officials in the Home Affairs Office.  I would like to know whether those appointments that have been made by the Minister, whether they be either judges or others, temporary or otherwise have been permitted by the Dáil?  I would like also, if it is relevant, to ask the Minister of Home Affairs has the system of calling a Grand Jury been brought to a head by correspondence received by him from the British High Sheriff?</P>

I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs is it true that the judges that were appointed as Republican Judges at a large salary were given permission to practise in English Courts.

      <P>I would like to say a few words on this report of the Minister of Home Affairs.  A great deal of trouble in the country is caused through the mismanagement of the Home Affairs Department.  A lot of this trouble arises through the Courts. I am getting letters every day from my constituents who have been served with writs and processes through the old English Courts.  Now, you all remember that at one of our meetings previous to the signing of the Articles of Agreement, we definitely decided we could not allow two Governments or two Courts to function.  There could be only one Government and one Court we could recognise.  At the time the Minister of Home Affairs took office, everything was about to work smoothly.  We had our Republican Courts functioning smoothly &mdash;local district and circuit Courts. Since he has taken over office, there has been a very noticeable change.  In Fermoy, Midleton, Youghal, and other districts around, summonses have been served on Jurors to attend those Courts under the old English system.  There are instances of where a Recorder came to these Courts, but he could not sit there because he would not be recognised and those in charge of the peace of the district had to tell him they could not recognise any foreign Court system. Now, a lot of business which could be done under the Republican Courts has been in arrears.  No one knows better than the Minister of Home Affairs that if he wants to carry out his duties of keeping order in the country properly, there is only one way of doing it; that is, by having one law alone and that law administered in such a way that any decrees given by these Courts can be carried out.  As regards the old Recorders and the old English judges, the Minister knows very well that in the south of Ireland at least, they could never function and never will.  If he wants to prevent further trouble, he will revert to the proper order of things and prevent this business and allow no Courts but the Republican Courts.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the fact that considerable dissatisfaction has been caused by the delay in the visit of Circuit Court Judges in certain areas.  In some instances the Circuit Judge is due over three months and a great lot of inconvenience results. The Home Office knows well that Cork City District Court was amongst the first established in Ireland, and it has been the most effective and most efficient in Ireland.  Cases are ready in that area for over four months and some important cases are hanging over. People are declaring that they will have to take the case elsewhere if the Circuit Courts are not held soon.  This delay is encouraging people to take cases to the British Courts instead of to the Republican Courts in the Cork area.</P>

      <P>The President of the Dáil gave an undertaking to keep all the Departments of the Dáil functioning, it will be recollected.  At the last session of the Dáil, I proposed a resolution that a Commission be set up to inquire into the sale and manufacture of intoxicants in Ireland.  In consequence of that, sometime afterwards I got a communication from the Department of Home Affairs, Dáil Éireann.  It was written on Dáil notepaper and signed by members of the Dáil.  In that communication I was asked if I was prepared to act on the Commission and if I would suggest the names of other people who would.  In reply to that letter, I wrote that I would act on the Commission and I suggested certain other names.  I got a second letter from the Department of Home Affairs suggesting alternative names, and I wrote accepting these.  I heard nothing further until the 27th March, 1922, when I got a communication addressed from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, which, I presume, is the Ministry of Home Affairs for the Provisional Government.  That letter ran as follows:&mdash;</P>

Cahill and yourself.  The Minister would be <Col N="316" /> obliged to know, as early as possible if you have any information as to whether Mr. Cahill will act as, in case he does not, it will be necessary to nominate some other member. It is presumed that you are agreeable to act on the Committee.</P>

I want to know from the Minister of Home Affairs, in view of the former letters addressed to me from the Dáil Ministry and my replies stating that I would act on the Committee to be set up under the auspices of Dáil Éireann, what was the purpose in asking me to go on another Committee?  Do the circumstances bear out that, in regard to his Department in any event, the undertaking of the President, that the Dáil would function in all its Departments, is being carried out?  Was it not an attempt to set up a Committee under the auspices of the Provisional Government?</P>

      <P>In reply to the questions raised, I would like to say in connection with the first question, with regard to the policing of the country, that that was very generally dealt with by the Minister of Defence in his report yesterday.  The policing of the country has been taken over by the Army in the transition period.  In certain places, for reasons which are well known to the members of the Dáil, where headquarters has not got control, there is a difficulty in the matter of police work at the moment; but as soon as General Headquarters gets definite command the policing can be done without any trouble in these places.  With regard to the question raised as to licensing jurisdiction, it would be well if members would realise that I took over this Department three months ago as it stood.  I never fashioned it.  Mr. Stack was responsible for the setting up of the Courts.  I took over the machine as I found it.  I took over the staff as I found it.  I did not dismiss anybody.  I did not make a single change in the personnel of the staff.  I told them they were to carry on, that there was no change in policy, and as a matter of fact, they have been carrying on to a much greater extent since I took the Department over because of the operations of the Treaty.  That applies to the Courts Department.  The Courts have no licensing jurisdiction, and they never had.  They have no Bankruptcy jurisdiction; no Lunacy jurisdiction, and no Probate jurisdiction.  There is no Department for writs, deeds, or transfers of land, or ordinary commercial transactions that are being carried out every day in the week.  We all know that, and there is no use in pretending that they have.</P>

      <P>Please allow me to finish.  There have been questions raised in reference to Dáil Éireann judges.  They have been appointed by my predecessor; I have appointed none of them.  They were taken over by me the same as the other persons functioning under the Department.  One Deputy raised a question about the summoning of a jury in Waterford.  I do not know anything about it.  One judge decided&mdash;very properly, I think&mdash; that criminal cases should not be tried without juries, and Court rules made no provision for either the empanelling or the summoning of the jury.  There is no machinery available under the Dáil Courts for providing juries, and I think what very probably happened is this: the local sheriff, regarding himself as an officer of the Provisional Government, acted on an order which he got from some official of the Dáil, and got the jury.  There was some reference to the terms of appointment of the judges.  I <Col N="317" /> have said they were all appointed by my predecessor, and they had the right, while acting as judges of the Dáil Courts, to practise in the British Courts. Undoubtedly they did so&mdash;some of them did.  That right was not given them by me, because I did not appoint them.  I merely took them over on the same terms on which they had already been appointed.  With regard to the delay in dealing with cases in Cork, all I can say in the matter is that at the time I took over the Department there was a great congestion of Court work.  That was largely owing to the fact that the principal court officials had been on sick leave, and also because of the fact that as a result of the operation of the Treaty, all sorts of people were pouring into the Courts&mdash;people who did not come into them before.  There was, in consequence, a certain amount of congestion, and it can be easily understood that some delay was more or less unavoidable. It can, however, be got over with a sufficient number of judges, but not otherwise.  I am sorry to learn that my friend, Deputy McEntee, got a communication from the Dáil Office on Provisional Government paper.  It was a typist's error&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the Minister has not made it clear about this appointment of judges.  Judges were getting a big salary from the Dáil and at the same time they were allowed to practise in English Courts.  I think this House had a right to be informed that these Judges had permission to practise in English Courts and that they were appointed on these conditions.  It has not been made clear to the House how they got the permission.</P>

I don't want to talk long on points, but I may mention that this matter of Republican Courts is one specific case and is one of the main things causing disturbances in the country.  There is evidence that the Dáil Departments are not being worked; they are simply marking time.  Marking time is not working.  The Minister states the Courts have not jurisdiction over several things.  Why have not they got jurisdiction?  What has the Minister been doing since his appointment that he has not come before the House and got the necessary authority?  That is at the root of a good deal of the trouble existing in the country.</P>

      <P>I was criticising the present Minister and not his predecessor, since he came into office. He has had ample opportunity of obtaining whatever authority he required to enable those courts to function over an area in which they did not previously function.  That is the gist of the whole trouble.  The Provisional Government is acting as a Government without responsibility to this House and their courts are being allowed to function and the Republican Courts are being allowed to live a kind of moribund existence.  I do not want to introduce any heat into the debate, but I would respectfully put it to the House that this is one of the disturbing elements in the country&mdash;that the Departments of Dáil Éireann are being allowed to mark time and are not going ahead.  The same would more or less apply to the police.  Nothing is being done about the Republican Police, because the Provisional Government is taking steps to put another police force into operation.</P>

      <P>The courts have been called Free State Courts throughout the country in the Press.  That matter has raised a lot of annoyance.  Then, again, I have to make reference to the dismissal of a judge in our area.  This particular justice was the only Republican justice who remained in the district and he was dismissed without any explanation, I think, by the Assistant-Minister.  There was another case in which a fine was inflicted by a District Court and an order was made to cancel the fine and it was sent down behind the justices' backs.  I think those matters should be explained.  I think also it is necessary for an instruction to be given to the justices of the Republican Courts to see that the reports in the Press do not describe their courts as Free State Courts. They could avoid that by opening them as Republican Courts.  They have been described in the Press as Free State Courts and that has raised a lot of trouble.</P>

      <P>I have no definite information about the Waterford case.  The jury may have been summoned by the Chief of Police, for all I know.  What I did suggest was that it was quite possible that the sheriff now an officer of the Provisional Government might have obeyed an order issued to him by the Registrar of the Republican Courts.  If he did, I do not see what grievance the Republican Courts have.  With regard to Mr. Etchingham's point, if the Registrars of Republican courts have referred to them as Free State courts, that is quite wrong and it is due to some misapprehension.  The Republican courts are purely Republican courts and will remain so, in accordance with the undertaking given by the President. The courts will be carried on as such. With regard to Deputy Collivet's point, that it was the duty of the Minister of Home Affairs to proceed to set up a new system of courts and increase the jurisdiction of the Republican courts, I would like to point out to him that under the undertakings given by the President no such obligation was thrown on me.  I took them over as I found them and I have carried them on.  They have been carried on to an extent hitherto unknown.  That is point No. 1.  To set up the machinery necessary to provide the courts with additional jurisdiction would be a matter of months and would mean the setting up of a huge staff and huge organisation.  It would take months to do it and there would be no sense or reason in doing that for the purpose of dealing with a transition period which will last only another few weeks.  At the end of that time, either the Republic will be set up in which case the Republic will have to establish courts which will be capable of doing the business of the people, or the Free State will be set up, in which case it will use machinery which it has in hand and get control of.</P>

      <P>I just wish to ask a question for the purpose of information. It is not of a contentious nature at all.  It is really relating to the cash account of the Department of Finance.  The members of the Dáil may remember that at the last session there was a question raised with regard to an amount which was in the region of £4,000 or £5,000&mdash;I will not be certain which&mdash;that was charged against the Defence Department in October last.  I questioned it, and the reply, if my memory serves me right, was that it was charged in error and an amount would be refunded.  Now, as regards the amount that is here, £4,890 4s. 6d., is the other item charged in October included in that?</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy for Waterford, I am afraid I cannot exactly say whether that particular amount is included in this £4,890, but I think so.  The reason this matter is not clearer is as far as I can make out, because of the London accounts.  They are not completed and I would like notice of the question before answering definitely that the amount in question is part of the £4,890.  If it is not part of it, it is because the London accounts are not completed.  The official auditor to whom I have been speaking, is going to London on Monday night.  I can give the Deputy a written answer to any question he may put.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that this report be not adopted on the grounds of the payment to the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> of a sum of £2,692 18s. 2d.  That payment is unauthorised and irregular. Never before, not even during the most trying period of the war, when the loyal citizens of the Republic suffered <Col N="320" /> loss and damage at the hands of the forces of the English enemy, when men were rendered destitute who before that period were living in circumstances of comparative affluence and not even then, in one particular instance&mdash;that of the late Mr. Crowley of Limerick, and who had four sons in the Irish army and whose property to the value of £80,000 was destroyed by English forces&mdash;never before, I say, did the Dáil vote a sum of money as compensation for the destruction of property.  Therefore, I say this grant is not only unauthorised but without precedent.  And I say, further, of all the cases where such compensation might be claimed, this was the least deserving.  We all know the record of the <i>Freeman's Journal.</i>  We have learned it over and over again from the newspapers which were edited by the President of the Dáil&mdash;the journal of the Sham Squire, the journal that attacked the Young Irelanders, the journal that attacked the Fenians, the journal that attacked Parnell, the journal that slandered the men of 1916, even when they were in their graves, and the journal that opposed the establishment of the Republic and the campaign to establish the republic in 1918.  Yet of all the instances where property was destroyed in this country, this is the one instance where Dáil money&mdash;money which was collected in order to sustain and uphold the Republic&mdash;was given away in compensation. I do not say but that there may have been circumstances in connection with this vote, circumstances where the alleviation of distress, consequent upon certain action, might be praiseworthy but I do say that in that event there were other agencies whereby the money necessary for that purpose might have been obtained.  It is quite apparent to all of us that the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> had been acting as the chief propagandist organ for the Treaty Party. If the Treaty Party wanted to compensate the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> for the punishment it justly deserved for publishing the report of a common spy in its columns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Then the Treaty Party ought in all honesty to have compensated the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> from the Treaty funds (&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo;).  I asked yesterday why was not this compensation paid from the Treaty funds and I have been misreported and put down as saying &ldquo;why was not the compensation paid from the sinking funds.&rdquo;  Perhaps the reporter spoke truly, after all.  The Treaty fund, like the Treaty Party and the Treaty itself is a sinking arrangement.  Now, there is one thing further about this payment.  It unveils at last the hypocrisy of those who have associated themselves at present with the Government of the Dáil.  It shows very clearly to the Irish people who was behind the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> in all the dastardly attacks it made upon President de Valera when he was President of this assembly. When wages are earned the paymaster or the employer must pay them or be exposed if he does not.  And it is because the <i>Freeman</i> faithfully carried out the instructions of the President of this assembly that this money is being paid now.  I say that and say it deliberately (cries of &ldquo;liar&rdquo;).  I say it for this reason that when the Treaty was being debated in this Dáil, when these attacks were being made that aroused indignation even among those following the charm of the delegation at that period&mdash;when these attacks were being made, one of the leading members of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> staff went to the Gresham Hotel every evening and there, in consultation with those standing sponsor for the Treaty arranged what was to appear in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> next day (opposition laughter).  It is all very well to laugh but I heard the appointments made, and I met the man coming out of the Gresham Hotel after keeping the appointments.</P>

For the reasons I have mentioned, I would suggest that in honour and in honesty, because we did not in the height of the war compensate those who deserved compensation at our hands on account of the abuses which it sometimes might lead to, we should not compensate in this case.  We steadfastly refused to compensate any person who suffered loss at the hands of the English enemy and just because we established that precedent we ought not to allow this amount.  Furthermore, the payment was irregular, because it is not the <Col N="321" /> duty of the Dáil or the Irish Republic to compensate the paper which has always been the hidden and sometimes the open enemy of Irish liberty.  It is not within our power and it is not honourable to us to allow this money to be voted to this journal without a protest.</P>

      <P>The <i>Freeman</i> published the report that a body of men bearing arms, and unscrupulous in the bearing of those arms had proposed setting up a dictatorship.  It was a national duty on the part of any paper in Ireland to publish that report.  The <i>Freeman's Journal</i>&mdash;I do not care twopence about its previous record&mdash;had at least the common courage to publish that report and for doing that a band of brigands or whatever you may like to call them went into the Freeman's Journal and destroyed the property.  The act of these men was largely brought about by the acts and speeches of members of this Dáil.  As these men and the Party to which they belonged would not stump up the money for the damage they had brought about, it was the duty of the Dáil, as a whole, to do the best it could. What it did was to contribute to the wages of some four hundred odd men who were put out of employment.  That was the very least the Dáil could do, when the ordinary duty of the other side who had brought the damage about was not done.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter yesterday, particularly in reference to the writer of the scurrilous article which appeared on the 5th January.  I do know that other newspapers got a reprimand in the past.  The <i>Independent</i> got one and the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, I think, got another.  Certainly, if any newspaper deserved to get a reprimand, it was the <i>Freeman.</i>  Personally I was sorry for what happened, because the paper was on its last legs. I am given to understand on authority it was losing about £500 a week and now this thing has given it a new lease of life.  I would ask the Minister does he know when he gave the money to pay the staff and the employees if the writer of the article I referred to, who, I understand, is a Canadian&mdash;we hear a lot about damned Englishmen&mdash;does he know if the writer of this scurrilous article got any of the money?  I heard the President say that he never inspired anything that appeared in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> and that he was never in the office.  I do not know if it is true that the famous Document No. 2 that was given out here in secret session as a confidential document was set up in type in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> office within twenty-four hours.  Who carried it there?  I would be pleased for some one to tell me that is not true.  I want to know if the gentleman who wrote that article participated in the Dáil Funds&mdash; the funds that were subscribed to the Irish Republic?

      <P>There were members of the <i>Independent</i> staff who, it was very seriously considered, would lose their lives if something was not done to relieve the excitement and to relieve the anger of certain members of the Volunteers in Dublin City, if some kind of outlet had not been opened to them. The outlet that brought the smallest loss to the country was allowed in that instance.</P>

      <P>And allowed by the responsible authority in this country, which is a very different thing to unauthorised reprisals on the part of individuals or collections of individuals. There is no similarity whatever between the two case except to those who do not wish to see.  In one case you had responsible officers and soldiers of the Republic operating under the orders of a responsible authority and operating in the interests of the country.  In the other case, the Dáil courts are still open and it is in the power of any person having a grievance against a newspaper or against individuals or a group of individuals to bring them before the Dáil Courts and have them treated according to law.  If a case is so flimsy that there is no possibility of getting a decision, is it within the right of individuals to take revenge and to take the law into their own hands?  Then if that is the case, we have come to a position in which it is within the power of certain units to say that the Government must abdicate or else that they would make themselves troublesome.  For my part, I see no similarity in the two cases.  If there are grievances, the Dáil courts is the place to bring them and not air them by the distruction of property of the Irish people which means a serious dislocation to people earning their bread by the sweat of their brow.  The employees of that concern were put out of employment. If there be a case it ought to be made.  It has not been made.  No justification whatever exists for it.  If there be a case, the courts are there to have it dealt with.  This is the distruction of property belonging to the country.  It meant that huge sums of money had to be spent in another country to get foreign manufactured goods into the country&mdash;materials which are not manufactured here.  That meant a loss here. You, on the other side, may smile but it is a serious matter when it has to be paid for.  I think the ex-Minister of Defence would not have justified such damage in the old days when he was in office.  Who is to pay for all this?  It is reducing the actual value of the country, seriously impeding any development of business and it does not conduce to advancement. We all remember the expression of the ex-President when he said the authority of the Dáil is sovereign in the country.</P>

      <P>I am with the Deputy for Monaghan in so far as the gravamen of the charge is concerned.  I am not one who agrees with the policy of suppression of free speech anywhere.  I would not stand for it.  But it seems strange that there should be this exception out of all the cases that have happened, let us say, since the new Executive, or the new Cabinet, came into authority.  Some of the best friends the movement had in its worst days and in the hardest times&mdash; some of our friends&mdash;have suffered very severe losses, as a result of the condition of the country, and not one of these people, as far as I am aware, received one penny compensation.  I do not know whether they have applied or not, but, at any rate, not a penny compensation was paid out of Republican funds to anybody who suffered or made sacrifices&mdash;to any person who suffered in person or property&mdash;as a result of the condition of the country.  The strange thing is that a newspaper which during its whole history of 160 years or 165 years, has worked, unceasingly worked, against the independence of this country, worked for every movement practically that made for keeping this country tied closer and closer to England, a paper that worked hard and unceasingly day in and day out against every Irishman who stood for separation of Ireland from England and worked against Mr. Griffith himself in the days when he was struggling hard to teach the young men and the young women of the country to be Irish&mdash;the paper that maligned him and his supporters and maligned me as a humble follower of his who stood to uphold the policy of separation from England&mdash;the paper that maligned everyone who stood up for Irish independence throughout its whole history&mdash; scandalous history which Mr. Griffith has retold again and again and made us all so familiar with&mdash;it is a strange thing that this paper would be the one sufferer to be relieved out of Republican funds. That seems strange to me.  I do not object to anybody who has suffered and who may not have been responsible for the policy of the paper&mdash;the workmen, for instance, who merely earn their daily bread as printers&mdash;I do not object to these people getting money to keep themselves and their families alive&mdash;I have no objection to that in the least&mdash; but I do object and say it is a strange thing for Mr. Griffith, as President of the <Col N="324" /> Dáil, to authorise the payment of Republican funds.  Surely there are other relief bodies in the country who should have given grants of this kind. It is very strange, coming from him, or with his authority, that Republican money should be given to a paper about which he on one occasion is reported as having said &ldquo;To be censured and libelled by the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> is the best certificate of honest character an Irishman could possess.&rdquo;  Why he selected that paper to get the benefit of our hard earned and hard collected funds, passes my imagination.</P>

      <P>There was just one slight mistake.  The Deputy for Dublin is making most dexterous efforts to sit on two stools.  First, he said he had no objection to the employees of the <i>Freeman</i> being supplied with certain funds to keep them alive.  Well, this grant is for no other purpose.  He then proceeds to impeach the Cabinet of this assembly for doing what he says he had no objection to.  It was not a grant to the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>; it was a subsidy to relieve the distress caused by those who selected the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> for destruction.  It is they who have the responsibility for any distress that ensued and it was to prevent the result of their misdeeds that this contribution was given to the victims of that entirely unjustifiable attack.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. M. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to give these particulars in a general way without any question from any Deputy.  We paid an amount of money when taxidrivers were thrown out of employment, because they were thrown out of employment to a large extent, arising out of an agreement of ours.  We paid an amount of money in the case of a man killed in Limerick and in connection with a clergyman who was victimised because of his political opinions.  These are the only instances that come to my mind but they form a precedent for this particular payment and, as memories seem to be so short, I think I ought to again read the actual record of the decision reached in voting or in passing this money at the Cabinet meeting.  It was passed to the Minister for Labour to enable him to pay the full wages' bill of the unemployed staff of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> for two weeks.  That payment was not a payment in any way to the proprietors of the Freeman.  The proprietors have, I take it, their ordinary legal remedy in that case.  Now, if we have a sense of responsibility, if we have any sense of being the Government of the country, we must surely have in mind, and have clearly in mind, the differences that existed between say 1920 and 1922.  The acts that have been referred to by Deputies&mdash;the very foul acts, the atrocities that were carried out all over the country, the houses that were destroyed and the lives that were taken&mdash;were committed when we were not the authority in power to be responsible for these things.  They were carried out by a foreign aggressor and a foreign Government was responsible for these acts. Under the Treaty, they will have to bear responsibility for the damage caused, <Col N="325" /> just as we will have to bear the responsibility for the damage done by our side. The <i>Freeman's Journal</i> or any other capitalists, will, I take it, take some action towards recovering their losses, in the ordinary course, by what has been accepted by us, as law.  But, under any conditions known to me, the staff would simply be out of work.  The proprietors &mdash;the capitalists of the <i>Freeman</i>&mdash;just as in any other concern, would not be responsible for the wages of the staff. It is all very well to veil this thing, but any person who opposes the payment of the money is opposing the payment to ordinary working people and you cannot confuse the issue by mentioning a scurrilous or any other kind of article that appeared in the <i>Freeman.</i>  Every Deputy will remember that I did not agree with the article.  I do not think any of our side could or did agree with the terms of the article, but every person in a public position has to be satisfied with any criticism that comes from the platform and the Press.  And indeed the criticism in the article and the terms used in the article compared very favourably with some of the terms used about other public men recently.  Let us, for goodness sake, not bring every matter down to the level of a Party matter.  Let us see an injustice when it is an injustice, and it is an injustice to throw these men out of employment. I am not saying&mdash;and nobody will say&mdash; that the persons who felt keenly about things that were appearing in the papers had no right to feel keenly about them, but they did not have any right to take that action, which lowered the value of Ireland as a whole and which did throw many men and some women out of employment.  In addition, whether we like it or not, or whether the opposition likes it or not, the report published in the <i>Freeman</i> was an official communication supplied by Dáil Éireann and as a Government and a sovereign Assembly that we all talk of, it was surely up to us to do something, if we could not protect them from violence, at least to protect the dependents of the people who were working in the concern.  That is the reason payment was made; not because of any thoughtfulness or otherwise for the <i>Freeman's Journal.</i>  The issue should not be clouded by any reference to past articles or to the history of the <i>Freeman.</i>  The men on the <i>Freeman</i> were not responsible for the articles or the past history of the <i>Freeman's Journal.</i></P>
