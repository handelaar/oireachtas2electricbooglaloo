The Standing Orders may arise shortly, but there is a proposal on the Orders of the day that there shall be elected a President of the Dáil.  The new Members do not know what that means.  We assume it means the Head of the Government, but we do not know how long that office shall be held by the holder.  It is essential that we should have an opportunity of hearing from the present or prospective Head of the Government on what ground we are expected to elect any particular person to that office.  If you rule&mdash;and perhaps this may clear the way&mdash;that on the nomination of any particular person we may discuss questions of policy past or in future, then the matter will be clear.  I suggest that that is the orderly way of going about this business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to meeting the wishes which have been expressed here and until tho Standing Orders are settled, let me say in English I propose to this Dáil the election of Liam MacCosgair as President of the Dáil. Since the last Dáil separated we have <Col N="18" /> lost the two people who were the leaders, and to whom we looked, as the leaders of the future&mdash;one of them the greatest sower who lived in Ireland while we have been here, and the other the greatest reaper the country has ever had.  Now in this country, without these two great leaders, we are faced with greater responsibilities thrown upon each particular Member of this Dáil, and very great responsibilities indeed thrown, upon certain Members who have to undertake the work which would have been taken up by the two great Chiefs whom we have lost.  The life of this Dáil is understood to be a short one, as lives of Parliaments go.  We have a certain definite work to do; we have first and foremost to implement the Treaty that was made recently between this Country and Britain, and made by, among others, those two Chieftains whom we have lost.  We have to set up a Constitution for our Country that will be in accordance with that Treaty, and we have in the meantime to perform the work of governing the Country.  The implementing of this Treaty will save our Country from outside enemies, and we have here in this Dáil to discuss and to arrange and to settle and to carry out means for defeating internal enemies, or very, very bad friends of our Country, whereby the National strength that lay in our Army has been seriously broken. That strength has been recovered.  The National Party that was the strength of the work of the past few years too has been broken, but a sufficiently large section of it still holds together, and the ties that bound the Country and the whole of that Party, before it was broken, still exist, between, the Country and the greater portion, of what they would call that great National Party. The responsibility of shouldering the greater portion of the work of the immediate future is being shouldered by that Party, if I could call it a Party, considering its history.  We have left to us a very great national responsibility, a national duty, to see that that National Party shall strengthen itself, shall solidify and recover its old national strength, to pull the Country through this crisis in the same way as the broken Party has pulled itself together and stood by the liberties of the Country in its own particular crisis.  And in proposing Mr. Cosgrave, as head of the <Col N="19" /> new Government, I propose him as a man who is the trusted head of that National Party, and I propose him as being in himself a man of sufficient strength of character to carry forward the work we place before him of securing the full freedom that is brought to us under this Treaty, and to carry out the work of implementing it, and of shouldering all the other great responsibilities. That work requires very great courage, very great tact, and very, very many other great qualities, to save our Country from those at any rate very, very bad friends of the Country who are endeavouring, with whatever motives, to destroy a, very big portion of that freedom which their own particular efforts helped us to get, not so very long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL:</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the resolution for the election of Mr. Cosgrave as President of the Dáil.  The position which he occupies is known to all the Members here.  He is the leading representative of those on whom the main burden has fallen of carrying out the national policy of the people of Ireland, at present, that is to say, giving effect to the Treaty of last December.  In proposing him for the Presidentship we speak of the Members of this Assembly in general.  While we are undoubtedly placing him in the highest position which it is possible to occupy in the civil life of Ireland, we are, at the same time, imposing on him the heaviest burden that it is possible to impose on any person in the civil life of Ireland at the present, and we cannot conceal it from ourselves.  My view of the Irish Government, under present conditions, or under any future conditions, is that no matter what its condition may be, when it becomes the Irish Government it is not the Government of a party, it is the Government of the nation; it is responsible to all sections of the nation, and that every party, every section, has an equal right to exercise its influence, its controlling influence, its, criticising influence upon the Government; and that, at the same time, the Government, when it is doing what is necessary under the circumstances for the good of the nation, is entitled to the co-operation and to the support of all parties without distinction. We know there can be no mystery about it how Mr. Cosgrave comes to be proposed to you.  Upon him naturally, in <Col N="20" /> the course of events, devolved the responsibility of taking up the burden of being Chairman of a Government after the blank created by the death of Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins; and that being so, his name naturally comes before you at this juncture as the right and proper person to be elected to the Presidency of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I take it that the promise you gave to the Deputy and the introductory speech of the mover of the resolution indicates that this is the occasion to make some reference to public policy and even to a declaration of policy on the part of those who occupy the Ministerial benches, and who are expected to occupy the Ministerial benches in future.  Alderman Cosgrave is being proposed for a very onerous office indeed &mdash;perhaps the most onerous that any man in Ireland's history ever occupied. He assured us a few moments ago that he was not a child in those matter; that we need not make suggestions, because they were not children.  I didn't think he quite meant that, but I could not help but think that it was obvious that he, with his experience, was not responsible for the rules, procedure, and general conduct of affairs of the last Dáil, because of the fact that he is fully conversant and well experienced in all matters of this kind.  Your own assurance covers the position.  I am quite sure that Mr. Cosgrave did not suggest that any member of the Dáil was not entitled to make proposals with regard to the due order of the business of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, though, everybody is looking for a statement, not upon these somewhat trivial matters&mdash;we speak proportionately &mdash;but upon the general issues that are facing the country to-day.  We on these Benches look upon ourselves rather as the inheritors of a situation&mdash;a constitutional position, if you like&mdash;that has been handed down to us and the country, to <Col N="21" /> us, at any rate, by the other people who had the confidence of the country in the past; and, as we have stated m another place, we accept the verdict of the country. We take it that the party that had command of affairs, that was given a free hand, pretty well, in the conduct of affairs, did their utmost, and got the most out of the situation, and that their judgment has been accepted by the people.  We feel ourselves not responsible for the present situation, but prepared to acknowledge that our predecessors did their best and, rightly or wrongly, they have handed to this Assembly&mdash;to this political generation&mdash;a heritage which we have to make the most of.  But since the last meeting of the Dáil, very many terrible events have happened.  My memory tells me that there was a decision to refer certain vexed questions to a conference.  Conferences were held between Ministerial Members and active Opposition Members, and between Army leaders on the one side and Army leaders on the other side, and it might have been presumed the result of these conferences would have been given to the Dáil before any action was taken by the Government of the day.  Up to this the public does not know what the result of these conferences, which they were charged with undertaking by the Dáil, was except the eventuality of civil war.  We do not know why they failed, or on whom the responsibility for the failure lies.  All we know is that within a very few days after the Conferences were held, within a very few days after Members of one party were in fraternal relations with members of the other party&mdash;the guns began to speak&mdash;three days before the date fixed for the meeting of the new Dáil. We are not going, as far as this group is concerned, to be captious critics of the Government.  We intend to make what we can of this Assembly as an Assembly which will do the business of the country in the best interests of the country.  (Hear, hear.) But when the seconder of the resolution says the duty of the country is to support the Government, when the Government is doing what is necessary in the best interests of the country, he does not indicate who are the best judges of what is necessary.  For a very long time the Government has been allowed to be the judges of what is necessary.  I hope the Government will be allowed to do many things.  They will have to be allowed to do many things in the interim <Col N="22" /> between one meeting and another&mdash; between one portion of a session and an other.  They will have the responsibility of carrying out the Decrees and the Acts of the Dáil.  But I hope it will be understood for the future that the Dáil is the master of the Government.  Hitherto, I think, and perhaps necessarily so, in the circumstances of the past few years&mdash;I am not going to stress the criticism too strongly&mdash;perhaps it was necessary in a revolutionary period that the Government should take on itself responsibilities and not be accountable at that period to any Assembly for their acts.  But when that particular portion of the revolutionary period has elapsed it is necessary for an account to be given to the people, and some responsibility taken by the people and the people's representatives for the acts of the Government.  I think it is not enough for the proposal to go before the Chamber.  It is hardly enough for the motion to go for the election of the President of the Dáil and then the nomination, presumably by the President, of the Ministry, without knowing something about the mitentions in regard to the future as well as some account of the proceedings in the past.  It seems to me it will not be unreasonable, and it will not interfere with the business of the State, if we have a discussion on this question of policies, past or future, taking place before any vote is taken upon this question.  We would like to know officially and authoritatively what the intentions of the Government are in regard to the discussions on the Constitution. We would like to know what the views of the Government are in regard to the powers and authority of this Assembly. We would like to know from the Ministerial benches what their intentions are in regard to the conduct of war-like operations in the country.  Are we to assume that the Propaganda Department is speaking officially and with authority when it utters the Die-hard pronouncements which remind one more of the <i>Morning Post</i> or of Sir Hamar Greenwood in the pre-Truce days than of an Irish Ministry.  We would like to know whether these pronouncements, coming from the Publicity Department presumably&mdash;certainly from the Propaganda Department of the Party which is acknowledging the Ministry&mdash;are official pronouncements or whether they really embody the considered intentions of the Ministry.  We read phrases, which to <Col N="23" /> those who have experience of the North of Ireland are very reminiscent of July 12th orations in the North&mdash;&ldquo;dying in the last ditch,&rdquo;&ldquo;No surrender,&rdquo;&ldquo;No peace until the last gun and the last cartridge have been surrendered.&rdquo; We know if we are willing to face realities that that kind of proposal is not going to be given effect to.  We may pretend that there is the intention, but let us face realities; we know that we are not going to be able to disarm these people.  If we are willing to face the fact no one will deny, least of all those who took part in the active operations of the last four years, that that is the situation.  Is there no way in which a word can be uttered from the Ministerial benches which will give some kind of a hope to the country that something less than grinding in the dust is going to satisfy the Powers that be and the Powers that hope to be ?  We have taken the view that the situation that faces the country arises from a different interpretation of the promises, the undertakings, the pledges, that men gave, and of the temperaments of those men.  Those who had the privilege of attending the meetings of the Dáil during the Treaty debates know that the great majority of those who voted for the Treaty, the great majority of the positive and active minds of the country who had helped in the agitation that resulted in the Treaty, accepted the Treaty, not as a satisfaction of their claims for National Independence, but as the best that could be obtained as a result of that particular effort, as something that was being accepted by the people under protest; as something short of their legitimate demand&mdash; that it was the best that could be obtained at that time.  I wonder whether it is possible to extract from the Ministerial benches the confirmation of that view of the intention of the Majority Party?  No one who claims the right of Self-determination will assert that that has been conceded in the Treaty, and I am throwing out the suggestion that a way may be found&mdash; I do it entirely on my own responsibility-to peace in this country, if this threat of war to the last cartridge is not going to be undertaken and that the country accepts the present situation as something very definitely short of its rightful demands.  I say that undoubtedly represents the minds <Col N="24" /> of the masses of the people.  I believe if we are going to be Masters in this Country, if we are going to be Masters of the future destinies of this Country, that we are to have actively in support of these Institutions the minds of the real democracy who are prepared to stand by the ideals of liberty and in the past also stood by those ideals.  We might also like to have an expression of opinion from the Ministry as to whether they have given encouragement to the suggestions that are very rife, that the powers of Government should be entrusted in some degree, to new people, meaning, of course, old people; to a new set of Governors, meaning, of course, old Governors.  We would like to know whether it is in the mind of the Ministry that we are going to revert to the position of having a new name with the old bodies with all the implications, social, commercial and industrial that that connotes?  Are we going to stand on the protestations or professions of the past few years that the new Ireland would be a bigger Ireland and that democracy would not be merely a political democracy, but have some relation to the social combinations, the social authorities, the social relations generally of man and man?  We all hoped that the new Ireland would mean a country in which the cash relations would be minimised, and human, relations magnified-that the motto would be service and co-operation rather than the commercial ideals that have made England great.  We would like to have assurances on these points.  We on these benches would perhaps welcome more than anything else a reassertion from this Dáil of the implication and intentions of the democratic programme of Dáil Eireann.  I would ask that the discussion might continue to an extent that we might get an authoritative expression from the Ministry as to their attitude to the future of these questions, and perhaps, most of all, the great question that is affecting those for whoin we are closely in contact and for whom we are specially speaking.  We know when we are speaking of unemployment, we will be told that the political and military situation is responsible, and we have no answer to that to a great extent; but this problem of unemployment that faces numbers of the people is a problem that existed before the outbreak of the present trouble.  The present Ministry and <Col N="25" /> the previous Ministry have known of the problem and presumably have been considering remedies that they would like to apply.  We would like to have some indication of what their views are on that question, because we are coming to a winter which will probably be the most severe winter&mdash;quite apart from the military situation&mdash;of any winter we have passed through for quite a long, long time. We are not going to get through this winter without considerable commotion, if I can read the signs of the times aright&mdash;quite apart from the military situation&mdash;unless the Ministry is going to lead the country and say what was promised definitely in the democratic programme of Dáil Eireann, that anyone willing to work was to be assured of an opportunity of working.  Can we have an assurance from the Ministry that that is their policy, that that is their intention? If we can the way may be eased. We may possibly find many ways of collaborating and assisting.  If I might say so, coming back to the War problem, that problem, too, will be greatly eased indeed, but for this menace of unemployment and the danger that men would be brought out of the fighting areas to starve on the streets, on the roads and countrysides.  We would like a declaration of policy on these matters, and I think you and the Dáil generally are willing to allow the discussion to proceed for some time before a vote is taken, as it might facilitate the business of the Dáil.</P>

Of course it will be in the memory of some people that this agreement was entered into, and as one of the persons present and a party to that agreement I would like to know what has become of that pact, who has broken it?  If it is this side then I could not take any part in the election of President.  I would also wish to know if the Ministry that is being appointed, whether it is to be a Coalition Ministry, and if not, why not?  I notice a gentleman in the Ministry smiling, but this is a very serious matter to me.  This was a matter of public faith, an agreement publicly entered into before the Nation. It is a very serious matter and I assure all present that the Nation is looking on, <Col N="26" /> some people seem to think they are not. I would like the President elected to refer to this matter as it is a question I want to be enlightened on myself.

      <P>Before the motion is put I suggest that the questions that Deputy Johnson has asked here should be answered.  I think all the questions he has asked are of the greatest moment, and require an answer.  The question of unemployment has been touched upon.  It is perfectly clear to me that what is called military warfare is to an extent the result of a large amount of unemployment in the country. I see no programme before the Dáil for dealing with this, and I think the President should give us a statement of his policy before elected.  I think that is the point Deputy Johnson wants to make, and I emphasise it strongly.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has said that some of the questions are rather premature and deal with matters some distance ahead.  I think some of us hope that some of the questions raised will be dealt with a little ahead.  That one, for instance, dealing with the Constitution.  There are far more urgent and important questions before the country at present than even the Constitution.  We  must have answers to certain of the questions before the election because the President will nominate the Ministers who form the Executive, and how could anybody vote for a President or members of Executive before that President had declared the policy his Ministers would pursue ?  There has been a certain amount of propaganda, and that propaganda has been contributed to by members of this Dáil, to the effect that the business of this Dáil is, to some extent, to be confined to dealing with certain documents, and not to dealing with the big life and death issues before the country at the present moment.  In my opinion, the first thing the Dáil should address itself to is the question of civil war.  Hundreds and thousands of people up and down the country are faced with starvation.  And there are other questions.  For instance, we want to get a definite answer from the Deputy nominated as President of the new Executive now about coming into power whether they are going to conduct war or police operations.  If they are going to conduct war, we all know where we are.  We know that war measures and finance will be called for, and that all the restrictions that accompany war will be called for.  If this is to be a police operation, if we are going to have Constitutionalism, let us have a police operation, and not an operation which nobody can say is either a war or a police measure.  There are hundreds, <Col N="28" /> perhaps thousands, of non-combatants, civilians, who are in jails and in barracks, who have been arrested without authority, without any investigation or trial or intention of trial, or anything like that.  Some of us, as far back as April, had occasion to go to heads of the last Executive to put a number of questions to them.  One question we had to put at the time was whether there was a code of Army regulations which would govern the discipline of the Army.  We were told then that there was no such code of regulations.  Regulations between the civilian population and the Army should be defined, so that soldiers and officers should know their places and duties, and the civilians know their places and duties.  These are questions requiring definition.  You are getting from day to day into a state of chaos.  You have been getting into that condition for the last few months.  Largely the reason is that no one has sat down and thought these things out and the proper way to deal with them.  It is for the President and Executive to deal with those questions. The Executive has the power of life and death over the whole population of Ireland. We must know, therefore, what is the policy of that Executive on these questions; otherwise, of course, we will be only getting into greater chaos.  We want to know the relations between the Army and the Government.  We do not know what are the relations between the new Executive and the Army, or whether the Army forces in the country are going to be responsible to this Dáil or not. These are the questions we want a reply to from the Executive.  Another thing I want to stress which has been raised by Deputy Johnson, and it was hinted at elsewhere by a Teachta who is an old and respected worker in the National movement for many years, though we differ now, and that is that there is a certain minimising of the power and authority of this Dáil. We do not want to indulge in captious criticism, but there are statements being made that this Dáil will not have anything like extended powers of legislation; that it will be only to a certain extent a Constituent Assembly.  Our view is that it has very considerable powers of legislation, and we want to know if that is the conception which the Executive has about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say I stand absolutely in support of everything necessary to maintain the Government in office until it carries through its work, but I do not think that appointments which may lead to inefficiency are likely to sustain them in office.  I may say that I am not making any adverse criticism of the Minister suggested-I think he has done excellent work, but I do think it is bad business from the point of view of the State to merge these two great offices under one head.  These in normal times are of vital importance in the national life.  Each of them would require the full time and attention of a very able head.  Now, we must face facts. One of the facts we have to face to-day is that our new administrators are, at the best, not much better than raw amateurs.  I say that without meaning any disrespect, for, I think, as amateurs they have achieved great work for the nation; but, my judgement, it would require a superman to give the attention necessary to both these Departments at the present time.  Now, Mr. McGrath has given evidence of great ability, but he certainly is not a superman.  My opinion is this, that if you merge two large and important Departments such as these under one head it is going to lead to Departmental inefficiency and Departmental confusion. The Heads of the Departments will not be able to do that which in my judgment is essential for the service of the nation at the present time.  It is something more than merely taking over control of a Department&mdash;something more than acting as the nominal Head of a Department.  They have to grasp every detail of the administration of the Department and import into these Departments the force and the influence of their own personalities.  I say one of these Departments is enough for men who are new to administration to discharge efficiently, and I say that the merging of two of these great Departments under one head is not giving the head of those Departments a fair chance, and the result will be you will be unable to cope with the control and development of those Departments, and the Civil Servants taken over under the old regime will take control and run these Departments. It is not fair to the Ministry, <Col N="33" /> and it is a false step on the part of the Government, and they should seriously consider whether or not a revision of these two Departments should be made, and the Departments severed&mdash;or at least placed under separate heads&mdash;in order to secure that the vital life of the nation shall get due service.  Remember after all that the people at the head of these Departments have no particular need to worry about the police measures that are being engaged in to quell the disturbances in the country.  There is no reason why the formulating of an economic social policy should be held up until the end of these disturbances.  I think those in charge of these great Departments of national life, if their work is held up for the time being, they should be thinking out and planning and arranging the basis of a policy of economic progress that will come into operation when these disturbances have ceased.  If you place a man at the head of two large Departments, you will be unable to develop such a policy of social and economic progress. I want to make my position, perfectly clear.  I am saying this now in a spirit of help and not in a spirit of acrimonious criticism.  If the two Departments had been severed I should not have said a word, but I think it is a fatal blunder to have them merged.  I think it is right, especially, that members of this Dáil should speak their minds, and those who support the Government should tell the Government when they believe that something is being done that is not the best thing.  I do not want to press this to a division, but I do want to urge on the Government, and on the Ministry, and on the President, to consider this matter seriously. The Ministry of Trade and Commerce and the Ministry of Labour are two of the most vital Departments of the nation's life.  Upon the efficient administration of these two Departments the progress and social stability of the nation's immediate Future are going to depend.  They are the two Departments of the nation which require efficient service and clear sound brainwork.  The merging of them is creating a situation where it is almost impossible to secure that efficient service to the nation.  Therefore I want to ventilate this criticism of mine upon that point.</P>

      <P>Mr. Chairman, at the recent election, one of the things upon which insistent emphasis was laid was the need of a strong Government; and in the interval since the election we have lost, according to speakers to-day, two of the most important Members of the Government that existed heretofore.  Now are we to understand that the method of giving, the country a strong Government is to diminish the Ministries?  There are in the proposal just made by the President of An Dáil two things, one a proposal, a very serious one, to abolish a Ministry by coalescence with another.  That is conjoined with the proposition that one individual do fill the two.  I would like to suggest as a matter of procedure that we be allowed to debate the first.  I agree absolutely with Deputy Milroy that there are no more important Departments, except perhaps Education, than the Department of Labour and the Department of Trade.  It seems to me, with all respect to the President, that rather we should prefer to multiply than to unify Ministries.  The Cabinet must not be sectional.  We are here representing not sections but the entire people.  We profess that we are the expression of the people's will as registered in the recent elections.  It seems to me that a strong Government could be better secured if, instead of reducing the Ministries, the number should be fixed so as to include the best ability of the country.  At the present moment the country is passing through a very dangerous strait; it needs all the help and all the guidance and all the loyal support it can receive from every section of the community; and it is putting an undue strain on the loyalty of those who <Col N="35" /> were not Members of the last Dáil, to expect them fully to acquiesce in arrangements of the reasons for which they have, absolutely, no knowledge.  I for one think it necessary, as Deputy Milroy has done, to express the criticism which occurs to me as a criticism necessary at this juncture, without in any way intending to hamper the work of the Government.  As regards affairs which it is imperatively necessary to carry through with urgency and o despatch there is nothing so necessary, at the present moment, as attention to all that complex of problems which are usually termed Labour problems.  Unless we can secure that there is a Department devoting concentrated energy and the highest ability to these questions, there is danger that we simply drift into a war policy, leaving everything else lagging behind.  I would like the President, therefore, to give us an opportunity of debating his proposal to merge those Ministries rather than to tempt us to adopt this thing through any unwillingness to vote against his nominee.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say just a few words on this subject. I have been Minister for Economic Affairs of the Provisional Government.  The name is, perhaps, somewhat grandiose. The Provisional Government did not select it originally, but it was selected by the ex-President of Dáil Eireann, and the idea was that, in forming a small War Cabinet, a post should be found for Mr. Barton, who at that time was lately released from Portland.  Mr. Barton spoke for the Departments of Trade, Commerce, Agriculture, and Labour. The heads of those Departments were excluded from the inner Cabinet.  Now there is talk here of cutting down Ministries. In fact, there was a Ministry of Trade and Commerce of Dáil Eireann, and there was this Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Provisional Government, to which to a large extent it was an amplification.  That was due to the peculiar position at the time, and the dual control which a great many people, including ourselves, found awkward.  It has been said that there was enough work for a separate Labour Ministry.  It was strange that this very proposal came up at about the same time from the experts of the Labour Department and the <Col N="36" /> Ministry of Economics without any consultation between the two, because there was overlapping.  It was impossible to take an all-round view of the conditions of the country without coming up against the wages question and other important problems, and it will be admitted that there is a very real and close connection between the development of industry and unemployment.  The Labour Department should not be a mere strike-settling department.  It should not be <i>a question of dealing out doles.</i>   It should be a question, of seeing to the two needs&mdash;the need of providing work for the unemployed and the need for developing to the full all the resources of the country. It is in that spirit that the change wae made.  The view is that one big economic department corresponding to the British Board of Trade is the ideal way of facing the social problems that confront us&mdash;the problem of unemployment and the problem also of developing the resources of the country.  I believe that one able man with such ability as Mr. McGrath had shown will be very well able to run that Department, and that those proposals, so far from making for looseness or inefficiency, will secure that the best possible attention will be devoted to these questions.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up the attitude of the bull in the china shop, but I must say I do believe in taking up a position of independent criticism in regard to these things.  I think this is one of the most important appointments at the present time, for this reason, we are fighting a War in Ireland which is caused by the defiance by a Military minority of the Civil Majority of the Nation.  The one principle that we are forced at the moment to give attention in Ireland to, is the great principle that the civil authority must be superior to military forces of any kind, whether military forces on our own side that we have to use through our Army, or any movement, revolution, or social disturbance, attempted by military forces within the Nation.  Here we have a proposal to have the one man in control of both the Army and of the civil measures <Col N="38" /> that have to be taken.  The administration of the Army involves an enormous amount of routine work that results from the present state of things in the country. I do not believe any man at the present time can do all these things as efficiently by holding two or more positions as if he only held one.  I believe, first of all, that the Minister for Defence should be a civilian, in this sense at least, that he should not hold at the same time an Army appointment.  I think that each of the positions held by Mr. Mulcahy should be held by different men.  I think in that way we would certainly get best results for the country, both on the military and administrative side.  It must-be evident to the Dáil that an enormous amount of work at the present time and for months to come, in connection with administration alone, having regard to the changes from day to day and the unforeseen changes that have to be made, in the routine work of an ordinary department and especially in this department at the present time calls on the time and energy of the man conducting and responsible for the department, making it absolutely impossible for him to devote his whole time to the administration of that department.  The same thing applies to the military side.  Surely it Is necessary for the Commander-in-Chief to devote his whole time to the military side so that the operations may conclude as soon as possible by the military side being successfully earned on with tremendous energy and concentration.  From this point of view it seems to me desirable that the appointment as suggested should be reconsidered, and I hope it will be reconsidered. There has been a considerable amount of change enforced, of course, within the past few months.  I can hardly think of a post that has not been occupied by one or other Member of the Government, both civil and military.  I only want to say, although these appointments may stand, and receive the approval of the Dáil, I certainly reserve the right of independent criticism for everything done in that way, and should not certainly consider I was justified in acting in any other way on behalf of the people I have the honour to represent.  Apart from that, no matter how important these Ministries may be or the issues arising in connection with them, I hope that the main business before the Dáil, <i>i.e.,</i> to wind up in a satisfactory manner the <Col N="39" /> relations between Ireland and England, to carry the stages of the Treaty through and get the Constitution going, so that we can after that devote our whole attention to the working of the country&mdash;will be attended to.  Until that time comes I shall certainly give every possible, support in every way to sustain the Government in its decision to complete that work, meanwhile criticising as may seem best.</P>

That the Commander-in-Chief should also be Minister for Defence reminds one too much of General Kitchener and of certain other commanders of armies in other countries, which leads, possibly not in all circumstances, to a dictatorship. I think there is not much reason to think that, in the present circumstances and the present personnel, but it is not a good principle to adopt at the beginning. The Minister for Defence should be Minister for Defence.  The policy to which I object is one that we should not begin now.  But there is another aspect of this appointment that I think we should have some information upon.  And that is, what force is responsible for the keeping of order, and to whom they are responsible. We are quite in the dark, I think, as to the relations of such police as there are in the country and the Minister for Defence.  Is it contemplated that the Civic Guard which is in course of formation&mdash; perhaps in some small degree in active operation&mdash;is that body responsible to the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Minister for Defence?  And is the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Home Affairs the power to order them?  Is it a civilian force or is it a military force?  These are questions that ought to be answered, and it is one added reason why, in our view, the Minister for Defence ought to be a civilian and not a military man.  Or, if we claim that a military man in this <Col N="40" /> case is a civilian his duties should not be Commander-in-Chief while he is Minister for Defence.  It would facilitate matters and save discussion at another time if we had an explanation as to the relation between the Civil Police and the Military forces, and whether they are responsible to the Minister for Home Affairs or to the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>Another important matter which I should wish to draw attention to, is this&mdash;As I came into this building, a friend of mine stepped out into the road and handed me an important sheet of paper.  It was propaganda conducted by the Irregular forces, who are producing disorder in the country.  I read this document, and found a paragraph in it which referred to a body &ldquo;calling itself the Provisional Government,&rdquo; and then it adds in a bracket &ldquo;really a Military Junta.&rdquo; Now, I am convinced that the Executive which this legislative sets up is not a military junta, and that it will not assume any of the powers of a &ldquo;military junta.&rdquo; And I hope I am equally confident in saying that it will not want to do so.  But it is important that the criticism of this kind made by those who are acting criminally in the country should not be supported by action taken here or taken or permitted to be taken by this Government.  And if you have a Ministry so formed that the Minister for Defence is at one and the same time Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the Field, I certainly believe that you are presenting people who at the present moment are acting illegally with an argument which they should not be presented with.  The principle should not be permitted in any country in the world where the Commander-in-Chief in the Field should speak in the Legislature, and thereupon become head of a civil department.  If he is asked a question here, in which capacity will he reply?  He will reply, of course, as Minister for Defence, but it will never be forgotten that at that moment he is Commander-in-Chief as well.  So long as the state of the country continues this question will have to be met frequently during the next three or four weeks, and these questions will arise whenever this Dáil meets, and I am perfectly sure that he will be too fully detained with his work as Commander-in-Chief to give this Dáil the time to answer for his work <Col N="41" /> in the field to the Civil Legislature. Therefore, I urge the President to see that whoever is Commander-in-Chief should not be also Minister for Defence, and whoever is Minister for Defence should not be Commander-in-Chief&mdash;that these two should be kept separate.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Under ordinary circumstances there might be some ground for criticism of one person holding these two appointments.  But at the present time, and under the present circumstances, it is obvious that the gentleman put forward is the person for both appointments.  He has been identified with the Army for many years, and his long and successful Army record has not deprived him of being able to give the Government very valuable assistance in Council.  The mere fact of his duties occupying his time to such an extent as to exclude him from perhaps being present in the Dáil during the time it would be sitting, to answer questions in connection with the War, would not, in my opinion, be sufficient justification for nominating to this Chamber another person.  Those of us who have been in the Civil Government only and have no connection with the Army know and appreciate fully the value of the counsel and usefulness of the attendance of the Minister for Defence at our meetings.  Those in the Army also appreciate his value, and the public outside appreciate his value both as Minister for Defence and Commander-in-Chief, and as I have already said, the two positions, although under other circumstances they might possibly be held by different persons, I think it is rather a matter for satisfaction that this Chamber has in the person of General Mulcahy a person able and competent to fill both positions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making a short statement in order that the Dáil may be placed in possession of the situation at the moment.  I do not suppose you will expect me at this stage, in the midst of negotiations, to go back on any of the facts of the past.  It would be well that the steps that have been taken this morning should be intimated to the Dáil.  At the instigation of the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Douglas, both parties to the dispute, the Department, and with the Department certain representatives of the Government on the one hand and the employees on the other, were brought together this morning, and all matters in dispute were pretty fully gone into, and this is the result.  I will read a brief statement: &ldquo;The Conference arranged by the Chairman of the Commission between representatives of the Government and representatives of the principal Postal Unions, took place this morning ai the Government Buildings.  After discussion, the representatives of the Government made the following proposal to the representatives of the Unions: &lsquo;The Government adheres to their position that the reductions in wages must take place, but they are willing to spread the reductions in instalments over a period of three months, the precise amount of the instalments to be settled in negotiation.&rsquo; The Government further made a definite offer to carry out one-half of the total reduction now, and one-half on the 1st December.  Neither the general proposal <Col N="44" /> of the Government nor the definite offer of instalments was accepted by the Union representatives.&rdquo; There is the position at the moment.  I may say that because of the fact of the Conference sitting simultaneously with this Parliament, I have not had an opportunity of consulting my colleagues, in relation to this offer; but I think I can state in advance, on their behalf, that they are prepared to consider, and I expect sanction, the advances I have offered to the Union representatives.  This particular offer was made on the distinct understanding, of course, that a strike would not materialise; but I may suggest to the Government, and through the Government to the Dáil, that is an unfortunate event I do not wish at this stage to foreshadow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOS. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position that faces us is a very serious one.  I take it the Dáil and the country will indicate one way or another who is responsible for the situation that may develop.  We know that in March (I think it was) a certain state of affairs arose over the proposed reduction of a Bonus, and there was then a threat of a strike.  Certain incidents took place which led to a considerable amount of ill-will, friction, and antagonism between the parties responsible and the men concerned.  I do not think I am stressing it when I say that despite all Mr. Walsh's experience in that particular service, this experience has not been sufficiently influential to overcome the disadvantages of Mr. <Col N="45" /> Walsh's temperament, and even since that time one can gather there has been a continuous friction between the Staff and the Postmaster-General, and, one would almost think, a feeling of resentment, that the time was not availed of to allow the country to be deprived of its Postal Services in March last, and that there was ill-feeling, because of that, lying at the back of the Postmaster-General's brain.  The opportunity arose apparently upon the publication of the report of a Commission of Inquiry into certain price increases.  The publication of a certain figure was made&mdash;the figure arrived at by a Committee constituted by two or three separate Governmental Departments. The publication of that figure was accompanied by a series of tables&mdash; a mass of facts or statistics privately circulated, and only published publicly within the last couple of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of that figure by members of these staffs, the Postmaster-General published a statement to the effect that the issue of this figure would warrant him in cutting off the advance which had been granted by virtue of the Commission's Interim Report, and in addition to that a proportion of the bonus, according to the old arrangement with Civil Servants. The very method of presenting the ultimatum to a body of men was sufficient to rouse their antagonism.  Let it be borne in mind that the Postal Servants had desired that the work of this Commission should be finished by the 1st of September.  It is not their fault that the Commission's work was not finished by that date.  It was by the wish of the P.M.G. that the work of the Commission was deferred.  When a figure arrived at by Departmental officials was issued, the P.M.G. takes the opportunity of lunging in and saying, &ldquo;Here is what you have to take by the 1st September, or clear out,&rdquo; because that is what is meant. In this, as in so many things, there seems to me a lack of appreciation of the mentality of men and women.  For two or three generations, at least for 120 years; every popular newspaper in this country, every popular politician, every agitator, fed the people with the notion that Government statisticians are against the people and are producing figures to down the people, to get advantage of the people.  We have been told from the beginning of things almost that a Government Department is anti-popular and that the officials of <Col N="46" /> that Department are working against the interests of the people.  Now that is a tradition, and in face of these facts we have this procedure adopted by the Government.  They admit that it is desirable to take out a figure which will represent the increase in the cost of living as between July 1914, and to-day. How do they do it?  They select three or four departmental officials, and when it is represented to them that it would be desirable, in the interests of confidence in the result of the inquiry, that the people who are likely to be affected should have a voice in saying how the enquiry should be conducted&mdash;what was the method adopted so that there should be some confidence in the method of enquiry?  We were told cavalierly &ldquo;You will be told how it is to be done when the result is reached&rdquo;&mdash;exactly a replica of all the things that have been done in the past and that have been so strenuously objected to.  Now the result of the enquiry is published, and I challenge any member of this Dáil to go home to his wife or his sister, or his housekeeper, and present those figures and ask her from her practical experience whether they are true or not.  I am not now criticising the method of the enquiry, or even the result of the enquiry, but I am drawing attention to the method of the presentation of this figure and the evidence that was adduced in support of the figure, and the effect on the popular mind of the reading of that explanation. If you test it in the way I have suggested, you will then begin to understand how the production of such a figure has affected the Postal Servants and how it will affect the rest of the public who will be concerned. Immediately on presentation of the result of the enquiry there was an assertion that on and after a certain date there would be a decrease in wages which would wipe out all the advances that were obtained as a result of the Postal Commission plus certain other payments in respect of bonus.  I submit that, on that alone, without any question of the method, the wisdom or the justice of the case, the conduct of the P.M.G. in this matter has proved him unworthy of the position. There is something in handling a man, and if a man is not fitted for handling men, it is not desirable that he should be put into a position of creating a disruption in a public Service.  The claim of the Postal servants is a valid one. <Col N="47" /> They contend what is to be considered in this matter is not whether the Postal Service is paying, not what people in England are willing to live upon&mdash;or starve upon&mdash;or grow luxurious upon&mdash; but what is a reasonable standard of life in Ireland for a man in the Postal Service, and what it costs to produce that standard. There is no attempt to find out by departmental enquiry what such a cost is, and there is a good deal of misconception about this particular report that was issued, but that is the fault of the people who issued it and the method of presentation. The whole question will probably arise in another form, but I am now indicting&mdash;if I may use such a word&mdash; the P.M.G. for his conduct of these negotiations, and I say, on this particular motion, that they unfit him for the position that is now proposed to be allotted to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan):</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson made a number of general charges against the P.M.G., but you will notice that he did not make one single specific charge&mdash; not one.

      <P>And as against that may I point out that while he indulged in a number of generalities, he never gave a single specific instance of either discourtesy or incompetence against the P.M.G.  It is no harm that the Dáil should know just a few facts about this particular dispute.  I will not go into it at any great length.  I would like just vo say a few things which would perhaps make the issues a little clearer than they are at present.  This cost of living figure was attacked.  It was stated it was found by a Departmental Committee. So it was, but the cost of living figure in England&mdash;the cost of living figure that operated here for years&mdash;was found by a Departmental Committee, and there was not a single attack on it, from that point of view, not a protest.  It is only when an Irish Departmental Committee finds the figure that attacks are made.  That <Col N="48" /> is rather peculiar.  If I may say it without any disrespect, it is a little like the slave-mind. An Irish Department is as well able to find the figure as an English Department, and if an English Department was entitled to find the cost of living figure an Irish Department is entitled to find it in exactly the same way.  Now criticisms of this figure which come on the merits of the case are welcomed, welcomed by the Department that found it.  They will consider any criticisms; they will receive any evidence which shows that the figures are wrong.  We have not got any.  Again, Mr. Johnson was not specific on that point.  He said generally that the method was all right, but he suggested generally, at the same time, that there was something wrong in the whole thing.  Any specific mistake, any evidence that anyone likes to bring forward is welcome and will get due weight by the Ministry of Economics that found the figure.  That figure was found, and it was found at 90; the English figure is 85.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Dáil should go into a discussion of this figure.  What is under discussion is the nomination of Deputy J. J. Walsh for the position of P.M.G.  As I understood Deputy Johnson's remarks, they were directed towards the temperamental unfitness of Mr. J. J. Walsh for his position Whether the House can discuss or cannot discuss Mr. J. J. Walsh's temperament I am not quite clear, but I do not want the House now to begin a discussion on this question, because if a Minister or any Deputy begins it now we may have appeals to continue it, and we cannot discuss the cost of living figure in any reasonable time this afternoon with regard to our general position.  I think, therefore, there should be a discussion on the fitness or unfitness of Mr. J. J. Walsh for the specific position. When people begin to talk about 85 or 90 we are lost.  I therefore suggest that the discussion should not go on, on the lines that the Minister is now following.</P>

      <P>I quite agree, but this is not the proper time to discuss the details of this dispute.  I would only say this: In this dispute the Government applied the figure found by the Irish Department.  In order to give the Postal Officials every chance to meet the cost entailed they agreed to spread it over a certain period, which is a concession the English Government did not make.  It is a concession that is not made in the North of Ireland, and I think it puts the P.M.G. absolutely right in this dispute.</P>

As a result of the dispute which arose last March a Commission was appointed and that Commission issued an interim report about the 15th May, and they recommended that certain temporary increases to the Postal Staff should operate until the Irish cost of living was agreed upon, or until an official report of the Commission was issued.

      <P>I have now to put before you two Ministers who will not have portfolios&mdash;Mr. Duggan and Mr. Finian Lynch.  It may be necessary to associate Deputy Lynch to some extent with the Ministry of Education.  Under what we will call for the moment the old law&mdash;Dáil Eireann and the Provisional Government&mdash;there were two separate Ministers for Education.  We are now doing away with all this.  Mr. Lynch just now is not available for immdiate service in the Government.  He is on active service.  He was a member of the Provisional Government, and Mr. Duggan, who was the last signatory to the Treaty, was the same.  There was a considerable amount of work that required to be done outside the Ministers with portfolios.  I ask the Dáil for approval of these two nominations.</P>

      <P>I want to protest against this.  To start at this early stage of a young National assembly by making appointments which have been generally questioned by old assemblies&mdash;the appointment of Ministers without portfolios who will not be responsible to the Dáil I think is a bad procedure and one which we should not support.  I am not saying anything against Deputies Duggan and Lynch, who have held office before and have acquitted themselves honourably.  If they had been proposed for definite offices, I would be <Col N="51" /> the last to oppose this proposition.  I think we should appoint Ministers to perform definite tasks for which they will be responsible to this Assembly.</P>

      <P>I associate myself with Deputy Darrell Figgis on this point.  I am strongly in favour of his views.  This is a strange, departure and it ought to be justified.  It looks as if we were to make the appointment first and discover the reasons afterwards.  It would be better if we were told of the special efficiency of these gentlemen, whereby one of them must be a General in the Field and at the same time a quasi-Minister for Education.  The Department of Education is quite safe in the hands of Professor MacNeill.  If help were needed it ought to be secured in a more regular way.  Is there a paucity of Deputies possessed of the experience and abilities deemed essential for such office?  I would expect Deputy O'Connell, who is associated with education, also to protest against a General who is commanding in the Field holding this office.  Efficiency, not persons, is our first concern.  In this Dáil we should be honest with each other, and I am determined to speak out upon matters upon which I think it my duty not to remain silent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who is familiar with the history of the last four or five months ought to be able to put his finger on the exact point we are discussing now.  Six or eight months ago the Provisional Government was formed of persons entitled to sit in the Southern Parliament.  Two of the gentlemen I have put before the Assembly constituted that Government.  There is no provision in the terms on which that appointment took place for either a dismissal or a resignation, and during the period which has elapsed since Ministers of the Provisional Government have had to make many journeys to England.  Is it reasonably possible to expect Ministers to carry out their duties in Dublin and at the same time be in negotiations in England?  One of these is the last signatory to the Treaty, and he has been on practically every delegation which has crossed to England.  If we did not consider, having regard to our experience in the last six months, that <Col N="52" /> these appointments are necessary we would not put them forward.  We put Mr. Lynch forward in the confident belief that his appointment is absolutely essential. I believe that those who criticised the appointments did so in good faith, but at the same time I am satisfied that no case has been made to impress the Dáil with the necessity for rejecting them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the reason given that it was impossible not to include these gentlemen?  I understand the reason given is that they were part of the Provisional Government, set up by the British Government by the transfer to it of Executive powers, and as there is no provision for removal, withdrawal, or resignation we must accept them.  If that is the answer I am prepared to submit to the inevitable, but if not, I consider the arrangement altogether unjustified.</P>

It is desirable that they give as much latitude as possible to Members in discussion and at the same time lend themselves to efficiency in the discharge of public business here.  It has not been possible in the hasty manner in which it has been done to approach those who might have been conversant with those who would be the best men to put on this Committee.  We have taken them at random, and if there is any question as to who, in the cause of his party, ought to be on the Committee, <Col N="53" /> the question could be raised by an individual member of his party.

The preparation of Standing Orders, and the Standing Orders Committee is one of the most important in any assembly. It prepares the business for the coming week, and if it is a small party, say the farmers, and they want to get something very important discussed during the coming week; if they want Friday they can do so by making representations to the Standing Orders Committee and have the matter discussed forthwith.  I think all the parties ought to have representation, and I ask the Dáil to support the amendment, and not let a motion go simply because it is carefully prepared and handed to a deputy who is asked to propose it, which shows that there was a meeting somewhere before this assembly to-day.</P>

If the Dáil so desired, it would be possible to meet on any particular day at 11 o'clock, but if the business is to be transacted properly it is necessary for Ministers to be in attendance to answer any questions that may be put to them, and they really cannot do anything unless they are able to give some time to their Departmental work.  The only way <Col N="58" /> we can carry on is to devote the forenoon to Departmental work and then come here in the afternoon.
