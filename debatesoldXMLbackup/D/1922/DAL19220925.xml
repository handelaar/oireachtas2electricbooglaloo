      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that a scheme for the building of 18 houses for ex-service men and their families, for Cobh district, Co. Cork, has already been decided upon, but for some reason or other is being delayed.  If he can explain the reason for such delay, and if he will now arrange with the Board of Works to have this work started immediately, the necessity for extra housing accommodation and relief of unemployment being keenly felt in the district?</P>

      <P>The number of cottages proposed to be erected under the Scheme referred to is 15, and not 18 as stated in the Question.  This Scheme was originally in process of making before the Custom House Fire in which all documents were destroyed; and the whole of the work under the Irish Land (Provision for Sailors and Soldiers) Act, 1919, had subsequently to be reconstructed, with inevitable delay.  During the reconstruction process the changes consequent upon the signing of the Treaty took place.  The work under the Act is carried out by the Sailors and Soldiers' Department, 30 Lr. Fitzwilliam Street, under the supervision of the British Treasury and with British Treasury funds.  Certain legal formalities consequent upon the change of Government in the country remain to be arranged for the delegation of authority for the signing of Orders making and confirming Schemes under the Act.  The <Col N="640" /> Ministry of Local Government and the British Treasury have been considering the matter and it is hoped that these legal formalities will be completed very shortly.  Until Schemes are made and confirmed, land is not legally acquired and the Board of Works cannot be instructed to enter on the land for the erection of the cottages.</P>

      <P>To ask the President whether he is aware that orders were issued to the Dublin newspapers that the evidence given at the Coroner's inquiry into the death of Patrick Mannion, at Mount Street, Dublin, on September 17th, should not be published?  Will he say by whose authority these orders were issued, and whether in view of the fact that the censorship is no longer in operation, he will say when the Press will be permitted to publish a full report of the inquest referred to?</P>

      <P>The censorship has not been abolished.  Papers may not publish matter which is against the public interest.  Any matter about which newspapers are doubtful may be submitted to the military censor.  One newspaper submitted a report of the proceedings of a Coroner's Inquiry into the Mannion <Col N="641" /> case, but as this report contained misleading statements which were not refuted at the inquiry owing to the fact that the military witnesses arrived only when the inquiry had closed, the Censor directed the Press to publish a summarised version until such time as the full facts could be published along with the misleading evidence at the inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first Article of the Draft Constitution is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann is a co-equal member of the Community of Nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I formally move that that Article stands part of the Bill I want to make a statement which will be as brief as is consistent with clearness.  There has been much said about this Treaty which was signed last December to the effect that there was duress.  Undoubtedly there was duress on the facts; undoubtedly the big stick was there.  The fact that war stood as an alternative is undeniable&mdash;the fact was that war was explicitly presented as an alternative to one of the signatories.  If that is so it does not alter the situation one way or another.  It was a question of comparison and undoubtedly in the face of the alternative, war, that Treaty was signed.  Now the position, as I see it, is that the Irish people regarded a certain state of facts with which they were confronted&mdash;a certain state of circumstances in which they found themselves &mdash;and, deliberately making their choice, as they were perfectly entitled to make their choice, they have taken this Treaty as the best thing they could take in the circumstances of <Col N="648" /> the time, and not believing very much in their prospects of getting better.  Now I hold&mdash;and I think in what I am going to say now I am expressing the mind of a great many people throughout the country&mdash;that in the case of a Treaty signed under circumstances and conditions like that, the position is simply that at any moment in the future the majority will of the Irish Nation can publicly and absolutely without dishonour repudiate that Treaty if they consider it wise to do so&mdash; if they consider it advisable to do so. If, weighing the pros and cons of the situation, they are prepared to take the consequences of doing so, therefore in our opinion at any rate, the majority will of this Nation is at all times sovereign.  It is sovereign now, it will be sovereign at all times in the future, and we do not deny and we do not limit that sovereignty. It is for that sovereignty we are fighting now, and as long as the Treaty is the policy of the Nation then the Treaty in all its bearings and implications must be the policy of the Nation and the Nation will stand honourably by that policy.  We will come later to clauses where this question arises, and we will have something to say with regard to these particular clauses.  Deputy Gavan Duffy, speaking here some time ago, said &ldquo;this is a contract,&rdquo; and he said it in a tone of exultation, with the suggestion that because it was a contract you could avail of any little loophole that you saw to evade the honourable implications of this Treaty&mdash;to evade the implications which, beyond all doubt, were present in the minds of the signatories at the moment when they became signatories.  Now, this Government will not dishonour the signature of Deputy Gavan Duffy, even at the invitation of Deputy Gavan Duffy, because when he signed the Treaty he signed it on behalf of the Irish nation.  That is the position as we see it.  I hope we have made it clear that if the Irish nation accepts this Treaty&mdash;if the majority of the nation accepts this Treaty&mdash;then it must accept it honourably, and the people must act up to it.  It is a political experiment. We do not propose to mould in cast iron our country's rights, or mould anything in cast iron.  We do not think that, in passing this Constitution, we are fixing the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of the Constitution of <Col N="649" /> the country.  Facing the facts as we know them to-day, I say that the Irish people have consented to accept this Treaty, and, until it is repudiated by the majority of the people, it stands, and must stand, as the national policy.  I have little to say about this first article. It is an agreed article arrived at after much discussion, and it is a fair statement of the Treaty position.  It recognises our nationhood&mdash;that nationhood, that sovereignty which is in fact claimed by the Dominions&mdash;and it places this country in the Commonwealth of Nations hitherto known as the British Empire, and as co-equal with Great Britain.  I formally move the inclusion in the Bill of the article.</P>

      <P>The Minister who has just sat down made some personal observations upon me which did not rise to the height of my contempt Certain Ministers seem to meet legitimate criticism by losing no opportunity of getting away from the subject and turning it into trivialities and personalities. Having said that much, I wish to move the first amendment on the paper:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Heading or Title, `Section 1, Fundamental Rights,' be transposed so as to appear after Article 1, and before Article 2.&rdquo;  I do not think that wants very much argument.  There are people in the country, as is known to us, who would say the first article ought to be &ldquo;Fundamental Wrong.&rdquo;  I, as one of those who accept the Treaty, do not say it should be so held, but when you are issuing a title like that you must be careful that the clauses that come under it be fundamental rights.  I think it will be generally agreed that &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo; is not a proper title under which to insert our connection with the British Commonwealth.  It is not a fundamental right, but an accident arising out of a contract we have made.  I should like to add that, while I agree with what was said by one of the Deputies the other day about the great need for care in our titles and the desirability of excising most of them, that where fundamental rights are declared in a title it should stand, but it seems quite clear to me that it is not a fundamental right that we should be a member of the Commonwealth of British Nations.</P>

I am struck by the importance of the suggestion put forward by Deputy Gavan Duffy.  The title &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo; should remain, whatever titles are eliminated, but there is a difficulty that occurs to me: if the title &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo; remain and subsequent titles are eliminated, the title &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo; would be construed then as being in respect of all the Articles, and that would lead to further confusion.</P>

      <P>In moving the adoption of this Amendment No. 2 I wish to draw attention to some things, and right at the beginning I would like to ask the Ministers, as these Amendments are being discussed, to please pay some attention to the criticism and the nature of the Amendments, and, in the interests of this Dáil, refrain from hurling anything which might make people outside think that the people here are not really concerned.  I should like that attention should be given to the Amendment, and that the replies and comments of the Ministers should be directed to that criticism and not to something that has happened outside the Dáil.  The Amendment I am proposing is this: &ldquo;That Article 1 be deleted and the following be substituted:&mdash;`Ireland is a Free State, and shall be known as Saorstát Eireann/Irish Free State.  All powers of Government and all authority, legislative, executive and judicial, are derived from the people, and the same shall be exercised through the organisations established by or under and in accord <Col N="651" /> with this Constitution.&rdquo;'  Now, if all that the Ministry has been telling us about their intentions to stick not only to the letter, but to the spirit of the Treaty of December 6th is true, there should be no difficulty at all in the adoption of this Amendment.  If I may put this in another way, I am really asking the Dáil to delete Articles 1 and 2 of the Bill and substitute for these two Articles the Amendment which I have on the Orders of the Day.  I shall ask the Deputies in the Dáil to turn to the first Article of the Treaty of December 6th; in that Article they will find Ireland was to have a mere Constitution, and the position in the Community of Nations and so forth, and Ireland shall be styled a nation&mdash;the Irish Free State.  In parenthesis let me say that I am one of those who believe that there is no obligation, whatever, in any clause or undertaking entered into by the signatories to the Treaty of December 6th, which compels this Dáil to have a Constitution at all.  The enacting of a Constitution now is a matter rather of whether it is wise, expedient or necessary, apart altogether from the question of the Treaty.  There is no provision in the Treaty that compels this Dáil to insert in the Constitution anything taken directly, or indirectly, out of the Treaty. As a matter of fact, the machinery or framework of the future legislation of the country can be drawn up without any particular reference to the Treaty at all.  I want to stress the fact that under the Treaty Ireland enters into a certain community of Nations&mdash;Ireland remember, the whole people of Ireland; that is, these 32 counties enter into a certain compact, contract or Treaty, with the peoples of States forming what is called the British Commonwealth of Nations, and inside that community of States, or peoples, or Governments, Ireland, not a part of Ireland, but the whole of Ireland, shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.  It seems to me that the clauses in the Draft Constitution, as it is called, or in the Bill before us, really evade and do not fulfil, to the utmost, the contract or the compact entered into in the Treaty.  The First Article here is &ldquo;The Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann is a co-equal member of the Community of Nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;  That <Col N="652" /> is one of the things upon which the Ministry made a great deal of fun the other day.  They made a great deal of fun about a declaratory clause.  This is nothing else but a declaratory clause, and the insertion of this in the Constitution seems to me as if we do not consider ourselves a Free State at all&mdash;that, as a matter of fact, the Treaty of December 6th, and it alone, conferred upon us the Free State.  That was not the position as I saw it; it was not the position from which I think any Nationalist could see it.  I want to substitute for that Article a kind of declaratory clause that is in Constitutions known to me, including most of the Constitutions in the selection of Constitutions which the Ministry has circulated.  They indicate that such and such a country is a Republic, a Monarchy, a Constitutional Monarchy, or something like that.  I want a declaration that Ireland is a Free State, and shall be known so, as is in the Treaty. The clause as it is here is not exactly the same thing, but quite a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all seen the Ministry and Members of the Dáil, and a good many people in Ireland, regarding the Irish Free State as the twenty-six counties; that is not the position.  The position at this moment, and since December, at least until a month after the passing of the draft Constitution by the British Parliament, and by the Irish Parliament, is that the Free State is the thirty-two counties of Ireland.  We want no insertion of the words &ldquo;Free State.&rdquo;  We want the insertion of the historical entity of Ireland.  Not only that, but if we are, as Article 1 says, co-equal members of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth, there are other things we have to take into consideration. If the Treaty laid down that we are to have the same status in that community as Great Britain, Canada, and others, well and good.  If the Treaty laid that down, it should be sufficient, and it should not be necessary to lay it down again in our own Constitution. There is just one other little thing, which is worthy of note, said by a man, who is not a Dominion statesman, but the Prime Minister of Great Britain, with whom the Ministry has had some little contact, and, therefore, may get some little more respect from the Ministry than the Dominion statesmen have got. <Col N="653" /> In a speech delivered on the 20th of June, 1921, at the opening of the Imperial Conference, speaking to the representatives of the Dominion, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In recognition of their services and achievements in the war, the British Dominions have now been accepted fully into the community of nations by the whole world.  They are signatories to the Treaty of Versailles and of all the other Treaties of Peace; they are members of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and their representatives have already attended meetings of the League; in other words, they have achieved full national status.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Ireland we do not require this Constitution, Treaty or anything else to acquire full national status.  We have our national status.  This Treaty was only the recognition of that status by a neighbouring country.  Anything else that we may do, entering within the community of nations, or any other community of nations is only a recognition of our status.  We had the status. And then Mr. Lloyd George went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" />&ldquo;In other words they had achieved full national status, and then our stand beside the United Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and the responsibilities of the British Commonwealth. If there are any means by which that status can be rendered even clearer to their own communities and to the world at large, we shall be glad to have them put forward at this conference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a means, and the Ministry did not accept that means.  I want to ask the deputies to dwell upon that&mdash;&ldquo;not only the dignities, not only the rights, but also the duties and the responsibilities to the community of nations known as the British Commonwealth,&rdquo; because of these things I ask the Dáil not to take your Article 1 as the Ministry puts it before us, but to take the more Irish, the more natural and national, the more correct position, and accept our amendment.  I beg formally to move the amendment.</P>

It was an agreed Article.  There is an amendment, I note, to it, which suggests that the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; should be inserted before the word &ldquo;people.&rdquo; Well, we are discussing the Constitution of Saorstat Eireann, and the reference there to the people cannot, I think, soberly and sanely be considered as a reference to other than to the Irish people. As a further objection to that particular amendment, it would be equally just if this Article is questioned as it stands, to criticise the amendment on the ground that powers of government in Asia or India are not derived from the Irish people.  We consider that this Article is a valuable recognition of the sovereignty of the Irish people.  It is the first time, I think, that in any Constitution which the British had to do with, that that fundamental, democratic principle of power deriving from the people of a country was explicitly recognised.  I formally move that that Article stand part of the Bill.</P>

I quite realise that the obvious interpretation of the words &ldquo;the people&rdquo; there is the Irish people; but you must recollect that, according to the draft Constitution now before us this thing is liable to go to the British Privy Council, and heaven only knows what they may discover there. It is important, for this reason, to make yourself clear that you have in the Oath Clause something about our common citizenship, and taking that fact in conjunction with the word &ldquo;people,&rdquo; left barely like that, undefined, where you would expect a definition, it is a dangerous thing, and one which I think this Dáil should not pass.  If there is any objection other than the objection suggested by the Minister, that it is unnecessary to insert the word &ldquo;Irish,&rdquo; let us have it; but, in view of the fact of &ldquo;common citizenship&rdquo; appearing in the same Constitution, it would surely be wiser, and it is right, to make it quite clear what we mean here, and say the Irish people if we mean the Irish people, and not allow anybody hereafter to twist it into something else.</P>

If there is no necessity for the words &ldquo;Irish people,&rdquo; then there is no necessity for the words &ldquo;in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  It seems to me one goes with the other, and if one is left out the other should be left out, and if one is left in the second should be put in.</P>

Now, obviously, the powers exercised in that portion, if any, which goes out from the Irish Free State, will not be exercised through the organisations &ldquo;established by or under and in accord with this Constitution.&rdquo; That explains the necessity for the words &ldquo;shall be exercised in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>

Then Clause 1 undoubtedly sets out that in future and for official purposes at any rate&mdash;I stress that&mdash; Ireland shall be known between these two Governments as the Irish Free State, and there is nothing as I read, to alter that I think it should be contended that the country is still a unit, even though the powers of the Dáil are no longer exercised in that area, and that its authority is not being wielded in that area. It is a mistake to interpret this Treaty, in my opinion, as though the partition is to take place by virtue of the decision of the Northern Parliament, if they do decide that, when we have preliminarily agreed to delegate to a Parliament (which is established through an Act of a British Parliament) those powers of Government, and I contend that if we hold to that view we would <Col N="659" /> have a much greater chance of maintaining the symbol of unity, which should not be lost entirely in this Assembly, and I would hope that if that view is asserted that any consequential phraseology which would arise from that reading would be maintained right throughout the Constitution.</P>

After all, when we state here that &ldquo;all powers of government and all authority legislative, executive, and judicial, are derived from the people,&rdquo; it was never <Col N="660" /> the intention in the minds of the drafters that we should be simply setting a book philosophy, a theory, in respect of any people.  We were specifically stating, and the Government is specifically stating, a principle in respect of one country, and that country is Ireland.  Consequently the words mean &ldquo;all powers of government, etc.,&rdquo; are derived from the people.  What people?  From the Irish people, because we are dealing here with the Constitution of the Free State, and the Constitution of the Free State is the Constitution of the Irish people.  Consequently all powers of Government can only be derived from the Irish people, and with the addition of the words Deputy Milroy has suggested&mdash;that all powers of government in Ireland, and all authority, legislative, executive, and judicial, are derived from the Irish people&mdash; would certainly meet the case, and I should hardly imagine it could be reasonably opposed by any part of this House. It is only stating a principle that is accepted on every hand.</P>

      <P>I propose as an amendment to substitute the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;so domiciled&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;who has been,&rdquo; and before the words &ldquo;in the area.&rdquo;  I put that down not with any view to pressing it to a division, but to draw the attention of the Ministers and their law advisers to it.  That matter would seem to me to be very intricate, and it seems to me to require more consideration than it has got.  If the test of citizenship is to be &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; you are opening up a large vista before the lawyers.  You are opening up rich harvests to them.  I do not suppose there is any word that has given rise to more law than the word &ldquo;domicile.&rdquo;  If possible, I should like to get away from that.  I think the clause ought to deal specifically with the position of wives and minors instead of leaving it to be determined by some legal abstraction, and, personally, I should like to see it provide for a register of Irish citizens, and provide for the creation of simple machinery by which the right of citizenship may be determined, and by which, for instance, a man may ascertain whether or not he is deemed domiciled here or in ordinary residence here, whichever term is adopted.  I do not know if members generally realise that if you adopt &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; as your test you are adopting a test which would allow people to become Irish citizens who have not been here, not only for the last seven years, but for forty years&mdash;people who say they have the intention of returning some day, people who have gone away with the intention of coming back to die.  Again, you have the case of persons leaving this country a month or two ago, or a year or two ago, out of disgust with the political success achieved by the Irish people.  If those people go abroad, and for reasons of health, or because they are rolling stones do not acquire a fixed <Col N="664" /> abode, gentlemen determined to settle somewhere else, they remain Irish citizens if you adopt &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; as your test.  In fact, the word is one which has given rise to so much litigation, that I should like something clearer to be put down here.  I do not attach much importance to the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; as a substitute, but, I think, &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; would be a better element of definition.  With the other amendments proposed I may as well deal now.  One is to insert after the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;elect,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;within a time and in manner to be prescribed by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That is to say, if you are going to confer upon people who belong to other States the right to become Irish citizens, you should provide here very precisely a further proposal for rules to be made by which we should know definitely, a year from now whether such people have opted to become Irish citizens.  If Members are interested in the subject, I would give them an opportunity to impress upon the Government the need to have this matter reconsidered before we put it into the final Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to support the Deputy who suggested &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in the first case, but I would in the second place where it occurs, and I would respectfully recommend it to the consideration of the Government.  A Deputy said that if you used the word &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; in the first case you would allow people who had been absent for five or ten or twenty years to return to this country. I do suggest that this Dáil ought not to deprive of their Irish citizenship men who leave this country to work in their professions in other countries, never having intended to abandon their status as Irish citizens.  There is no country in the world, except, perhaps, the one across, where they send out so many people to earn their fortunes&mdash;people who would like nothing less than to be deprived of their right to call themselves Irish people, and who come back here to spend their declining years.  I have known dozens of them myself.  People who went into the Indian Civil Service and other Services, who became doctors, civil engineers, and one thing or another, in different spheres, and who come back&mdash;there are plenty of them living here now&mdash;having <Col N="665" /> come back after spending their working days abroad; they come back here now, and whose children are possibly going to do the same thing after them.  If you leave &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; in the first place it preserves the rights of these men.  In the second place if the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; could be substituted. Heaven forbid that I should try to inflict a lecture on the Dáil on the word &ldquo;domicile.&rdquo;  There has been a great deal of litigation but it is not over the meaning of the word so much as over the facts.  I do think when this clause was drafted the over-lapping escaped the notice of the draftsmen.  If you use the word &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; the clause reads: &ldquo;or who has not been so domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State for not less than 7 years,&rdquo;&mdash;that governs the moment when the Constitution passes.  I think there is over-lapping that did escape notice.  I think it was the intention of the framers to imply that any person who is living here for not less than seven complete years before this Constitution passed this Dáil was entitled to Irish citizenship, if he elected to take it.  I do not think they ever intended to deprive Irish people who happen to be absent at the moment the Constitution passed from their right to call themselves Irish citizens, and therefore I second the second amendment which the Deputy for Co. Dublin has put on the list, and respectfully press upon the Government to accept the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in the second place where &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; occurs.  Possibly they may see their way to reconsider the matter and deal with it afterwards.</P>

      <P>Before that is finally done may I make a few suggestions? I speak with some temerity in face of the learned remarks made on this subject on a point that may be germane to the subject.  I wish to do so as having had something to do with the drafting of the original clause which has given rise to a great deal of discussion here. It also gave rise to many earnest discussions&mdash;and brought back to memory many discussions&mdash;at the Committee regarding the words &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and <Col N="666" />&ldquo;domicile,&rdquo; and eventually the word &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; was accepted because it implied, whether the person had lived here or not lived here the intention of remaining, which was more a mark of citizenship than mere residence.  I wonder if it would be altogethr wise for us to substitute the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; in the second instance for this reason, and the reason does not originate with myself, but originated in some of the earlier discussions, and was raised with great learning on that occasion.  It is this&mdash; there might happen in Ireland, at the present moment, some person who had been resident here for the previous seven years, and actually I remember one or two definite cases of the kind were brought forward, people who had been resident here for the last seven years, ordinarily resident here, whose wives and children had been resident in other places, in other countries, and who, therefore, and I speak with correction in the presence of the lawyers, who would not be considered as being domiciled here although ordinarily resident here, and it was the intention of the Committee that such persons&mdash;their chief interest would be where their domicile was, and not where ordinarily resident, and by virtue of that fact and the habits of those persons having been referred to where they took occasion to return to their domicile, so that their chief interest was in other countries and not in this country, and, therefore, the right and exercise of citizenship should not be conferred. Under the circumstances I would urge the Dáil to consider the retention of the word &ldquo;domicile,&rdquo; not only in the first instance, but in the other instance. Clearly, if persons go into the Indian Civil Service, and return after several years, the interests of these persons are in this country.  Equally, if a man is resident here, and his home and family are in another country, his ordinary interest is in another country.  The first person should be admitted to citizenship, but the second person should not be admitted to that citizenship, as such persons would consider other citizenship, very naturally, from their point of view a matter of pride.  With regard to the latter amendment which comes under this section I am asking Mr. Gavan Duffy to insert in amendment 5 <i>(d)</i> after the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;elect&rdquo; the words &ldquo;within a time and <Col N="667" /> in manner to be prescribed by the &ldquo;Oireachtas.&rdquo;  The objection to that is this.  The Oireachtas may prescribe certain times and conditions, after which every person living here, and even domiciled here, would have citizenship conferred on that person, but the imposing of citizenship on that person might impose on that person a very great wrong. I believe it to be the law in the United States that if it can be proved in respect of anyone that he is a citizen of some other State, he is excluded from citizenship of his own State, and, therefore, to impose citizenship upon a person who does not want to accept it would it be like thrusting a favour on those reluctant to receive it.</P>

      <P>I move an amendment to Article 3.  This and the others are put forward with the privilege of the Ministry.  This particular amendment is in the form of a verbal amendment to remove ambiguity as it stands. It refers only to the last sentence of Article 3: &ldquo;Men and women have equal rights as citizens.&rdquo;  The intention of that portion of the Article was to give men and women equal political rights, and the amendment provides that the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; should be inserted after the word &ldquo;equal.&rdquo;  The sentence will then read &ldquo;Men and women have equal political rights.&rdquo;  I think that is much clearer than the text as it stands, and will commend itself to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious change, and we think we ought to hear some reason for it.  While it professes to give equality to women with men, it takes away from them a great deal of the rights that are ordinarily regarded as attaching to citizenship.  I take it &ldquo;political&rdquo; means they have the right to vote and stand as candidates for constituencies, but beyond that they have no other rights.  This amendment, it seems to me, ought to be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Clause as it stands in the text might almost be regarded as redundant.  It might have been stated, in view of the attitude we took up, we would not have regarded it as necessary to put in anything at all. It is not with a view of taking away any rights that women have, or that members of this Dáil think they should have, as citizens, but the reason it was inserted was this: there was a fear that lawyers might construe it in such a way as to cause considerable difficulties later on.  For instance, there are certain acts or offences for which women are not prosecuted, and for which men are prosecuted, and vice versa, and there are some circumstances in which it would not be thought desirable that women and men should be treated in precisely the same way.  Members of the Dáil, I am sure, know that there are such cases; while everybody here desires that women and men should have every political right, they would not say that in every case certain acts should be regarded in the same way in the law when committed by women as when committed by men.  It is for the purpose of avoiding <Col N="671" /> complications of such a nature arising that we change the word &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; to &ldquo;political rights&rdquo;&mdash;not to narrow the Clause or reading of the third Article from the word &ldquo;citizens,&rdquo; but out of fear that the word &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; might be construed by lawyers to tie the hands of the Legislature and the Judiciary later on in a way we might not foresee at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion to put in the words &ldquo;political rights&rdquo; indicates a limitation of the intentions of the mover.  I think it would be a retrograde step to alter this sentence by the amendment. Some of us have thought very highly of this particular part of the clause, and regret very much that it should be limited to &ldquo;political rights.&rdquo; There are economic rights which men enjoy, and we at least would like women to enjoy the same economic rights, and inasmuch as you are in the Constitution giving equal political rights in that constitution, and have as a matter of fact in practice in the last two years conceded women equal rights, politically and socially, to a great extent, I think it would be a great danger, and would reflect badly upon the Dáil, if you insert in the Constitution anything limiting that equality to the phrase &ldquo;political rights.&rdquo; If the amendment is pressed I think we would have to propose a further amendment to include economic rights and social rights also, and I think there would have to be a differentiation made in the law.  I think it very desirable these words already in the clause should be retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just because we are afraid that our hands might be tied later, when such a differentiation might be necessary, it is felt that the phrase is one which it would be perhaps unwise to put in just as it stands.  As a matter of fact the subject matter of the phrase as it stands in the text is contained earlier in the clause where it states &ldquo;every person domiciled shall be a citizen, and shall be subject to the privileges and obligations of citizenship.&rdquo;  I think it was almost unnecessary in the first instance, and it might have been suggested to remove it entirely, but that might be also understood in the way in which these changes are understood.</P>

We want to prevent a man who happens to stand in a court charged with a felony from pleading that he committed the act under the duress of his wife.  There are then other acts and penalties for offences which might be suffered by women were the words allowed to stand as they are; therefore, we put in the words of the amendment.</P>

The clause would then read: &ldquo;men and women shall enjoy the privileges, and be subject to the obligations of such citizenship under conditions to be discerned by law.&rdquo;  There is no difficulty that the Minister has raised that could not be covered by that, and it would leave no sense of grievance among the women citizens.  I think at a moment's consideration it will be seen that what I suggest covers the whole ground.</P>

      <P>I would like to urge that the mover of this amendment does not press it.  I think it would have an unfortunate effect if we were to change the words that have been brought in here.  I think it was quite clearly intended by the original drafters of the sentence to include, not merely the individual, but also the economic and social rights, to which reference has been made.  With regard to the arguments brought forward by the Minister for Local Government, and also the Minister for Home Affairs, as to the legal effect of this subsequently, whether the rights have a different relation before the law, I would like to say <Col N="673" /> that I think that is met in the form of wording adopted in the sentence, because the sentence does say that men and women have equal rights as citizens, with the same rights as citizens.</P>

I submit those arguments can very fairly be met by what will be prescribed in law.  As it stands, the amendment would mean a narrowing of the effect wanted to be produced by the sentence in the Article.

      <P>May I say one word in support of the Minister for Local Government?  I think this Dáil does not appreciate that there are many cases in which women possess privileges at present.  The effect of the clause, without the amendment suggested, would be to confer these privileges on men until the law was altered. You were putting it in the Constitution. It is easy to alter the law, but it is very, very, hard to alter the Constitution. I think there are, particularly living in this country, some women at any rate who have obtained decrees of separation from their husbands&mdash;I do not say divorces.  It would come rather as a shock upon them to find that they may be made to provide alimony for the husbands they had sent away.  I only give that as one instance. There are many other cases in law in which women do possess, at present, privileges.  I am not for denying them for a moment, but I do not think privileges ought to be rashly conferred on men without consideration.  If the law is wrong, you can alter it, but if you make a slip in the Constitution it will be hard to get it composed.  Therefore, I suggest that you confine it to political rights for the present.  Later you can make the law conform to our ideas of justice, whatever they may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was going to say.  The main point I had in mind was that there was no exact limitation <Col N="674" /> here.  You were not depriving them of anything.  You were simply asserting that you have not yet got the machinery for showing what your liability was as to the precise thing that was done.  Take, for instance, the Inland Revenue and Customs Department, which we are taking up now.  At present the man must discover from his wife&mdash;it may be in some instances a difficult job&mdash;what income she has got, and he is responsible for whatever statement he puts in. She would be entitled to deny that particular information if this clause stood as at present, and there should be two assessments. It would lead to endless bother.  The position is that we would continually have to alter the law, whereas if you leave the women to talk over their grievances, you will not be long in hearing what they are.  You can then take steps to remedy them.  I do not think there is any great grievance here that cannot be altered.  You are not putting a full stop in this; you are simply making the way clear to regularise it by law.</P>

      <P>I submit Deputy Mac Giobuin's statement is really an argument in favour of leaving the sentence in the Article as it stands. I think we will all agree it may be a matter of great difficulty and length of time to change a clause or sentence in the Constitution, but that it is not so difficult to change the law.  I submit the whole thing is a matter really of law, and not of Constitution.  Presumably we shall be altering the laws to fit in with the new conditions that are prevailing in the country.  For that very reason&mdash;it is not likely in these things that there would be a wholesale change in the Clauses or Articles of the Constitution&mdash; I submit you should stick to the Article as it stands, or that part of the Article as it stands, and leave in the new codification of the law these other points to be looked after.  I submit we should not limit or narrow the machinery; it is quite narrow enough as it is.</P>

If you speak of men and women having equal rights &ldquo;of citizenship&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;as citizens,&rdquo; I think you would get over the difficulty suggested by Mr. Fitzgibbon, and at the same time express what we all want to express&mdash;&ldquo;fundamental equality.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment could be gained equally by the Parliament instructing the Executive not to recommend or endorse any suggestion of that kind; but it is quite another thing to attempt in the Constitution definitely to limit or shear what is regarded as one of the few remaining prerogatives of the Crown.  And any possibility of a repetition of 1800 is, I think, sufficiently guarded against in that Article, where it is stated &ldquo;that no title of honour in respect of any services rendered in or in relation to the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann may be conferred on any citizen of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann except with the approval or upon the advice of the Executive Council of the State.&rdquo;  The point that Deputy Figgis raises, and probably Deputy O'Brien would have raised on the amendment which stands in his name, could be sufficiently met by each Parliament making a general instruction to the Executive that it ought not to recommend any titles or honours.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment as moved by Deputy Figgis, and I think it is very essential that it should be adopted, notwithstanding what the Minister for Home Affairs has said.  The Minister stated this was one of the few prerogatives left to the Crown. The Article as put before us limits the <Col N="681" /> granting of such titles to those granted with the consent of the Ministry here in Ireland.  We are not concerned with the prerogative of the Crown, but with what action may or may not be taken by the Ministry at home.  If this country and this Dáil was left to itself, I take it we would frame a Republican Constitution. This Clause is essentially Republican, and if we cannot have a Republic, as we would like, let us at least have our Constitution as Republican as we can have it.  This affects what would be done in Ireland by an Irish Ministry, and, while there may be no general disposition to grant title or honours, it is well to guard against any possibilities.  We might wake up some day to find a Lord Blythe, Baron O'Higgins, and Viscount Cosgrave.  It is well to guard against these things.</P>

      <P>I must not have made myself sufficiently clear to set down definitely that no title or honour may be conferred on any citizen of the Irish Free State, and leave it at that, as a challenge, a provocative thing, and beyond doubt as an attempt to limit a prerogative which the Crown undoubtedly claims for itself.  But you get the same object in a less brusque way, and in a less provocative way, when you say that no such title or honour may be conferred except with the approval or consent of the Executive Council of the State, and let the Parliament then simply give its instructions to the Executive Council to give no titles or honours. If you look carefully into that you will find we have not our eyes on any jobs or titles.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the amendment brought forward by Deputy Figgis has in view exclusively political titles of honour.  We are all at one with the Minister for Home Affairs in thinking that the nationality will have sufficient vitality to support a Ministry at any future period against becoming an agent of corruption in the way that Deputy O'Brien fears.  A title of honour includes a great many more things than these social distinctions referred to as Baronetcies and Viscountcies, and the rest.  Supposing the Royal Society in England wish to confer a title of Fellow of the Royal Society upon an Irishman for some distinguished contribution to Science or Research, would not Deputy Figgis be quite willing to allow the privilege to a Minister of that day to consent to have that title conferred?  I would support the Minister for Home Affairs on this occasion because the phrase &ldquo;Title of Honour&rdquo; is so much wider than what is contemplated by the mover of the amendment.</P>

That is the same meaning of this argument at the present moment, and is that the exact meaning of putting in the words &ldquo;Title of Honour&rdquo;?  If so, we need to reconsider the words &ldquo;Title of Honour.&rdquo;  I understand it definitely to mean what is sometimes referred to as a honorific title, and that is something which deals specifically with a social caste.</P>

You cannot set down, I submit, having regard to the exact position under the Treaty statement, a prohibition on the British King from conferring honours in this country, but they have conceded that they will not confer except upon the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council, which in practice can be made equivalent to a complete prohibition, and I submit that that clause is most valuable, and should be allowed to stand.</P>

      <P>It struck me in connection with this general discussion somehow or other that the idea in some Deputies' minds in regard to the Executive Council is scarcely an idea that ought to prevail in an assembly like this.  The Assembly of the Dáil is unquestionably a Government. The Executive Council carries out the orders and wishes of the general body of the Dáil.  It is part of the Dáil and the sense of the Dáil directs the Executive Council in whatever it does.  Do not think of the Executive Council as if it were an institution outside eternally declaring war on the liberties of the Dáil.  I think with the safeguard you have got, with the democratic feeling and sense that runs through this Constitution, you have every safeguard that can possibly be given in this article; and having regard to the circumstances of the case in this article, I certainly recommend the Dáil to accept it.</P>

I strongly disagree with Deputy O'Connell's suggestion that it would be better that provision should come from the English Parliament rather than from ourselves. Even if it be undesirable it is much better that we ought to do it for ourselves than that it should be done for us by somebody else.</P>

The wording says: &ldquo;The liberty of the person is inviolable, and no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law.&rdquo; Consequently the law from time to time may change, and it is left open during the time of war and in special stress of circumstances so to vary that law that the liberty may be impeached. The Article as it stands protects exactly that liberty of Government which Deputy Duggan was so anxious to ensure, and therefore I suggest to him that what he is anxious to ensure is already ensured, and that what he intends to achieve has already been achieved, and that his amendment is unnecessary.</P>

It is desirable that the law should leave the hands of the Executive free when a state of war exists.  Whether or not there is a state of war will be a matter for the Courts. At present, if the courts are satisfied that a state of war does exist, they have discretion to refuse writs of Habeas Corpus. If this were passed as it stands there is danger that it might be read that they had not that liberty.  No; there will be different views in the Dáil in the present situation, but, I think, the majority of the Dáil will agree that it <Col N="689" /> would not be desirable, in the state of affairs that we find ourselves at the present time, that the powers of the Executive should be less than they are, or that the Executive should be restricted more than it is.  The whole life of the State is being assailed.  Nobody wants unduly to restrict the liberty of the individual, but, on the other hand, we must not so tie the hands of the Executive that the State may be destroyed, because the hands of the Executive are tied&mdash;and unnecessarily tied.  And, I think the present state of things, on the whole, will be pronounced satisfactory. There is another thing in it, and that is that we must not look too much, and not be too much guided by what we thought of things in the past, because we are now&mdash;owing to the setting up of an Irish Government&mdash;facing a new situation entirely.</P>

      <P>We have come to the consideration of a matter that is of the very first importance. It has been my duty to go into a good many Constitutions, and the Article as it stands here is more or less the substance of the Constitutional Law in the matter as it is adopted in every other Constitution without any such addition of words as is now projected. The whole question of fundamental liberty is at issue, and I do urge that this being a Government amendment can be very easily carried by the Government if they care to press it, because they hold the majority in this Dáil and they could get the Whips to put it through.  But they would be thereby rendering nugatory the struggle for freedom not only in this country, but in other countries, because this question of Habeas Corpus has been adopted in all countries as one of the fundamental rights of the citizens, and such definitions as &ldquo;times of peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;times of war&rdquo; have never before been introduced into a Constitution.  The matter could be met by a sufficient elasticity in the law.  The conditions of the times, peace and war, can be set out in the general body of the law, and they can be met very easily and still keep within the provision of Article 6, and I suggest to the Government to let Article 6 stand as it is, passing legislation to meet these special contingencies hereafter either in an anticipatory law or otherwise, but not to change Article 6, for the change <Col N="690" /> which is suggested would make our Constitution appear, when compared with other Constitutions, not so free in this important matter as other Constitutions are.</P>

      <P>If the discussion is not closed I would like to say a few words.  The position taken up in this case is one which affects not the liberty of individuals, but the liberty of the nation. If we were satisfied the safety of the nation&mdash;and that safety is vital&mdash;and the safety of the whole fabric of the nation was not in danger we would not ask for the inclusion of these terms.  It is because evidence cannot be produced, perhaps which would justify the Court, or be looked upon as evidence sufficient to justify the Court in arresting people, and which cannot be produced by reason of the non-acceptance of information, and because of causes over which we have no control.  The rich are enabled to buy off evidence.  I am positively convinced that has been done in some cases that came before us, and that people who have revolvers or other implements and resources at their disposal are in a position to prevent other evidence being brought forward. The evidence is there, and we have not arrested, so far as my information has gone, one single person without satisfactory and sufficient evidence being before us of the absolute guilt or complicity in some way or another of every person we have in our hands.  At the moment, supposing we pass this Constitution immediately, and that we are asked by these people to bring them before the Court, five thousand or six thousand of them, why we would require at least ten times the number of lawyers we have available to produce this evidence. I think I need not inform the Dáil that in some cases that have appeared in the Courts, lawyers have disgraced what is an honourable profession by the action they have taken&mdash;lawyers that are not themselves free from very serious complaint on the national side, posturing as Republican lawyers, and so forth.  That is the condition of affairs, and it is by no means the intention, nor could it be defended, that action such as has been suggested here were to be taken in ordinary industrial disputes. No Government could stand by that.</P>

I believe it is quite feasible and quite simple for the Dáil to pass legislation to meet the emergency, if you require it, but do not allow the Constitution to be spoiled by putting in a clause which is going to throw us back to a period of 70, 80, or 90 years ago, but develop in civic life and common freedom.</P>

What would be deplorable was that the Irish people who have given themselves out to the world as lovers of liberty should put into their Constitution a qualification of liberty such as suggested.  The difficulty raised by the President can easily be met.  The Minister of Defence told us the other day that we should legalise the position of those arrested on suspicion.  That can be done before this Constitution comes into effect.  Such a Bill could be very easily passed.  The main objection raised by the President to the clause as it stands would go.

      <P>&ldquo;It is the duty of all citizens to ensure that their children and wards receive adequate education.  To this end provision shall be made by the State for the free education of the young up to an age to be prescribed by law.  School attendance shall be compulsory.  Provision shall be made by the State, so that secondary and higher educational institutions shall be readily accessible in the case of persons with small means.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All schools and educational establishments, public and private, shall be controlled by the State, within limits to be determined by law.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All schools and educational establishments shall aim at inculcating moral character, religious tolerance, and personal and vocational efficiency, and the teaching given therein shall be imbued with the spirit of Irish nationality and international goodwill. The duties of citizenship shall be a subject of instruction in all schools in order to fit the pupil for his responsibilities as a citizen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> I consider this Article as it stands altogether too meagre; it is not sufficient, in our opinion, for the Nation to state that the children of the Free State should be granted elementary education.  The children are the hope of the future and they have the right to the fullest measure of support and protection which the State can give them, and I therefore suggest that the rights of children to food, clothing and shelter should also be granted to them as well as the right to education.  That is set out in the first paragraph of my Amendment.  I need not enlarge at any length on the second paragraph.  While, of course, it is the duty of parents to educate their children and those under their care of all citizens, I propose that the provision whereby they are enabled to do so should be put on the State.  I was rather tempted to put down here the last sentence in the last paragraph, &ldquo;that secondary education should be free,&rdquo; but I prefer for the present to leave it read &ldquo;provision shall be made by the State, so that secondary and higher educational institutions shall be readily accessible in the case of persons with small means.&rdquo;  I attach a good deal of importance to the third paragraph, that education, public and private, shall be controlled by the State, within limits to be determined by law.  It is right that the children should be protected from exploitation either by private or otherwise interested persons, and it should not be within the power of any person to set up a school in which education is purported to be given without giving any right to the State to say what is the nature of that education.  You could conceivably have a case in which a person might set up a school and teach what might be regarded as pernicious doctrines, and the State should have the right to say whether that should be allowed or not, and that is all that is intended within the meaning of the paragraph.  I think there is hardly any necessity for me to dwell on the last paragraph of the Amendment.  I propose the Amendment.</P>

It is not necessary to set out in full detail all the most modern and up-to-date amplifications of those rights. A certain amount can be safely left to legislation hereafter.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would accept a slight amendment. Instead of suggesting &ldquo;all citizens have the right to free elementary education,&rdquo; make this run in parallel lines to the preceding Clause, &ldquo;the right to free elementary education is guaranteed.&rdquo;  It is in no way different from the original; it is merely a question of symmetry of language.  There is one point in the Amendment proposed by Deputy O'Connell which it would be my duty to oppose as strenuously as possible.  That is the proposition to bring the Universities under the control of the State. Nothing more reactionary could be proposed than that.  There is no University in the world, and certainly none that I am aware of, except in the Six Counties, in regard to which this has ever been proposed.  Unless the Universities are autonomous, education perishes.  The proposal, if passed, would amount to the destruction of the vivifying influence of Universities in the national life of the entire community.

We have heard a good deal, in discussing this Constitution, of the conditions under which we are considering it, and we are not allowed, we all recognise, to evolve out of this a Republican Constitution, because of certain circumstances, but there are limits and, beyond those limits, we are allowed to evolve as near a Republican Constitution as possible, and without those particular limits we are allowed to embody in our Constitution what was embodied in the Republican Constitution of 1918.  I want to remind those Members, who were Members of the Dáil, in what was closest to a Constitution of anything they had, that they declared &ldquo;it shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter, but that all shall be provided with means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland.&rdquo;  This Clause that is proposed puts into more precise terms that Clause of the Democratic Programme.  The Republican Constitution is as near as you can get to it, and I am certain&mdash; because I have it here&mdash;that the Minister for Home Affairs voted for it, and he did right in doing so.  It is a very valuable provision, and it ought to be embodied in this particular Constitution in such phraseology as may be decided on.  If this particular phraseology is not correct, <Col N="700" /> then it may be altered, but I do contend that the ideas embodied in that particular clause of the &ldquo;Democratic Programme&rdquo; ought to be embodied in the Constitution we are now setting up.  I think, as far as it is possible, it is pretty well contained, so far as the education goes, in the Amendment that is now submitted.  It is not an extravagant Amendment; it is an Amendment that all educationists, I think, would approve, and I would appeal to the House to agree to it, and have it as a monument to the work of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am not an educationist, nor do I know a great deal about the different Constitutions of the world, but it seems obvious to me that this is not a matter for a Constitution, but a matter for legislation&mdash;emphatically so.  There are, as far as I can diagnose this Amendment, three distinct subjects mooted in it, (1) provision for food, clothing, shelter and education sufficient for their proper physical welfare and training, (2) to make more accessible to people of small means secondary and higher educational institutions, (3) control by the State of educational establishments. I suggest if there are any subjects that could be legitimate subjects of legislation it is those, because the ways and means of dealing with them must be dealt with before they can be taken up.  Take the first clause, if that was brought forward as a Bill, and it could be shown to be a practical measure, I should certainly give it my strongest support.  I think it is one of the first things that the Parliament of this Nation will have to see to.  It is not securing it by merely entering it in the Constitution before you have thought out the ways and means of providing for it.  I think a much more effective way of achieving what is intended in each of these three proposals, is by the introduction of legislation that deals specifically with them rather than burying it in the depths of the Constitution.  I am not arguing against the propriety of the proposals contained in these, but I am arguing that it is not the time to press for them, nor is the Constitution the effective place to have them made articulate.</P>

      <P>We in Ireland are not only &ldquo;first flower of the earth and first gem of the sea,&rdquo; but I think we are the salt of the earth as well, so much so that it is not necessary for us to put into our Constitution fundamental things like this although it seems necessary to put in certain other things.  Now the selected Constitutions of the world were handed around to us the other day, in a volume.  Not many of us have had the time to go through them, but casually looking through them you will find the recent Constitutions such as the German Constitution and the Polish Constitution provide for this; and there is great similarity in many ways and in many things between the Irish and the Polish people.  Even the Mexican Constitution and Mexican politics provide for many things which seem to be tabooed in an Irish Constitution. Deputies upon other Benches have all, or nearly all, held out to the people that one of the first matters and one of the most essential things necessary in Ireland was Education, and that the whole root of things in Ireland is Education, and here in the document that is to be the framework of the whole future legislation of the country the very people who are to be the citizens of the future State &mdash;the children who are the foundation of the State and the foundation of the family&mdash;the position of the children, of the family, of the education, and every provision for the children is to be neglected in the fundamental legislation of <Col N="702" /> the country.  It is to be left to future legislation.  Everything, of course, can be left to future legislation.  There is no Clause in this draft Constitution which might not properly be the subject of legislation in the future, and the fact that this Amendment contains 20 or 30 lines instead of 2 or 3 lines as in the original Clause, does not necessarily make it a Bill.  I think it is a shame, and I think it will be a shame if the only provision made by Teachtai for the children and for the education of the people of Ireland on education is to be made in two lines of the Constitution, and certainly those for whom we speak expect of an Irish legislature that shall not merely give the right to free elementary education without going into the distant future.  I support the Amendment.</P>

(Mr. Milroy: &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;) Even with the two or three lines which gives the right of free elementary education you will have legislation or you will have to provide the ways and means for giving that free elementary education. In answer to Deputy Whelehan and also to an argument suggested by the Minister for Local Government, I would say, and it must be remembered, that the time for drafting these Amendments was extremely limited and we had not very much time to think of a special form of wording.  I would also say what Deputy O'Shannon said, that most of what is container in my Amendment will be found in all new Constitutions <Col N="703" /> drafted in the past few years.  If I understand the suggestion contained in what the Minister for Local Government said, we will have an opportunity of bringing this forward again perhaps in a different way and after consultation with Deputy Whelehan and Deputy Magennis, and in these circumstances I am prepared to withdraw the Amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;<i>(a)</i>  All estates and interests in the lands, waters, and natural resources of Ireland heretofore claimed to be vested in the King or Crown of Great Britain are reserved to and vested in the Free State/Saorstát Eireann.  The air of Ireland and all forms of potential energy and forces of nature which are unknown or not usable because of lack of scientific or technical knowledge are also reserved to and vested in the Free State/ Saorstát Eireann: Provided that the Oireachtas may make provisions for rewarding any person making a scientific or technical discovery of general public utility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)  All estates and interests in the lands, waters, and natural resources of Ireland formerly claimed to be <Col N="704" /> vested in the King or Crown of Great Britain but alienated prior to the adoption of this Constitution to individuals or corporations, which at the date of adoption hereof were not developed or were not the subject of a mineral or development lease, and all wealth below the surface of the soil which was unknown or undeveloped at the date hereof, may be acquired by the Free State/Saorstát Eireann acting on behalf of the people in such manner and on such basis of compensation as may be prescribed by law: Provided that in awarding compensation therefor account shall not be taken of the value accruing after the date of the adoption of this Constitution from any cause other than the industry of the individuals or corporations from whom they were acquired, or their predecessors in title.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are just two matters that I would like to draw attention to in that connection, and one is, I think it is a matter of very great importance that we should protect at this moment of all moments the air of this country, which has suddenly, owing to discoveries of the last few years, acquired an importance of very considerable moment.  I know there are certain contracts, that there are certain titles, that do grant a tenure of land, and I believe that they read in the wording of the title &ldquo;ad que coelam,&rdquo; but owing to the circumstances that it has not been very easy in the past to make out easements in the air, no such easements have hitherto been made out; but we are now faced with the possibility that such easements will be made out in the near future, and will be claimed, and we do not know whether that claim will extend, and how far it may hinder the unification of Irish air by Irish energy.  If I may just briefly make one reference in that connection. I remember some years ago&mdash;not very long ago&mdash;in connection with certain national work, being in a coal mine in South Wales, and having my attention drawn to just a little strip of a corner from one causeway to another, a passage from one gallery to another, across just a little strip of the subway that did not extend to more than 6 or 7 ft. all told.  The Manager informed us that he had to pay £180 odd a year for what was known as wayleave across the small strip, simply because a certain <Col N="705" /> person so many hundred feet up happened to possess the exact piece of land that happened to be above this little piece.  That down below in an Irish mine would practically mean the uneconomic working of the mine.  We are not dealing so much with that at the present moment.  I am now referring to what might happen the other way, if there are these easements going to be considered.  And the matter is receiving very careful attention in all countries where it is contemplated that the State should make out a claim for the absolute possession of all air, and which I think would have to be done by a Constitutional provision by this State at the present moment.  These Articles were drafted under other circumstances with some care, and I think they should be part of the Constitution, and I move them to that effect.</P>

I could not hold out hope that the amended form would meet the point of view embodied in the Amendment of Deputy O'Brien, or the new Article of Deputy Johnson.

      <P>In that case it may be well to have it discussed.  The Amendment which we have put down may be said to cover no more ground than the Clause as it stands, but we prefer the wording as being more explicit and more definitely laying down that the soil and natural resources are vested in the Irish people, and that those who may possess portions of the soil or have the right to exploit these mineral resources, shall do so on definite terms laid down by the Nation.  And anyone who fails to use these resources, or misuses them in a manner that may be considered to oppose the welfare of the people as a whole, in these circumstances the State may step in and prevent that kind of thing. We hold these resources are to be looked upon as the estate of the Nation, and that the interests of the Nation as a whole must be served in the exploitation. Under the conditions that prevail in the world to-day a person who is in possession of any part of land, or the instrument of production, is held to be entitled to exploit this just as it may serve his private welfare, and to withhold those things from the service of mankind in general.  If, say, the owner of land finds that, according to the condition of the market, it is not desirable from his personal standpoint that that land should be cultivated, it goes out of cultivation.  We hold, on the other hand, that these things are essential to the welfare, happiness and prosperity of the people as a whole, and that the Legislature and State generally should prescribe the conditions under which these things should be held and exploited, and that ownership is to be read in a limited sense as the right to exploit those things under such conditions for a limited period, and if those are not fulfilled the State has a right to resume possession and prescribe the conditions under which the land and mineral resources should be exploited.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>

      <P>One would like to know, except for the fact that the Minister has practically offered to withdraw Article 11, what are the rights of the State in and to the natural resources which are said to exist in this clause? As it stands I think it really means nothing unless you define those rights, and the amendment proposed is an attempt to define those rights.  And, again, I would say that it is recasting a little more precisely what was, as a matter of fact, laid down in the Declaration of January, 1919, of Dáil Eireann, and I think it is commonly accepted doctrine that the over-lordship of the State is definite and clear, and that property that is held is held in trust for the public welfare.  If that trust is not fulfilled, the State has an over-riding authority. The second part of this amendment defines <Col N="708" /> that it is a duty of the trustee, the landowner, to utilise his land to the full, and that, when by virtue of public activities, values in land increase&mdash;not accruing from any expenditure of capital or labour&mdash;then that increase shall be absorbed and used by the community for the common good.  That is a doctrine which I do not think anyone in his private capacity will denounce or deny.  It is generally accepted, and I submit it would be well to have it embodied in our Constitution at the beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>About Article 11 as it stands, one of the matters that the Government is dissatisfied with in the clause is the word &ldquo;alienated.&rdquo;  We had in mind by that &ldquo;permanently alienated.&rdquo;  We had meant by that to provide that the air to which Mr. Figgis referred, or the water-power resources of the country should not be given over entirely to private owners for exploitation, but we find that alienation legally might have a much stronger meaning than we thought, that it might provide even that leasing, for instance, is alienation, and that the clause in so far as it might be operative and used for testing the validity of the law, might compel the State actually to work the resources itself, which, of course, we would not want to tie ourselves to.  That is one of the immediate causes for reconsidering this clause.  The object of the clause is pretty well that of Mr. Figgis' amendment, though there are a couple of points in his amendment that we cannot actually accept.  The objection to this other clause, amongst other things, is that it is not a foundation of law.  It is purely declaratory; for instance, in Clause 11 as it stands, it does in a certain way limit the right of the Parliament and the Legislature to make laws, and of the Executive to do acts.  It provides a direction and framework, defective as it may be.  On the other hand, this is a theoretical declaration which carries us nowhere in itself, which might not be, and need not be, implemented in any way.  It is a theoretical declaration to which many people might take exception, which would be misunderstood by many people, and which would cause alarm.  Its inclusion would in itself form, I think, even if it were not objected to, one of the sort of things which we should not have in the Constitution.  I admit that in the draft there are other things <Col N="709" /> like it which have succeeded in getting in, and which may remain in, but, in my view, with a view to preventing this Constitution being used afterwards in the hands of lawyers for a purpose for which we do not intend it to be used, we should keep down as closely as we can to things that give a definite direction to the legislature, that impose a definite restriction upon the legislature, or that in some way set up a framework or machinery of Government.  This, if it were passed, would be somewhat in the nature of a pious resolution to which a great number of people would object, because, although it might not, in effect, have all the meaning, or carry the threats which they would think it might carry, they would be reasonably entitled to object to its going into the Constitution, when it was not necessary for any purpose of the Constitution for making any change in what would be done by the legislature or by the Government.</P>

      <P>The Sinn Fein programme that was read by Deputy Johnson was intended to be a programme of legislation and not to be embodied in the Constitution.  It might be taken that in social matters the Constitution registers the advance made by democracy in winning and consolidating the rights of the individual, the rights of the many against the few.  It registers the advance made as far as the present time.  It is correct in doing that, but it would not be right for members here to visualise what the legislative advance of the next fifty years would be, and attempt to anticipate the future legislation by recording in the Constitution the aims of the pioneers of to-day.

      <P>It is quite evident from the last two speeches that there is a very different conception of the purpose of a Constitution in the minds of Ministers and in the minds of those of us who are sitting here.  As a matter of practice, as a matter of precedent, we find that Constitutions are usually made at a time when the public <Col N="710" /> mind is flexible and after a leap forward, and it is with the desire that the opinions of the best minds of the best period shall be fixed that Constitutions are made.  It is quite evident in the minds of Ministers and their supporters that we should be as limited, as conservative as possible, and do nothing that would suggest that there has been a revolution, but rather to accept the position which we have arrived at through English legislation with just some little change in the political arrangement of the country and stand at that and not move forward.  Now that is the difference and the complaint.  I think it is a pity that we are not intending to embody in the Constitution the best thoughts of the best period in Irish history.</P>
