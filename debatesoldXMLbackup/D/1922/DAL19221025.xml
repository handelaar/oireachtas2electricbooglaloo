      <P>To ask the Minister of Finance if he will consider:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Permitting the Income Tax of persons engaged in Agriculture, whether under Schedule A or under Schedule B, or both, for the years 1919/20, 1920/21, 1921/22, to be adjusted together, so that losses may be set off against profits.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whether he will suspend the time limit for lodging Farm Income Tax appeals.</P>
      <P>(3)  Further, to ask whether he will return as soon as may be to the prewar assessment of Income Tax under Schedule B, to one-third of the rateable valuation.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where a loss in husbandry is proved for any year, full allowance for that loss can be made against any other liability for the same year.  The suggestion that a loss in farming for any year should be set off against assessable liability for another year is one which it would be impossible to reconcile with the Income Tax law.</P>
      <P>(2) Where reasonable cause is shown it is not the practice in present circumstances to refuse an appeal on the score of time limit.  If the Deputy can let me have particulars of any specific cases in which it is claimed that reasonable latitude has not been allowed, I will have inquiries made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) As stated in my reply to Deputy Runaid on 20th instant, the basis of assessment for 1922/23 has already been <Col N="1892" /> reduced by one-half.  The question as to whether or not a further reduction can be made for 1923/24 will be a matter for the decision of this House next year.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that demands for Income Tax have been received by Rural District Councils in respect of cottages erected under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, and in view of the fact that in practically all these schemes the Revenue derived from rents is not sufficient to meet the repayment of loans and other current expenses, but requires a subsidy from local rates, he would state whether such demands for Income Tax are properly payable by District Councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE MINISTER for FINANCE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>Demands for Income Tax are made on the ground that the net liability for Income Tax is based on the valuation of the cottages. A deduction is allowable in respect of the amount of interest included annually in the repayments by District Councils. This allowance can be obtained on due proof as to the amount of interest being furnished to the Inspector of Taxes.  No <Col N="1893" /> allowance can be made in respect of repayments of loans or other current expenses. Subject to the deductions referred to above the demands for Income Tax are properly payable.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a number of firms in Cork City to whom awards have been made, and compensation claims paid, have, although approached on several occasions by representatives of the Cork Corporation and the Cork Workers' Council, persistently refused to start the rebuilding of the destroyed premises, and whether, in view of the widespread unemployment presently existing in Cork City, he will take steps to compel the firms who have received compensation to start the rebuilding immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE MINISTER for FINANCE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that pressure has been put locally on firms in Cork who expect to have claims for compensation paid in order to secure that such firms should commence rebuilding at once.  The number of firms, however, in whose case awards have in fact been made and compensation actually paid is hitherto small, though it is anticipated that it will greatly increase in the near future.  The arrangement made in Cork that firms wishing to rebuild could obtain advances up to 3/5ths of the amount of the building decree held by them has not been availed of to the extent expected, but I understand that the firms concerned were not anxious to commit themselves until the precise sum payable to them was ascertained.  The present cost of building in Cork is not such as to encourage the prompt placing of contracts and it would appear to be a matter of importance for the City that all parties should consult together with a view to such a reduction in costs as will enable the money available for rebuilding to be applied to the best advantage.</P>

    <P>(1)  If it is not a fact that a large percentage of Civil Servants, victimised for political reasons immediately prior to and after Easter, 1916, have not yet <Col N="1894" /> been reinstated as a preliminary to the full consideration of their cases:</P>
    <P>(2)  When the Tribunal which is being set up by the Government to investigate the claims of the victimised Civil Servants will commence its deliberations:</P>
    <P>(3)  What will be its terms of reference and its personnel, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE MINISTER for FINANCE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>In every case of victimisation of whole-time Civil Servants in Irish Departments, in which the fact of victimisation was clearly established, the Government has reinstated the victimised officer.  Some 70 reinstatements have thus been carried out.  A number of further cases in which it was necessary to make some additional inquiries, or in which the applications were received at a late date, have now been disposed of and instructions for reinstatement have been issued.  In cases in which the fact of victimisation has not been clearly established it is proposed to set up a Committee to consider the merits of each case.  This Committee will also deal with certain cases of alleged victimisation outside Ireland and certain exceptional cases in the Post Office.  I am not yet in a position to make an announcement as to the Terms of Reference and Constitution of this Committee.</P>

      <P>In all three cases the claims to Old Age Pensions were disallowed on ground of age. No evidence as to age was submitted beyond Declarations by aged persons of their belief that the claimants had attained the age of 70 years.  Such information <Col N="1895" /> is helpful in conjunction with other evidence as to a claimant's age, but it will be obvious that the evidence of people who in many cases must be suffering from senility cannot be accepted as conclusive.  In the case of James Hanlon, the evidence afforded by the Declaration was discounted by the records of the Marriage Register which showed that he was married on the 23rd May, 1894, and was at that time 38 years of age.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will consider the question of introducing legislation to exempt from taxation and rates for ten years all new houses that may be built by private builders, within the next two years; or if he will make a grant to builders towards the erection of houses for citizens of Dublin now in urgent need of proper housing accommodation; further, if he is aware that there is an immediate demand for 20,000 houses in the City of Dublin and that the only effort being made to meet that demand is 500 houses per year being built by the Dublin Corporation; also if he is aware that many private builders are anxious to build if assistance is granted.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative, and the proposal will not be considered unless it becomes evident that local authorities advocate a policy of remitting rates in such cases.  The need of Dublin for new houses is fully recognised. The Corporation have at present in various stages schemes involving the erection of 2,000 new houses and the work is being pushed forward as expeditiously as possible.  The number of houses erected in Dublin by other agencies with State aid has been relatively small compared with the activities of private builders in other towns.  The question of continuing grants to private builders for a further limited time will be considered.</P>

May I say that any <Col N="1896" /> six individuals can form a public utility society and can get these concessions?</P>

Is he aware this Department, functioning under the British Government, had paid a bonus of £35 and a third per cent. additional remuneration during the past three sessions to part-time teachers of Irish under the County Wicklow Technical Instruction, and why are these teachers treated in a different manner under an Irish Government?</P>

      <P>The Department's contributions to the scheme of Technical Instruction in County Wicklow this session will be on the same basis as for <Col N="1900" /> last session.  The position is that as a result of increased contributions to the Scheme from local Councils, the committee are proposing to appoint six whole-time and fifteen part-time teachers of Irish, and they have asked the Department to provide the cost of living bonus to the whole-time teachers, and the temporary additional remuneration of 33? per cent., referred to in the question, to the part-time teachers.  This proposal would raise the charge on the Department's funds from £700 paid for last session to £1,450.  As, however, the Department's estimates for the current financial year were prepared before the appointments of the additional teachers now to be engaged were proposed, no provision was made for bonus to the six whole-time teachers, or for temporary additional remuneration to the new part-time teachers to be employed this session.  No increase can now be made in the estimates, and the Department are not, therefore, in a position to undertake any further commitments.  Last session five part-time teachers of Irish were engaged, and as the estimates made provision for the continued employment of that number this year, temporary additional remuneration will be paid by the Department in these five cases, which will be treated in the same manner as in previous sessions.</P>

      <P>The introduction and financing of Land Purchase schemes is bound up with the problem of the financial settlement between Ireland and England.  Negotiations on this are going on at present and will be continued after the Constitution is passed. It will, however, take some months before arrangements are completed.  In the meantime the Land Settlement Commission which is now functioning <Col N="1901" /> under the Provisional Government, is being kept intact as an Arbitration Court and where landlords or owners of land consent there will be no difficulty in making this Arbitration Court available either to fix prices or where new judicial tenancies are being created or to carry out the actual division of the land. Until, however, land purchase legislation is introduced, such sales cannot be financed by the State.</P>

      <P>Most of the officers employed at their trades in the Prisons Service receive additional remuneration either as Engineers with a special scale of pay, Artisan Warders with a special allowance of 10s. a week, or Trade Instructors with allowances at a variable rate up to £28 per annum. In a few instances men and women employed on trial as Trade Instructors receive no allowance and are regarded as qualifying for the grant of the allowance as vacancies arise.  Owing to the extensive repairs necessary in recent years <Col N="1906" /> due to damage caused by prisoners the Prisons Board in August, 1920, obtained the approval of the British Treasury for the employment of not more than thirty additional Temporary Warders with an allowance of 10s. per week when employed as Artisan Warders to carry out structural repairs and alterations.  This sanction was renewed in July, 1921, but was limited to the financial year ended 31st March, 1922.  In March, 1922, the Prisons Board asked the British Treasury for authority to continue the 10s. allowance to temporary warders employed as Artisans and also for sanction for the payment of a similar allowance to permanent warders when fully employed at their trades.  No decision was, however, received and accordingly the payment of the 10s. allowance to temporary warders employed as Artisans ceased on 31st March, 1922.  The employment of prison officers as Artisans enables the Prisons Board to carry out certain work economically and the system has certainly effected a saving. Representations have been made to this Ministry by the Prisons Board on behalf of the officers concerned.  The matter is at present under consideration and the Minister of Finance is being asked to sanction certain recommendations. The question will be settled in the course of a few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my privilege to move that this Bill be now passed. We have been considering it for upwards of a month.  Certain amendments undoubtedly calculated to improve the Bill have been accepted and embodied in the draft, but substantially the Constitution stands as presented to the Dáil. The Constitution confers on Ireland the status of co-equal membership of the British community of Nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It declares that all powers of Government and of authority, legislative, executive and judicial are derived from the people of Ireland.  And if there were more thought in Ireland of those Articles and all that those Article imply, there would, I am confident, be less turmoil in the <Col N="1907" /> country and less difficulty about the acceptance of the Constitution.  It is because things have been happening in Ireland so big and so rapidly that the public mind has failed to grasp them, that there is trouble through the country. And it is because there is in Ireland the irresponsibility of a people that has not been doing its own housekeeping for many a long year and century that the public mind has failed to grasp them.  And I feel that it will take some months, or possibly a longer period of the actual working of this Constitution before people realise to the full the degree of freedom which it bestows. The Constitution, someone said, is the mechanics of Government.  And people will have to see that mechanism at work before the full effect, the full dimensions of the change are brought home to their minds.  The Constitution was an interpretation of the Treaty; and the Treaty conferred on Ireland the Constitutional status of Canada.  And Canada being rather far away people here, many people here, at any rate, have very little idea of the extent of freedom enjoyed by the citizens of that country. Canada is by the full admission of British Statesmen equal in status with Great Britain and is as free as Great Britain.  She has complete control of her own destiny.  The supremacy of the British Parliament over the Dominions has ceased to exist.  They are not subordinate dependencies, but free Nations equal in status to Great Britain and united with her only on the basis of free and friendly co-operation in what is known as the Commonwealth of Nations, as distinct from Empire.  A multitude of statements by responsible statesmen in Great Britain and Canada embody this quality of independence. &ldquo;In actual fact Canada has complete legislative and fiscal independence in the widest sense of the word.  The British Parliament cannot impose laws upon Canada and exercises no control whatever over Canada.  The Crown has no authority in Canada.  It signifies sentiment only.&rdquo;  That is the view of the status of Canada taken by one whom some people consider an eminent constitutional authority.  That is the view and those are the words of Mr. Erskine Childers, ex-T.D.  There has been certain criticism here directed to showing that the Constitution embodies a <Col N="1908" /> cutting down, a dwindling down of the status and rights that the Treaty gave. That, of course, is, and must remain, a matter of opinion.  We have given our opinion.  We gave it here on the day we introduced this Draft, and nothing that has since transpired here has caused us to alter that opinion, and it is that this Constitution is a strict and fair interpretation of the Treaty.  There is at present what is called a political crisis in England.  I think we have reason to congratulate ourselves that to a very large extent we have become independent of political variations in England. I think, too, that looking back on last December we can agree that it was a sound view that there was then a flood tide and all the portents then pointed to the return of party politics in England. You had in power then a political combination which would carry its measures in the House of Commons, and still more important, could carry its measures in the House of Lords, and the signatories took that full tide.  No single Party Government faced with a formidable political opposition could, I believe, carry a settlement such as the Treaty signed last December through both Houses in England.  Only a great political Coalition formed from the two big political parties in England could have carried that, and the most mature political mind we had in Ireland, a political mind and acumen that is now lost to Ireland, saw that, and seeing it acted in strict conformity with its oath and did the best thing for the Irish Nation in the circumstances that had arisen.  Two men signed that Treaty. They have been described here, most aptly described, one as the greatest sower and the other as the greatest reaper that this country has ever known. This Constitution should be prized by the people.  It was won in toil, in danger, and in stress.  It was negotiated on the cliff's edge, and it gives to Ireland the care of her own household.  It puts into the hands of the Irish people the making and moulding, and the amending or repealing of their own laws. It gives them full fiscal control; it gives them power to develop in peace and reconstruction towards the fullness of National life.  And the people of Ireland, despite certain superficial symptoms to the contrary, appreciate that fact, and the people in Ireland will <Col N="1909" /> travel that road of peace and progress and reconstruction, realising that never yet did a country that went to war attain 100 per cent. of its war programme, realising the big thing that has been won, and realising above all the spirit in which it was won, the spirit that brought success and which gives us this to-day.  The greatest man that ever served the cause of an oppressed nation achieved this thing, and having achieved it, gave as the last final proof of his conviction of its worth, his gallant life. In presenting it to our countrymen, we can find no fitter words to use to them than the words he used to them: &ldquo;The country is yours for the making, make it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it right for me to say a word or two on this final stage of this Constitution Bill.  I am one who still thinks, despite the disavowal of the Minister, that the Constitution Bill does not embody all the liberties for Ireland that were contained, or might have been interpreted to have been contained, in the Treaty.  Very shortly after the Treaty was signed and published, I wrote certain words which were endorsed by the Labour Party at a formal Conference, something to this effect&mdash;that the Treaty was the fruit of the effort of the people to whom the political fortunes of the country had been entrusted, that they had done their best, that they believed it was the utmost they could achieve, and we were prepared to do what we could with the political instrument that had resulted from their efforts.  We said then, and we say now, that it does not embody or satisfy the demands of the country for self-determination, and that demand will probably have to be worked for, if not fought for, for quite a long time. Nevertheless we said that so far as the individual citizen was concerned, as distinct from the nation, so far as the individual citizen within the nation, as distinct from the nation within the world of nations, was concerned, the freedom that was granted under the terms of the Treaty was such freedom as would guarantee 999 days out of 1,000 of any individual's life within the nation.  The country has power under this Treaty, and I am willing to admit, <Col N="1910" /> under the Constitution, to control the lives and the fortunes of the citizens for 999 days out of every 1,000 days of the life of the citizens.  We can, I believe, make of the Constitution what we will. From it we can develop and grow into full and complete and absolute national enfranchisement if we will.  But I want to make this demurrer, and it is that while we have achieved, or may achieve, through the instrument of the Treaty and the Constitution, political freedom and enfranchisement, we must continuously bear in mind that political freedom and enfranchisement is but sounding brass and tinkling cymbals unless we use that freedom for the purpose of social, economic and cultural freedom.  I fear that the signs are that we are not going to use the political freedom to achieve social, economic and cultural freedom, social and economic and cultural self-development.  I am afraid that the signs are that we are likely to forget that a greater effort still is required, within the country's own life, to free ourselves from the incubus of capitalism and all the accompaniments of capitalism.  It has been pointed out very eloquently and, I think, subscribed to by the great majority of those who have been thoughtful adherents of the Sinn Fein and Gaelic Movements, that the real subjugation of the life of the people of Ireland was the economic and social and cultural subjugation, and that the political was but an instrument to that end.  And unless we are going to use the political freedom to the end of releasing the country and the people of the country from its other subjections, nothing has been achieved.  After all, nationality, nationhood, is but a means to an end.  Unfortunately too many have thought, and think, that the political institutions, even the social and economic institutions, which they strive to amend and change, are ends in themselves, but they are not; they are institutions and organisations intended so to assist in the development of individual life, the human material that we are and are surrounded by; to mould and develop and improve that humanity, that these institutions exist; and to think of nationhood, of political freedom, and of national Parliaments and political institutions of one kind or another as something to be achieved, and then to finish, is the greatest possible mistake. <Col N="1911" /> You must at all times bear in mind that, great as they are, they are but instruments to a greater end, that end being the development of the individual, the improvement of the race.  And I want to lay stress upon this.  The country is in a state somewhat of fluidity, and it is possible to-day, if we will, to change the habits of thinking, to change the social practices, to change the economic environment during this period of fluidity, whereas if we allow things to stabilise in their present forms, if we allow vested interests to be solidified, we are going to find it very difficult indeed, without a new revolution, to make the country what it ought to be.  I would plead with the Ministers, with the members of the Dáil, and with the public generally, to take advantage of the present opportunities to modify the circumstances which have bound the country to the system, economic, social and cultural, which was imposed for the purpose of maintaining the hold of another and an alien civilisation upon this country.  We must remember that there is with all of us a desire to get the greatest end by the easiest means, and in economic affairs that is tending to the supremacy of the big machine, to wholesale mass production, and, through that wholesale mass production, a driving out of the possibilities of self-development within this country.  If we are not going to face that issue boldly and without too much regard for present vested interests, we are going to find that the political achievement is not going to be of much avail.  We will need to put a barrier&mdash;some kind of an obstacle of a psychological and an economic kind&mdash; upon the desire of the people to get the most for the least.  I am referring to the demand for cheapness in the market commodities; I am now referring to the demand for cheapness in the labour market, the human commodity, as human labour, unfortunately, is considered. We have got to get away from this idea that human labour must be bought as cheaply as possible, irrespective of the consequences to humanity; and that we must be free to buy the things that we require in the cheapest market, irrespective of the consequences to Irish humanity.  And if we do not face the consequences of that principle, we are not going to get anywhere <Col N="1912" /> through this Constitution.  This may seem a little bit distant from the motion that is moved by the Minister, but it is very necessary, in my opinion, that we should direct our minds to the facts underlying the impulses which have led to this political revolution.  It has been a revolution.  We see it round about us; anybody who will look at the obvious things cannot deny it.  We see people in power who a very few years ago would have thought it preposterous to imagine that they were going to sit on Government benches in power, and the old ascendancy accepting their defeat.  It is a revolution.  But let us not forget that there must be something beyond that political revolution, and it must find expression in a change in the material outlook, in the educational outlook, in the social outlook&mdash;a complete change in human relations.  I believe it is possible within this Constitution, faulty as it is, to grow and develop on lines which will mean the re-establishment of a Commonwealth in which humanity has the first place, and property and property relations will be placed in their proper position, secondary to humanity and to human relations.  If we accept that ideal &mdash;if we face the responsibilities that the acceptance of that ideal will impose upon us&mdash;then we can do great things for this country.  But, in accepting that ideal and in accepting those responsibilities, we will have to fight very hard indeed against the tendency to allow the big financial interests&mdash;the international financial interests&mdash;to get a hold upon this country.  The more promise we make for prosperity, the greater the temptation will be for these financial interests to get hold, and I would ask the Minister for Finance particularly to see how easy it would be to do nationally by the nation in its organised capacity, with finance, what the bankers do, in fact, in their own private interests.  We are going, if we are not careful, to put our necks in the noose, and it will only require the will of the financier at some future date to draw tight the noose, and we shall be strangled.  We can, if we will, clear ourselves from that in the earlier stages of our history, but we can only do it by realising that the bankers build upon their faith in the possibility of the social life of the country building up the economic life.  And it is on the <Col N="1913" /> collective effort of the people and their faith in the collective efforts of the people, on whom the bankers make their profit, on which they build their ascendancy. I am asking now that the Ministers will themselves, on behalf of the nation, do this work for the nation without the intervention of these big financial interests.  This, again, I say, is not apart from the motion before the Dáil. It immediately arises out of it, because without an economic future, without a looking beyond the mere political change that has taken place, the political change is going to be of no avail.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have got to the Final Reading of this Bill, because if the Bill must go through in its present form, it is better that it should go through in that way than that it should not go through at all, and I am the first to recognise&mdash;little as I like many of these provisions&mdash;it is better that the Bill should go through in this form than that it should not go through at all.  Now, the Treaty was a big thing, a bad thing in many ways, but necessary, in so far as it was bad, still on the whole a big thing, because it was a big thing to get English Statesmen with all their truculence to sign the document that they did sign.  The Constitution is far less a big thing.  The Minister spoke of attacks upon the Constitution based upon the grounds that they cut down our Treaty rights.  To some extent I think the Constitution does cut down our rights.  Nevertheless, substantially in the big things it secures those rights, and my objection to it, as it now stands, is not so much grounded upon its failure to give us all that the Treaty entitled us to have, as upon the fact, first that many things are expressed vaguely and uncertainly, so that if we have weak Ministries hereafter, England will be in a position to get much more out of this Constitution, as against Ireland, than she should be in the position to get; and secondly that there are other things in the Constitution expressed in a way that is offensive to the National dignity.  A mere matter of form it may be said, but I think that matter of form is important to the Irish Nation, and that is why as one of the signatories I have felt it a duty to protest against these items when they came along in the course of the discussions on the draft, and I am glad to note one change that has arisen in the course of this debate. <Col N="1914" /> As it appeared to me, when the debate was introduced, the Constitution was introduced rather as a natural outcome of the document signed last December, just such as Ireland might very properly expect to have, and I, and other members too, have thought that they have noticed a growing recognition in Ministerial quarters of the fact that the document now presented to us is not the natural interpretation of the document signed last December, but is an interpretation forced by circumstances, so that it is now generally recognised, and the fact is important, for those who come after us, can look back on the record of this difficult time&mdash;it is generally recognised this document is one which would not be in its present form were it not for the duress of present circumstances, and more particularly of the civil war.  That is something to the good.  We have had various amendments which have not gone far to remove the objections that I felt to the Constitution.  We have one amendment which is very important, and upon which I congratulate the Ministry, and that is the insertion of power to amend the Constitution quite easily in more normal times than the present, which is a power that is valuable and a proper power to insert in the Constitution.  So far as I am concerned I recognise one big thing about this Constitution, and it is this, that with all that is bad in it, nevertheless there is there a sufficient volume of substantial good to enable Ireland to go ahead on its own lines without outside interference, and that after all is the thing that matters most. To that extent I am glad to have this Constitution through.  We are now at the stage when this Constitution is through, when Irish Ireland will for the first time have an opportunity of developing upon its own lines, upon the only lines that will make an Ireland worth preserving and an Ireland worth having. Such an Ireland as that we can get when this Constitution has been put into force, because we shall be free to develop upon our own natural lines.</P>

      <P>I was wondering, during the observations of the last Deputy, whether he was torn between two impulses&mdash;to damn the Constitution with faint praise, or the other better impulse of being convinced of its virtues. I have very little to say on this matter, but there are one or two things that <Col N="1915" /> should be said at a stage when we are putting the finishing touches to this international contract.  When this stage is finished Ireland will have discharged her part of the contract, and Ireland, in my judgement, will have achieved the greatest triumph in her history since the Battle of Kinsale.  She will have recovered the vital powers that give her control over her own destiny.  There are limitations in the Constitution, just as there are disagreeable limitations in the lives of every human being.  But there is in the Constitution the principle of growth, and that flexibility which will enable the people of this nation to mould her institutions in a way that will secure, in so far as it is possible to secure, that consideration of humanities upon which Deputy Johnson dwelt with such stress. This is not only a great instrument for national well-being; it is a monument to two great men who have passed away. I believe that future generations, deriving the advantages this instrument will confer upon them, and living in the fulness of the liberty that they will derive from it, and also living within the protection of the development of this Constitution, will bless the names of these two great men.  I think it is only right, when we have reached the closing stages of this debate, that that should be said.  They have discharged their part, and they have given Ireland exemplars of what self-sacrifice and devotion to national duty should be.  The main thing I rose to say is this: when we have finished this stage of the proceedings Ireland will have discharged her part of the contract; it will remain for England to fulfil her part.  I am not suggesting that there will be any action on the part of the British Government which will jeopardise what has been won with so much labour and sacrifice by the Irish nation.  We have to look beyond the mere passing of the Constitution Bill through the British Parliament, and we have to look forward to the equitable carrying into effect of what will arise out of the Constitution, and out of certain decisions which certain of our countrymen may make in the North-East.  We want to use this instrument, and the powers Ireland gets through the Treaty, not as a means to further estrange one section of the Irish people from another. We want to use it to bring together those of our people in the North-East who are <Col N="1916" /> estranged from us, so that there shall be reconciliation and unity and goodwill between all sections.  When the time comes for certain steps to be taken to deal with that situation, we desire that England will stand as faithfully by her part in the transaction as, in justice to the English statesmen who have been responsible for what has been done up to the present, she has done.  I sound that note, not so much as one of warning, but rather as a suggestion.  That is the next great step that Ireland has to consider and it is my fervent hope that the conclusion of this Treaty, in all its implications, will have the result of bringing together, instead of accentuating the present differences of opinion, the people of the North of Ireland with those of the South, and bringing them to realise that their interests are as much bound up and dependent upon the national progress as are the interests of Irishmen, whether they be from Cork, Tipperary, or Dublin. I want to sound that note so that at this stage there will go out to the men of the North-East a message of goodwill from this National Assembly.  The note we wish to strike is one of reconciliation and goodwill, and we hope to see reconciliation and goodwill operating through the medium of the Treaty and the Constitution.</P>

      <P>As is appropriate, my contribution will be very brief.  Since I have, according to the little measure of my powers and opportunities, debated continuously and, I may claim, too, pertinaciously, some of these articles, it is only right that I should give the Constitution mild benediction, now that it leaves the Dáil a very much better instrument than when it entered it. We have now in retrospect to recognise there are at least four very important modifications in the Draft Constitution. all making for betterment.  We have the amendment by which women are recognised as citizens, with all the reasonable and equitable consequences to be drawn therefrom.  We have the further amendment, for which I am particularly grateful, not merely to the Dáil, but in an especial measure to the Ministry&mdash;to wit. the restoration to An Dáil of representation for Universities.  That was made, you will recollect, a non-controversial Article&mdash;the new Article dealing with representation in the Dáil.  The Whips were <Col N="1917" /> not put on, and it was left open, and many Members of the Ministerial Party supported it, not merely in the effective way of voting, but in the still more effective mode of recommendation to the Dáil by speech.  A certain daily paper, commenting upon this amendment, declares: &ldquo;University representation is now embedded in the Constitution. It is so, because it was regarded as a short-cut for the provision of representation to the Protestant minority.  For no other reason would it be tolerable.&rdquo;  Now it is a duty that I owe to my colleagues here, to recognise that the history which that purports to give of this very important and highly valuable amendment of the Constitution, is utterly at variance with what we know to be the correct account.  At no time when this amendment was before the Dáil was it recommended on any such grounds, and one of the chief recommendations of it was that it is one of those alterations which would make our Constitution more characteristically an Irish Constitution as bringing into the construction of the future Ireland elements and influences which belong to our past traditions. There is another amendment which I think we have to congratulate ourselves upon, and that is with regard to the Executive Council; but above all the most valuable, to my mind, is that machinery provided in Article 50 by which any amendment of this Constitution may be made within a period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation. If the Constitution had only a few Articles and that Article as well, it would still be an excellent thing.  I do not suggest at all nor would I be taken to declare that there are things missing from the Constitution that are better away.  I can conceive of amendments&mdash; but I must in justice confess, at the same time, when we bear in mind and have fully present to our recollection all the unfavourable conditions under which the Draft Constitution was conceived, and all the hostile and inimical influences against it being a better document than it might reasonably have been, we ought to be very, very grateful indeed that the Constitution is so excellent a thing as we now behold it.</P>

      <P>I am not rising to take the opportunity of damning the Constitution with faint praise, or for that matter of praising it with faint <Col N="1918" /> damns.  I rose to support the Second Reading because I believed that the machinery embodied in the Constitution was the machinery of freedom; but I believed that that machinery could be improved.  I am rising to support this Final Reading and to urge its passage unanimously because I think that machinery has been improved substantially and materially, improved in many ways, and as a result, we have a Constitution to-day that does bestow freedom on the Irish people.  Possibly one may think that there are certain matters in which that machinery might have been improved even more substantially than it has been.  Those are natural regrets, and one might almost think sometimes that amendments for that improvement might possibly have been received a little more cordially, and I regret to say, sometimes a little more courteously, than they were.  Those are regrets, however, that one necessarily puts behind one.  I recognise, and the entire Dáil recognises, that this is a moment of no ordinary sort in the history of the Nation.  We are bestowing upon ourselves as a Nation a Constitution, and whatever happens in the future, that Constitution will be the fundamental machinery by which we, as a nation, will conduct our own affairs, for ourselves, for our common advantage as a people, and by which we will raise our heads among the nations of this earth and claim that we have in substance, and in very considerable substance, restored to ourselves that dignity that we once held, and now again hold. It is for that reason, and because it is a Constitution in which the Irish people may exercise freedom, that one supports it now, and I think that it would be proper to an occasion like this&mdash;advantage should be taken of a moment of this kind &mdash;to remember that the nation at large is looking upon this scene.  We have had an eye looking on this scene that will report the material substance of what is occurring to the nation at large; but I am thinking not merely of photographs that will report the exterior substance.  I am thinking that generations to come will look upon this scene and will know that here on this day certain work was done, of which we ourselves do not recognise the magnitude because we are living in the midst of these scenes.  Future generations will realise it, and future generations <Col N="1919" /> will prove that freedom was wrought and that the machinery was of such a kind that it could improve itself, and could extend, and it could become supple with use, in order that the nation might develop and in order that the Constitution might develop with the development of the nation.  But in that connection a thought was with me that has not been expressed, and had it been expressed I would not have arisen.  It is this: The nation even now, in spite of many distractions, does recognise that important work is being done, and I believe&mdash;and it is possible I have some inward substance for the belief&mdash;that many people who are now in arms against the will of the Irish people equally will recognise that when this Constitution shall have been passed by this Dáil, and shall have been prescribed by the act of this Dáil, whatever promulgations may hereafter proceed, that that work will have, even for those who are in opposition to this body, a certain finality which they should recognise. They will oppose, and their thoughts will centre around the existence of the person whose name occurs so often in the Constitution&mdash;the king.  But, speaking with the recognition of that dignity and that courtesy that the occasion requires, one can only say here in this country what would be said in any country respecting the dignitary to whom I have referred. I do not know whether any members of this Dáil play the ancient game of chess. We know that in the ancient game of chess the king is a very important person among all the men, but that his moves are restricted to one square at a time, and that he is a target for every other piece.  He is a singularly helpless person, and ultimately if the game proceeds to its conclusion he gets caught, and I think that Kings in Constitutions are like kings in chess, and that really the important piece in the Constitution is that person whoever it may be that is chosen to be the Premier or President. I hope the President of this Assembly will not think I am making any reflection upon him when I say that the most important person on the chess board is the Queen.  The most important person in the Irish State under this Constitution will be the Executive Council that will be responsible to the Legislature set up by the Irish people.  The machinery of this Constitution is such that the King merely becomes ultimately <Col N="1920" /> the voice by which the will of the Irish people is expressed.  I ask if there can be any one thing that the Irish people or any persons in this country desire more than to have that will expressed, because it is in the expression of that will, and not otherwise, freedom can always be attained.  And if they do so desire, or if they have any wish or leaning towards the ultimate expression of that will, at any rate and in any event I do urge, not here merely, but even more widely, that the act of this day, or the act we have now entered upon, should be recognised by the people who are to-day in arms against the authority of this Dáil, and that they should recognise that now that the Constitution has been enacted, though they do not regard certain parts of its machinery with any excess of affection, still that they should nevertheless recognise that when that act is completed on behalf of the Irish Nation it behoves the minority of that Nation to work through and try that act and to come in and put the thing to the test, and to see whether the machinery that will be passed here is or is not necessary to achieve that substance of freedom for the Nation&mdash;that substance of freedom for the Nation being that the Nation desires to live a certain form of life.  And that the desire of the Nation can be achieved by the machinery of legislative and Executive functions, and that is what this Constitution does.  For that reason I support it here as I supported it before, and for that reason I would like to take this particular opportunity &mdash;perhaps a person unfitted for it&mdash;to urge upon my fellow-countrymen who are to-day in arms against the Irish people that now that the Irish people through their Legislative Assembly, through this Constituent Assembly, have decided upon this Constitution&mdash;that they should recognise that act as having a certain finality though not the restricted finality that at one time appeared to be possible before Article 50 was amended into its present form, and to recognise that there should be peace in this country, and by means of this Constitution advantage taken of the opportunity that seldom befalls any people.  Because we here can start development to-day.  To use the language of the sporting men we can start from scratch.  We can experiment in freedom as no nation to-day can experiment in freedom.  By means of <Col N="1921" /> the expression of the will of the Irish people in and through this Constitution we can achieve that object to which Deputy Johnson has so eloquently referred, that is the economic freedom and social freedom without which freedom is merely a thing spelled with letters and has no actuality at all.  I urge, therefore, that not merely this Dáil should pass the Constitution and pass it unanimously, but that in the same spirit this Nation should also pass it and pass it expressly with consent and unanimously, working it for all it is worth in the common advantage of all, and to the utmost advantage of each.</P>

    <P>This Constitution, to my mind, is, as the Minister for Home Affairs carefully said, a strict but fair interpretation of the Treaty.  It may not be everything that everyone would desire in this country, but what it lacks are not things that are of really material essential value.  They are the trimmings that might be sentimentally valuable but substantially they are of very little consequence. The thing that really matters is we have in this instrument here now the framework and machinery without which a country cannot proceed in its own way to do its work by its own methods. Deputy Johnson seems to have some doubts about what this country may do <Col N="1924" /> when it begins to operate under this Constitution.  He believes it might ally itself with agencies that might be detrimental and possibly disastrous and that vested interests and great combines of wealth might be availed by Ministers to the disadvantage of the general interests of the community.  Well I think that every individual in the community has vested interests, and I think that the vested interest in the right to live is one of the greatest vested interests in any community, and I think that is the vested interest which the country is likely to pay most attention to in the future and not vested interests which enable men to create monopoly and to engage in all sorts of combinations that will bring them wealth and affluence.  The most important thing for the country to consider will be the thing that any Government that is likely to receive the support of the people is bound to do and that is to see that the general body of the community are only considered and considered not so much in realition to their ability to accumulate wealth or to become very distinguished but to see that so far as possible the people of the country will be in such a way that if they are to succeed in the world they will not be prevented by any obstacle except something that is inherent in themselves and for which no arrangement can be made.  Deputy Gavan Duffy says that the Constitution has faults, and that it contains in itself things that are faulty.  I really cannot see where the faults in the Constitution lie.  I really believe that as a Constitution, so far as it was permissible within the terms of the Treaty, it is absolutely without fault from the point of view of a Nation like ours that wishes to proceed on its own lines and to do its own work.  Amendments made have been claimed credit for, and Deputy Magennis claims credit for four essential amendments that made great improvements in the Constitution, and particularly the one that deals with the right to amend the Constitution at any time and which secures University Representation.  These are amendments that are involved in the Constitution no doubt.  Now, I think that Deputy Figgis has fully estimated the importance that attaches to these little trimmings that are put into the Constitution.  England, of course, must have precedent, and must <Col N="1925" /> follow formula in these things.  I suppose there are a certain amount of precedents that we are not free to break through, but I think this Bill lacks very little that the country had really at any time stood for.  It reminds me about a little squabble we had in our district about a steamship Sunday service.  The owner was a Sabbatarian.  After a lot of agitation it was agreed that we should get the steamship service, but there was one condition, and that was that the steamer should not whistle.  I think that applies to this Constitution&mdash;the whistle is not in it.  There are a lot of men going about and kicking up a big row because they are not allowed to whistle. Well, they may be able to whistle later on, if not &ldquo;The Marsellaise,&rdquo; at least &ldquo;A Nation Once Again,&rdquo; when they get into deep water, but not at the present time.  I support the passing of this Constitution, and I believe the Ministry deserve every credit for the attention and energy and earnestness they have concentrated on this business. I believe the Constitution itself provides for the nation a machine that, if it is properly used, will, despite the prognostications of Deputy Johnson, do the work in Ireland, and that we will have very few complaints to make.</P>

Bhí roint chainnte i dtaobh Airtiogail 50, ach do réir an Artiogail seo is féidir linn an Bun-reacht d'atharú gan pioc trioblóide i rith na n-ocht mblian so chughainn.  Nuair a bhíomair ag déanamh díosbóireachta ar an gceist seo d'aithnighmair go raibh a lán sa Bhun-reacht so nár thuigeamair i gceart, nár thuigeamair i gceart a mbrí, agus dá bharr san bhí eagla orainn go mbeadh a lán trioblóide 'na thaobh agus go mbeadh a lán oibre i sna Cúirteanna le linn na huaire.  Mar sin tá slí againn san Airtiogal so chun rudaí beaga do cheartú gan an sgéal mór do phlé arís, agus sin é an fáth go gcuirimíd Airtiogal 50 mar atá sé.  Ach tá fhios ag gach éinne anso ná fuil comhacht againn an Rí do chur amach as an mBun-reacht.  Má cheapann aon duine gur féidir linne rudaí do chur sa Bhun-reacht ná ceaduíonn an Connradh do dhéanamh tá breall air.</P>
      <P>Mar atá an Bhun-reacht anois fanfaidh, agus is maith an rud dúinn an méid sin do thuisgint.  Tá súil agam ná fuilimíd ag smaoineamh ar na rudaí atá in aigne Theachta Ghabháin uí Dhubhthaigh, ach ar aire do thabhairt do leas na tíre agus do leas na ndaoine, chun sláinte agus saol na ndaoine d'fheabhasú, agus an Ghaedhilg do chur chun cínn.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To delete the word `Ireland's' in the fourth line of the preamble and to insert the words `of Ireland' in the same line between the word `unity' and the word `shall,' and to insert the word `the' between the word `that' and the word `National.'

I would ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he will refer to Article 11 when he will see that it does not exactly carry out, in the words that appear, the suggestion that was agreed to, in order to obviate certain awkwardness in wording. To read it as a short sentence, without parenthesis, as I did once before:&mdash;&ldquo;All the lands and waters, mines and minerals within the territory of Saorstát Eireann hitherto vested in the State shall belong to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  You have three titles there.

      <P>I desire to support Deputy Johnson in asking for your ruling in that direction: I originally <Col N="1933" /> moved the Article as it now stands. You have already discussed this matter in sub-Committee.  The whole of that Committee's recommendations was not adopted by the Dáil, but those recommendations included a provision which, if it were here, would make it quite clear that it was then intended that people not members of the Dáil may be members.  A provision was even made that the Ministers, including the Executive Council, who were members of the Dáil would be a majority.  So if this amendment were moved with the idea that it was calculated to restore what was the mind of the Dáil and the intention of the Dáil, as I say must be the case, then it was moved under a misapprehension.  When it was before the Dáil originally the clear intention&mdash;of the mover at all events&mdash; was that the Article should leave it open to the Dáil to decide whom it should have as Ministers from outside.  Obviously what the Deputy proposes is a great deal more than a verbal change. The report of the Committee bears that out.</P>

      <P>Members of the Dáil know that most of the Ministers favoured the original Executive proposals which involved the selection of Ministers, other than from amongst the members of the Dáil.  Therefore, this amendment is not with a view to carrying out any considered opinion or any considered wish of ours, but it is because the whole trend of the discussion <Col N="1934" /> here on the Executive proposals showed that that was the very thing in the Executive proposals that the majority of the members of the Dáil objected to, and the fact that they had not explicitly barred selection of Ministers other than from amongst members of the Dáil was merely an inadvertance on their part.  There is very little doubt if they had adverted to the fact that they had not entirely closed the door on that process of selection that they would not merely have closed it, but have banged that door.  That was quite clear from the discussion here and the general tenor of the speeches made on the proposals. Facing the fact honestly in consultation amongst ourselves in the Cabinet, we thought it right to put down that amendment, simply to carry out what we well knew to be the wish of the members.  It is entirely now a matter for the members themselves as to whether they will accept it.</P>

      <P>I would point out so far from that argument as to the will of the Dáil having weight, the amendment in question was only carried by a majority of one.  So far as the will of the Dáil is concerned that cannot be considered to be a decisive vote, inasmuch as Deputy Magennis pointed out several times that there were two questions involved.  Undoubtedly on the last stage of the discussion on this Bill this question would have been raised and points would have been insisted upon in the course of the discussion and votes would have been taken but for the fact that the form of the Bill, as presented to us, was as it now stands in respect of this Clause.  In view of these circumstances, and in view of the Standing Order, I submit that there is no option but to declare that this is not an amendment of a verbal character, but an amendment of substance, and would raise a new discussion on the principle of whether there should be compulsion or should be any option whatever to the Dáil to nominate a man or woman as Minister who is not a member of the Chamber.  The matter is left open.</P>

      <P>I recollect the circumstances and I claim very distinctly there was a vote against the proposal to have Ministers selected from outside the membership of the Dáil, and that was negatived on two occasions by vote. <Col N="1935" /> In the first case it was complicated with a provision that if a member of the Dáil were selected as one of those in-and-out Ministers that he was to surrender his seat.  The &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in that clause was withdrawn and then by the Committee of which Deputy Fitzgibbon was Chairman another clause was introduced with what would seem to me at the time limitations.  Undoubtedly the clause as it stands is the form in which it was proposed by Deputy Gavan Duffy &mdash;&ldquo;Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council may be nominated by the Chamber.&rdquo;  What helps my recollection of this is that I contested the form of words for quite a long time.  What was really the sense of the Dáil, at least, was represented by that slight majority to which Deputy Johnson refers.  The sense was that those non-Executive Council Ministers should not be selected from non-members of Parliament, but I do not think it could be contended that they were to be drawn exclusively from members of Dáil Eireann.  Whether or not there was room left for the selection from the Senate I think is rather a difficult question, so that perhaps from that point of view it is more than a case of rectification of an error to introduce these words.</P>

      <P>Apart from the ambiguity as to whether Ministers might not be selected from the Senate, I think it is agreed that, unless implicitly barred, Ministers may be selected who would be members of neither Seanad nor Dáil.  It is right to say that if this particular amendment is not accepted the Bill will probably have to go back to Committee, because there is this point that if Ministers are appointed who are not members of the Dáil, it is insisted on the other side that such Ministers shall comply with Article 17 as if they were members of the Dáil.  They would not agree to Executive proposals that would involve Ministers from outside the Dáil, unless the Dáil were to make compliance with Article 17 compulsory on such Ministers.  Therefore, if we do not bar such Ministers by the acceptance of this amendment we will have to send the Bill back to Committee to insert an Article to the effect, that if outside members are selected they shall comply with Article 17.</P>

      <P>The Dáil appointed a committee, and Deputy Professor Magennis pointed out that the resolution about the committee had for its principal sentence: &ldquo;That this House approves of the general principle of the proposal that certain Ministers need not be members of the Dáil.&rdquo;  The committee considered that proposal and brought in certain clauses putting that into practice, and the committee's report was rejected, and by people I am quite clear, who believed they were voting against the idea that anybody could be a Minister that was not a member of the Dáil.  That was quite clear.  I suppose Deputies turned up specially to vote against any such proposal, and, having voted against it, they went away.  They did not remain for the committee stage to see that none of the things to which they objected would, by any Parliamentary sleight of hand, get into the Constitution, and things did get into the Constitution, and the Constitution as it stands does not coincide with that particular vote of the Dáil, rejecting the report of the Select Committee.  This amendment on the paper now is an attempt which might have been made at the last reading, but which is being made now to clear up the position.  The amendment is not in order now as a verbal amendment to the Bill, but you can take it by special leave, and discuss it.</P>

If there were general agreement to make any amendment that is one thing, but to use a majority to destroy the Standing Orders in face of opposition, just to carry a particular clause which is out of order, according to the Standing Order under which you have been working, I <Col N="1937" /> submit is an abuse of the procedure under which we have been working, and ought not to be allowed.  The Minister has pointed out that there will be need for reference back to a Committee to secure one particular provision.  I do not suppose there will be strong opposition to that.  This matter that is now under discussion is of very great importance. As has been suggested, if you are going to restrict these non-Executive Council members of the Ministry to the Dáil, that is an imposition upon members who support the proposition that Senators may be appointed as Ministers. As it stands it is open to the Dáil to nominate members of the Senate as Ministers.  If you alter it, as is suggested, that will not be possible, and I submit you have there a very considerable and vital alteration in the form of the Constitution, and it ought not to be altered by a mere misuse of the forms of procedure.</P>

If the Ministers think that in the clause as it stands there must be inserted in Committee somewhere or another a reference to Article 17, the Bill will have to go back to Committee for that.  If it is going back to Committee at all, would it not be better for Ministers or somebody else to move to re-commit the Bill now?  It is a matter which must be inherent in the power of the Assembly, to resolve itself into Committee in a matter like this.  In Committee you could have a straight vote on the clause as it stands, or we could make necessary alterations in reference to Clause 17.

      <P>As far as the new amendment now suggested is concerned, it meets the real vital issue of the case. It would have to be by general agreement. I would say that Deputy Johnson's point is a very good one.  The fact that the opportunity was not availed of by these very energetic Deputies who did not agree with the Article as originally framed&mdash;the fact that they did not rectify the infirmities of that Article as subsequently submitted and adopted is <Col N="1939" /> certainly a point that we would scarcely contest with Deputy Johnson.  This particular amendment would meet the case if it is generally agreed upon.  It gets in what has come to be a vital issue in this matter.  We all admit that no Minister would get any advantage or derive any advantage that the members of the Executive Council did not derive or possess; that is that a Minister should not be excluded from the obligations of Article 17 or from the other obligation of being appointed by the representatives of the Crown.  That was not our intention, but it was so construed and it was incorrectly interpreted.  If this amendment be accepted it will meet the case and it will also meet Deputy Johnson's point.  Certain members had very particular objection to what are called extern Ministers and they were unable to rectify the Article at the time when they should have rectified it.</P>

      <P>So far as the withdrawal of the amendment goes, I am delighted.  So far as the other amendment goes, the difficulty, I feel, is this.  Ministers take the view that this Article 17 must be applied to every future Minister under the Constitution. I venture to differ on the ground, that I see nothing whatever from beginning to end of the Treaty that could prescribe any such thing.  Article 17, following Article 4, must apply to Members of Parliament, but where do they get the theory from, that it must apply to other people?  If I am alone in taking this objection, I should not feel myself justified <Col N="1940" /> in holding up the Bill.  On the other hand, I do not want to be taken as assenting to what I consider a very strange view.  I dissented from a sub-committee on this very same question. I suggest that the thing go through as it stands now, that British Ministers have no right to impose any fancy view of their own upon it.  The Treaty speaks. for itself&mdash;is there or is there not any definite ground which makes Ministers. think that there will be trouble about this thing in London, I mean trouble caused by a legitimate claim by the other side?  Viewing the thing, as the words are written in the Treaty, I fail to see where the difficulty can come in. Therefore, if I am the only one to take this objection, I do not want to hold the matter up, but I strongly protest against the insertion of unnecessary words, because forsooth the English beyond may ask questions when this Constitution is through.</P>

Now; on a former occasion, with regard to the report of Deputy Fitzgibbon's Committee, the Chief Whip of the Ministerial Party reminded us of a regulation by which a matter decided cannot be brought up again within six months.

    <P>&ldquo;Article 74.  To alter paragraph 2 so as to read:&mdash;`Goods transported during <Col N="1944" /> the said current financial year from or to the Irish Free State, to or from any part of Great Britain or the Isle of Man or any part of Ireland which may be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State, shall not, except so far as the Executive Council may otherwise direct, in respect of the forms to be used and the information to be furnished, be treated as goods exported or imported, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a verbal alteration.  If it is ruled to be other than a verbal alteration I cannot press it, but it seems to me that to use the words &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; in this clause is not the intention of the Minister, inasmuch as the Constitution itself has created a relationship between Ireland and Great Britain which nullifies that term, and consequently it could not be intended that the words &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; should remain.  The suggestion is that the paragraph should be altered to &ldquo;Goods transported during the current financial year to or from the Irish Free State, to or from any part of Great Britain or the Isle of Man, shall not, except so far as the Executive Council may otherwise direct in respect of the forms to be used and the information to be furnished, be treated as goods exported or imported, as the case may be.&rdquo;  There is a suggestion, which I accept, to leave out the words &ldquo;any other part of Ireland which may be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  It may meet the situation and may be a better form to say &ldquo;From any part of Great Britain, Ireland or the Isle of Man, leaving out the words &ldquo;Or any part of Ireland which may be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  If we say &ldquo;Ireland, Great Britain, or the Isle of Man,&rdquo; that may be satisfactory to Ministers and convey the same idea without using the words &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; which is a misnomer.</P>

      <P>There are no more verbal amendments to be moved to the Bill, and very little has been said in the course of the discussion on this last reading which calls for comment. It is right to say that we are satisfied that whatever Government emerges from the present break-up in English politics that the Treaty and all honourable implications of the Treaty will be observed and adhered to.  We have no misgivings on that point, and we do not think that anyone else need have misgivings on that point.  If we were asked to suppose the unthinkable, and to suppose that attempts would be made by a future Government in England to tamper with the Treaty, or anything that flows naturally or honourably from the Treaty, then our attitude in such a condition of things would be quite simple.  There will be nothing complex about it; and certain little fishes who have been straining themselves to talk like whales since last December might have an opportunity of showing their form.  One thing more: we have no other policy for the North-East of Ireland than we have for the rest of Ireland.  We have no policy but the Treaty policy, and we are going ahead with that.  This Constitution has been framed for all Ireland, and it is a Constitution under which all Irishmen can live in peace and charity with their neighbours, and we wish for nothing more heartily than that&mdash;to all Irishmen, whether they be from the extreme North or the extreme South or the North-East or South-West, if the Northern Parliament decides to opt out from the jurisdiction of the Free State, then they must take the very natural and logical consequences of that; and we have nothing to stand on except upon our Treaty rights.</P>

      <P>In Article 82 of the Treaty particulars are set down as <Col N="1948" /> to how the first Senate shall be constituted, and that practically follows out the agreement which was entered into by the late President Griffith and the representatives of the Southern Unionists. Now, this resolution was one which the late Mr. Griffith undertook to move at the Session or meeting of Parliament which would adopt this Constitution.  It is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that the President of the Executive Council, in nominating the nominated members of the Senate, should, with a view to the providing of representation for groups of all parties not adequately represented in the Chamber, consult with representative persons and bodies, including the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Chamber of Commerce, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Benchers of the Honourable Society of King's Inns, Dublin, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, Councils of the County Boroughs of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have agreed as far as the Ministry is concerned, and I think most members of the Dáil to whom I have spoken agree, that the contract entered into by President Griffith should be kept by us. It was a fair bargain to satisfy those who thought they were being at least politically excluded from having any part or control or co-operation in the Government of the country.  It has been put to us by representatives of these men that although their points of view differ from us in many things they can bring to bear on matters which are of great public concern a line of thought that we are unacquainted with.  If by including such an order in the Oireachtas, goodwill may be established between all sections of the community, and that we can bring home to these people the fact that we are prepared to work with them for the good of the country, I think that very much good may be accomplished by reason of that fact.  For a generation people who are mainly concerned in this proposal have been divorced from close association with the people, and it is hoped to bring them into close association and to get the benefit out of their co-operation in that direction.  I formally move the motion.</P>

      <P>There is just a point that arises in connection with this proposal.  I am not opposing it, but I think it well to draw attention to the wisdom of consulting not only these particular societies but other organisations that are entitled to be consulted, representing the Northern parts of Ireland. It seems to me that it would be desirable to take advantage of the opportunity to invite representation from that part of Ireland which has not been represented here, on to the Senate, and that representative people from the North-East corner&mdash;the Six Counties&mdash; whether nominated by Chambers of Commerce or the Royal College of Physicians or the College of Surgeons or other societies, or perhaps even by the Trades Council of Belfast or of Derry, may well be brought into consultation, and consider whether they might be prepared to nominate (or consent to be nominated by the President) persons representing labour interests in that part of Ireland.  It is within the competence, as I read the Constitution, to make Senators of men or women from that part of the country, who would be prepared to act and show that there is a unity despite the possible dissension of the majority, that there is a unity with the rest of the country in the minds at least of a very large section of the residents in the Northern part of Ireland.  I would urge upon the President that when he is consulting these various bodies that he should bear in mind, and ask them to bear in mind, the wisdom of nominating representatives who live and move and have their being in that part of the country called Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Representative of the National University it is, I fear, incumbent upon me to obtrude myself&mdash;though just for a few minutes at most&mdash;into the consideration of this matter.  It was, I think, on the 18th September last that the President of An Dáil either read to us or circulated a copy of that compact which the late President Arthur Griffith and the present Minister for Home Affairs of the one part, entered into with certain representatives of Southern Unionists of the other part. Now in that document, which I studied very carefully, and I have read more than once in the interval, it is stated that <Col N="1950" /> the representation to which the present motion of the President of An Dáil refers as representation for all parties not adequately represented in the Chamber, was to be a representation for the minority party, a representation, that is, for what was formerly known as the Southern Unionists.  Many of them, we know, repudiate that description now, and would regard it as offensive to apply it to them, but inasmuch as it is a term used in that minor Treaty it might be more convenient&mdash;and I protest my intention is not to be offensive in any sense&mdash;to continue to use the term.  In that agreement representation was to be secured in some fashion in the Senate for certain bodies the political complexion of which was understood to be describable by the term Southern Unionist. Now amongst the bodies to be consulted for the purpose of securing this minority representation in the Senate, which otherwise could not be secured in An Dáil, a certain number of bodies were set out as to be consulted, and they are set out here again.  There was, as I read it, a danger that once the nominees were elected to the Senate, that they might be thought to take their places there by virtue of some professional pre-eminence, and that the political origin of their being specially nominated might be lost sight of as historical fact.  You can easily see what the consequences of that might be as regards other professional bodies&mdash;I hasten to say, before I develop my point, that I congratulate the President on the mode in which he has obviated, so far, I think, as words can go to obviate, the possibility of any such misunderstanding, and it is merely to put it on record on behalf of the National University of Ireland, that I am now speaking on the matter&mdash;there was, I say, reason to fear that when representatives chosen, say, on the recommendation of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland should take their seats in the Senate, that the public would look up to these as being the men of mark in the Medical Profession, selected because they were outstanding men in the Medical Profession, and then it would appear as if medical men, graduates of the National University, for example, occupied some species of inferior status to those other men whom the late President and others desired to do honour <Col N="1951" /> to, although our graduates are men who deserve well of their country.  I think it therefore incumbent on me, even at the risk of being wearisome and tedious, to impress upon the Dáil this fact that in the present motion of the President it is declared &ldquo;that it is expedient to consult with representative persons and bodies, including the following.&rdquo; This consultation is not limited to these bodies; I take it there is implied in this an undertaking to consult with other representative bodies as well.  Now, the bodies mentioned are the Chambers of Commerce; they, of course, would be able to inform the President of An Dáil as to who in their bodies are men of eminence in business and commercial circles, who by reason of their political predilections would possibly not find favour with the electorate.  I take it that the Chambers of Commerce are intended to give light and counsel with regard to commercial and industrial Unionists. Now we come to the Benchers of the Honourable Society of the King's Inns, Dublin.  That body, I think&mdash;I speak subject to the correction of Deputy Fitzgibbon&mdash;along with the Bar Council of Ireland, represents the barristers&mdash;the principal branch of the Legal Profession in Ireland&mdash;and here again, if members eligible for nomination to the Senate are recommended by this body, it will, of course, again be under the compact with the late President Griffith because they are Southern Unionists, and not because they are the most distinguished lawyers in the country.  And then again, the next body to be consulted is the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, and that undoubtedly is the official body associated with the solicitors' profession &mdash;the other branch of the Legal Profession in Ireland; and once more it is necessary to bear in mind that when that body recommends candidates for election to the Senate it is because the recommending body regards them as Southern Unionists who require this assistance to bring them into the new Parliament of Ireland.  These recommendations are all because of the pact made by President Griffith.  Now, I would not have spoken at such length only that I believe it was most necessary to have it impressed upon the Dáil that when the President put into the present motion the words, &ldquo;including the following,&rdquo; he is divesting the original document <Col N="1952" /> embodying the pact of a great-deal of what to us, in the National University, was highly objectionable because, if you bear this in mind, the College of Physicians of Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, form a conjoint body, for conferring medical degrees, or rather licences to practise.  They represent one licencing body; Trinity College, or Dublin University represents another.  The National University, which has three medical schools&mdash;one an exceptionally large and important medical school in Dublin, another in Cork, and another in Galway&mdash; represents a third.  Now here is a licencing body, <i>pari passu</i> with the licencing body mentioned in the pact, and I do not intend, and hope I shall not be taken as intending, even in the remotest way to suggest any reflection on the body named here.  It is merely to secure equality and to obviate any possible misunderstanding with regard to the result that shall be attained by the President when the recommendations of these bodies come up with the list of their nominees.</P>

      <P>I welcome the determination of the Ministers to consult Commerce, Science, and the Law, and I presume they will also consult the Engineers and other eminent Societies, but in consulting these bodies I would wish the Minister to assure me, or to assure himself rather, that there is some reformation in the mode of election to Fellows of these Colleges.  Now, the first College on the list is the College of Physicians.  I have been told by very eminent physicians in the City of Dublin, men who have worked for a very considerable number of years, worked practically all their lives and stand at the head of their profession, that it is next door to impossible to be elected to a Fellowship to the College of Physicians if they do not wear the cloak of the University of Dublin, of Trinity College; while at the same time men of practically no experience, or of a few years' standing, no eminence whatsoever, will be pitchforked into it if they have the appendage of Trinity College.  Now if such is the case, if I have been rightly informed that such is the case, I hope the Minister will bring pressure to bear on these Colleges&mdash;the College of Physicians in particular has been instanced. and I suppose the same thing holds good <Col N="1953" /> with the College of Surgeons&mdash;that there will be reformation in the mode of election of the governing body of these Colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk about having consulted the College of Surgeons and the College of Physicians instead of some other body. We have eight doctors at present in the Dáil.  I think whatever the other Body is, the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons are very well represented here.  Possibly there are some representatives of the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons amongst these eight doctors.  I believe there are two or three members, perhaps more, but that is not the point.  There is no imputation either upon the bodies included or the bodies excluded.  The real idea, I think, in the minds of those who put up that proposition was that it is from such Institutions as those mentioned that you would get representation that was not then in the Dáil.  Possibly <Col N="1954" /> now after the Elections a different set of propositions would have been put up, but at that time those were the bodies from whom the representatives of what were called Southern Unionists thought they would get that leavening.  We all know that the late Dáil was exclusively a political body.  Politics were the whole substance out of which it was composed.  Now this Dáil is not so constituted. We have very respectable orders of the community&mdash;Labour, Farmers, Doctors and Universities.  I know, too, one gentleman who sought to impress upon myself and other Ministers the rights of women.  I think he was responsible for the exclusion of a lady from this Dáil.

      <P>However, that is the case we are putting up with regard to this Seanad.  We hope this Seanad will be a success.  It will be very largely responsible for the success of the Oireachtas.  If bad feeling should be raised between the two Houses, then the Seanad will be of no use.  If good feeling, goodwill and co-operation are the result of the relations between the two Houses, then I think there is little doubt that they will be a success.  It is for that we hope, and in order to bring that about I am utterly indifferent as to the type or style of individual that will be in that House.  I note what Deputy Johnson says about bringing in somebody from the North, but he will observe it is from groups not adequately represented in the House it is proposed to select.  If, for example, the North were to accept that co-operation and that good feeling that I believe every single member of this Dáil entertains towards the North, I am satisfied that you would have both a different Dáil here and a different Seanad.  But if that be not the case, do we serve any useful purpose in bringing in those Deputy Johnson desires&mdash;I mean that particular order?  What will happen here, to my mind, is this, if the Oireachtas of the Free State be run on the basis which I believe is the intention and the hope of every member of this Dáil, the days of the North keeping out are very few and we will live to see them coming in, and coming in in that way&mdash;impressed with the solid work we <Col N="1955" /> are carrying on&mdash;will be the best way to get them in.</P>

I have that assurance from the Minister responsible.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to the fact that we in our Standing Orders adopted a certain Committee in Procedure, but nothing was done in that because of the pressure of business.  You may give that your attention in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Motion made and question put: &ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn to Wednesday, November 1st.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
