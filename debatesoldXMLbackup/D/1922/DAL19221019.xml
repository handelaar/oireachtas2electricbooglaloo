      <P>I am proceeding with Amendment 40 <i>(b).</i> Amendment 40 <i>(a)</i> was withdrawn in consonance with the acceptance of two earlier amendments.  The amendment that remains should, I suggest, take its place, if adopted, after Article 43, amongst the other legislative provisions. It is strictly a legislative provision, whereas those I accepted yesterday more strictly came amongst the Articles dealt with under &ldquo;Fundamental Rights.&rdquo; My amendment reads: &ldquo;To substitute after Article 43, and before Article 44, of the present draft the following:&mdash;`The utilisation of water-power and the production of electrical energy is placed under the control of the Parliament/Oireachtas, and Parliament/Oireachtas shall from time to time prescribe the manner in which this control shall be exercised, so as to safeguard the public interest and to ensure proper development and use.' &rdquo; It is not my intention at very great length to develop a case for the insertion of such an article as this, because it occurs to me that the case is more or less obvious and apparent.  I would suggest to the Minister for Home Affairs that it would be germane to the consideration of such an Article as this to consider that a case has already been made out in the practice of other countries on this very matter.  The case of Switzerland has been frequently referred to in this Chamber when dealing with different parts of the Constitution.  There is an Article in the Swiss Constitution dealing with this exact matter.  It is numbered 24 <i>(a).</i> and it deals with the utilisation of water-power under the supreme control of the Federation.  The Article at some length, <Col N="1740" /> and with considerable detail, sets forth exactly the legislative restrictions upon the exercise of that water-power.  What I wish to draw the Minister's attention to is that this Article in the Swiss Constitution is not an original Article.  It is an amendment that was adopted by referendum in the year 1908.  The Constitution was originally devised in 1848 and was revised in 1867, and this Article found its way by way of amendment in 1908, by a very huge vote&mdash;21½ cantons as against a half canton, or 304,000 votes as against 56,000 votes.  I point to that for this reason, that this Article in the Swiss Constitution, dealing with the very matter intended to be covered by the amendment which I am now proposing, found its way there because of the teachings of necessity&mdash;that, unless some such provision were made as a constitutional provision, the country failed to protect itself in the development of its resources of power, and failed to ensure that development in the most economical way.  The dangers experienced in Switzerland were twofold, and I just allude to them briefly in order to bring them before the attention of the Ministry and of the Dáil.  The first was that until that Article was embodied in the Constitution it was found that foreign corporations were using Swiss water-power for foreign purposes, and it was also found that people&mdash;Swiss citizens&mdash;who held small water-powers in one place or another, were developing here at this particular point 50 h.p., where. apart from their obstruction, of larger development, it would have been possible to have developed in some other place on the same river a considerably higher water-power.  The matter is very technical, and it has been examined in this country at very great length.  I think it has been examined in this country recently by a body set up by an earlier Dáil, and called a Commission of Inquiry. It has been examined by that Commission at greater length and with greater detail than has ever been given to this matter in this country before, certainly far greater detail than one could expect to give it in debate in this House. It was to obviate such a debate that it was appointed.  Here are the conclusions of this Commission&mdash;the technicians attached to which gave special attention to the matter:&mdash;&ldquo;That all water resources and rights should be vested in the State. <Col N="1741" /> That the State should encourage sound water-power schemes by paying a bonus on every h.p. developed.  That, as far as possible, the current generated in hydro-electric stations should be of a standard type, and also that the State should exercise sufficient control over the development of water powers to ensure <i>(a)</i> that all proposed schemes are economic; <i>(b)</i> where the development of a water-power interferes with existing rights and properties, that private compensations are equitable, that interests of greater value to the nation are not sacrificed for power development, and that the development of power is not prohibited by interests of less national importance; and (c) that all schemes within each catchment should tend to give the best total output for that catchment area.&rdquo; After careful investigation this body came to the conclusion that those objects, which it considered to be vital and necessary for the development of water-power resources could only be attained efficiently and economically if the State undertook the supreme control by vestment of the entire water-power resources of this country, and I may say that this Article has been very carefully considered by electrical engineers and by certain competent authorities, and has been reduced down to as small and as compact a form as the importance of the subject warrants.  And it is considered in this form to give just that degree of vestment that is adjudged to be necessary if this country is to get the best value out of its slender water-power resources, and if we are not to have those water-power resources raided by those in this country who are not primarily concerned with the development of this country for the advantage of the citizens in it, and it is in order to safeguard public interests as the amendment reads. It is to ensure that proper development and use that the intention of this amendment is that by an Article embodied in the Constitution, these rights should be ensured to the Free State, and for that object, and with that intention in view, I move that that amendment be accepted by this Dáil and embodied in the Constitution before the report be accepted.</P>

      <P>The case against <Col N="1742" /> the amendment is that it tends to redundancy in the Constitution, because the object of the proposed amendment is already secured in an amendment which was accepted yesterday, and which I moved.  In order to place these two matters in direct juxtaposition in the minds of members it would be well, if I read out both.  Deputy Figgis' amendment is:&mdash;&ldquo;The utilisation of water power and the production of electrical energy is placed under the control of the Parliament/Oireachtas, and Parliament/ Oireachtas shall from time to time prescribe the manner in which this control shall be exercised, so as to safeguard the public interest, and to ensure proper development and use.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, turning to Amendment 20, which we passed yesterday, and following the very excellent lead which Deputy Figgis gave us, leaving out mere relative clauses and parentheses, we find:&mdash;&ldquo;All the lands and waters, mines and minerals, within the territory of the Irish Free State, and also all the natural resources of the same territory (including the air and all forms of potential energy) belong to the Irish Free State, and shall be controlled and administered by the Parliament, in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation, but the same shall not be alienated,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>Now, I submit that amendment accepted yesterday amply covers the object which Deputy Figgis aims at, and to accept his amendment now would merely be to leave ourselves open to the charge of having something superfluous and redundant in the Constitution.  We, therefore, are not inclined to accept the amendment, and we ask the Dáil to take that view.</P>
      <P>The amendment was put, and declared lost.</P>

      <P>I beg to move as an amendment to insert after Article 44 the following Article:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The laws of the Parliament/Oireachtas shall, save where otherwise provided in any Act, be in force throughout the territory and the territorial waters of the Free State/Saorstát Eireann, and all ships registered in the Free State/Saorstát Eireann; <Col N="1743" /> and, save where expressly so provided in any Act, they shall be binding on Irish citizens, when beyond the limits of the Free State/Saorstát Eireann, or on ships not registered in the Free State/Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had expected that an amendment dealing somewhat with this point, which I first moved when the Bill was in Committee, would have found its way in among the amendments now before us on the Report stage.  It was argued against the previous amendment that it was not necessary, inasmuch as its insertion would be redundant, since the subject matter was covered by an earlier amendment.  Had I shared that view I would not have proposed the amendment. It certainly cannot be said that the subject matter of this amendment has been met or covered by an earlier amendment; yet I suggest that the subject matter is one that should be embodied in the Constitution.  The subject is one that it is not very easy to make clear in such a body as this, inasmuch as it deals with the very vexed aspect of international law.  It deals with what is known as extra territoriality, and it is quite possible that that may become a very vexed question.  Indeed, it has become a very vexed question in Canada, where Canadian citizens, once they leave Canadian territory, leave the influence and authority of Canadian laws behind them.  I have a letter from Professor Berriedale Keith dealing with the matter, and he gives a number of instances where it is proved that Canadian citizens have gone into the United States to evade the Canadian marriage laws, and on returning after a marriage that would have been considered as bigamous, they nevertheless claim the protection of the Canadian law, and receive that protection. This question of extra territorial legislation is a very vexed one, and one that it is not easy to make clear in this Dáil; it is not easy to draft an Article for it at all, as I stated clearly in this Dáil when this Bill was in Committee, and for that reason I asked Professor Berriedale Keith if he would be good enough to help me to draft an Article such as I would be able to propose, and the Article here is one that he himself has drafted.  I have his permission to make a quotation from his letter.  He says, &ldquo;The precise wording can be <Col N="1744" /> manipulated to suit the terminology of your draft generally, but you should, I think, make clear the three essential points:&mdash;(1) the Laws of the Parliament shall normally throughout the territory of the Irish Free State, include the territorial waters.  There has been a good deal of discussion&mdash;most of it fruitless, as to the real status of the territorial waters of the Dominions, <i>e.g.</i>, Canada, and you should prevent any possibility of doubt in the case of Ireland by mentioning these waters expressly.  The extent of these waters you cannot well define as the matter is one for international law to decide.  (2) The Laws of the Free State should apply to the full extent to every ship registered in the Free State, wherever that ship may happen to be.  Otherwise, the law applicable would probably be held by the British Courts to be English law, though the point is not without doubt. (3) The Parliament should have power when it desires to bind Irish citizens even beyond territorial waters, and when on non-Irish ships.  To take a simple example&mdash;it should be possible to punish an Irishman who, e.g., marries a second wife in the lifetime of his first wife.  Such powers, of course, should be exercised sparingly, both because of considerations of international law and of the disadvantage of imposing penalties on things which may not be criminal by the law of the place where the person acting is resident, but the powers plainly necessary for the discipline forces or aeroplanes beyond the territorial limits of the Free State, and soforth.  Irish laws, however, should have such effect only when expressly inactive in this sense.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these matters, unless power is taken in the Constitution already, will be excluded.  We had the Latin tag quoted yesterday, that if you mention one thing you may exclude another, but if we do not include this in the Constitution, we exclude it, and what happens actually in that case is, that the laws of the Irish Free State will not be binding upon any Irish citizen, except that he is in the territory of Ireland, and the law that will bind him outside Irish territory will be English law and not Irish, and inasmuch we desire that with respect to the legislation of Oireachtas we should hold co-equality with the other nations, it is necessary that the law binding <Col N="1745" /> upon Irish citizens in its full force and effect should be Irish law and not English law.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask some explanation of the position. Say, in the case of a factory owner who was a citizen of the Saorstát, and who was precluded by certain Acts from employing people under certain conditions in the Saorstát Eireann, and if that particular citizen went to Germany, or Russia, or South Africa, or China, and employed the citizens of that particular country under conditions different from those which prevail in Saorstát Eireann, would he be amenable to the laws of Saorstát Eireann?  That is the difficulty that strikes me in one clause of that particular Article.  The other two I can appreciate fully; but that particular clause which says, &ldquo;Provided in any Act, they shall be binding on Irish citizens, when beyond the limits of the Free State/Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; Perhaps some supporter of this clause will explain that for my benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of this Article&mdash;this proposed amendment&mdash;may be regarded as padding for the last sentence&mdash;that last sentence which introduces, or attempts to introduce, into this Constitution, as in Canada, the principle of extra territorial jurisdiction.  Now, extra territorial jurisdiction has been described by Deputy Figgis as a very vexed question. It has been described by another constitutional authority, Professor Berriedale Keith, as an unsettled point in the Dominions, and we are to set it down here as one of those agreed fundamental principles which properly take their place in their country's Constitution&mdash;to set it down with a minimum of critical examination and a minimum of reflection.  It seems to me that on the question of jurisdiction you come up against this&mdash; that if we had set this down in our Constitution that the laws of the Free State were binding on Irish citizens all over the earth, and that Irish citizens in Canada and Australia and America on anywhere else, refused quite to take that view, you come back always to the point as to whether the Government of the country in which he may happen to be accepts that view, and inamuch as there <Col N="1746" /> may be no such agreement, the whole thing is reduced to futility.  Are you going, as the President asked, to extradite a man because he refused to obey your vaccination laws at the end of the earth?  And is the Government of that particular country going to fall in with your views and assist you to enforce your law in their territory?  That is what it comes to.  And to set down here in our Constitution a principle of that kind, with no guarantee whatever that it will be honoured or accepted by any single country on the face of the earth is simply inviting ridicule.  I contend, sir, that the reference to territorial waters was unnecessary, and that the reference to ships was unnecessary, and that the reference, the attempt to introduce into this Constitution that very vexed question, that unsettled question of extra territorial jurisdiction, is simply trifling.</P>

Well, on consideration we are prepared to insert there 75,000, and also lower down in the line 28 to substitute 15,000 for 20,000.  I note another amendment on the paper in this connection.</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to favour 50,000 simply because in any case the application for a Referendum can do no harm, and when you consider the extraordinary difficulty of getting 50,000 you will agree.  I think 75,000 would be almost as difficult as 100,000.  I would like to see it lower still than 50,000.  The proportion in countries where it is in operation is lower than what is proposed here.  Fifty thousand would be low enough, and it will be unwieldy and difficult enough to work, and I think 50,000 will meet the case better than 75,000.</P>

      <P>Leaving out the argument in support of 50 as against 100.  I will ask the Minister to accept the proposition to substitute 30,000 for 50,000 in line 34.  It would then read: &ldquo;Any legislation passed by the Parliament providing for such initiation by the people shall provide, first, that such proposals may be initiated on a petition of 30,000 voters on the Register.&rdquo; That, I think, is reasonable, especially if you are reducing the number 100,000 to 75,000.  The request that legislation shall be initiated on a petition by 30,000 instead of 50,000 is not asking too much.  I beg to move that part of the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government informs me that there will be about 2,000,000 voters, and this figure of 50,000 is, I think, about 1/40 of that number.  To suggest that it is too large a number in view of the importance of the power that is given to them is scarcely tenable.  In view of the importance of the power that is given to them, and in view of the elaborate and expensive machinery they can set in motion, we do not consider there is a <Col N="1748" /> case for the reduction of the figure, while, of course, it is open to the Dáil to vote on it.</P>

      <P>The sixth amendment is to Article 50.  It proposes &mdash;&ldquo;To delete from the word `but,' on line 48, to the word `amendment' on line 54, both inclusive, and to insert in lieu the following:&mdash;`But no such amendment, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, after the expiration of a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall become law, unless the same shall, after it has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the said two Houses of the Oireachtas, have been submitted to a referendum of the people, and unless a majority of the voters on the Register shall have recorded their votes on such referendum, and either the votes of a majority of the voters on the Register, or two-thirds of the votes recorded, shall have been cast in favour of such amendment.' &rdquo; This simply makes the thing somewhat clearer, and provides for an eight years' period instead of five years.  Also, there is a change there&mdash;a change from 5 to 8 in line 55.  I think that, beyond that change in the time, there is no change of substance; it is merely a matter of the wording, as the new amendment is clearer.</P>

      <P>We come now to the Executive Proposals, and the Government's attitude in this matter is to preserve, or to attempt to preserve, the reduction of collective responsibility to the minimum of Ministers, and to leave a certain number of Ministers individually responsible for the conduct of their own departments.  We therefore suggest that a change in Article 51&mdash;&ldquo;The Executive Council shall consist of not more than 12 nor less than 5 Ministers.&rdquo; That would leave the President free to make his entire Ministry of the Executive Council or to leave 2 or 3 or more Ministers to be filled by the Committee of the Dáil, and limiting his own Executive Council to the collective responsibility of a number, perhaps 7 or 8 Ministers, but it leaves him the discretion whether he will do that or not.  It is permissive rather than mandatory, so that it leaves a latitude and discretion to the President.  He may choose to appoint only 6 or 7 Ministers and make these Executive Council, and leave the filling of the remaining Ministers to the Committee to the Dáil, or he may appoint all the Ministers, in which case all the Ministers will form the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the suggestion that the option should be given to the President for the time being to say that he shall have an Executive of 12 is not wise.  I think the sense of the House was that there should be a number of Ministers responsible for what you might call Technical Departments, rather than departments affected by public policy, or directing public policy, that should be directly responsible to the House.  If you leave that decision to the option of the President, it is asking us to do what the present President said was too great a responsibility to be put on any individual Minister.  The amendment of the Minister for Home Affairs leaves the option of seven Ministers to the President. The Council cannot be more than 12, and it must not be less than 5, and the option is left the President to decide whether the number shall be the larger or the smaller.  I think that that is <Col N="1750" /> against the wish of the House, as expressed on the last occasion, and I would urge the substitution of the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; for &ldquo;twelve,&rdquo; so as to read that, &ldquo;the Executive shall consist of not more than seven, nor less than five.&rdquo; I think all the arguments that were used from Ministerial benches at the last discussion tend to favour the reduction of the number of what you might call the Cabinet, the body responsible for the general policy, so that there could be a real collective mind in regard to this question of general policy.  But we are asked now to leave that option to the President for the time being, and I suggest that that is contradicting the will of the Dáil in the matter, and I would press the proposition that it should be limited to seven; that is to say, that the Executive Council should consist of not more than seven nor less than five.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope that the Ministry will see their way to accept Deputy Johnson's amendment, because if they reflect upon the suggestion they have made they will see that it would surely destroy the whole spirit of the new scheme that is being adopted. I should like to remind the Ministers that the Special Committee that was appointed by the President, consisting of supporters of this new scheme, unanimously recommended that there should be not more than seven people in the Inner Cabinet.  Now, it seems to me it is rather a strong thing for the Cabinet to go against the unanimous recommedation of the Committee unless they can produce some overwhelming reason for doing so, and I believe if you pass the Ministerial amendment you will leave the President in a somewhat unfortunate position.  Any man who is elected President&mdash;and Ministers know this better than other Teachtaí&mdash;will be assailed on all sides, directly and indirectly, by people who think themselves admirably fitted for such and such a job.  The unfortunate President will be the target for all these gentlemen, who will be tumbling over one another to get into certain places.  The proposal, as put by Deputy Johnson, for the Executive Council relieves the President of the odium of having to say to a good many of his friends that he could do nothing for them.  It puts the matter in the hands of the Dáil, and not the President, and I do urge the Minister for Home <Col N="1751" /> Affairs to accept the amendment by Deputy Johnson, which represents the spirit and the intention of the Committee appointed to go into this matter.</P>

      <P>I might say one thing about this matter, following on Deputy Gavan Duffy's statement that the President would be assailed, and that the Ministers knew better than the other Members of the Dáil that he would be assailed by people who were seeking office.  It is, perhaps, not necessary to say to the Members of the Dáil that the Ministers do not know anything of the sort, and there certainly has not been any assailing of the President in the past by people who were seeking office. The object of this amendment proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs is to, secure elasticity.  The Committee recommended a proportion of not more than seven or less than five of the Ministers being members of the Executive Council, but of course the scheme that was put forward by the Committee was not adopted by the Dáil.  One of the ideas that was in mind when it was suggested that outside Ministers should be brought in was to get men who would not be affiliated with any political party, and it was with the idea that there might be men on the Ministry who would not be returned as politicians or members of any political party that it was thought it would be possible to have the overwhelming body of the Ministry individually responsible. Now all the Ministers must be Members of the Dáil.  All of them must consequently be men who get in on some sort of political basis.  It may be that we may find it possible in the future, and even in the immediate future, to have the majority of the Members of the Ministry Ministers who are individually responsible, but the desire is to get elasticity. This change, in which we have not a Ministry of which all the members are individually responsible, and not a Ministry which is collectively responsible only, is in the nature of an experiment, and we thought there would be a better chance of its getting a fair trial and of its being a success if there was as much elasticity as possible provided for&mdash;if just so many Members were individually responsible in the first instance as was found suitable in the peculiar circumstances of the case.  There is also another <Col N="1752" /> thing in favour of this&mdash;the degree of elasticity that is provided for in the amendment.  We are not yet arrived at normal times.  In a time of crisis it might well be desirable to have the entire Ministry, or practically the entire Ministry, collectively responsible.  In normal times I would see no need at all for that but as we are just passing out of abnormal times into normal times, there is a further advantage in allowing the President and those who would work with him the choice of having the whole body of Ministers, or practically the whole body of Ministers, collectively responsible if they think fit.  In regard to the suggestion that the President would have the option of appointing all the Ministers members of the Executive Council, that will depend a good deal upon the temper of the House.  The President will have to be proposed and nominated by the Dáil.  If there is a desire expressed, he, perhaps, will explain his attitude in regard to this matter.  I think it leaves it open.  In any case, at the present stage an amendment such as has been proposed by Deputy Johnson, making the number seven or less than five, gives too little scope for variation with the circumstances, and is too rigid in view of the experimental nature of this division.</P>

      <P>Briefly the reasons that the Minister for Local Government has stated&mdash;reasons covered by the word &ldquo;elasticity&rdquo;&mdash;are the same as urge me to prefer the number twelve to the number seven.  There is one further reason that has not been mentioned, and it is this: Deputy Johnson, when speaking of the Executive Council, referred to its collective responsibility for the policy of the country, whereas these other Ministers, whom I irreverently called yesterday cab-tout Ministers, would be directly responsible to the Dáil each for his own Department. But there is one further responsibility that has not been mentioned, and that should be mentioned.  It is that the Ministers forming the Executive Council share a collective and exclusive responsibility in respect of finance&mdash;a responsibility, that is to say, that is not shared by those who do not form part of the Executive Council.  Surely the more Ministers who share that financial responsibility the better for the unified administration <Col N="1753" /> of finance, as well as for proposals brought forward to the Dáil recommending the expenditure of money. We have already stated in this Constitution that the Executive Council, and only the Executive Council, has financial responsibility.  It follows that any Minister not a member of the Executive Council is dependent on the will of that Council in respect of matters of finance.</P>

      <P>There is one observation that I would like to put before the Dáil when they come to consider this matter.  I do not know myself yet whether I am going to vote for the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson or not, but I wish to press a consideration on the Ministers which may induce them to accept Deputy Johnson's amendment instead of their own proposal. I am not at all desirous of pressing on the Dáil or Ministers the unanimous opinion of any Committee. Committees are no better than anyone else, and I do not think the fact that ten people happen to arrive at agreement in a back room is any reason why their collective wisdom should be greater than any other members of this Dáil.  But one of the matters that weighed most strongly with this Committee in making this recommendation of not less than five or more than seven was this&mdash;the Dáil has accepted the principle that there may be Ministers who are not on the Executive Council; therefore, if you have an Executive Council of twelve, you may have an unlimited number of other Ministers who are not on the Executive Council.  Under the original draft you could not have more than twelve Ministers whoever they were.  In the Constitution in its present form you may have up to twelve on the Executive Council.  You may have other Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council nominated by the Chamber.  One of the great objects, I think, that we should aim at in our early days is to avoid expense as far as possible, by not overcrowding the Dáil with Ministries of one shape or another.  Now, the Committee came to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that a thoroughly good&mdash;I will call it Cabinet for the moment&mdash;a Cabinet of five, six or seven, could carry on the main policy of the country. That left a margin of other Ministers from outside who would run their own departments, and it is surely undesirable <Col N="1754" /> that we should have an excessive number of Ministers&mdash;twelve good Ministers and subordinate Ministers as well, in a House so small as this, and to run a country which, however you look at it, has only four million of people, and some forty thousand square miles in area.  Is it necessary to have more than twelve Ministers; is it desirable to have more than twelve Ministers?  Surely, twelve is an ample staff to conduct the business of this country.  Now, the Minister of Local Government said that we were still in abnormal times.  I should have thought myself that abnormal times were the very times in which you want to concentrate the main work of the country into as few hands as possible. In the most abnormal times of all the Roman Empire, and other Empires, too, found it necessary to appoint a dictator, because they thought it was better that the whole running of the country should be committed to one or two men, who might have sole responsibility and full control.  I should have thought that in abnormal times you would seek most of all to concentrate responsibility and control in a few hands, and leave those Ministers who have Departments that are not really concerned with the vital details of the country, to conduct them without having to share responsibility with four or five heads of the Government who are looking after the major affairs.  If the Ministry say they consider it vital that they should have this elasticity of the twelve, I am not prepared myself to vote against that, but I would urge upon them to reconsider it in view of what they have heard, and see if Deputy Johnson's amendment would not meet the case.</P>

      <P>Deputies are aware that with reference to the Executive proposals we invited the Dáil to get clear away from the cut and thrust of Party politics; that we sketched the kind of assembly we would have here in future, having regard to the system of franchise that we have&mdash;the system of Proportional Representation&mdash;that we would have here not a Dáil composed of two or three large and solid parties, but rather a Dáil composed of a great many groups, and groups that would not be stereotyped, that would not vote on all matters, but would vote together perhaps to-day and differently to-morrow, according as their opinions or their interest <Col N="1755" /> changed.  We felt that in such a Dáil, with a strict Party system in play, you would not have stability; you would have very frequent changes of Government, and you would have consequently very little continuity of policy in the Departments of State.  And so, in the Executive proposals which we put before the Dáil, we asked for practically a root and branch abolition of the Party system.  We asked that a very small Executive Council would take collective responsibility for the broad matters of policy, and that outside that Council each Minister would be individually responsible to the Dáil and would stand or fall on the running of his own particular Department and the soundness of the measures which he brought before the Dáil.  It was not exactly that he would go out of office if any particular measure that he brought before the Dáil was defeated, because that would force him back to a very cautious, conservative kind of policy in the running of his Department, but that he should be judged by the Dáil broadly on the conduct of his Department, and would be removable only on the head of malfeasance in office, incompetence in the conduct of his Department, or failure to carry out the expressed will of the Dáil.  To emphasise the non-party nature of the administration, and aiming only at giving the people the greatest efficiency in their services, we asked that this Selection Committee of the Dáil would be entitled to go outside the strict membership of the Dáil itself to select Ministers from all people eligible for election to this Dáil.  If they saw outside a man whom they considered eminently fitted for the headship of a particular Department, the fact of his non-membership of the Dáil would not be an insuperable obstacle.  We considered that government should be in he interests of the people, and that State services should be run with an eye to the maximum of efficiency for the people. So we brought these proposals before the Dáil, and this Dáil, with certain emphasis, rejected them.</P>

      <P>Yes; one vote. But there was a certain emphasis even about that one vote.  We are sorry that these proposals were rejected.  We believed, and we still believe, that their adoption would have been to the best advantage <Col N="1756" /> of the country and the citizens of the country, and now we are forced into the position that we are trying to save from the wreck whatever was good in those proposals and whatever is left. What is left really is that we can still have an Executive Council taking collective responsibility for the broad matters of policy, and that we can still have in dividual responsibility of certain Ministers. The Dáil did not approve of the principle that Ministers might be elected from citizens eligible for election to the Dáil, but who need not necessarily be Members of the Dáil.  Now, as between this seven and five, that is a very open matter.  Deputy Johnson thinks that the Executive should be limited to seven, not more than seven, and not less than five, whereas our proposal leaves it free to the President to make the entire Ministry his Executive Council, or, alternatively, to have the Executive Council as small as five.  It was simply the view that in changing circumstances and changing material behind him in his party, and even in the Dáil itself, that it was unfair to bind the hands of future Presidents, and that it might be claimed that the best thing to do was to leave them a certain discretion.  He, after all would be the person primarily responsible for the running of the Government.  And in any one particular Parliament it might be clear to him that he had behind him men of sufficiently good calibre to appoint, who could take collective responsibility with him for all matters, and in another Parliament he might feel that only five or six of his particular party were of &ldquo;Ministerial timbre,&rdquo; if I might use the expression, and he would prefer to leave to a Committee of the Dáil broadly to select the others from any other party of the Dáil.  We have no decided preference.  If the Dáil prefers Deputy Johnson's figure of not less than five and not more than seven, that will be quite agreeable to us.  We feel that our own motion was put down rather with the view to try and suit ourselves to the temper and opinion of the Dáil. We had no particular preference for that figure, and we thought that if the Dáil had not a feeling in favour of those proposals, then the best we could hope for was that they would not absolutely bar their being put into operation in the future, and that they would leave the President a latitude in the matter.  Personally, <Col N="1757" /> I would be glad to see Deputy Johnson's amendment carried, and it is a very open matter for the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It would not have been there.  My proposal is, that &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; be deleted and that &ldquo;seven&rdquo; be substituted, and I think I could quote the argument of the President on the last occasion as strongly to reinforce this claim.  The President insisted that it was a most undesirable thing to throw <Col N="1759" /> upon any one man the responsibility of choosing of his own choice so large a number as twelve Ministers to act as his Executive council.  He suggested, what I think is obvious to everyone, that you cannot have a compact body of twelve men who are going to be unanimous and equally influential on the Council.  With a council of twelve you are certain to have a minority, you are certain to have at least a smaller number who will be the real Cabinet, and the other few who will have the name of being the Executive Members of the Council, but who will not really be Executive Council Members. We have had that experience in recent years in this country.  We have had that experience in England.  I believe it is the common experience in every country that when a Cabinet or Executive Council consisting of numbers anything like 12, 13, 14, or even ten you are going to have a smaller number who are really the holders of office and wielders of power, while the others have the nominal responsibility but are not equally responsible in fact.  They may have the responsibility without having real power, and that is an undesirable state of things. Besides it is not fair to put upon the President the option of saying whether his council shall be five or twelve.  The Minister for Home Affairs in arguing upon the last amendment said it would be possible, as it will be, with this large flexibility, to have one President at the beginning of his Parliament saying, &ldquo;I am going to have a Council of five,&rdquo; and a succeeding President saying, &ldquo;I am going to have a Council of twelve.&rdquo; That does not make for continuity; it does not make for consistent policy; it will make for log-rolling; it will make for back stairs influence, and for all those things which are undesirable.  It would be very much better to say the Executive Council must be a large number than to say it is to be at the option of the President whether it is to be a large number or a small number.  If you leave it that way you are going to ask successive Presidents at the beginning of successive Parliaments to tell the Dáil whether they are in favour of a Council of five; you are going to ask him to say &ldquo;I cannot choose twelve men out of this Dáil that I can rely upon to act collectively.&rdquo; You are throwing upon him the responsibility of telling his supporters that they are not good enough to form an executive Council <Col N="1760" /> or, alternatively, while he may think they are not good enough to compel him to bring them in.  That is not an option that is desirable to give the President.  It should be either one thing or another. He should be compelled to say the Council shall be twelve or the Council shall be seven or five, but to give the option of having a Council of from twelve to five, is entirely unwise because it is too great. The arguments used in favour of the last Amendment certainly seem to me very strongly against the proposition as it now stands.  It is suggested that the discussion on the previous reading made a certain decision.  But as Deputy Professor Magennis has pointed out, that decision was not made upon one specific point.  Certain Members who formed the majority voted on the principle that they did not want persons from outside the Dáil to be brought into the Ministry, and consequently they voted in the majority. Others voted in the majority from another reason altogether, so that it cannot be said that this particular principle was voted upon on the last reading.  The Minister for Home Affairs asked us to save something from the wreck.  I do not think there was any wreck at all.  I think certain doubtful cargo was thrown over-board, but the ship is still sound, and what is now being asked to be done is that undesirable cargo should be retained and I suggest that that part of the cargo should also be thrown over-board.  I think it is desirable that we should point out, so that there can be no misapprehension, that the desire of Deputy Figgis has been fulfilled in this form of Executive. As the draft now stands, as the Bill now stands, it is not absolutely necessary that Members of the Ministry outside the Executive Council shall all be Members of the Chamber.  The option still remains with the Chamber and we are now in conformity with what Deputy Figgis points out is the rule of other legislatures.  There is nothing to prevent them bringing men in from outside, and my Motion will lead to this: that the Executive Council of the future will not be more than seven Members, with additional Ministers up to twelve.  That would be the consequence of further amendments&mdash; which I believe will be carried&mdash;as any more Ministers above seven and up to twelve might be appointed by the Chamber, to be directly responsible to the Chamber, but I want the Dáil to vote in favour <Col N="1761" /> of the amendment, to restrict the Executive Council, because I believe that, throwing upon the President for the time being at the beginning of every new Parliament, the option of saying whether the Ministry he is going to gather round him&mdash;or, rather, the Executive Council he is going to gather round him&mdash;shall be seven or twelve, or any other number in between, is an option that he will not thank you for.  It is not a good thing for the President&mdash;it is not a good thing for the Chamber&mdash;it is not a good thing for the Ministry itself.  And it will be a bad thing for the country.  I beg to move that the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; be substituted for &ldquo;twelve.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the thing that would recommend this particular amendment most is that it would actually provide, I think, that there should be some Members individually responsible, because if the Executive Council is limited to seven there certainly would be some additional Ministers appointed, and that, to my mind, has a lot to recommend it.  Personally I think that it provides for more rigidity than is desirable.  If it were, for instance, not more than nine or less than five, I would be myself very well content with it.  I think, however, as I say, that it is a little bit too rigid.  It seems to me that this question of individually responsible Ministers, and collectively responsible Ministers who are members of the Executive Council will work out in this way: as long as there is a definite majority party in the Dáil, all Ministers, both in the Executive Council and outside it, will, save in very exceptional circumstances, belong to that majority party. The President who will appoint the Members of the Executive Council, who will be collectively responsible, will of necessity select that Executive Council entirely from the majority party, which he will represent.  Now the extern Ministers will be chosen by a Committee proportionately or impartially representative of the entire Dáil; on that Committee there will be a majority&mdash;representing the majority party of the Dáil&mdash;and the nominees of that Committee, I take it, will in normal circumstances be all nominees of the party having the majority in the Dáil.  And even if the Committee were to propose the names of members outside the majority <Col N="1762" /> party, then there would be the great probability that the Dáil itself and the majority party in the Dáil itself would reject the names of those representatives of other parties.  That is how it is going to work in practice.  That means that substantially there would be no great difference between members who are individually responsible and members who are collectively responsible.  Because, being as they will normally be, and as they must in fact, because of one consideration be members of one party they will pretty well stand together and it will make no great difference at all. Now, what would happen in that case by tying the Dáil down to seven members at most on the Executive Council, would be this: that the President would have to choose, or might have to choose between two proposed Ministers, two people who are certain to get on to the Ministry, whether he would make one of them his nominee, and include him in the Executive Council, and leave the other who had, perhaps, an equal claim, outside the Executive Council to be selected by a Committee of the Dáil.  That might put a difficulty up to the President which would be undesirable and there would be nothing much gained by it.  There would be a certain disadvantage in having a President tied down very tightly, as this undoubtedly ties him to a very small range of discretion, and there would not be much to be gained by it.  The Ministry would be made up in reality as at present of the Executive Council, until we come to the stage when there is not in the Dáil a definite majority party.  If there is not a definite majority party in the Dáil the President will either be chosen for some special qualities of his own, or he will be chosen as the leader of the strongest party in the Dáil.  Whether he is chosen as representative of one of the strongest parties in the Dáil, or leader of the strongest party, he will choose for his Executive Council pretty well the members of his own party; if his party is at all strong, although not a majority party definitely, he will certainly put on the Executive Council the members of his own party.  Now he is not bound to put, if the clause were left as it stands with the last amendment adopted, he would not be bound by the Constitution to have any extern members on the Ministry.  But if he was not the nominee <Col N="1763" /> of a party who had a majority in the Dáil he would be obliged to have outside Ministers.  He would be obliged by the pressure of the Dáil to leave room for Ministers not members of the Executive Council and not members of the party of the President.  So that I think that once we come to the stage in anticipation of which entirely new Executive proposals have been put forward&mdash;once we come to the stage at which there will not be a definite majority party in this Dáil, then I think that the pressure of the Dáil will leave the President no discretion, but to leave open to Parliament the maximum number of Ministers for nomination by a Committee of the Dáil.  Now it seems to me that there is not a great deal between the two clauses&mdash;the clause as it now stands, having been amended by the acceptance of the proposal of the Minister for Home Affairs and the proposal of Deputy Johnson.  I believe that in either case once we arrive at the stage when there will not be a definite majority party in the Dáil, we will have extern Ministers&mdash;Ministers not bound by collective responsibility.  And although with a majority party we may have them, it will to a considerable extent be nominal only.  If a clause were adopted which would tie down the President too closely, probably the only substantial effect of it might be to create difficulties of personality for him in chosing his Ministry, difficulties which he could avoid if he could add one or two more on to the Executive Council, men who might be equally entitled by their ability and by their influence on the Dáil to be on it with the original seven.  As I say I would, in a sense, like to see an amendment which would make it certain that there would be some extern Ministers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson addressed a certain part of his arguments towards myself, and it would be but courtesy if I were to deal with the points that he put across to me.  He stated that most of the objections that I had originally given expression to in the draft, as it first appeared, had now disappeared.  That is perfectly true, and <Col N="1764" /> so far as that goes I will be perfectly agreeable so far as I am personally concerned, to the substitution of the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; in place of the word &ldquo;twelve,&rdquo; but for the objection that I have already mentioned, and that is the question of financial responsibility.  Now, I tried two or three times in this Dáil to get that particular clause dealing with financial responsibility somewhat changed, and I was not successful.  I am dealing with that Article 37.  It reads &ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law, unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by a message from the Representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo; I do not complain that any loosening of that bond was not accepted on the lines that I have suggested, but I do say that in as much as that was not accepted we are now obliged to try and get as many Ministers as possible into this united financial responsibility for expenditure. In other words, to put the same thought in another phrase, from the point of view of departmental responsibility that each one of the spending departments should be equally responsible for the allotment of the National finance through the various avenues that are possible to each. Each person in charge of a spending department should be equally within his rights, or her rights, in coming down to this Dáil, or to the body that decides what the expenditure is to be, and in saying I consider such and such a purpose of the very first import and I urge that the Nation's finances be charged with such and such moneys for such and such purposes, and I think when each of the Ministers are placed on an equal responsibility in respect of that matter you then get efficient administration.  But as to the provisions now appearing, what happens?  If you had an Executive Council of seven, you would have Ministers not Members of the Executive Council of five, and each of these would be requiring money for his expenditure, and would be prohibited from coming to this Dáil and asking for that money without having between himself and the Dáil an Executive Council of seven interposing and saying we cannot recommend that expenditure, and consequently each one of these five would be reduced to the position of not being Ministers to the Dáil, but Ministers to Ministers of the <Col N="1765" /> Dáil.  For that reason I am opposed to the figure seven, and I would be opposed to the figure nine.  Whereas if this Dáil had impartial power for the allotment of money for twelve Ministers whether of the Executive Council or not of the Executive Council, my objection to that would have been met and I would be able to vote for it.  I am merely voting against <Col N="1766" /> it now, not because I am opposed to it on principle, but simply because an earlier Article that we have adopted in this Dáil would impair the collectiveness of these two different kinds of Ministers. It is because I think that all Ministers should hold equal responsibility that I am opposed to the reduction of this figure.</P>

      <P>This amendment 13 proposes to add at the end of Article 51 the words &ldquo;on the nomination of the President of the Executive Council.&rdquo; That is simply to make it clear that in reality the President selects and appoints the Ministers, though nominally the Representative of the Crown has the appointment.  We add this at the end of Article 51 &ldquo;The Executive shall be responsible to the Dáil and shall consist of not more than&rdquo;&mdash; now it would be seven Ministers&mdash;&ldquo;appointed by the Representative of the Crown on the nomination of the President of the Executive Council.&rdquo; It has been pointed out to me that in line 30 that is made clear.  &ldquo;The other Ministers who are to hold office as members of the Executive Council shall be appointed on the nomination of the President.&rdquo; Well, it is just as well to have it in Article 51, because where it occurs in Article 53 there is the additional statement &ldquo;They shall be appointed on the nomination of the President with the assent of the Dáil,&rdquo; so that it would not be too obviously a redundancy because of that addition.</P>

      <P>I was saying that this is simply a question for Deputies to consider, whether in view of the fact that these appointees of the President or nominees of the President, will act as a single Body taking collective responsibility, that the President ought to be allowed to put them up in the same way as a bloc, as they will not be individually responsible. They will be members of a single Council facing the Dáil together on all matters, and going on the same lines in all matters, and it is simply a point whether in view of that their appointments or nominations would require individual approval.</P>

After Article 56, and before Article 57, to insert a new Article as follows:&mdash;`Article 56A&mdash;Every Minister shall have the right to attend and be heard in the Seanad.' This amendment proposes a new Article, giving Ministers the right to attend and be heard in the Seanad.  It is advisable that the Minister, say, in charge of a Bill should be entitled to speak in explanation and in support of that Bill in the Upper House.  He probably will have&mdash;he ought to have, at any rate&mdash;a better grasp of all the details of it, the reasons that prompted him to insert a particular clause, and so on, than any member of either House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this, for this reason, that I think it spoils the original intention of the Seanad.  Surely the purpose of the Seanad is that it should be kept out of those party issues to which constant reference <Col N="1769" /> has been made in this House. They would normally and naturally sway a Chamber.  In whatever aspect we regard them, Ministers will be the mouthpiece. In an earlier discussion in this Dáil Professor Magennis referred to the Seanad as a &ldquo;Cooling Chamber,&rdquo; and I remember the Minister for Home Affairs himself adapting and using that excellent expression.  Obviously, if it is to be in any sense a &ldquo;Cooling Chamber,&rdquo; you are at once bringing those passions that are alone supposed to be the monopoly of the Chamber of Deputies into the Seanad by allowing the Ministers to arrive there and introduce there all the discussions that have already been heard, and might even possibly have been read in the Seanad. It is a possibility that they may even read the debates of the Chamber.  Whether they do or they do not, I suggest that the Seanad be left to its own separate consideration, without Ministers invading it with issues that have already been thrashed out in the body where they naturally belong.  For that reason substantially, and reasons that are attendant upon it, I think it would be better that Ministers should not have the right to go and speak in the Seanad.  There is one further consideration.  Even if we assume that a Minister might speak in the Seanad, I suggest it would be wrong here to interfere with the right and authority of that House.  It might be said any Minister might speak in the Seanad by the wish of the Seanad or by the authority of the Seanad, but the Seanad should not be compelled to hear him even though the Seanad did not desire to hear him.  While I am opposed to the principle of Ministers speaking in the Seanad, I do not press that very strongly, but what I do press as emphatically as I possibly can is that the Seanad should be left its rights as a House, and should be left that principal right of not hearing anybody or of hearing anybody according as it may decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to leave out the title Governor-General, and I am proposing this and several other amendments separately in connection with the Governor-General clause.  I want to make it quite clear that there is no reason to confound these amendments with those of a different character moved to other clauses on the last reading which the Ministry considered it vital to oppose.  I want rather to emphasise that distinction in the case of those other amendments.  I have not repeated them on this reading.  I have practically confined myself to the amendments to this clause, which I deferred on the last reading, because having made the strongest protest I could I do not feel I can add anything to it by merely repeating, and also because it is now generally accepted that these difficult matters were pressed upon us, on the ground that circumstances which have been described rendered it essential. It is clear we are not accepting them, as if they were the interpretation that we would put into our Constitution in other circumstances, and moreover the Ministry have made one very signal concession in altering the power of amendment to the Constitution.  It is the most important amendment we have had.  This Governor-General clause stands on a totally different footing. None of these amendments here, if carried&mdash;no single one of them&mdash;I think, I may say this without fear of contradiction&mdash;will create any difficulty as between us and Great Britain.  I first ask that the Dáil should not call this gentleman, who represents His Britannic Majesty, by the particular name of Governor-General.  You may say there is not much in a name.  That name, at all events, is objectionable to a great many of us, because it connotes the idea of domination; it connotes a great deal more than is really carried with the office in fact.  Of course, he must have a name in due time as representative, but that name is not a matter of any urgency.  Nobody who wants this Treaty put into force, seriously desires to see a merely trivial name given him, or a derogatory name, but, on the other hand, many of us feel strongly that such a name as Governor-General, <Col N="1771" /> connoting what that word does, should not be given to him.  We are in no way bound to give it.  There is nothing to make it necessary&mdash;and I fancy the Minister for Home Affairs will agree with me&mdash;to put any name at all in the Constitution.  The Constitution is just as complete, if we leave that until later on.  There is a difference of opinion as to what the name should be. I do not think anybody is enthusiastic about this particular name; therefore, I propose that the Dáil delete so much of the Clause, as gives an undesirable name to the British representative who is to come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  I will not repeat more than is absolutely necessary the arguments that I addressed to An Dáil on this topic previously.  The title Governor-General as used in Canada and Australia is pretty much the same sort of survival, as we have seen in other portions of the Constitutions in which so many things are done in the name of the King.  The word Governor-General in those Dominions is a continuation of their history beginning with the time when they were British possessions. Canada was a colony, Australia was a colony.  They have grown into statehood, but they have retained the title of Governor-General.  Although he is only a figurehead he is as much a symbol of the Crown in those Dominions as other fictions of a Constitutional nature, but to go outside the Treaty and to adopt for the sake of symmetry with the Dominions&mdash;that we are declared by the Treaty to have equal status with&mdash;is really to import a term that will have evil connotation.  One of the soundest maxims of Constitutional law is that the King reigns but does not govern.  Now, the name Governor-General suggests government, and even though the name is eviscerated&mdash;and is in fact eviscerated, of all such reference in Australia and Canada where the constitutional growth has had that effect &mdash; the introduction of the name here gratuitously will suggest to the unthinking at any rate, that in some way we have got a new Constitution in Ireland, under which there is a Governor who governs.  Some name less suggestive of what is unhistorical or hurtful may easily be found later on.  The title in the Treaty to be quite accurate, it is not a <Col N="1772" /> title, it is merely a denomination&mdash;is the representative of the Crown.  The Crown representative would be a convenient abbreviation of it, though I think, on second thoughts, it would be objectionable to many people in Ireland as bringing into every day usage, and thrusting prominently upon the notice of everyone the fact of the Crown being a constitutent element in our Executive and Legislature.  I myself for historical reasons would favour the title of Lord Deputy inasmuch as no matter what hateful associations it has out of past history, at any rate, it has its place in the earlier history of <i>our</i> relations with the British Crown.  It seems to me the Constitution may very well be left open in this regard.  I recognise the force of what the Minister in charge of the Bill put to us on a previous occasion; to wit that this is an agreed Article.  Now it is an agreed Article with the sole exception of the introduction of the title Governor-General.  If that is eliminated there is no conflict whatsoever.  As Deputy Gavan Duffy has pointed out there is no occasion for friction with the British Government upon the matter, and the wisdom or historical research of the Dáil at a later period, or of some member of it, may supply us with a happier title and one less suggestive of what is objectionable.</P>

      <P>I do not think it matters very much what the name of the Crown Representative is to be; it is really the power he will have.  But if there is a serious objection to the name, there is no reason, to my mind, why it should be given this Irish title, which covers both the title of Governor-General and Crown Representative: &ldquo;Fear Ionad an Righe.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We will confine ourselves to the name of that officer.  It is suggested to delete the title Governor-General.  Now, the representatives of the Provisional Government when in London agreed to accept that title.  They agreed because of its fixed meaning, and because of its general meaning, for the moment that you accept that name you stamp the man's limitations in a way that people all over the British Commonwealth of Nations will understand, and understand readily.  You secure, further, that if he goes, or attempts to go, outside these <Col N="1773" /> limitations, it will be resented in all these places, because this word has a very definite connotation for them, and it is in their interests that a Governor-General should not attempt to outstep his limitations.  For that reason, while there is nothing in the Treaty binding us to adopt that particular title, it was considered advisable to adopt it, and we recommend it very strongly to the Dáil. If that title is changed, say, by an Imperial Conference, naturally we get the advantage of the change; but if we go out on our own, and call this gentleman a High Commissioner, or some such title as that, then we have to face the fact that we do not stamp his limitations in a way that people in Canada, Australia, or South Africa will understand.  There is the fact that to their minds, at any rate, a High Commissioner conveys some idea of inferiority of status, and the British do not send High Commissioners to places that are autonomous; they send them only to such places as have one form or other of Crown Colony government. There would be very serious resentment in South Africa, Canada, or Australia if the British proposed to send a High Commissioner there.  These are points worth looking into.  But what I feel most strongly is that if we show an attitude of determination to whittle down this gentleman's status and powers, then we may not be as fairly met as we would otherwise be on the important and what I consider the paramount question of the identity of the gentleman. That is the thing that matters, and not what you would call him.  The man, his outlook, and his nationality are the things that will matter. What I suggest is that if we show we are approaching this particular matter from a special angle, then it will become a thorny matter with the British, and they will approach it from a special angle of their own, and there will be less prospect of fair agreement on the question of the identity of the official, whether you <Col N="1774" /> decide to call him Governor-General or anything else.  Mere wisdom, mere expediency&mdash;and we are not one bit afraid of the word expediency&mdash;seem to dictate that acceptance of the title with a view to a satisfactory appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to the Minister it is not proposed to whittle down any power the Treaty gives?  That is a misunderstanding.  The suggestion is merely not to give this particular name.  The Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State&mdash; those are all different names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the argument that has been adduced is not that the name of the Governor-General in the first appointment shall be changed, but that this title should not be contained in the Constitution.  That is the argument.  If, for instance, the proposition was the suggestion that the Minister for Home Affairs has made, that at some future Imperial Council the British Commonwealth decided to change the name of the Representative of the Crown in Australia, it would require a change in the Irish Constitution to alter the title of the Irish Representative of the Crown.  That is an argument that should have weight with Ministers.  It is not that the next Governor-General, or the first Governor-General, or the first Representative of the Crown must be given a particular title.  That title can be arrived at by agreement between Ministers, or between the Dáil and the British Government if they wish.  The objection is to the fixing of that title for ever, or until the Irish Constitution is changed in a formal manner.  That is the argument in favour of the deletion of this name.  There is no necessity, as has been pointed out by the Deputy who moved the motion, in the Treaty to put this in the Constitution, and why we should go out of our way to fix it upon ourselves passes my comprehension.</P>

      <P>The next Amendment 18 <i>(b)</i> is:&mdash;To substitute for the words &ldquo;in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada and in accordance with the practice in the making of such appointments&rdquo; the words &ldquo;with the assent of the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In moving this amendment I am claiming, I think, the authority of no less a potentate than the Right Honorable David Lloyd George.  I very seldom find myself on the same side as that gentleman.  I cannot believe but that the Minister will see and that the Dáil will see that it is objectionable to be dragging in other countries as a means of describing powers and other things in our Constitution, unless we are driven to do so.  In this particular clause dealing with the Governor-General we bring in Canada and Australia.  Would it not be simpler and better and clearer to state exactly what we mean rather than talking about the practice in Canada?  What we mean is that this gentleman can only be appointed with the consent of the Irish Executive.  If that is what we mean why do we not say so?  I want to remind the Dáil of two things, and one of these is a letter from Mr. Lloyd George, and the other is a passage in Keith's &ldquo;Government of the Dominions.&rdquo; Professor Keith says:&mdash;&ldquo;Is there any valid reason why the choice of the representative of the Crown should not be left to the State Government, whose selection would, normally, if not always, fall upon a local man,&rdquo; and the learned Professor goes on, &ldquo;logically, indeed, there is no answer to the argument that the choice of the Governor should rest primarily with the State Government subject to the approval of the Crown.&rdquo; Mr. Lloyd George went much further than that.  It will be within the recollection of the Dáil that President Griffith found, after coming back from London, after the signing of the Treaty, that certain questions were a little obscure, and he found it would be desirable to have some elucidation, and, consequently, he obtained a letter for the second Dáil from Mr. Lloyd George, the first paragraph of which relates to this particular question.  That letter is signed by Mr. Lloyd George, and addressed to President Griffith, and, after quoting Article 3 of the Treaty as to the appointment of the Governor in the same manner as in Canada, and soforth, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;this means that the Government of the Irish Free State will be consulted so as to ensure a selection acceptable to the Irish Government before any recommendation is made to His Majesty.&rdquo; That clearly <Col N="1777" /> means that we are not to have foisted upon us a gentleman who is to hold a British Court here.  We are going to pay for this gentleman.  The British Premier himself admits that they are not to appoint, according to the Dominion practice, a person objectionable to the Irish Executive, and therefore surely it is reasonable that we should say in express terms what we mean as I say in this amendment&mdash;that he shall only be appointed with the assent of our Executive. Mr. Lloyd George's letter to Mr. Griffith is not binding upon anybody or upon any British Government, and it will be no answer hereafter to say if there is contention in this matter that Mr. Lloyd George said so and so in his letter; we must put down in black and white what we mean, that this gentleman can only be appointed with the approval of the Irish Council.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gavan Duffy has claimed for this amendment that it is important that the position should be defined in the Article as it stands.  I think it is not important, and I think it might well become in a future time the very reverse of important. Stating the position to be exactly the position of Canada at a time when Canada is developing&mdash;she has already developed out of all recognition beyond the Act which embodies her Constitution and that development has not ceased&mdash; and there is therefore a certain advantage in stating that your position should be that of Canada, whatever that may be found to be at a future Imperial Conference. If, for instance, Canada wins out to the position of electing her own Governor-General, and that we leave our Article as it stands, which says &ldquo;that the Representative of the Crown shall be appointed in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada and in accordance with the practice observed in the making of such appointments,&rdquo; obviously we share in the benefits of the Canadian victory upon that particular point.  If, on the other hand, we adopt this amendment and insert that he shall be appointed on the advice and with the consent of the Executive, that stereotypes a position here which is capable of development elsewhere.  It is well <Col N="1778" /> understood that the British signatories to the Treaty last December agreed that the Irish Executive should be consulted in the matter of the appointment, and that no person who was objectionable to the Irish Executive Council will be appointed.  The less tampering there is with this Article as it stands the better is the prospect of securing the appointment of a person who will be eminently acceptable to the great majority of the Irish people.  This point was found to be one of the most touchy and thorny points with the British and they explained that by saying that it was the one thing left; that it was not a matter of substance really, but that all they had left here in this country was that link of the Crown and that it was important for them; that would have caused them to hold out and fight very bitterly if we rejected that settlement last December.  They pointed out that it had a sentimental value, not a value merely to England, but spread around about this thing called the Commonwealth of Nations.  Upon that point they were very touchy, and they claimed that it is absolutely all that is left of their connection here and that there is implicit, at any rate, in the Treaty, the undertaking that we will not approach this matter in a derisive or contentious way.  If we attempt to interfere with this agreed Article then we put British Ministers and Representatives upon their mettle and the prospects of securing a proper appointment here are proportionately diminished.  It is in that spirit we would like Deputies to view this Article and its contents.  And that it will be always the man who holds the position that will matter&mdash;the man and his mentality&mdash;and not the written words in the Constitution which not ten per cent. of the people of Ireland will read or lose a moment's sleep about. The kind of person that is appointed and the kind of household he runs and the kind of mentality and outlook he displays will have their re-actions&mdash;very far-reaching re-actions in the future life of this country and that is why we ought not to cast away the substance in bothering about trifles and bothering about ink and paper and bothering about shadows.</P>

      <P>Might I ask a question before the Minister finishes?  I did not make a speech in <Col N="1779" /> order to save time.  I wanted to hear the Minister.  Would he adopt this quotation from Duncan Hall's &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo;?  Sir Robert Borden, the great authority on Constitutional Law and Relations, in 1917, laid down the principle: &ldquo;That the Crown, in its relations to any Dominion, acts upon the advice of the duly constituted Government or Cabinet of that Dominion.&rdquo; If that is Sir Robert Borden's view, is it the view of the Irish Ministry or is it not?  If it is the view of the Irish Ministry, what objection can there be to putting it or the equivalent of it, expressly as the Irish interpretation of our relations to the Crown and the Imperial Parliament into this Constitution?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To substitute for the words `of the like amount as that now payable to the Governor-General of Australia' the words `ten thousand pounds, until otherwise provided by the Parliament/ Oireachtas'; or, alternatively, the words `ten thousand pounds, unless altered by the Parliament/Oireachtas.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever may have been agreed upon in London, I press this amendment upon the Dáil and upon the Ministry as one of some importance, and one in no way conflicting with the Article before the Dáil; but a very considerable improvement to it.  I propose that, instead of <Col N="1780" /> talking vaguely about the amount to be paid to the Governor of Australia, as we do in the draft, we should mention a specific sum of £10,000, and then qualify that with the words &ldquo;until otherwise provided by Parliament,&rdquo; or, alternatively, with the words &ldquo;unless altered by Parliament.&rdquo; I am putting those alternatives down in order to give the Ministry an opportunity of selecting the one they like best between the Canadian precedent and the Australian precedent.  There is surely an objection to fixing here and now definitely that sum which is to be paid to this gentleman as being whatever sum the Australians may choose to give their man. How can it be defended that we should pledge ourselves in advance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, let us fix it without reference to Australia. Let us fix the amount; but the more important part of the amendment is that it stipulates that we should have power to change this sum.  You must have some lever upon this gentleman. You must have some means of securing his good conduct.  The British Dominions have taken good care under their Constitutions to reserve to themselves such a lever.  It is worthy of notice that in this draft Constitution there is a special provision made for a suitable official residence for the Governor-General. Well, I suppose it would be churlish to propose to leave that out, but it is more satisfactory to propose that we have the right to decide how much salary he is to have.  But that phrase about providing him with an official residence and establishment is not to be found in the Dominion Constitutions, and is put in here because an agreement was come to in London, when the British Government was in a rage.  I cannot find it in any other Dominion Constitution.  If it is there I shall be glad to be told about it.  I say this is a special provision with which Ireland is saddled.  When we agreed to have him, we would give him a residence, but there is no need to put that into the Constitution.  And its insertion makes it all the more necessary that we should not be bound by the figure of £10,000.  Now, I ask the Minister's attention to the Canadian Constitution, Section 105, of the Canadian Act says:&mdash;&ldquo;Unless altered by the <Col N="1781" /> Parliament of Canada, the salary of the Governor-General shall be £10,000 sterling.&rdquo; The Australian sections, Section 3, uses the words &ldquo;Until altered by Parliament.&rdquo; Now, it can not be undesirable that we should there grasp the power which those Dominions already have of stating in their Constitution that their Parliament can change the Governor-General's salary, can change it any day they like.  If Australia has thought it necessary to do that, if Canada has thought it necessary to do that, why are we to be debarred from doing it especially in a country where money will be a very important matter?  I press upon the Ministers the desirability of insisting here upon establishing in the Constitution what is absolutely a clear right, and establishing a thing the insertion of which in the Constitution cannot be said to infringe any verbal arrangements that were come to in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I second that amendment.  I have already spoken at, I fear, considerable length against the whole clause in Committee.  It is most objectionable that Ireland's public funds should be made chargeable for the maintenance of the official residence and establishment.  However, I realise the futility of opposing that further, and will not waste time upon it.  There is an opportunity here to take power for the Irish Free State which is already in the possession of the Dominions with which we are to be upon a parity.  There is nothing contrary to the Treaty in this, and there is nothing anti-British in it&mdash; there is no people in the world that exhibit so keen and so close an appreciation of the need for the control of the public funds and the public purse as the British people, and I think, instead of their resentment being roused by any claim being made here to this effect, they would rather admire the Dáil for what they would call their business capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not accept the amendment.  This particular matter of the amount of the salary of the Governor-General was raised in London. None of us was particularly briefed on the matter, and the amount paid in each of the Dominions was gone into, and it was found that the fairest settlement of the amount would be simply to <Col N="1782" /> take Australia, because of the similarity in population and general wealth of the country.  I have no objection personally to this &mdash; to ask, say, some officials in the Finance Department to find out what exactly, in money and perquisites, if I may say so, is the value of the salary paid to the Governor-General of Australia, and, instead of putting in this reference to Australia, put in that sum.  Further than that I do not think we ought to go, and I doubt very much if any qualifying clause to the effect that that might be changed by Parliament would have any other effect than to stir up needless friction.  If instead of the present roundabout statement, that it shall be of a like amount as that now paid to the Governor-General of Australia, you prefer that we should now name a definite sum we could do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister only proposes to make an alteration by putting in the amount. But so far as the power to change is concerned, I take it that he agrees with me that there is no bargain fixing that amount for all time &mdash; I mean there is nothing to suggest that we cannot change it even though we do not put it in the Constitution.  The Minister agrees with me that there is no definite bargain that there should be that particular amount for all time.  It is not in the Constitution, and I take it it is nowhere else.</P>

We could name a specific amount which shall be charged on the public funds, and that is the only alteration in the Article that I would accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt at all that it was the talk which went on with reference to the Governor-General that caused the agreed clause to take the <Col N="1783" /> form it did take.  I have no doubt also that the fact that suggestions were made about the Governor-General living in a tenement, and that sort of thing that went on, that caused the Article to stand without any provision as to alteration; but the fact remains that under the amended Article 49 the Constitution can be amended by ordinary legislation, so that after eight years at least there is the possibility, whenever Parliament shall choose, to amend that clause or alter that sum if Parliament were to choose to alter it.  With regard to the putting in a proviso that the Free State shall provide the Governor-General with a suitable residence and establishment, that is only doing what some Deputies have been talking of, that is putting into the Constitution the practice of the Dominions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I ask the leave of the House to move amendments, of which notice has not been given, to Article 69.  It is on the last line of page 12: &ldquo;To insert after the word `war' the words `or armed rebellion,' that is `the jurisdiction of military tribunals shall not be extended to or exercised over the civil population save in times of war or armed rebellion, and for acts committed in time of war,' I move to insert again the words `or armed rebellion.' &rdquo; Then in line 3, on page 13, to insert the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;the&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that &ldquo;Such jurisdiction shall not be exercised in any area in which all the civil courts are open or capable of being held, and no person shall be removed from one area to another&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that there might be an area in which some civil court, perhaps a court not having any sort of criminal jurisdiction, or a court in a special area, or one local court in a small corner of the area, or something like that, might be able to be opened and might be capable of being held, whereas courts in general would not be capable of being held.  This is simply that the test of whether or not such a state of war exists in any particular area as to justify the exercise of the jurisdiction of military courts in that area will be that all the civil courts are open or are capable of being held.  With the leave of the Dáil I would like to move the amendments.</P>

      <P>I think that that is an incautious departure.  I would beg the Minister to reconsider it, because I think it goes beyond what he intends.  I grasp the idea that is clearly <Col N="1785" /> behind it, but I think the words themselves are clearly in excess.  It might be taken to refer to the closing of a particular civil court, whether it was a court under whose jurisdiction a particular matter would fall or not.  After all, it seems to me that if the High Courts are open, and if the case can be brought before them, that satisfies Coke's great test.  The country is not in a state of war where a High Court can be held.  It might just be possible that in some little district the Resident Magistrate's Court would be impossible, and then it might be held that, inasmuch as this one was closed not all were open. It creates a practical difficulty, though I am in agreement substantially with the Ministry.</P>

      <P>This matter was considered very carefully, and advisedly the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; was put in.  I am afraid we could not accept the Deputy's suggestion, that because the High Courts are open, there is no state of war.  I do not think that is sound law.  I do not think it is sound teaching on the question.  I do not think that holds in practice in any country.  I think if you reduce the question to practice, you will find that in most countries where martial law has been proclaimed, it has been possible, at least at intervals, to open the High Court.  There are difficulties in any possible wording of that clause, but I think we reduced them to a minimum by the word &ldquo;all,&rdquo; and I think, after consideration, the Deputy will have agreed that putting one thing with another, we could not have done very much better.</P>

      <P>This amendment was put up by the Treasury, the Finance Department.  It involves the deletion of Article 73 and to substitute the following new Article.&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall affect any liability to pay any tax or duty payable in respect of the financial year current at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution or any preceding financial year, or in respect of any period ending on or before <Col N="1787" /> the last day of the said current financial year, or payable on any occasion happening within that or any preceding year, or the amount of such liability; and during the said current financial year all taxes and duties and arrears thereof shall continue to be assessed, levied and collected in like manner in all respects as immediately before this Constitution came into operation, subject to the like adjustments of the proceeds collected as were theretofore applicable; and for that purpose the Executive Council shall have the like powers and be subject to the like liabilities as the Provisional Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Goods brought during the said current financial year from the Irish Free State to any part of the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, or from any part of the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man to the Irish Free State shall not, except so far as the Executive Council may otherwise direct in respect of the forms to be used and the information to be furnished, be treated as goods exported or imported as the case may be.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of this Article, the expression `financial year' means, as respects income tax (including super-tax) the year of assessment, and as respects other taxes and duties the year ending on the thirty-first day of March.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Article is put up to ensure continuity in the collection and in the payment of taxes.  The gist of it simply is that the liabilities to the British Government become liabilities to the first Government of the Free State, and continue to run until the current financial year runs out, which will be on the 31st March next.  Amounts properly due to the British Government become due to the first Irish Government under this Constitution.  If there are any questions desired to be raised on this particular Article, no doubt the Minister for Finance will answer them.</P>

It is intended to have precisely the effect that Article 73 of the Bill was intended to have, but it is thought that some matters which might have been left in doubt are not made quite clear and explicit in 73, are made clear in the proposed amendment.  It is not put before the Dáil in the sense of putting a new matter of substance.</P>

      <P>I spoke before the amendment was seconded because what I was saying was in the nature of an appeal.  I hoped before this was formally seconded and therefore put in train for voting that it might be postponed. So far as I was able to comprehend it, on hearing it read, there is one very important item in it.  Under cover of securing continuity there is a reversal of doctrine, and a critical question is raised by it&mdash;a reversal of doctrine on the part of the Ministry in relation to their own past policy.  Before the truce, and they are responsible for this, appeal was made to the country to hamper the operations of the British Government in a variety of ways.  For example, by the withholding of Income Tax.  Numbers of people as a matter of principle, and also encouraged thereby as a matter of gain, refused at great personal risk&mdash; the peril of imprisonment&mdash;to pay their Income Tax, and now we are asked to pass, by a small number of Deputies, a resolution which will compel those arrears to be paid now under the patriotic pressure of paying into the depleted funds of the Irish Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not? That is exactly what I am going to show. There had been no settlement at the time of the Treaty with England in regard to financial matters.  In all the debates about the Treaty&mdash;that I was able to read about&mdash;in the last Dáil there was not one word raised by the opponents of the Treaty against the omission to determine the financial relations, and this was one of the many things that made me regard the party opposing the Treaty as hopelessly incapable and absolutely bankrupt in the way of statesmanship&mdash;that they thought of freedom without considering it in terms of finance. Now there is as yet no agreement, so far as I understand&mdash;this may be my <Col N="1789" /> ignorance, but certainly the public share my ignorance&mdash;with the British Treasury as regards adjustments of finances between Great Britain and Ireland. There are to be sets-off, but what is to be the exact amount is absolutely in the melting pot.  The thing is undefined, and now pressure is to be used to collect arrears of Income Tax; they are to be paid into the funds of the Irish Free State.  Do the Ministry ask us to believe that England will not calculate the amount as a set-off?  What, then, are they proposing to do but simply to become collectors of arrears of Income Tax on behalf of Great Britain?  It seems to me that the matter requires a great deal more consideration.  As to the question of policy it is simply a reversal of the Sinn Fein teaching.  That is what it amounts to.  Ministers are cutting with their own past.  I would beg of the Ministry to leave the Dáil time to digest this.  It may be that my criticism is an example of crudity.  I dare say the Minister for Finance will say it is, but I shall put in this plea of extenuation that neither I nor any of our colleagues here have had an opportunity to deal with these proposals as they ought to be dealt with, namely, with full and mature consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any case has been made against accepting of this Article instead of the one that is in the Bill.  It is not exactly fair to say that it is a question of rushing. Everybody who has been in attendance here knows from the number of questions that have been addressed to the Minister for Finance what imperfect information there is regarding the collection of Income Tax.  It has been put to us that for some time previous to the Truce we advised people not to pay their Income Tax.  That is true, but we never advised them not to pay their Income Tax at the expense of their lives, their liberties, or any bigger loss than would be occasioned by the payment of the Income Tax.  As far as I know, there was no express Decree of the Dáil passed ordering people not to pay their Income Tax.  These were liabilities that in the ordinary way would have gone to the British Government.  By the arrangement that we have made with the British Government these will now come in to us, and if the Deputy who <Col N="1790" /> has spoken now has any misgivings about the matter I can assure him that if he pays up his arrears of Income Tax that they certainly will be very well spent, because there is a sensible body of men here, and in any action they will take they will be guided by the soundest business principles.  There are reasons for putting down this resolution&mdash;serious reasons.  There is a line of thought in this country at the moment that people will be liable for double income tax, charged here and charged also in England&mdash;people having property here and having investments in England, that they would also be liable for them.  There is no danger whatever of any such liability, and it is the intention of the Government, and those who compose it, and if they are not in power it will be their duty to advise those who are in power, that the best interests of this country would not be served by having double income tax, and there is no real danger of any such thing as double income tax occurring. As regards the second part of the Article, &ldquo;Goods brought during the current financial year,&rdquo; it is known that, although we are entering into possession of all moneys collected&mdash;Customs, Revenue charges, and so on&mdash;we have not yet got over the staffs of these Departments.  The British Inland Revenue authorities and the Customs and Excise are at present operating on an agency basis.  If the idea is that if we cut as from now, I say it would not be a reasonable position in the limited time at our disposal, and the number of matters to be attended to, to fix up machinery in such a perfect way as there would have been no mess-up in the business. I do not know that any case whatever, except the case of want of confidence in the Government and its advisers, has been made.  I ask the Dáil to pass this amendment.  It would not be possible to delay this.  The Report stage, this particular stage, I expect finished possibly to-night, at least I expect to-morrow evening.  In that case only verbal amendments can be taken.  As regards the suggestion to hold up the whole thing in order to allow members to read it, it would have been possible for any of them to have made inquiries, and the Minister of Finance would have explained it perhaps more exhaustively.</P>

      <P>I am interested in <Col N="1791" /> this particular subject, but I think the phrase in the first sentence, &ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall affect any liability,&rdquo; makes it possible for me to agree without opposing or even entering into any argument such as that touched on by the President.  If there is a liability, then nothing in the Constitution shall affect it, and that is as far as one needs to go in this matter.  We may deny the liability, but that is not for this discussion, I take it.  I ask Ministers just to devote their attention to one very slight verbal question in the second paragraph &mdash;&ldquo;Goods brought during the said current financial year from the Irish Free State to any part of the United Kingdom.&rdquo; By the way, United Kingdom in that sense I am not sure should appear. The words might very well be in the British Act if it were phrased in Britain&mdash;&ldquo;Goods brought from Ireland to London&rdquo;&mdash;but it does not appear to be quite satisfactory for us here to speak of goods brought from the Irish Free State to the Isle of Man.  I suggest the word &ldquo;brought&rdquo; should be altered to &ldquo;conveyed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; should be altered to something else&mdash;to Great Britain, or the Six Counties, or both.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 26 to Article 75, line 56/57&mdash;&ldquo;To delete the words `resigns as aforesaid, or `if any such judge.' &rdquo; This amendment is an adoption of a suggestion which was made here at Committee Stage by Deputy McGoldrick.  The Article will read:&mdash;&ldquo;If any judge of the said Supreme Court of Judicature, or of any of the said County Courts, on the establishment of Courts under this Constitution, is not with his consent appointed to be a judge of any such Court, he shall, for the purpose of Article 10 of the Scheduled Treaty, be treated as if he had retired in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance of the said Treaty, but the rights so conferred shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims that he may have against the British Government.&rdquo; It was felt that the Article as originally worded might possibly cover the case of a resignation by reason of age or ill-health, or something in that way.  A judge resigning in that way would be entitled to claim the benefit of Article 10.  It is proposed, therefore, to leave out these words I have mentioned and let the Article run without them.</P>

      <P>It has been found necessary to move after Article 77, Article 77 (B), and it is regretted that it was not possible to give the Dáil longer notice.  The Article reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>77B.  &ldquo;The transfer of the administration of any public service, the administration of which was not before the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution transferred to the Provisional Government shall be deferred until the 31st day of March, 1923, or such earlier date as may after one month's previous notice in the Official <i>Gazette</i> be fixed by the Executive Council, and such of the officers engaged in the administration of those services at the date of transfer as may be determined in the manner hereinafter appearing shall be transferred to and become officers of the Irish Free State; and Article 76 of this Constitution shall apply as if such officers were existing officers of the Provisional Government who had been transferred to that Government from the British Government, and as if the date of transfer were the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.  The officers to be so transferred in respect of any services shall be determined in like manner as if the administration of the services had before the coming into operation of the Constitution been transferred to the Provisional Government.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Article different days may be fixed for the transfer of different services.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the new Article is that it covers the case of the Land Commission. The Land Commission has not yet been transferred and, unlike Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue, it is not even in the stage of being at present administered on an agency basis.  The Land Commission has not been transferred at all, and before it can be, there will have to be very considerable financial negotiations.  This new Article merely provides that the transfer of any service like that which has not been transferred before the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution, shall be deferred until the 31st March, when the financial year ends, or such earlier date as may be fixed, upon a month's notice being given by the Executive Council.  If we were in a position to take it over earlier it would lie with us to <Col N="1794" /> give the one month's notice and then to take it over, but we do not want to take over a huge department like the Land Commission without very careful examination of both its assets and liabilities. In the fixing of its liabilities, as well as in the deciding of its assets, there will be need for a good deal of Committee work, and negotiation between experts.  Our position is entirely safeguarded in this new Article.  It says that it shall not be taken over until the 31st March, or if we think fit to take it over earlier, there shall be a month's notice in which the necessary negotiations may take place.  That particular Article is set down simply to insure that the Land Commission will not pass automatically, on the coming into operation of the Constitution, into our hands with its liabilities undefined, and that before it passes to us we shall have an opportunity of going very fully into the business aspect of the matter, and examining what are alleged to be the liabilities of that department, as well as satisfying ourselves as to what exactly are its assets.  There is nothing else in that proposed new Article.  It was a very necessary Article because some hold that if we did not put it in, the Land Commission would pass automatically into our hands when the Constitution would come into operation, and possibly the Irish Government might find itself confronted with an accomplished fact, and be told simply, &ldquo;those are the liabilities, and they pass to you on such and such a date.&rdquo; To forestall that we put in this Article.</P>

      <P>It is but right to say that one of the great difficulties in <Col N="1795" /> this matter is what is called scheming the service.  Now, if we passed the Article in the order in which it was first set out, very considerable difficulty would arise.  This is one of the cases where our absence from any control or any knowledge of the administration of this country by the British, places the Government and the Dáil in a very disadvantageous position.  Those are things one must learn as one goes along &mdash; the peculiarities and intricacies of these Government departments which the public had very little knowledge of.  We should take precautions with a view to safeguarding our positions and allowing some time for negotiations.  These negotiations would have taken place almost immediately after the elections, if it were not for what has happened.  We were in course of negotiation with them, but I think the Dáil will realise that the Provisional Government had a very considerable volume of business to transact, and, not having the inside knowledge of these Departments, there is a liability to fall into some mistake or other.  I believe the Dáil will safeguard it with this proposed new Article, and it is with that view it is put forward. We regret there was such short notice, but, having regard to all the circumstances, it is well we have arranged it this way.</P>

      <P>There is only one fear at the moment which I do not think is quite irrelevant.  This new Article that is proposed was put into our hands a few minutes ago. Strictly speaking, it should have arisen in Committee, but that does not greatly affect the issue.  Here is a matter which it was very proper and right to raise, and if it had not been included in some part of the Constitution the Parliament would have left it open to imposing in future a liability which we would not agree to take.  That discovery was made quite recently; indeed, so late that we have just got it, and I am wondering whether there are not other matters that might occur to-morrow morning or next week.  The point I am raising is this: it is impossible in a matter like this, when dealing with the transfer of services, to be perfectly sure that all matters are covered.  Here is a matter which, if we passed the fourth stage of <Col N="1796" /> this Bill yesterday, would be out of order, and could not be included.  What protection are we taking in regard to other matters?</P>

      <P>I owe it to the courtesy of the President that I have a copy at all, and I merely read it in the last few moments, and it strikes me in reading it that there is a very important question of the Insurance Commission involved. A great deal of blundering and bungling has taken place as between Great Britain and Ireland with regard to that service.  Within one month of the promulgation of this Constitution&mdash; that might at furthest be the 6th January next &mdash; Northern Ireland will have made its election and declared whether it is to remain in the Free State or go out, and the whole question then will emerge &mdash; a very difficult question, too, with innumerable entanglements and complexities &mdash; of what is to be done with the Insurance Commission.  It would look as if the general terms of this include such administration. Mention has been made exclusively of the Land Commission, as if it were the only case.  There is a further thing that puzzles me.  &ldquo;The officers to be so transferred in respect of any services shall be determined in like manner as if the administration of the services had, before the coming into operation of the Constitution, been transferred to the Provisional Government.&rdquo; I wonder what that means?  I, for one, speaking as an individual, have no knowledge of how the officers would be determined for any administration, if the services to which they belonged do come into the hands or under the control of the Provisional Government.  I am not speaking with any attempt even at hostility. I am speaking as one trying to explore a difficult area.  What exactly does this mean?</P>

I am credibly informed that they are mathematically correct, and I am prepared to accept that.  The Dáil should know that in dealing with those amendments it simply turns on making the total membership 60.  If they approve of that all those things are consequential and necessary.</P>

There are some other matters in connection with it that it would be advisable to deal with, as soon as possible, to get dates, for example, in connection with the scheming of the Land Commission, and other matters like that, and to see how soon we could take up the question of financial adjustment, and so on.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday at question time I asked the Minister for Agriculture to state the reasons for the action taken by the Government with regard to the closing of the College of Science, and also to state the intention of the Government with regard to the future.  A long reply was given by the Minister yesterday, which did not quite clear up some of the points I had in mind, and I intended to raise the matter last night on the adjournment, but Deputy Gavan Duffy got in before me.  My object in raising it to-night is to give the Minister an opportunity of clearing up some points in this connection which still are doubtful.  We were told yesterday that the College of Science was closed for military reasons.  I do not wish to go into that.  If the military advisers of the Government have said it was necessary to close the College of Science for military reasons, they are the best judges, but to the ordinary lay mind this necessity is not so apparent.  It is said that it was necessary for the protection of the Provisional <Col N="1800" /> Government that the College should be closed, but to anybody who knows the situation of these buildings, it would seem that there would be equal necessity for the protection of the Government to close the houses upon the opposite side of Merrion Street.  It may be said, of course, there is a certain element of danger from the military point of view in allowing four or five hundred students to go into a college&mdash;into the grounds&mdash; from Merrion Street side, but I am informed that it is possible to have an entrance from Kildare Street, and to shut off the college buildings altogether from the quadrangle of the College of Science.  However, that is not the main question, and it would certainly to my mind be more convincing, and I would be more convinced, as to the military necessity, if we had the assurance that this building with its splendidly-equipped laboratories and classrooms was not being used as offices of the Provisional Government. Now, if it was looking for accommodation the Government were, I suggest that accommodation could be got otherwise than by commandeering this splendidly equipped building of the College of Science.  They might have gone and commandeered some of the hotels, although they are pretty scarce now, but we have a large number of picture houses that they might have commandeered for this purpose.  Now, a statement has been issued on behalf of the students this afternoon, and it is to my mind so important that I will read it in order to give the Minister an opportunity of saying whether it is correct or not.  This is an extract from that statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is learned this afternoon that the Board of Works has prepared plans for the complete internal reconstruction of the College of Science, and that these alterations are being put in hand immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know whether that is true or not.  If it is true, it seems to me that in spite of the implication contained in the Minister's statement yesterday, the Government are already prejudging the question of the continuance of the College of Science.  If it is not true, I am sure the Minister will be glad of the opportunity of publicly denying the statement.  In his statement yesterday, the Minister referred to the reconstruction of the College of Science. I am not quite clear, because I have not <Col N="1801" /> been able to gather from the statement exactly what we are to understand by the proposed reconstruction of the College of Science.  He says, when it is reconstructed it will be reconstructed in accordance with the merits of the case. I trust he will throw some light upon that matter of the reconstruction of the College.  It is alleged that there is a duplication of work, as between the College of Science and the Universities. That may be so, but to my mind it is not a sufficient reason for closing up this institution.  If the same kind of work is being carried on in the universities, it is possible that there is room for both, and my information is, that institutions similar to the College of Science are found in most progressive countries.  I have been further told&mdash;it may not be the case, but in any case the statement has been made &mdash;that the students from the National University, especially third and fourth years' pupils, doing their engineering course, have been sent from the Universities to the College of Science, because there are better opportunities in the College of Science than exist in the Universities. Now, there is the question of the rights of the students and the rights of the staff, and I think the students as a whole were taken rather short.  Advertisements appeared, I understand, in the Press that the College would open in the ordinary way, and it was only when they had come up to town that they were told they must find accommodation elsewhere, and they have since had a certain amount of knocking about from one building to another and a very great deal of dissatisfaction exists and to my mind with a great deal of justice.  What I am concerned with really, is the intention of the Government with regard to the future of this College, and whether it is their intention, when the military necessity has disappeared, to revert to the <i>status-quo.</i> There is a very large volume of opinion, I submit, in this country, anxious that the College of Science should continue as at present, and I think no decision should be taken without very great care and very great consideration to discontinue this institution.  I would further be glad if the Minister would say what exactly is the position of the staff of the College&mdash;whether their salaries are to be paid; whether it is the intention to get rid of them, or whether they are to carry on their work still in other quarters <Col N="1802" /> that have been found for them.  I wish to say again, that my object in raising the matter is more to get these things cleared up publicly than otherwise, and I suggest that on the points I have raised that the Minister will clear them up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points in the questions raised by Deputy O'Connell.  The first is with regard to military necessity; the second, which is of very great importance to the students and to the public generally, is whether the College of Science is going to be discontinued.  I remember very distinctly when a grant was given for the foundation of the new College of Science, there was a good deal of jealousy in both the institutions, in both universities, that a State grant which had been given had not been given to the two Universities to enlarge their Science Departments, and which if given would have provided better results.  The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction had apparently no difficulty whatever, in getting a promise of a quarter of a million of money for the building of the College of Science, and I am sure it cost three or four times that amount.  I am informed that the equipment of the College has cost half a million of money and it will be a very serious matter that such a huge sum of money, having been spent, this equipment is now to be scrapped.  Now, one of the reasons given for the foundation of the College was, that there was not proper accommodation in either of the two Universities to teach the subjects that were taught in the College of Science, and I ask, is it possible for the Universities to do now what they were incapable of performing when the College of Science was being built. Another point is this, as to the Professors, who have been accustomed to teach in the College of Science, are they the men who are to teach the same subjects to these students in the University?  Or, are the University Professors to be paid extra, if they are asked to do it?  The most important point to my mind is the question of the dismantling of these splendid buildings.  The College of Science has been doing splendid work and its Professors are men of the highest scientific attainments. It will be a deplorable thing if we are to lose this fine building for the future. I simply tried to enlarge on what Deputy <Col N="1803" /> O'Connell has asked so as to give the Minister of Agriculture an opportunity of exactly explaining the situation, because there is tremendous excitement, and tremendous discontent at the present moment amongst the students, and not only amongst their sons, but amongst the parents of the students who have sent the students to the College of Science with the object of getting from that College a highly scientific training.  There is great discontent that the students are to be hunted about from one institution to another in order to get their qualifications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN Mr. P. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it right to say that I have learned from Deputy FitzGibbon, who has handed in a question which I will read, that he was going to raise this to-morrow at question time. I will read the question now:&mdash;&ldquo;Whether it is a fact that operations are in progress in the buildings hitherto occupied by the College of Science which will, if carried out, make it impossible for the College to resume its activities in its former capacity on the termination of the present troubles?&rdquo; Now, there has been a good deal of excitment, a good deal of artificial excitement, about this.  There has been a deal of cry and little wool about the whole thing.  Now, I want to make it perfectly clear that the College of Science was not closed because the College of Science buildings adjoined the Government buildings.  It was not closed because the Government wanted more offices.  It was not closed because there were certain defects in the organisation of the College of Science.  I want to have that perfectly clear.  The College of Science was closed because our Military advisers advised us that with the information at their disposal they thought it right to tell us that it was absolutely necessary that it should be closed; that it was being used for purposes for which it was never intended.  Our Military advisers informed us that they had certain information in regard to the activities that were going on in the College of Science which made it absolutely necessary to close the College of Science if they were to be answerable for the adjoining buildings. That is the clear simple position. We are accustomed to take the advice of our Military advisers, even if it inconveniences people, and we took it on this occasion.  I hope now it is perfectly clear why the College of Science was <Col N="1804" /> closed.  Now, having said that much I would have thought that all this excitement would not be due to the closing of certain buildings&mdash;that if there was to be any excitement, or any energy wasted, it would be wasted, or I should say applied rather to the question of finding adequate provision for the students that were going to the College of Science.  I think that is the subject that anyone really interested in the question would address themselves to. The students of the College of Science had to take the facts as they found them. We are all inconvenienced by things that are happening at present.  I am inconvenienced, I dare say there is not a man here who is not inconvenienced. There is hardly an institution in the country that is not inconvenienced, and what they do like sensible men, is they make the best possible arrangements. And I thought it my duty as responsible for the College of Science, to make the very best arrangements I could, temporary arrangements.  I explained here yesterday that Dr. Coffey, the President of the University College, had offered all the facilities of his University to the College of Science.  When I learned of that, I instructed the authorities of the College of Science to take advantage of it.  I make no excuse for that.  I considered the offer of Dr. Coffey very generous, and I considered that practically in every subject all the students of the College of Science can get the same facilities in University College as they could have got in the College of Science.  There are one or two exceptions.  I do admit that in Practical Engineering there is not the same equipment.  We hope to remedy that.  If the College of Science is to remain closed for any length of time, we have got to remedy that.  And the net result of it will be that they will only be seriously handicapped in one small direction, and that is in Practical Engineering.  And I hope with regard to that that we can make some arrangements later on.  Now I was asked about the reconstruction of the College of Science.  I think we are going too far on this matter.  The College of Science was closed for reasons over which none of us had any control.  The authorities of the College of Science, and everybody interested in it, are perfectly justified in making quite sure that this accident shall not prejudice the institution. As I said yesterday, this accident <Col N="1805" /> shall not be made a reason for effecting a special arrangement.  They are quite right in that.  On the other hand I wanted to make it perfectly clear that so far as the College of Science does need reconstruction&mdash;and in my opinion it does&mdash;I am not to be stopped when the time comes, if it is my responsibility, from effecting that reconstruction by any undertaking given in connection with this particular arrangement that is taking place now.  I hope I am perfectly clear. I may be right or I may be wrong in saying that there is certain duplication between the Universities and the College of Science, and it is abnormal that there should be one educational institution under the Minister of Agriculture and another under the Minister of Education. But that is outside the point.  These are two different questions, and I would not have referred to them except that they have been referred to and canvassed. These are questions that would come up at the proper time and be dealt with at the proper time, I hope after due consideration. Nothing that happens now is going to prejudice that one way or the other. Now, as to when the College of Science will open, I cannot say.  I would like to think that it would be very soon, but I certainly cannot say.  It will all depend on the military situation and on the advice we get from people competent to give advice on this subject.  With regard to the question as to whether we are going to use any of the rooms in the College, if they are suitable for our purpose we certainly will if we require them.  There is nothing sacrosanct in the rooms.  If we find rooms in the College of Science suitable we will make use of them rather than leave them idle, but we are not going to make any changes in the College of Science which would prejudice its opening when the right time comes. With regard to the staff of the College, I met the staff of the College yesterday, and I discussed the whole question with them, and they agreed themselves that their duty in the matter was to make the best possible arrangement they could for the students, if necessary to send the students to the University College.  If rooms can be set aside in University College, Dublin, for the staff that will be done.  If there are some of the staff idle as a result of this, that cannot be helped.  After all it flows from the original happening&mdash; namely, the closing of the College.  The <Col N="1806" /> arrangements are not yet completed. When the arrangements are completed we will know how the whole matter stands. At this stage I cannot say what the final arrangements with regard to the staff will be.  I do not think that any other point has been raised.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister was very thankful that it had been raised, and I was also going to add that I was very glad that it had been raised, but I would like the Minister to be good enough to add to the statement which he has just made, if he can.  I think he can give certain confirmation of what was said when a deputation of the staff of the College of Science visited him yesterday&mdash;when he was good enough to receive them.  The Minister has referred to the generous offer of the National University to give what assistance they could in the difficulty which, I may say, very unexpectedly arose, but I think it was inadvertently he omitted to remark that on the same day he had a similar offer communicated, not to himself, because he was away at the time, but through me, on behalf of the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.  It was through inadvertence I omitted to mention that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Inadvertently I am sure, but as one offer was given such publicity, it was necessary for me to draw attention to that offer also, and that offer still holds good.  The other point on which I think the Minister for Agriculture agreed yesterday when that deputation was present was that this matter affected what is apparently a very vital point&mdash;that is, that members of any educational institution, whether College or University, should have their academic independence, and that what has caused a considerable amount of feeling in this matter may, or may not, have <Col N="1807" /> been inevitable in this case to a certain extent, but which was to a certain extent regrettable was that the orders to the students were not communicated to the staff under whom they were immediately placed, but through an external body.  Now, when an academic question of that sort is raised it is right that the staff should be satisfied that their academic independence is not in any way being lowered, and the Minister was quite ready and able yesterday to satisfy members of the staff that he was not going to lower their academic independence in any way.  The way, however, in which the matter was left&mdash;I would like the Minister to confirm this&mdash;is that the staff were left to make such arrangements as they could for giving instructions in the best way that could possibly be done by sending students to classes in the Universities, or by themselves teaching the students in the accommodation provided for them, on the one hand by the National University, or on the other by Trinity College.  I am not now in the slightest way objecting to anything the Minister said in his opening remarks, with which I am quite in accord, and I would like him to add two things in his supplementary statement. He has already added one of them.  I am sure that the omission was due, as he said, to inadvertence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the statement of the Minister for Agriculture is going to create this impression&mdash; that he was glad of the opportunity which had arisen by the decision of the Military Authorities that the continued sessions of the College of Science were dangerous, and therefore it ought to be closed.  That gave him the opportunity of keeping it closed and dispersing it and utilising the Universities for doing the work which has hitherto been done by the College of Science.  Now that may be a right policy or a wrong policy.  If it is a right policy it is done very much in the wrong way. I am not asserting that that is his intention. I do not know.  I am in doubt. But, certainly, if I were to judge merely by the manner and the matter of his statements yesterday and to-day, I would conclude that that was the intention&mdash; to disperse the College of Science and to utilise in the future the two Universities for the work that has been done there in the past.  We have something like what <Col N="1808" /> may be intended to be an assurance that the statement that was issued on behalf of the students to the effect that the Board of Works had prepared plans for the complete internal reconstruction of the College of Science, and that these alterations are being put in hands immediately, that that statement is not accurate.  I am not sure whether the Minister definitely disowned or denied that statement.  He said that they were not taking steps which would prejudice the possibility of the College reverting to its old work.  I feel that the statement of the Minister is going to leave the impression, unless it is removed by a subsequent statement, that the Ministry has decided upon a change of policy and that they do not desire that the College of Science in its present form should continue its work, but that the students should divide themselves into one or other of the Universities for carrying on this particular scientific work.  If that is a misinterpretation, I hope there will be a very much more definite disavowal than has been given to it by the Minister for Agriculture. There is another aspect of this matter I would like to raise, and it is, perhaps, more germane to the complaints.  I feel that the Minister for Defence&mdash;the Military Authorities&mdash;have perhaps acted too drastically in deciding that the only remedy was to close the work of the College.  They came to the conclusion, I presume, that work was being carried on there or might be carried on there which would be disastrous to the adjoining buildings and would be a national damage; but the Military mind in general has a habit of saying this thing is in hand, and therefore it must be stopped, going direct to the other extreme. Now, I suggest, inasmuch as the number that are vitally affected by this is comparatively small, the advanced students, I understand, doing the later experimental work, that it might have been possible to have still provided facilities for these particular students by one means or another, to carry on their work in that building, without dispersing the three or four hundred students&mdash;which number has been mentioned&mdash;of all grades and rank.  A smaller number could have been supervised, and some provision might have been made, I think, for the work being carried on without this very drastic decision.</P>

      <P>If I had thought that, I would not have intervened at <Col N="1810" /> this stage, because I am not very conversant with the facts, and there are other Deputies more conversant with the facts.  I thought this debate should have continued until there had been some fuller discussion, because it is of considerable importance and ought not to be stopped in this manner.</P>

      <P>I am as much alive to the importance of this subject, I take it, as any Deputy in the Dáil, but we have Standing Orders which I think we must maintain, and if we agree to this particular breach of them now, it must not be taken as a precedent. The Standing Orders Committee can, of course, meet, draw up a rule on this matter and put it before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There is not much more for me to say, but what I cannot understand,&mdash;except on the assumption that the Minister of Agriculture has decided, in his own mind at any rate, that a complete change of policy in regard to the College of Science ought to take place,&mdash;I cannot understand why he should have emphasised that he did not want to be precluded from certain changes in the future, that he did not want this particular crisis to prevent him making a change of policy in the future.  So far as I am aware nobody suggested anything of that kind until he raised that matter in the answer to a question yesterday, and it seems to suggest that he, at least, has decided that there will be change of policy.  I would like to have an assurance, and I am quite sure the people interested would like to have an assurance, that there was no other way out, no other way of meeting the Military situation than by the complete closing of the College of Science.  I should like to have an assurance that other methods of meeting <Col N="1811" /> the Military situation were fully considered, and that consultations with the people most concerned were made, to consider how best to meet that particular situation.  Before doing such a drastic thing as this it seems to me that that was the obvious duty of the Minister concerned.  I think we would like to have this assurance that the particular equipment, the particular machinery, that is and has been used in the College of Science, and which is now there, is not going to be dismantled or disturbed, so that we shall have some confidence in saying that until there is a well-thought out and approved new policy, that no new policy of this kind will be decided on the mere fancy of the Minister of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I suppose it would be vain on my part to presume that my few scattered and incomplete remarks yesterday evening inspired sudden enthusiasm for autonomy on the part of students as against control of the State in matters of this kind.  Now, I have heard a number of suggestions put in the form of queries, to the effect that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, all this time had some sort of Machiavellian policy up his sleeve with regard to the College of Science.  The facts of the case are these: that the Minister of Agriculture, to the great regret of his colleagues, was absent, unwell, for a week at least, I think, before this crisis arose at all, in any shape or form, or was whispered in any shape or form. He was not present, to our great regret, to be consulted when the difficulty arose. He was not consulted when the difficulty arose, and the decision was taken entirely in his absence.  Now, with regard to the decision itself&mdash;again the atmosphere of suspicion has been raised, and I want to make the facts as plain as possible.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture has understated the facts, and I do not feel competent to state fully what the reasons of Military necessity were.  I doubt myself whether those reasons were confined to any knowledge of activities or possible activities that might be pursued by anyone among the students, or likely to be among the students, and I doubt very much whether the reasons were confined to that at all.  But whatever the reasons were they satisfied the Military Authorities.  The Military Authorities made a very complete examination <Col N="1812" /> into the facts of the case, and when their advice that the College must be closed came to me, in the first instance, the first thing that I did, at the very earliest possible opportunity, was to approach the Military Authorities and to put before them every possible plan that I could think of, by which the closing of the College should be averted&mdash;every precaution that I could think of, or that could be suggested to me by people who were competent to suggest, by which the closing of the College could be averted. I put those considerations fully before the Military Authorities, and the Military Authorities decided that the precautions, and so on, that I suggested to them, did not meet the case, and that it would still be necessary to close the College. Up to that time none of these questions that have been raised with regard to the design of my colleague as to the future of the College had come before anybody. Now, I hope that disposes of this question of ulterior designs.</P>

      <P>With regard to the future of the College, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that the Government does not desire that the benefits of the College of Science to the public shall be continued, but the Government does not certainly pledge itself that they would be continued in any particular form.  They will be continued, we all hope, to the full, in an equal or greater measure than at present.  Deputy Sir James Craig pointed out&mdash;his own estimate, I think it was&mdash;that something like half a million had been spent in the building and equipment of this College of Science, and I think my friend would possibly have liked to complete what he said by saying that very much less than half a million would have enabled <Col N="1813" /> the two Universities to make far more magnificent provision for the needs for which the College of Science was intended to provide&mdash;very, very much less.  I think it is well to be clear that there is no intention on the part of the Government to diminish the benefits of the College of Science to the public.  This thing has arisen in a particular way, and if the Minister for Agriculture has replied as stated, that the fact that it has arisen does not preclude the Government from regarding the most complete and beneficial way for utilising and extending the work of the College of Science in the future for the public benefit&mdash;if he has said that, it is because the question has been raised outside and inside, and it has been put to the public and is being put to the public, that in some way or other, because this has arisen, the Government should be precluded and placed under some sort of pledge, that it is going to continue this Institution in every shape and every form and every degree exactly as it exists now.  The Government will give no such undertaking. With regard to the equipment and machinery, I am asked will the Government undertake that the machinery will not be dismantled or disturbed.  The undertaking I will give will be that the facilities which exist will not be diminished so far as the Government can prevent it, but that no changes will be made in any shape or form.  For the same reason as I have said, it was necessary for the Minister for Agriculture to safeguard himself, it is necessary for me to safeguard myself.  I will not give any undertaking and I am sure that the Government will not give any undertaking, that no such thing as a change in the smallest degree in the equipment of the College will be made.  I hope that is perfectly clear.  The Government, so far as it can, will maintain the benefits of this College for the students who attend it, <Col N="1814" /> and that is all they pledge themselves to do.  This College has been the most markedly State institution of such educational institutions in Ireland at the present, and I hope that no one will imagine that, because it has been so, it should now suddenly be transformed into a sort of Soviet.  We find here in the reports students actually saying, and the Chairman of the meeting upholding, that the reasons assigned by the Government for this act are not the true reasons.  The reasons given by the Government are the true reasons and the only reasons for which the College has been closed.  And we also find it suggested that the students should come here and tell us&mdash;you, the elected representatives of the people of Ireland&mdash; what they thought of it.</P>

      <P>They did not come, very wisely.  Really the students, I think, are the beneficiaries in this matter to a very large degree.  This is a College endowed at enormous expense and it is conferring enormous favours on all those who are able to take part in its work.  I hope we shall have a more reasonable attitude in future, and I trust that no responsible person here or outside will encourage the students of a college of this kind to take up an attitude such as that which appears to actually menace the action of the representatives of the people; or that they should take upon themselves publicly to say that the reasons which have been given for the closing of the College are not the true reasons.</P>
