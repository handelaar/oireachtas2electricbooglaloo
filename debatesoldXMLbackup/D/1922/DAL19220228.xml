      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT GRIFFITH:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty approved by the majority of the Dáil, a meeting of representatives elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland was convened to formally endorse the Treaty and set up the Provisional Government.  That Government was duly established.  Dublin Castle has been handed over to it, and the evacuation of the country by the British forces was begun and is still in progress.  It was intended to ascertain the will of the Irish electorate at the earliest moment, and if this will sustained the Treaty to proceed with the drafting of an Irish Constitution.  The leaders of the minority party in the Dáil, however, contended that more time was needed for the electorate to form a correct judgment, and that the Constitution should be published before the election. An agreement to this effect was signed, and in conformity with it I went to London with the Minister for Home Affairs and secured that no election will be held during the three months' period agreed upon.  Since the last meeting the Cabinet decided it was advisable to discontinue the Belfast Boycott, with a view to instituting an era of good will with our dissident fellow-countrymen in the North-East.  The object is not yet achieved, but we are hopeful that it will be.  The Dáil Departments will function as hitherto until the election. The Provisional Government Departments have been actively functioning in harmony with them, and in the interests of peace and good order will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, may I ask if it is a fact that a considerable proportion of the staff of Dáil Eireann Labour Department has been transferred to the City Hall and is working there in conjunction with the Labour Department of the Provisional Government?  If so it would seem that Mr. MacGrath was not prepared to keep the Dáil Departments functioning as they were before the Articles of Agreement were signed&mdash;that is, to their fullest possible extent, and to function as the only Labour Department of this country competent to deal with Labour disputes among the Irish people.

      <NameTxt>MR. MACENTEE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make a speech in regard to it unless these questions are answered satisfactorily. Unless we are certain that the gentlemen who are going to be appointed will act in the spirit of the pact entered into at the Ard-Fheis we, of course, cannot agree or assent to their appointments as Ministers.  There is, in regard to this Department, a certain matter of doubt. Throughout the labour troubles that have taken place since the establishment of the Provisional Government&mdash;labour disputes which those who stand for the Republic are very well aware did not take place and were capable of easy settlement under the regime of the Republic&mdash;we, who understood that the Ministers had been appointed to uphold the Republic until it was disestablished by a vote of the Irish people, see that the Labour Department of Dáil Eireann has been absolutely subverted by the Labour Department of the Provisional Government.  Before we can assent to the appointment of a Minister here today we must have a satisfactory assurance that the Minister of Labour appointed here will function solely as the representative of the Dáil in all labour disputes which may take place between now and the election.</P>

I am perfectly willing to deal with the Minister of Dáil Eireann.  As far as the Ministers of the Provisional Government are concerned, it does not make any difference whatever in this question.  He, as the Minister of Education of Dáil Eireann, would have my first support and submission in my capacity as head of a school.  Now, I want to know, in view of the new arrangement, if he will undertake to deal with the education of Ireland as Minister of Dáil Eireann and not refer me, in any communication I have to make to him, to any other Government than the Government of Dáil Eireann?</P>

      <P>To suggest that the Minister of Education is supreme in educational matters is very extraordinary. It is a manifest fact that the Minister of Education in Dáil Eireann was not supreme in educational matters. The suggestions of the educational authorities were very often not received.  In my present capacity I have power to see that the suggestions which I think should be carried out are carried out, but that can only be done through the machinery of the Provisional Government.  That is one of the facts of the situation and no amount of drawing of cobwebs about the facts can alter them.  If you like to make me &mdash;to use the Minister of Finance's phrase &mdash;do the dirty work, by applying to the Provisional Government, very well.

      <P>I would like to ask a question of Mr. Hogan.  Does the reply made by the Minister of Defence to the question submitted by Mr. de Valera also govern his case?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MR. HOGAN MR. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>MR. HOGAN:</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that letter exactly shows the position.  I was written to in regard to unpurchased tenants.  You all understand what that means&mdash;tenants who have not purchased under the Land Purchase Act.  I was asked what could be done.  That letter came to me to the City Hall, and it was the right place to send it, because there is no use blinking facts.  We all know that the Dáil Department has not the finance to complete land purchase.  This letter came to me to the City Hall&mdash;to the only body who are in the way of the finances to complete land purchase&mdash;and I answered it.  I may say that, as far as I can, I am keeping the two departments watertight.  When people write to me on business which can only be done by a Government of State with control of legislation and taxation, I answer that from the department that has such control.  If I wrote out from the Dáil Department to the unpurchased tenants of Cork or elsewhere that the Dáil Department was going to complete land purchase, I would be writing what was not a fact.  I knew it was not in their power to do it.  That is my answer.</P>

I did not send any letter to the City Hall.  I sent a letter to the &ldquo;Minister for Agriculture, Dáil Eireann, c.o.

Mr. Collins, Minister of Finance, Dáil Eireann, is not in a position&mdash;and the Lord Mayor of Cork knew it&mdash;to put up two million pounds for the rebuilding of Cork, but Mr. Collins, Chairman of the Provisional Government, is in a position to secure from the British Government payment in advance on the liability which will be settled by an inter-Governmental Commission. And the Provisional Government is responsible to the body that appointed it.  It was not this body that appointed the Provisional Government and, as one member of the Provisional Government, I will not answer questions here regarding actions I take as a member of the Provisional Government.</P>

Before the Provisional Government was established we had succeeded in making this really the <i>de facto</i> Government of this country.  The citizens of Cork want money for the rebuilding of their city. I suggest that it is not correct to say that the only agency by which the money can be raised is the agency of the Provisional Government.  We succeeded in floating a loan in America and had the Articles of Agreement not been signed we would have succeeded in floating another loan, twenty times as large.  If the citizens of Cork wish to raise money for rebuilding, I say it is within the competency of the Minister for Finance to float a loan in America or elsewhere for the specific purpose of rebuilding Cork.  That would be one way in which it could be done.</P>

      <P>Before you put the question I would like again to emphasise what Mr. de Valera has just said.  We would like a clear definition of what the authority is that is to rule this country.  Is it Dáil Eireann or is it the Provisional Government?  All of us here recognise that Dáil Eireann is the sovereign authority.  When our Ministers act under that authority will they accept before this House full responsibility for everything that is done in their various departments, and answer questions or take responsibility before the House for matters that arise in the course of their duties?  One definition has been given by an important member of the Cabinet of Dáil Eireann.  Another definition of policy has been given by another member.  Which definition can we accept, or is there any united definition that can be given by the Cabinet? I will certainly give a vote on this question of the appointment of Minister of Agriculture, not because I have any objection to Mr. Hogan any more than any other Minister who has been proposed to-day, but as the issue has been raised by the Minister of Economics. He has definitely raised the question, and on the appointment of this Minister I certainly will ask to be allowed to give a vote in this matter if it is not satisfactorily cleared up&mdash;if the Minister of Economics here is not going to accept responsibility to this Dáil for all actions taken in his name.</P>

      <P>In his capacity as Minister of Dáil Eireann, and, as far as this House is concerned, that he should bear responsibility to this House.  If there is another authority to be accepted as ruling his actions, if there is to be another Government which will be acting, perhaps&mdash;I don't say always, but which may sometimes act&mdash;in contradiction of the action of the Minister of Dáil Eireann for which he would not accept responsibility to this House, then see the position you would be in. And those who would support the action of some servant of another Government in this country, and who would not accept responsibility for it in this House, would be recognising another authority in the country which might act, if we don't stop it at once, contrary to the wishes of Dáil Eireann.  There are many here who would not be content to sit in this assembly and to give to it the authority of their presence if it is once said by any member of this House, particularly by a Minister, that Dáil Eireann is not henceforth to be the sovereign authority in the country.  It is a question I would like the Government of Dáil Eireann definitely to give us some information on.  On the answer they give serious consequences may arise.  I, personally, am anxious&mdash;as I think most of those on this side of the House are anxious&mdash;to, during the period of the Pact, let things run as smoothly as possible.  If matters of this kind are going to arise&mdash;if division of authority is going to be introduced&mdash;the consequences may be very serious.</P>

In fact, I see no other one that would be consistent with the position at all.  Why is, at the present time, the machinery which has been set up in accordance with the policy of the President being accepted?  Simply because we regard this as the sovereign assembly of the nation.  The majority here have given licence to certain things to be done. Take, for instance, the case of Economic <Col N="98" /> Affairs.  All the economic affairs of this nation are legally under the control of Dáil Eireann in virtue of the fact that we were elected by a majority of the Irish people.  All these were taken control of by the Minister of Economic Affairs.  He is responsible for them, and he will use whatever machinery&mdash; whatever resources he will get&mdash;in consequence of this policy.  If we had not his policy we would have another policy. It is in accordance with his policy&mdash;not in accordance with ours&mdash;that we are demanding that he takes full responsibility for the economic affairs of this nation, and that we, the sovereign assembly, choose to ask questions in respect of them.</P>

We spend most of our time talking about generalities and principles, and when we have principles fixed we seem to get no further.  Each one interprets principles according to his own particular point of view.  I suggest we would be doing better work to come down to details.  Is it to be the case that <Col N="101" /> the anti-Treaty party can introduce legislation tending to make our position impossible?  Because, if it is, that is breaking the spirit of the agreement of the Ard-Fheis.  That is the real question.</P>

It is only by reason of his permission the thing is allowed at all.  The President has got a majority in Dáil Eireann for his policy.  That majority will be sufficient to get his machinery accepted if it is in accordance with the ordinary rules of the House.  All we want is to make certain that we can ask him with respect to the general affairs of the nation&mdash;that we can ask the Minister for Economic Affairs questions relative to the economic affairs in the nation.  He is able to do certain things for the nation.  We are here custodians of the rights and interests of the nation.

President de Valera stated here a few months ago that he would bow to no authority but the authority of Dáil Eireann.  Now, in a few months' time, when an election takes place, if his party is defeated at that election, will President de Valera and his associates bow to the will of the Irish people, because, on their platforms throughout the country they have been, to my mind &mdash;I say this without offence&mdash;confusing the issue, and they have not made it quite clear to the people yet whether they will bow to the will of the Irish people?</P>

There are Ministers working very hard, day after day, and week after week, to establish Executive machinery for dealing with the various ills and problems of the nation.  It is to those Ministers these deputations should address themselves, and it is to those departments that concern them they should go.  I suggest that the first thing a deputation should do would be to put its case properly on paper, and not be coming here before us making speeches that go in one ear and out another.</P>

I strongly support the motion not to receive this or any other deputation. The Labour deputation that was received here some time ago was not intended to be regarded as a precedent.  It was regarded as exceptional&mdash;to deal with a very grave matter.  I don't think it should be taken as a precedent.  I therefore support the motion not to receive the deputation.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;We beg to thank the Dáil very sincerely for allowing us to present a very brief statement on a very grave question.  The statement I have, I can assure you, will occupy not more than two minutes. The organisation we represent is the largest body in Ireland that concerns itself with the drink evil.  It comprises nearly four hundred Total Abstinence Societies, with a membership of about two hundred thousand.  It is not our present purpose to make any suggestions regarding permanent legislation on the Liquor Traffic, but rather to urge the necessity for executive and administrative measures of a transitional nature to cope with a crisis. We are in touch with conditions in every part of the country, and for some time past, especially since the Truce, we have been receiving accounts of exceedingly grave and widespread drinking abuses.  The facts, indeed, are notorious and alarming.  (1). Dishonest traders have taken advantage of the national struggle to ply their traffic without any regard to days and hours of closing; and honest traders are powerless in the face of such unfair competition.  (2) Besides, an illicit traffic in poteen-making has grown to such dimensions in many parts of the country that it is gravely demoralising the masses of the people.  (3) Occasional licences are being granted too freely, with very regrettable results.  We beg respectfully to submit that these and similar abuses constitute a grave national menace which calls for prompt and drastic action from Dáil Eireann.  We need not labour the point.  In the critical times through which our country is now passing the danger of unchecked drinking abuses must be obvious. You have the power to make such transitional provisions of an executive nature as the situation calls for, to issue summary police regulations, and insist on their enforcement, regarding days and hours of closing and the suppression of the illicit traffic; and to authorise the infliction of heavy and exemplary penalties for their infringement.  It is inconceivable that there could be any division of opinion in the Dáil on the desirability, and even the urgent necessity, of such measures. Why not, then, put them in force as soon as possible.  They will have the support of sound and patriotic public opinion from every class and party in the country.  We invite you very earnestly to give the matter your earliest and best attention; and we thank you sincerely for allowing us to bring it under your notice.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>A small deputation from the Executive of the Catholic Total Abstinence Federation of Ireland earnestly requests the favour of a few minutes' hearing from the Dáil for a statement on a matter of urgent public importance concerning the actual condition of the Liquor Traffic in Ireland. The Federation, with its 400 affiliated branches throughout the country, can claim to voice Irish Catholic opinion on the Drink Problem.  The deputation is actually in attendance in the hope that the Dáil may find <Col N="107" /> it convenient to give us just a few moments before proceeding to business, or before resuming in the afternoon.</P>

      <P>There is one thing that ought to be made perfectly clear, irrespective of the motion in question. The notice that has to be given is written notice of motion.  I think it ought to be universally adopted that notice of motion means, in case of a Bill or Decree, notice setting out the full document, because a document of this kind is absolutely valueless if it says notice of motion concerning such a subject. It is the duty of a person who proposes a notice of motion to set out the motion in full.  If it is not set out in full, then it is not complying with the Standing Orders, and no action should be taken upon it.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this question of Orders of the Day, I wonder could we get any arrangement by which it would be possible whereby those on our side who wish to bring forward matters would have them definitely brought forward other than waiting like this without knowing whether they would come on at all?  If this happened to-morrow or at the end of the Session it would not come up at all.  Would it be possible to arrange by means of the <Col N="108" /> Ceann Comhairle that notices of motion like that would be considered in some definite manner?  For instance, take the case of the Speaker to-day.  He is absent.  Somebody may have sent him a letter yesterday and may never hear of it again.  The matter should be considered by somebody the Cabinet and the Deputies would appoint.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, the members of the Dáil have already in their hands the Statement of Accounts which I have got printed in two parts in the old way in order to show the accounts more clearly&mdash;one for the half-year ended 30th June, 1921, and the second for the half-year ended 31st December, 1921.  In addition to that I have adopted the usual custom of giving a sketch of the accounts practically up to date.  That sketch, of course, could not be ready as soon as these accounts. I will read the auditor's report and make just a few comments on it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13 Westmoreland Street,</P>
      <P>Dublin,</P>
      <P>17th February, 1922.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the Members of Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen,</P>
      <P>I beg to report that I have completed the audit of your books for the two half-years ended 30th June, 1921, and 31st December, 1921, respectively.  I send you herewith certified copies of Receipts and Disbursements Accounts for the two half-years.  Upon these accounts I have to report as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Accounts for the Half-Year to 30th June, 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Cash Balances on hand at 1st January, 1921, as per audited accounts, were £233,855 4s. 8d. The Receipts for Self-Determination Fund amounted to £25,925 10s. 10d. of which £25,236 11s. 10d., was <Col N="109" /> received from U.S.A.  There was received £86,371 1s. 6d. in respect of the Loan, of which £84,614 16s. 6d. was remitted from U.S.A. out of amounts raised there.  Interest received and accrued amounted for the half-year to £7,413 9s. 1d. Revenue earned by Departments came to £1,373 4s. 5d.  Refunds from Departments out of amounts charged in previous accounts came back: they amounted to £5,169 1s. 2d.  There is a further refund of £5,000 from the Department of Home Affairs for the N.E. Counties, which sum is shown as a Disbursement on the other side.  An item of Suspense was received amounting to £1,187 2s. 0d.  The various items of Receipt, added to the opening balances at 1st July, 1921, make a total of £366,294 13s. 8d.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Expenditure for the half-year is shown departmentally, the principal heads of expenditure under each Department being indicated. The total amount of Expenditure for the half-year was £111,269 15s. 8d.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Including accrued interest to 30th June, 1921, there was a balance of cash on hands of £255,024 18s. 0d., at the end of the half-year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accounts for the Half-Year to 31st December, 1921.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The account begins with the balance on hand at 1st July, 1921, viz., £255,024 18s. 0d. £6,285 11s. 5d. was received for the Self-Determination Fund, £5,500 being from Australia.  £168,702 4s. 2d. was received in respect of the Loan, of which £167,727 0s. 10d. was remitted from U.S.A.  £35 was received for the New Loan.  Interest received and accrued amounted to £5,608 1s. 5d.  The earnings from Departments were £5,392 12s. 8d.  Refunds were received in respect of expenditure charged in previous accounts to the extent of £951 12s. 7d., and there was a Suspense receipt of £33.  The opening balance of cash in hands at the beginning of the half-year, and the receipts for the half-year, make a total of £442,033 0s. 3d.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Total Departmental Expenditure for the half-year came to £202,831 14s. 9d., and the Trustees' Expenses to £255 7s. 4d.  There is also charged a sum of £1,341 19s. 5d. which was stolen from the offices on the 14th or 15th December.  The Expenditure in the various Departments is shown in detail in the enclosed accounts.  Included under the head of Foreign Affairs, Special Expenses, is a payment to a delegate of £200 in respect of a proposed visit to U.S.A.  As this visit was not made, I wrote to the delegate to inquire if I might include the £200 as cash unexpended and on hand at 31st December, 1921.  In reply I have to-day received a letter stating that there is a sum of £83 18s. 6d. on hands.  I have not, however, altered the accounts as regards this item.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The balance of cash in hands at 31st December, 1921, including accrued interest, amounted to £237,603 18s. 9d.  With respect to this sum I have to say that it includes an item of £1,660 7s, 5d., balance of current account with the Sinn Féin Bank, now in liquidation. I have written to the Liquidator for verification, and inquiring as to the prospects of realisation, but up to the date of this report have not heard from him.  A sum of £9,033 12s. 7d. is included as being on hands at the London office at the end of the half-year.  I have not been able to vouch this sum nor the following items of expenditure made by the London office and included in the accounts: London Office, Local Expenditure, £1,873 13s. 11d.; in respect of Peace Negotiations, £1,050 2s. 7d.; and Special Defence, £4,050 0s. 0d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before I proceed with the reading of that report I would like to explain these items.  It is simply that at the time of audit they were not vouched.  Our representative in London has been written to in regard to the vouchers, and in a very short time, I have no doubt, these vouchers will come along.  As regards the item &ldquo;Special Defence&rdquo; there is a slight mistake in putting in the amount, as this is an amount paid on behalf of prisoners. £1,000, returnable by the Self-Determination League, and the other amount, £3,050, will be returned for the new half-year's account.  Well, the auditor's report proceeds:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Part also of the Cash Balance is a Deposit Receipt for £7,000 lodged <Col N="110" /> with a Bank to secure an overdraft of a private individual.  This lodgment was authorised by the Ministry. On inquiry to-day it is found that the overdraft and the Deposit Receipt are about equal.  The Bank, however, holds further securities almost equal in value to the overdraft, so that, for the present at any rate, the contingency of a loss does not arise.  With the exceptions just referred to I have satisfied myself as to the correctness of the Cash Balance at the end of the half-year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may do no harm to make reference to the £7,000.  It was passed by the Dáil Ministry some twelve months ago.  It was reported as a special item and private members asked me for particulars of it, which I gave, and these will be available for anybody who requires them.  The auditor's report concludes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it would be well for the Members to take into account the advisability of now dispensing with Bank and other accounts opened in the names of private individuals, and of consolidating the funds of An Dáil in one account.  There appears to be no necessity now for these individual accounts, and if they were transferred into the names of official trustees, possible complications would be avoided.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am,</P>
    <P>Ladies and Gentlemen,</P>
    <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P>D. O'CONNOR.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, now, since that was written by the auditor, the Trustees and the Dáil Cabinet met; and I would like this incorporated in the Finance Report: that the Self-Determination account of Dáil Eireann be now closed, and that the amounts received in Australia be included as though they had come to hand before the date of this resolution.  Now, in the usual course, or in accordance with the practice that has prevailed, the American accounts are not given out in detail, but I can give the items, and, as on a former occasion, any member who wishes to have a copy of these figures can have it within a reasonable period. Now, the following are the American Accounts of the Dáil for the half-year ended on December 31st:</P>

    <P>And now the usual summary&mdash;I refer to the cash summary as at the 31st December last&mdash;has been made out in this way. You will see from it that the cash on hands at home was £237,603 18s. 9d. The cash on hands in the U.S.A. was $2,130,364.82 which, at the rate of exchange&mdash;4.40&mdash;amounted to £484,174 0s. 0d.  The total of those two amounts was £721,777 18s. 9d.  The following reserves had to be stipulated for: General, $500,000; Bank, $100,000; and Sundries, $250,000.  That totalled $850,000, which at the 4.40 rate of exchange came to £193,181 16s. 4d. That amount deducted from £721,777 18s. 9d. left the net balance available at £528,596 2s. 5d.  In addition to all that I have made out a summary bringing the position up to date as to the 18th February, and I can put it briefly before you in this way: The Home Balance on the 31st December, 1921, was £237,603 18s. 9d.  The Receipts since included: Cash recovered from the English, £22,250 8s. 10d.; Loan, et cetera, £582 0s. 4d.; Revenue, £1,026 11s. 1d., and Refunds, £495 2s. 6d.  Those four amounts total £24,354 2s. 9d.  That, added to the Home Balance, makes £261,958 1s. 6d.  The principal item of the receipts is the money that was stolen from us by the English and returned. The outlay for the seven weeks comes to <Col N="111" /> £51,393 10s. 2d., leaving a balance of £210,564 11s. 4d.  Now, for the United States, the cash on hands at 31st January, 1922, per the United States accounts was $2,461,589.50 dollars which, at 4.40 rate of exchange was £559,452 3s. 2d. That indicates a total of £770,016 14s. 6d., which, less reserves amounting to $850,000 or £193,181 16s. 4d., left £576,834 18s. 2d. net balance available. That was our net balance on February 18th last&mdash;the absolute net cash balance without any consideration for assets. I just want to make one or two brief remarks in regard to the assets.  I have tried to discern between what are good and bad and doubtful.  Among the assets is an item of £200 concerning the Rathmines Comhairle Ceanntair. Then, in regard to Fishery Societies, there is an amount of £19,630 which I have classified as bad or doubtful. Under the scheme of helping County Councils is an amount of £16,800.  Then there is a special deposit which is really not a loan&mdash;only a safeguarding of money; that comes to £7,700.  I do not know if I have properly classified the following item as bad or doubtful.  It is an account which the Ministry passed as expenses in connection with the Manchester trials, which is recoverable from the Irish Self-Determination League. The amount is £2,500.  Promises on loan, £7,610, are all good.  Land Bank Capital £200,000 is good.  The next thing is Kilcunny Farm, £6,575.  Then there have been returns since these accounts were made out, as follows: Peace Negotiations, £13 16s. 9d.; Foreign Affairs, £635; Advances, including sub-commission, £5,361; Roscommon County Council, £2,500.  Now, there were three amounts on hand in connection with the sub-commission accounts as follows: £240; £342 10s.; and £316 10s.  The reason I did not deduct these from the total advances is I did not know how the sub-commission and others stood at the time.  The following amounts have been refunded from the Provisional Government: Salaries, £65 18s. 7d., and over £60 of Ministerial salaries have been refunded. Now, there may be just one or two questions coming out of these.  These accounts differ from the others in only one respect.  In all others we tried to draw the dividing line between the Self-Determination Fund Account, as we called it on the basis passed in An Dáil in June 1920 Session, and the Loan Account. It has not been possible to do that, and the expenditure has become so complex I doubt in an analysis if the Self-Determination Fund would really bear the burden of the charges placed on it if I rigidly adhere to the formula passed in June 1920.  It would be possible to do it, but it would entail considerable labour, and it would not be worked down to the last pound note, either.  The sum of £23,000 received from the United States on 12th January is included as having been received here prior to the 31st December. This was done so that the accounts in the United States would agree with the accounts at home on the 31st December. There is another point.  In Rome there was a small amount of funds lying to the credit of our representative there, and the Bank that it happened to be in has closed down temporarily under an order of the Italian Government under a moratorium. The amount is £400.  That will right itself when the moratorium is removed. The point I want to draw attention to is the balance that has been paid to the County Councils.  It is £14,300.  That is a matter I did not mention.  I do not know should we proceed at once, in view of the changed circumstances, for the recovery of the money from the County Councils.  I have no doubt when the County Councils find themselves in possession of the new funds they will return what has been loaned without anybody asking it.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to one matter here before you proceed with the motion.  There is a slander being spread in America which affects me personally, but I do not mind it affecting me so much as the credit of the country, because, if we go for loans and monies come in, it is only right that there should be an assurance to those who subscribe that the monies they subscribed are being properly dea't with. I am a Trustee of Dáil Eireann, and this slander or libel is being spread, and I want the Minister of Finance definitely to say whether this could be possible.  I say it is a lie&mdash;an infamous slander&mdash;and I must deal with it.  It is this, according to the New York <i>Gaelic American:</i>&ldquo;When de Valera, on January 31st, found himself defeated, he clandestinely withdrew 20,000 dollars from the New York Banks, where it was deposited.&rdquo; Now, I did nothing of the kind.  I want the House to know that, and I want publicly to deny it.  The Minister for Finance knows it would be impossible.</P>

      <P>This one hundred thousand dollars, which is twenty-three thousand pounds, is the amount which came to hand on the 12th January, and it was drawn in America previous to the 31st December.  I have included it in our accounts up to the 31st December so that the two items should be alike. When I was over there, now, I saw in my office a cablegram something like what Mr. de Valera has read out.  It is a most infamous thing.  There has been absolutely no difference on the part of the Trustees, and every penny that has been handled since the 6th December last, has been handled in exactly the same way as before the 6th December. No one here will have any doubt about it, I think (&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo;).</P>

The money was ordered to be sent in the ordinary way, and I did not know anything about it until it arrived.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that these accounts would be published in the United States, because there has been a very vicious propaganda there to the effect that the money was squandered and spent without the authority of this House.  The answer to all this is, of course, to be seen in the statement given by Mr. Collins.  But, in justice to the men who were in America and who no longer represent the Government, I think arrangements ought to be made to have these accounts published in the United States, so that we will be clear of charges which we have always considered beneath contempt, and not worth an answer.</P>

It is a <Col N="113" /> matter of public interest.  People are likely to ask what this item represents. The item is on page seventeen and it concerns Armagh meetings, £75.  Being in his own constituency, nobody would for a moment suggest anything, so he has now an opportunity of explaining it.</P>

      <P>I would like to say with regard to these accounts, that the whole of them make a very voluminous document.  I had it placed in my hands only the moment I came in, so, in the circumstances, I could not possibly go through this document dealing with the accounts and give it the examination we all would like to give to a matter of its importance.  I know that it is not the fault of the Minister of Finance that this statement has been presented so late.  In fact, in my opinion it is early to have accounts for the period ending up to the 31st December published.  So it is not for the purpose of complaining that I rise.  I must say that the Finance Department deserves every credit for presenting us with such a voluminous statement as this at such an early date&mdash;all things being considered&mdash;concerning the duties they had on hands since Christmas, at all events.  I would only like to ask the Minister of Finance if, at a later date or at another meeting of the Dáil, he would have any objections to answering questions arising out of these accounts, after we have an opportunity of making a careful study of them.  With regard to America, we who are in this Dáil, now that we have a statement of the amount of money coming from America, should express our very deep gratitude to America for the way she has supplied us with funds.  Were it not for that assistance the recent fight would have been an impossible one.  I say that in view of the statements that have been made in regard to America and the assistance given by America.  We owe a deep debt of gratitude to the people of America for what they have done for Ireland.  The people of America talked to us in millions of dollars, and that fact brings home to us more clearly the extent of our indebtedness to America.  I would like to say again that we should express our gratitude to the people in America and also to the people who represent us in America. They certainly did magnificent work&mdash; work which redounds very much to their credit.  I would ask also that the Minister for Finance, who deserves every credit for getting out the statement of accounts so quickly, would give us the courtesy of answering questions later.</P>

I saw in the Press that the money was returned, but I do not know anything more about it.  Of course it is one thing to see in the Press that the money has been returned, and it is quite another thing getting the payment of it through the courts.  I mean the time that elapses.</P>

      <P>Every penny subscribed in America to the loan was entered in my name.  Every person in America who subscribed, whatever the <Col N="115" /> minimum sum was, has his name or her name registered, and all have got bonds so far as they have subscribed.  There has been an accurate account kept of every policy subscribed in America. We had not the same conditions there as here; therefore it was possible to have full receipts given for every penny subscribed. There is no doubt whatever about the conditions in America.  There seems to be some misunderstanding about the condition of the funds at present.  We have regarded the funds as being National Funds&mdash;funds of the Irish Republic.  The rule is that the Trustees getting these in their names, are responsible for their safe keeping, and the disbursement of them in accordance with a definite rule, the rule being that application is made by the Minister of Finance, countersigned by the President, for such sums that might be necessary in accordance with the estimates voted in Dáil Éireann.

      <P>I would like to point out that when we are here we should have a detailed estimate presented to us.  We look through the Estimates for the half-year and we find that the most general item&mdash;an item that appears under every Department, and by far the greater proportion of the proposed expenditure&mdash;is one termed &ldquo;Special Work.&rdquo;  It is very ubiquitous and very vague and very general, and I submit that before we discuss these Estimates they ought to be presented in a more detailed form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins1919" hpid="MR. M. COLLINS MR. M. COLLINS">
      <NameTxt>MR. M. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, this is the form these Estimates were always submitted in, and if the Deputy for Monaghan does not remember what &ldquo;Special Work&rdquo; means, his memory must be extremely short indeed.  Estimates have gone before the House for five successive periods in exactly this form.  I will give you an instance of what &ldquo;Special Work&rdquo; is.  Take the first Department&mdash;the Agricultural Department. If you wish to have all the details printed they can be printed, but there is no printer in Dublin who will take on the printing and promise to have all the work done in less than a fortnight. There are no less than twenty-two pages. You have, for instance, such items as Agricultural Department Inspectors, £1,000; Surveyors, £600; Inspectors' and Surveyors' Expenses, £1,500; Agricultural Inspector, £200.  Another thing I would like to draw your attention to is that in the Estimates submitted by the Department these things are further detailed, and you can get how much a week these Inspectors are getting, if you like.  The details I was just reading out go on like this: Agricultural Inspector, £200; Agricultural Expenses, £220; Registrar, £165; Local Registrars and Note-takers, £150; Commissioner's Expenses, £1,050; Temporary Legal Assessors, £300; Labour Arbitrators, £223. Total, £5,808.  That is the first item under the Department of Agriculture. Then for the development of Agriculture there is £1,000.  That comes under the heading of contingencies.  Then you have the Department of Fisheries, and under that there is &ldquo;Special Work&rdquo; set out at £169, while Sundry Expenses come to £610.  Now, we can go through each item separately like that if we so desire.  If the contrary had not been the custom all these things could have been printed.  But I can tell you these things could not have been printed for <Col N="116" /> this meeting; if you like they can be printed for the next meeting.  When they are printed no doubt we shall have some grumbling, too.</P>

Then we will be in a better position to know whether the Estimates will be acceptable to this assembly or not.  None of us has seen them, or, at least, had an opportunity of examining them, and you cannot ask us to vouch money like this in the dark&mdash;money that is going to absorb fully two-thirds of the assets of this assembly.</P>

      <P>The Departmental expenditure for the last half-year was £202,831 14s. 9d., and the sum asked for here is £203,121 0s. 0d. Is there a sufficient difference to warrant criticism of these figures?</P>

      <P>In regard to Home Affairs, reference might be made by some Deputy to the fact that the expenditure for the six months was not as high as the Estimates put forward.  If a Minister is wise he always looks forward for a bit more than he thinks he will spend.  I may say also that the receipts from that particular Department for two <Col N="117" /> months of 1922 have more than exceeded the total receipts for the six months ending 31st December, 1921.  In the Home Affairs Department there are the items: Judges' Salaries, £1,500; Expenses, £200; Organisers' Salaries, £1,092; Expenses, £400; Police Staff Salaries, £279; Police Expenses, £910; Police Officers' and Men's Salaries, £9,490; estimated increase in Salaries, £2,000. The total is £15,871.  Now, I can go through this thing item by item.  What is down for contingencies is the same as the last time.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister of Finance if he has got an application from the Honorary Secretary of the Fine Gaedheal for a loan of £5,000 to carry on the work of the Organisation.  The Dáil is acquainted with the work the organisation has to do.  Before the negotiations it was thought well that the several organisations throughout the world which were formed for the express purpose of assisting Ireland in her fight&mdash;organisations consisting of most of those of our own race&mdash;should have their activities coordinated by some central machinery, and it was decided to have a World Congress at which such machinery would be set up.  That Congress was held, and the organisation was established to assist the Irish people to attain to the full their national ideals, and to secure for Ireland her original place amongst the free nations of the earth.  It had also as its object the encouragement of the Irish language, literature, history and general culture, and to promote the trade and commerce of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I desire to put a question and in doing so I may say I am putting it not with a view to criticising the figures here, but to ask for information.  Does the Minister propose any change or improvement in the police force?  The House is aware that the providing of an efficient police force is one of the prime necessities of the moment.  In Cork, for example, we have a Brigade area which includes the city and embraces two hundred thousand souls.  There we have only one whole time police officer.  We would wish to find out if it is the intention to extend and make the force more efficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinStack" hpid="MR. A. STACK MR. A. STACK">
      <NameTxt>MR. A. STACK:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which has a lot to do with the Dáil policy.  We who claim that the Dáil is the supreme Government of the country would like to know what the policy of the Minister is with regard to the police. For instance, now, I have seen a paragraph in a paper in Roscommon to the effect that a District Inspector of Constabulary named Kearney, a man who was responsible for the arrest of Deputy Con Collins and myself, and the man who was chiefly instrumental in working up a case against Roger Casement, has received an appointment from a body known as the Provisional Government, with a view to establishing a police force. Now, if that is done under the Department of Home Affairs, if that is done with the knowledge of the Minister, and if that is supposed to be part of the policy under consideration at the moment, we are entitled to know all about it, and it is certainly a matter in connection with which I would move that the Minister be censured.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. A. STACK:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of Home Affairs has his Estimate included in this, and the question of the police forces comes under that.  I say that this body and none other has the right to set up a police force to take over charge or control of law and order in the country.  We would want to know before we pass any Estimate for the Department of Home Affairs, in respect of police anyhow, what is the policy of the Minister with regard to the police; what kind of a police force he intends to set up; and whether he intends to utilise the services of men who have proved themselves to be the enemies of this country by remaining in the police force during the war, and doing their best against the people?  I certainly must be taken as pressing for information with regard to the policy as to the police force before I assent to the passing of the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Since I was in office the passing of the Royal Irish Constabulary is supposed to have taken place, and the entire maintenance of law and order has devolved upon Dáil Eireann.  Many representations are being made in respect of the matter and preparations are being made to set up a police force.  We would like to know the nature of these preparations, and if they are to be subject to the control of the Dáil altogether, because we claim that the Government of the Dáil is the Government of the country.</P>

I protest against the President saying every question asked for the purpose of seeking information should be regarded as hectoring or as introducing obstructive tactics.  We want information. We gave this ourselves formerly, and I do not see any reason why it should not be asked now.  If you are going to pass the Estimates for Home Affairs, and the policy as to the extent to which you are going to police the country comes up, it is obvious it has a bearing on the Estimates. It is not fair that every question should be put down as hectoring.  As regards the £5,000 loan I suggested, I will give notice of the motion in connection with it.</P>

That answer is not accepted; the opposition read something else into it.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is for payment of eighty-one officers and men who are already members of the Republican Police force.  They are the only paid officers in the police force because recently it was found desirable to disband the rank and file of the force and have the police duty generally done by the Army.  The men, who originally came from the Army, and who were disbanded, went back to their units, and the Army as a whole was made responsible for the police duty.  There is no such man as Kearney in the Republican Police force, that I know of.</P>

      <P>Including Ministers. I may mention there is a rumour current that certain offices formerly used by the Dáil are now used by the committee considering the question of a new police force.  There is a number of others also.  In regard to Local Government and Home Affairs there is an inflation in the Estimate over the Estimates of last year.  There is another Estimate in regard to the Boycott, which we are told is discontinued, and you are <Col N="120" /> asked to vote £3,000 to carry on something that we are told has been discontinued. The only logical course is to have the presented Estimate tabled in detail&mdash;let the details be elsewhere if you wish&mdash;so that any member who wishes to examine the details of the different Estimates can examine them at such and such a place&mdash;Dáil Eireann offices, for instance&mdash;and we could take a vote on them to-morrow after we have an opportunity of examining them.  We are not following the precedent established in the Dáil in regard to these Estimates. It is true we used to take them very hurriedly, but we only did that under stress of war.  I have continually protested against them being taken in that fashion.  Some discussion should arise on every Estimate.  I ask any reasonable man or any Deputy in the Dáil, who knows what we were compelled to do when the Dáil could only last one day, when the enemy were around us, when we might be raided at any moment, and simply because we were then compelled to do a thing, are we now, when we have freedom to discuss the matter, going to follow that precedent?  I say it would be illogical to do it.  During the war, every head of a Department presenting Estimates or accounts explained them and had to stand over them, and it was not left to the Minister of Finance to do all that.</P>

I submit we ought, at least, if the Minister of Finance and members of the Cabinet will agree to the proposition, adjourn consideration of the Estimates until to-morrow. I do that so that I will not obstruct or hold up the business.  If we adjourn consideration of the Estimates we can proceed with the remaining items on the Orders of the Day and get through the business of to-day's Session expeditiously. To-morrow we can take up the Estimates when we are in a proper position to discuss them.  I will move that as an amendment to the motion that the Estimates be adopted.  If the Minister of Finance is not prepared to accept that he ought to return to the precedent established at the Dáil, and which is much sounder than the one he seeks to introduce to-day.

      <P>I desire to make a few remarks on the Estimates. In passing, I may mention that recently I went to the offices of the Minister of Home Affairs, and was informed that he was very seldom there.  I was informed that at the City Hall he was the Minister for Home Affairs of the Provisional Government, and I was not obliged to see him in that capacity.  When I did see him, subsequently, I referred to the police force and was informed that they didn't propose to carry on the police force and that another Department was seeing about policemen; probably the Provisional Government would provide a police force.  That is a serious question. We won't get away from it by one party saying that objections are being made for obstructive purposes. This is a genuine matter that we are all <Col N="121" /> concerned in.  An item of £900 has been mentioned.  Is it seriously put up to us that the Minister of Home Affairs is going to police the country on £900?</P>

      <P>I desire to speak in support of the amendment.  I raised this question and it may appear to be a personal matter.  I assure the members that, as far as the Ministers or officers are concerned, it is not: neither is it a personal matter with regard to myself and that lovely Inspector Kearney.  This man Kearney was, from my experience of him, one of the most vigilant servants the enemy had in this country, and he did his best&mdash;by open means and underhand&mdash;to beat us.  He claimed to have been the means of preventing the Rising in Kerry in 1916, and, I suppose, persuaded his superiors that such was the case, because to my own knowledge, he was a man who had previously failed in all his examinations for promotion to the position of District Inspector.  In consequence of what he did in 1916 he received the promotion.  He remained in the R.I.C. during the whole period of the war and, in common with others in the R.I.C., he did not resign when called upon by the country.  Instead of recognition, he deserves from the Dáil&mdash;or any other people's Government in this country&mdash;reprobation. I do not wish to say any more about the Department or the head of the police, as the amendment is confined to Kearney, and I simply rise in support of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to talk on the whole question of policing the country.  It was the custom to get reports from Ministers respecting the working of their different Departments. It would be more appropriate if we had those.  Perhaps, instead of asking for a reduction, it might be possible that we would be looking for more for this particular Department.  Will we get an assurance that Ministers will give us, as was customary, a short report of the work in their Departments?  I would prefer not to speak on this now, but would rather speak on such a report. Yet, if I am given no other opportunity, I will have to do it here.  Could I get an answer to that question?  It is probably one of the most important matters we will have to deal with.  Expolice officers who did certainly act by the nation during the war, came to us and suggested the formation of a force with national goodwill.  I expect they also saw the President.  The time has come when we should definitely establish a national police force.  The place to discuss a matter of that sort fully would be <Col N="122" /> on a report from the Minister of Home Affairs.  If we were to have such a report to-morrow I would defer saying anything on the matter now.</P>

      <P>I rise in order to bring a whirl of talk down to plain realities.  The Dáil now starts talking about establishing a police force.  Here at the last Session we asked Mr. de Valera and his colleagues to co-operate with us in forming a committee for the safety of the Irish public.  That proposal was refused.  The Dáil suggests the formation of a police force.  It would cost three or four millions a year to maintain it.  We have not that money. It is well known we could not command that sum.  Well, what has been done?  The Provisional Government is trying to organise a force which it proposes to work in harmony with the Dáil, and what you are trying to do here is to try and obstruct that, while robbery and murder are rampant in the country.  There are many of you coming here prepared to try and obstruct us.  I am speaking now to the Irish people, and to the Irish people I say we are going, as far as lies in our power, to maintain law and order. We will make a police force, and if the Provisional Government has a police force it will be subject to us.  But to start and talk of the Dáil establishing a police force without money and without powers&mdash;to have a police force for itself &mdash;is deceiving the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I must say the attitude of the President on this matter is very unsatisfactory.  He has answered only part of my question.  I want a reply from the Minister for Home Affairs in regard to the police force.  As the President has said, in the ultimate it is this body that is responsible for keeping order, and the President, surely, must be ready to give an account of the method by which he proposes to keep order.  I do not care what it is so long as order is kept, and it is in accordance with general principle that this is the supreme body.  We have a right to know what steps are being taken by the responsible authority to this body for the maintenance of order&mdash;what steps are being taken for the maintenance of a police force.  It will be a matter of opinion how such a force should be got up.  I am asking for an opportunity for discussion on that most important question. The suggestion that we simply want to obstruct is ridiculous.  We have a perfect right to get information on the Estimates on the question of maintaining order generally, and on the conduct of the Government of the country.</P>

      <P>With regard to one question asked about the Estimates and one supplementary question, I may at once say that these Estimates are prepared in precisely the same form as for the last meeting at which Estimates were taken.  It is true that on previous occasions the Estimates were less illustrated. The reason was that the Departments were then working under war conditions, because no Treaty was there to save them from war conditions. Another reason, also, was that we were anxious to get away from meetings which were held a year or a year-and-a-half ago, because there were war conditions and we did not want the Dáil raided.  These Estimates were put forward in exactly the same way.  Now, in regard to the next question, it was the duty of the Deputy for Monaghan, if he was not satisfied, to have notified us of his objection a fortnight ago.  However, the figures can be made available; two copies can be seen at the Mansion House if the members of the Dáil so desire. An attack has been made in respect of the Home Affairs Department.  I could say the same things, or some things at any rate, about some people, but perhaps the less I say the better for all concerned.</P>

      <P>Of course it is understood I am in office only a few weeks and it was considered, in view of the short time since last Session, that it was not worth while to have a report. Indeed, there is very little to report on. Besides, we are passing through a transition stage, and it takes some time to get a proper grip of the departmental affairs in the circumstances.  The British police forces are being disbanded within the next few weeks, and we are faced with an entirely new situation.  You must set up a police force, the cost of which will run into an amount which would not be possible for the resources of the Dáil. That force is being set up, not under the Dáil, but under the Provisional Government, which has the resources to do it. The whole matter can be raised on a question of which notice has been given for to-morrow.  In fact, it has been raised in a question of which I have got notice for to-morow.</P>

There is no such report here.  I was anxious to know if we would have an opportunity for debate.  There is no debate on a question.  This whole question of the maintenance of order during three months, or for a longer period, is very important.  I have no doubt the President and Ministry have a definite policy, and it is only right that we should know what that policy is.  All these things are important for us, because it is our duty to see order kept in the country. I agree this must be a non-political police force.

We have not enough money to form a police force that would run for three weeks.  But the Provisional Government can do it and has the money.

That seems very strange.  I do not know where that comes in.  No mention has been made as to what particular item has to be reduced.  We have heard question after question.  Now, I think the President ought to know what it would cost to maintain a police force of three or four thousand men in this country, and whether or not the funds of the Dáil are sufficient to bear that cost.  The essence of the opposition here is to influence and to control, as far as they can, the activities of the Provisional Government.

      <P>I have been wondering whether I would be in order in proposing an increase of £500,000 in the Estimates of the Minister of Home Affairs to allow him to develop a police force adequate to the requirements of the situation, under Dáil Eireann.  It seems to me that we have to take our bearings now.  This morning I suggested, if we were up against a definite issue, that the Provisional Government was set up by a meeting composed of the members elected to constituencies in Southern Ireland, and that it is responsible to that body and not to Dáil Eireann.  I said I, as one member of the Provisional Government, would stand by that, and in the things I do in my capacity of what certain members would call national apostate, I refuse to be responsible to this body.  That is the full, unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The position is vague, undefined and anomalous; but in so far as it is unsatisfactory and anomalous, the responsibility lies on those who put every difficulty in the way of seeking from the people of Ireland a straight declaration of whether or not they wished us to proceed on the basis of the Treaty (hear, hear).</P>

      <P>We could easily avoid this unsatisfactory kind of debate if there was a little less of what I will charitably call muddle on the opposite side.  Two questions have been raised&mdash;the report of Ministers and the case of Mr. Kearney.  If it is desired to raise at the meeting of the Dáil an important matter of policy, it surely would be the obvious course to give a notice to the Minister concerned.  In this case it is manifestly unfair to expect Ministers who have been in office something like seven weeks to prepare reports.  It would be absurd to ask them to prepare reports on their work during that period. <Col N="126" /> The right way to obtain information is to ask beforehand so that the Minister could prepare an answer.  The second thing is a vote of censure about this man Kearney, but the notion that the Minister for Home Affairs can deal with that on the minute is perfectly absurd.  The suggestion to reduce a vote upon a question sprung on the Minister like that is one that should not recommend itself to the House.  The Standing Orders give you ample means of dealing with an unsatisfactory answer.  You have all this now sprung on the House.  That is not the best way to deal with public business.  After the agreement at the Ard-Fheis it is rather unfortunate that these matters should develop into a mere party question.  That is the effect of bringing up matters without notice.  I propose the vote be now taken.</P>

Do you not consider it right and proper that an opportunity would be given in Public Session so that the people of the country would see that we are all determined to preserve law and order, in so far as we can?  The cause of unrest is because there has been no order to express what has been the unanimous opinion of this House&mdash;that law and order must be maintained.  I submit to the gentlemen on the opposite side that an opportunity should be given to us on this side to demonstrate that we, as well as they, are determined to preserve order.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to make any speech on this amendment. One thing is to ask us to co-operate under a policy with which we do not agree.  That is, the policy of the majority party in this House.  Another matter is that when they have decided their policy and got a majority in favour of a certain line of action, that we are not to get an opportunity as members to, at least, get the country to benefit by that policy.  Have we no opportunity now to say that such benefits as might accrue to the country should come from the policy of the opposite side?  I think it is ridiculous.  We will not co-operate in the sense of taking part responsibility with the majority party here for the maintenance of order, or for their policy.  But their policy has got a majority here, and it is our business as part of the whole House to see that that policy which they have got a majority for is carried out, and to criticise if it is <Col N="128" /> not carried out.  And we have a definite right to know what provision is going to be made in accordance with their policy, by the Minister for Home Affairs, for the maintenance of public order in the country.  If the majority rule&mdash;and we have accepted that, because we would not be here if we had not&mdash;we have the right still of demanding that that majority gives an account of its stewardship, not merely to the members here, but to the country as a whole.  We have a right to demand that the Minister for Home Affairs would tell us what provision has been made in accordance with the policy of the majority, for the maintenance of order.</P>
