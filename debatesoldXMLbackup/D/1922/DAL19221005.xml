      <P>To ask the President whether he is aware that an order has been issued by the O.C. the National Forces in Galway to the effect that permits to drive motor cars or obtain petrol would only be given to persons who could produce receipts for their motor tax; can he state the powers or authority under which this order was issued, or whether it is to be regarded as a military or civil regulation; also whether, in view of the fact that the earning powers of such cars as are used for hire are very considerably lessened, and that private owners can use their cars but very sparingly, owing to the state of the roads in that district, he will consider the advisability of making some concession, by way of reduced tax or otherwise, to car owners until such time as ordinary conditions of road travelling again prevail.</P>

      <P>The first part of this question should have been addressed to the Minister for Defence.  I am taking the matter up with him, but it will take two or three days to get an answer from that particular area.  As regards the second part of the question, there is no option but to continue the collection of motor taxes, as all other taxes, on the present basis, unless and until alterations of the law are made by this Dáil on any points where that course may be thought proper.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the answer given on the 28th ulto. to a somewhat similar question by Deputy Domhnall O Ceallachain.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Transport (Roads Department) have been informed by the Co. Surveyor for Cork, that at a meeting of the Cork County Council on September 6th, it was decided to ask the Local Government Department for a grant towards improving the Cork to Mallow and the Cork to Fermoy roads.  These are the roads towards which a grant may be made from the Road Fund.  The Fund is financed out of the proceeds of Motor Tax.  The collection of this now rests with the County and County Borough Councils.  Particulars are being obtained from the Cork County Council as to the progress of the collection of Motor Tax in the County, and when available the question of a grant from the Road Fund for these roads will receive further consideration.</P>

      <P>Strictly speaking, Justices of the Peace are empowered, <Col N="1207" /> under the Provisional Government, to continue the work that they are at present doing until their Commissions are withdrawn.  While that is legally the position, it is hoped that no Justice of the Peace will insist on carrying out functions against the wishes of his community, in view of the fact that withdrawal of the Commissions will take place quite soon and is at present in hands.  As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, it is not proposed that there should be any such mechanical exchange of Commissions, but pending the contemplated reconstruction of the whole judicial system under the Free State, it is not possible to make any definite pronouncement on the future of honorary magistrates.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether he is aware that an inquest fixed for Tuesday, September 26th, in connection with the death of John Lohan, of Woodquay, Galway (who had been shot by National troops for, as alleged, failing to halt when called upon to do so), fell through owing to the non-attendance of a sufficient number of jurymen; whether it was not within the power of the Coroner, seeing that these jurors summoned had not attended at the specified time, to issue fresh summonses and compel the attendance of these or other qualified jurors up to the required number; whether the Coroner was justified in the circumstances mentioned in abandoning the inquest; and whether he will state generally the powers and duty of a Coroner in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is conversant with the extent of the privation being endured by large numbers of the working class population of Mallow and district as a consequence of a succession of trouble, viz.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The destruction of Cleeve's Factory, the Town Hall, and ten of the principal business houses by the Black and Tans on September 30th, 1920, followed by</P>
      <P>2.  The suppression of fairs and markets and the shutting down of motor garages,</P>
      <P>3.  The decline of tillage in the locality,</P>
      <P>4.  The dismissal of artizans and labourers hitherto employed about the military barracks but dismissed on transference to the Irish Government,</P>
      <P>5.  The recent destruction of the railway bridges, including the Blackwater Viaduct, and consequent stoppage of railway traffic?</P>
      <P>Further, how many persons are registered as unemployed in Mallow, and how many others not registered are unemployed in Mallow, and whether those workers who lost their employment in consequence of the destruction of Cleeve's Factory have been deprived of unemployment benefit and are now practically starving?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the fact that considerable unemployment exists in Mallow and district, largely due to events such as those mentioned in the question.  But all persons normally employed in the insured trades, who satisfy the conditions, are in receipt of unemployment benefit.  On 2nd October, the latest date for which figures are available, 317 persons were registered for employment at Mallow.  No statistics are available as to the number of unemployed persons who have not registered. The disqualification for unemployment benefit of any of Messrs. Cleeves' workers is due to their having lost their employment in circumstances which do not entitle them to benefit.</P>

      <P>I have a note here to the effect that, after being burned by the Black and Tans, Cleeves' Creamery was rebuilt by the firm, and the workers did not therefore lose employment by the burning, but because of subsequent strikes and the seizure of the factory. The Department has held that the loss of employment was due to a trade dispute, and consequently disallowed benefit.</P>

      <P>Article 46 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses may be suspended for a period of ninety days on the written demand of two-fifths of the Members of the Chamber/Dáil Eireann, or of a majority of the Members of the Senate/ Seanad Eireann, presented to the President of the Executive Council not later than seven days from the day on which such Bill shall have been so passed or deemed to have been so passed.  Such a Bill shall be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people if demanded before the expiration of the ninety days either by a resolution of the Senate/ Seanad Eireann, assented to by three-fifths of the members of the Senate/ Seanad Eireann, or by a petition signed by not less than one-twentieth of the voters then on the register of voters, and the decision of the people on such referendum shall be conclusive.  These provisions shall not apply to Money Bills or to such Bills as shall be declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.&rdquo;  This particular Article gives to a three-fifth proportion of the Seanad the power of applying for a referendum on any measure.  The referendum is a feature of the Constitutions of Australia, America and Switzerland. It is, we consider, particularly suited to <Col N="1211" /> this country, in the circumstances of the time.  It will impress on the people more forcibly perhaps than would otherwise be the case that henceforth the law of this country is their law, is the creature of their will, is something which they can make, alter, or repeal, as it seems best to them.  That personal actual contact between the people and the laws by which they are governed is advisable in a country which is passing out of a condition of bondage and a country where the traditional attitude of the people is to be against the law and against the Government.  The referendum, we consider, will be a stimulus to political thought and the political education of the people.  It will compel the people to think of the necessity for certain laws, and to think of the effects of certain laws, and all that political thought will have a steadying effect upon the country.  It is argued for the referendum, also, that it is some check on corruption, that if you, by any chance or by any mischance, had a corrupt legislature that at least it would need a man with a very long purse to corrupt all the people or a sufficient number of the people to carry a measure by referendum.  There is a proposal &ldquo;to insert in line 13 after the word &lsquo;people&rsquo; the words &lsquo;by a majority of the votes recorded.&rsquo;  (Tomas Mac Eoin).&rdquo;  It might save time if I said that that was a proposal we are prepared to accept.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether we ought to take it as evidence of the conservative nature of opinion in the Dáil or the radical nature of opinion in the Dáil that nobody is anxious to discuss this very big principle. I think the Minister in introducing it has perhaps wisely slurred over the implications of the referendum, and I think it well, right now to say that, in my opinion, this clause is definitely intended to be, and will in effect be, a conservative influence.  While I am saying that I am not going to oppose it. I think it would be a dangerous thing if not an unwise thing to say that we are going to refuse to accept the principle that the people in the mass will have a right to put their veto on an Act that the Parliament thinks wise to pass, but it should be made clear, in the discussion of this clause, that it is intended <Col N="1212" /> to be a brake upon the activities of reformist, radical, socialistic, or bolshevistic Parliaments.  If there is any risk of that with the majority of agriculturists among the electorate this clause at least will prevent it, and I only rise to say that we recognise that it has a conservative influence, and that despite that fact I am not going to oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I am not rising to speak on the question of the referendum itself, which is a matter which I have always strongly agreed to, believing that whether they be radical or whether they be conservative, the people have a right to have their will expressed, to have their will known.  But it is because I am in such entire agreement with the proposals for a referendum, and their adoption in the Constitution, and the creation thus of rule by the people that I had down an amendment which was wrongly placed in yesterday's Orders of the Day.  You will remember that you drew attention that it was put down for Article 44 when it should have been down for Article 46.  It was:&mdash;&ldquo;To substitute in the second sentence instead of the words &lsquo;on the petition signed by not less than 100,000 voters on the Register,&rsquo; the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;On the petition of not lees than 30,000 voters on the Register.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My reason for that is very brief, and need not take up any time.  It is that if the referendum is intended to be adopted it may as well be in the form in which it can be put to use and not embodied in a form in which it is extremely unlikely it can ever be used.  The mechanical difficulty of getting rather more than one hundred thousand actual signatures before the referendum can be put into effect is a mechanical difficulty which will impose itself between the Constitution and its practical effect in operation.  It will be quite sufficient to get the actual signatures of 30,000 voters without asking for 100,000.  I think the 100,000 would practically make this Article in the Constitution remain in the Constitution and never come into effect, whereas 30,000 voters will be quite difficult enough to get.  If anyone contemplates the difficulty of getting 30,000, he will see it is no easy task, without making it more difficult than it is.</P>

      <P>In moving the adoption of this Article, I may say it will still further associate the people with the forging of the laws of the country, and it puts the power in the hands of the people of even initiating legislation.  If a large section of the people feel that a certain law is desirable; and if Parliament fails to introduce the desired legislation, power is given here to the people to initiate legislation themselves.  It is the direct complement of the Referendum, and pretty much what can be claimed for the Referendum can be claimed for the Initiative&mdash;that it keeps contact between the people and their laws, and keeps responsibility and consciousness in the minds of the people that they are the real and ultimate rulers of the country. <Col N="1214" /> The text of the Article as it stands is permissive; it is not mandatory.  It is permissive of Parliament to institute the initiative, but it is mandatory if Parliament, having failed to introduce it, is so requested by a petition within two years. I think it is better not to speak of the amendments that are on the paper until they are moved.</P>

      <P>I beg to move to leave out the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; (the Parliament/Oireachtas may provide for the initiation), and to insert instead thereof the words &ldquo;shall within two years,&rdquo; and to leave out the words &ldquo;should the Parliament/Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years it shall, on the petition of not less than one hundred thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than twenty thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision, in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.&rdquo;  I think we are entitled to a <i>quid pro quo</i> for our not opposing the Referendum in asking you to make the Initiative mandatory. One runs parallel with the other, and one is the complement of the other.  If Parliament does certain things and passes certain legislation, and a minority of that Parliament may hold up that legislation by calling for a Referendum, the complement of that is that people who may be desirous of certain legislation, and Parliament is dilatory in passing it, would be able to initiate such legislation.  And it seems to me there ought to be no question that if the Referendum is to be part of the Constitution, the Initiative is equally necessary, especially if we are attempting to associate the people generally with legislative projects.  We say in the clause as drafted that Parliament may provide for the Initiative, and, if it fails, then there must be a petition of 100,000 voters to insist that Parliament shall provide.  That surely is not a reasonable proposition. The effect of it, as Deputy Figgis has pointed out, is that the Initiative is not going to become part of the Constitutional machinery, and while the clause here is fairly full, the provision in the first part of the clause practically shows we are wasting our time in discussing it. My proposition is that we shall lay down as part of this Constitution that, having passed a Referendum clause we ought <Col N="1215" /> certainly to make provision for the initiation of legislation by the people, and that it should be mandatory upon succeeding Parliaments to make proposals for initiation machinery.</P>

      <P>There are difficulties about making anything mandatory within a limited period.  We cannot tell what the Parliamentary history of the next two years may be. It may be impossible for it to undertake the passing of a law establishing an Initiative. It may be that after an election we would have no stable majority.  We might have the most extreme difficulty in coming to an agreement in regard to the provisions for an Initiative; that is the detailed provisions.  It seems to me that it would not be desirable to make it mandatory on the Parliament with a time limit.  On the other hand, it is mandatory as it stands whenever a petition shall be presented signed by 100,000 voters on the Register.  It may frequently be a matter of some difficulty, and it is desirable it should be a matter of some difficulty, to get within a limited time 100,000 voters to sign a demand for a Referendum; but if there is any body of opinion, or if there is any political party interested in getting provisions for an Initiative, then, working without any time limit, there should be no real difficulty in getting 100,000 signatures to a petition asking that legislation should be passed providing for an Initiative. Even if there were nothing like 100,000 people in the country who really wanted the Initiative&mdash;and there are likely to be many more than that&mdash;the active political party which was interested in it could get the signatures of as many voters as that by a canvass. It is an entirely different case from the case of the Referendum where whoever was getting up the petition would be working under a time limit.  I think that is a sufficient answer to Deputy Johnson's argument.  It does not make it mandatory on the Parliament to do, within limited time, a thing it might not easily find itself able to do, and it does not prevent action being taken which will lead to the legislation being provided at a later stage.  I do not think in any of these matters which are left to the people that we should make it too easy for a very small body to involve the country in the expense which anything of this nature will bring about. <Col N="1216" /> Every Initiative will mean an enormous expense.  It may be that within two years, when the country has had experience of Referendums, there may not be any very great desire for an Initiative. On the other hand, if there is sufficient desire, it would be very easy to get it.</P>

      <P>May I say that the time limit seems to be the difficulty with the Minister for Local Government; but if immediately any particular party began to get signatories to a petition, provided they succeeded, it would be mandatory upon the next Parliament, and they would then have to find the time.  So that the argument as regards the time limit would not be very effective in demolishing the case. If it would meet the Minister's point, I am prepared to eliminate the words &ldquo;two years,&rdquo; and say &ldquo;within the next Parliament,&rdquo; and I have no doubt the process of political education of the community will go on by virtue of petitions and the like; but I prefer that we should be devoting our time to other matters than persuading people to sign petitions at the initiation of this Constitution.  It would probably save a good deal of time and expense and energy if this proposal were accepted now.</P>

      <P>I think there is a definite difficulty about any time limit, because if you fail to get agreement on the details, it may easily happen that the next Parliament's life might be very short.  It might, owing to divisions and that sort of thing, not be actually possible to get it passed.  This Dáil, at any rate, will become the first Dáil of the Free State.  It does not follow that the next Dáil will have four years.  There are very likely to be considerable political changes after the election; new parties will arise; parties will go to pieces, and there would be a difficulty or a danger that any time limit might be really over-run.</P>

      <P>Surely there is considerable objection to putting compulsory legislation upon Parliament.  If the people want this thing they can get it quite easily themselves by demanding <Col N="1217" /> it in sufficient numbers, and the numbers are not very great considering the number of electors under the present wide franchise.  On the other hand, if the people do not want this thing, and you put a compulsory provision in the Constitution, with or without a time limit, Parliament must provide it even against the will of the people, and it will be extremely difficult, as was pointed out on many occasions before, to get an alteration in the Constitution.  This is permissible if the feeling of the country is in favour, probably even without a petition at all; or, even if the Dáil is in favour of it, the Government will probably feel themselves compelled to yield to that public opinion and to provide it. On the other hand, if the feeling of the country is not in favour, it is difficult to see any good reason for forcing the Government to give them what they do not want.</P>

      <P>I notice the difference in the attitude of Deputy Johnson between the Referendum and the Initiative.  I observed the great skill with which he has been endeavouring to pull the leg of the Ministry, if I may be permitted to say so.  When it came to the Referendum, which is intended to act as a brake upon hasty legislation&mdash;I moved that the large numbers should be eliminated, and that, instead of having 100,000, there should be 30,000&mdash;he opposed that; and I noticed the Farmers' Party, who would have participated in the brake, also opposed it.  Now, when it comes to the Initiative, which is intended, if I may so put it, to ginger up the Legislature and get advanced legislation&mdash;a thing which might not be entirely to the will of the entire nation, but might be to very well organised opinion&mdash;in this matter he suddenly becomes a convert to the numbers being brought down.  I agree with him.  I think the numbers ought to be brought down on the Initiative, and I will support him in that.  I think the numbers ought to be brought down on the Referendum, too.  What is fair one way is fair the other, and if he succeeds in managing to bring this off I shall say &ldquo;Bravo&rdquo; to him.</P>

      <P>What we feel is that to make this thing mandatory is assuming too much.  It is assuming a great demand for it on the part of the country to make it mandatory, the time limit is assuming that, and it is placing definite responsibility on Parliament to provide for this.  It remains to be seen whether that demand will take shape and crystallise in the country, and we do not think that it is too much to ask, as evidence of that, one hundred thousand signatories to a petition.  To make it mandatory without a time limit is simply absurd.  Parliament shall provide for so and so, when it suits it, when it thinks fit.  If there be any approach it would more likely be on the lines of a smaller figure perhaps, than a hundred thousand.</P>

And in line 12 to make the number requisite for the initiation of a petition 25,000 instead of 50,000.  This is a matter of proportion as to what number we consider practicable in the matter of initiating legislation, and everybody who has had anything to do with the organisation of public opinion knows how difficult it would be to raise so large a number of petitioners as 50,000, and I submit that the numbers are too high in the present form, and could well be divided by 2 to make it practicable.</P>

      <P>It is, I suppose, unnecessary to state that, with the exception of the Articles which I mentioned in my letter to Deputy Johnson, these things are free to the Dáil to consider.  The other matters are matters on which the Government takes a certain stand, and would not be prepared to remain in in the event of a defeat on them.  But matters of this kind are very much for the individual judgment of Deputies.  Our own feeling on this is that the only figure we would change or consider changing would be that figure in the second sentence, which states the number of voters on the register who shall make the petition for Parliament to provide for the Initiative.  That number is down at 100,000 here, and we certainly will consider altering and lessening that number.  But, in view of the great expense to the State that each Initiative will involve, we do not consider it unreasonable to ask for these other figures further down in the Article.</P>

      <P>I should point out, while it is undoubtedly true that, if an Initiative is called for, it will involve considerable expenditure by the State.  But the very fact that it would cause a great deal of expenditure on the part of individuals, or groups, or parties, would prevent the too frequent use of this privilege.  And, as a matter of fact, in the one country which has been so often quoted in favour of the Initiative, its experience since that reform was introduced is that it has not been used with undue frequency.  It has been used with great moderation, and they found sufficient difficulties to preclude people from inciting the Government to spend money unnecessarily.  There is preliminary expenditure called for by organisations responsible for the movement, and that in itself is a check, and it is ths experience that, I think, is borne out in other countries, that the Initiative is not used with undue frequency, and therefore expense is not a matter of very great moment, especially if one is prepared to consider the real educational value, in a political sense, of the agitation for an Initiative. That, I submit, in itself is very well worth, from the political point of view, all the expenditure even by such a practice as that.  Others may organise a petition and then fail to get sufficient support, but the education has gone on, and the preliminary expenditure has been undertaken by the various parties on the score of expense.  I do not think it is a matter that the Government should lay too much stress upon.</P>

      <P>With reference to this clause it is an agreed Article of the Constitution, and we would advise very strongly against any attempt to change it.  We think as it stands it is an implied safeguard of the position of the new State with regard to war&mdash;that we shall not be committed to actual participation in war without the consent of Parliament. We choose Parliament there in that Article because war is almost invariably a matter of sudden emergency. You have not six or eight months or years' notice of war, but some incident occurs, some tension or strain for a short time, and the war clouds burst.  Therefore, the assent of Parliament rather than referendum of the people was chosen by the Government for insertion in that Article.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Home Affairs has already brought attention to the amendment. The proposal is the alternative proposal to which he referred, and that is that the actual decision for war should be actually with the people, except in the case of invasion.  Warfare of a certain kind has occurred in Ireland to-day, but it is not war within the meaning of the Article.  In my judgment and I put it to this Dáil, this Nation would require not to be committed to actual participation in <Col N="1223" /> any war which is not a war of invasion, and which, therefore, is a war conducted in some other territory than Ireland, and for some other purpose than a purpose in which Ireland should be primarily and directly interested.  The direct voice of the people, yea or nay, should be given in the matter.  It is the people's children who will be lost in that war; it is the people who will have to bear the privations of the war, and it is the people will ultimately have to pay the cost of that war.  Therefore the decision in that case should be given by the people themselves. Let them decide whether this war outside Ireland is a war in which they desire or do not desire to participate.  The decision should be the crowning decision and the ultimate and final decision.  In moving that proposal, and bringing it before the attention of the Dáil in order that it may make a final decision, I believe that if the Dáil were to vote in accordance with the amendment in this matter, it would make its decision in accordance with what the people would desire to see done.  I do not believe that any Deputy here, if he voted in accordance with what his own people would like to see done, would vote against this amendment, because it means that the people of his constituency and the people of all the constituencies in Ireland would have the direct voice as to whether Ireland should or should not be involved in war.  Finally, if this amendment be carried&mdash;I ask the Deputies to give this special attention, because they will see exactly what is involved&mdash;if this amendment be carried, then the Article would be able to remain, numbered as it is, in this Section 2, Sub-section <i>(e).</i>  If the amendment is lost, it will have to be removed to some other place, because you cannot put in a provision giving the decision to the Legislature in a section dealing exclusively with Referendum and Initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, the gist of Deputy Figgis' amendment and the statement he made supporting it is to say that until the enemy actually lands on your shore you must not make war or presumably warlike preparations.  We consider that there is no matter on which the Government and Parliament are more likely to keep at one with their people than on this <Col N="1224" /> matter of peace and war.  And to suggest that when you are menaced or when you are gravely wronged that you should solemnly set about and take a Referendum of your people, a Referendum which may last some months and with the enemy looking on, and, so to speak, counting the votes and going ahead with his particular preparations, is to suggest something which when reduced to actual realities, brought face to face with facts, will not stand the strain, and if it is accepted what will happen is that some future Government to save the State must walk through this Constitution, and would be bound in its duty as a Government to do so.  Now, there is no use in inserting Articles in this Constitution which in face of facts as we know them, in the face of all probabilities in the future, will not work.  No country, no Parliament, is likely to declare war other than a war of defence unless it feels that it has very strongly behind it the support of the people.  But you may limit yourself, or you may wish to limit yourself, to these defensive wars, and so, save in the case of actual invasion, there shall be no war at all, for instance.  That is something which we may discuss here, but the effect of that would be that it would leave you absolutely at the mercy of a foreign power in the event of an outbreak.  You would not be even in the perfect position of home defence.  It would put it outside your power, and outside the merits of any world issue, or any international issue.  The Parliament that will declare war against the wishes of its people will not last two months having done so.</P>

You are not now contemplating the case of a transitional or Provisional Government compelled to take certain action believed to be in the best interests of the State; to prevent steps being taken which would mean no Parliament being held in Ireland at all. But you are considering the case of a future Parliament sitting here, and by Deputy Figgis's amendment you are putting it outside the power of that Parliament to decide the issue of peace or war.  You are saying you must go out through the country and set up elaborate machinery and take the opinion of the man in the street, of the man in the shop, of the man in the field, of the man in the workshop on this issue. Well, if you can have that adopted in all countries it might be a very good thing, but if you adopt it here and if it is not adopted in other countries then you are bringing about a state of affairs where you have the dogs tied and the stones loose and you will regret it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment on this subject is met by the amendment of Deputy Figgis.  Therefore there is no need for me to move my amendment. But I think we have to bear in mind in considering this proposal the possibilities of the future, as well as the probabilities of the future.  The war that is contemplated is not a war of defence against invasion.  That is covered already by the Article as it stands.  The war that is to be guarded against is a war overseas, is a war that this country may be drawn into by Parliament, by the will of Parliament perhaps, at the instigation of perhaps Canada, or perhaps Australia, or perhaps South Africa, or perhaps Great Britain, and the last is very much the more likely.  This Parliament will probably change its character.  We need not have very long memories to know how the elected of the people a very few years ago enthusiastically backed a war overseas.  That might easily happen again, very easily happen again.  If the &ldquo;Daily Mail,&rdquo; for instance, changed its tune and increased its circulation in Ireland, or if the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; got hold of the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; and conducted a war campaign throughout Ireland in favour of some small nationality across the sea, it <Col N="1226" /> is not at all an improbable thing that this country might be drawn into it.  It is not at all an improbable thing that a Parliament led by a Government which was closely associated with Imperialistic interests, capitalistic interests, oil interests&mdash;if this country prospers&mdash;may be drawn into war by the will of the Parliament against the will of the people.  There is no question of calling for a Referendum in a case of invasion. But whether we like it or not, entering into an association of Nations, some of which are very Imperialistic, very Imperialistic indeed&mdash;take New Zealand, for instance&mdash;this may happen, and it is a grave possibility, a very likely thing indeed, that in case of a war which might be defended on pretexts meant to incite the enthusiasm of Parliament, the people who would be called upon to pay the piper, both in blood and treasure, would be opposed to it.  I think we ought at this stage safeguard the country from being manoeuvred into a war by possibly a reactionary Government and possibly a reactionary Parliament in the future, swept off its feet by newspaper propaganda. You may say the people are more likely to be swept off their feet than Parliament.  I admit it; but at least it is an additional safeguard.  If Parliament does not want to enter into a war, then there would be no need for this Referendum.  But if Parliament is enthusiastic for war, and the people are against it, then the people should be the deciding factor.  On the question of the machinery, I think the Ministers must bear in mind that, having provided for a Referendum, and having provided for the Initiative or possibilities of the Initiative, there will necessarily be machinery provided for taking those votes rapidly, and to speak of this hanging over the country for months is simply playing with the question.  You will have to provide machinery for taking a Referendum perhaps within a fortnight, perhaps even within a week, and it will always have to be ready for action, so we should not let our minds be swayed by a thing like this &mdash;by arguments of the impracticability of taking a Referendum in the case of war. The war will not be imminent.  The thing will not be imminent unless Parliament and the Government are anxious for war, and we are to guard the country against the possibility that Parliament <Col N="1227" /> might be swayed by overseas capitalistic interests, or, on the plea of humanitarian impulse, be driven into a war overseas against the will of the people and at the price of the people's treasures and the people's blood.</P>

      <P>I think this is a case essentially for looking at the two sides.  It is admitted there should be a check on the desire, which a Government or an Executive might have for involving a country in a war and that check, I think, is quite sufficiently provided for by making the assent of Parliament necessary.  If we were to go further, I think, we would be going too far, because while it is desirable to avoid war, I think there was truth in a couplet I once saw somewhere:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I will answer that by saying that it is specifically excluded, for the Article reads: &ldquo;save in the case of actual invasion the Free State shall not be permitted to participate in any war without the assent of a majority of the voters on the Register obtained on a Referendum.&rdquo; That does not preclude in any way warlike preparations.  When the Minister used these words, &ldquo;presumable warlike preparations,&rdquo; I think, with great respect for the Minister's intelligence, I will not elaborate the point, but simply say it was not worthy.  There is nothing whatever to preclude all the warlike preparations required or that may be required at any moment to defend&mdash;or &ldquo;shall not be permitted to act or participate in any warlike preparations.&rdquo;  With regard to the further argument, that it would take months to obtain a Referendum, I may say that the practice in countries where the Referendum is employed, that from the decision to hold the Referendum until the obtaining of the final result, <Col N="1228" /> in most countries, is not more than 7 days.  He also said that no Parliament is likely to conduct war unless it has the support of the people.  That has been stated a thousand times from different platforms in this country, and the people of this country believed it when the representatives of the people in 1914 did commit this nation to war, which the nation did not at that time desire.</P>

Within three months he committed the nation to that war.  It is always happening.  I stand on the principle that the only people entitled to commit a nation to war are the people who will have to pay and who will have to send their sons to it.  I move the amendment with all the greater emphasis because I believe if this amendment were put to the people of this country there would be an overwhelming majority in its favour.</P>

      <P>One thing that strikes me on the question of a Referendum in connection with the outbreak of war is that Switzerland in the great European War succeeded in keeping clear all the time.  It is the only country that, I take it, according to its Constitution, would have to have the matter decided by the people. I think that is a very strong argument in favour of a Referendum to the people directly, when Switzerland was able to keep free, although situated in the centre of, and surrounded by neighbours who were engaged in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases, I think, in which it might not be possible or easy to get this Referendum into operation within a given period.  I have a recollection of the late war, just before the outbreak of hostilities, on the part of one of the high contracting parties, as they call themselves.  I think when Russia commenced to mobilise the Germans informed them that if they did not cease mobilising they would invade <Col N="1229" /> Russia within twenty-four hours.  If Germany did not take the initiative on that occasion, I think Germany would have lost.  If Germany had waited for a Referendum her position would have been deplorable in a very short time. Warlike preparations such as have been indicated by Deputy Figgis would in essence be a declaration of war.  Other nations are not going to look on when your preparations are being conducted, without seeing the real intention that is behind the nation, or arming and so making such preparations. When Deputies speak of the people having to be consulted they apparently forget that the Parliament in this case is in very close association with the people, understands the need of the situation, and are in a position to feel exactly the pulse of the people in a matter of that sort, and it is unlikely that a Parliament constituted as this one is, devised under a Constitution so democratically fashioned, would for a moment embark on a war which would not have the support of the people behind it.  There appears to be a certain democratic sanction for asking the consent of the people in those cases; there appears to be a great case for getting every nation to accept the same principle with regard to it.  But you would hazard, to a very great extent, the integrity of this nation if you were to impose on those responsible to the people, on those authorised by the people to govern, selected by the people at elections, obligations which other nations do not accept.  For that reason I think until there is a more general acceptance by other people who are likely to engage in a war of the principle of consulting the people that you ought not to take any risks with regard to the defences of the nation.  It is most unlikely that this country, placed as it is, would be rushed into a war by this Parliament.  But it would be very unwise, having regard to the isolated position of the nation, that other nations would have the idea that Ireland could not be in a position to maintain itself in a war for at least a week after other nations had begun warlike operations. For that reason&mdash;for the common security for which Parliament is responsible &mdash;no risk should be taken in a matter of this sort merely to establish the principle which, although others may recognise, they do not give loyal support to.</P>

      <P>A good many of the points made by the President are made by the Prime Ministers and by the statesmen of every other so-called democratic country.  There is not, I think, any head of any State but will claim that the Parliament of that State and the Executive of that State are in the closest possible touch with the people who will have to pay for the war. It is true of England, America, Germany, Russia, France, and of every State.  No matter how democratic or undemocratic the Government and the Executive, if the Government is in favour of war they always take that point of view.  We have had our own experience here in Ireland, and it has been the universal experience, that representatives may be elected on particular specific issues to the National Legislature&mdash; their mandate may not be exhausted or it may be nearly exhausted, when an issue arises of this nature.  I do not think there is anybody who is supporting either of these two amendments who would want this thing to apply in case of invasion or to apply to the preparations to defeat invasions.  The case of Germany and Russia is not a case in point, because the German Executive saw the mobilisation of the Russians against Germany, but instead of bursting abroad into Russia, the Germans, of course, did a burst in on the other side of the Continent altogether.  If the Ministry has any objection to this amendment their objection must be that they foresee wars abroad, because there is nobody in the Dáil proposing that this should be done, in case of invasion or potential invasion, nobody at all.  Both Deputy Johnson's amendment and Deputy Darrell Figgis's amendment leave the first part of the Article to stand, save in case of actual invasion, and we are not so stupid as to interpret that as meaning a landing at Cobh or somewhere else, of a body of troops.  But there is a possibility&mdash;it might be slight &mdash;that there is a valid objection to the preparation for war in this thing or to the amendment.  Whoever is objecting to it has a conception of a war abroad. I mistake the Irish people if the body of the Irish people at any time now or in the future are going to shed a single drop of Irish blood in any war abroad. Remember that our relations and the <Col N="1231" /> relations of this Executive and of this Dáil to Great Britain, in two or three years, may not be the gingerly sensitive relations that they are at the moment.  Remember that it is a possibility that one of the States of the Commonwealth, most likely that of Great Britain, may be able to make up to the Executive the position they made up to a good many people abroad, that a war abroad would be for the interests of the whole Commonwealth and therefore it would be a war in the interest and in the defence of this component part of the British Commonwealth. But Deputy Figgis is quite right that there is not any question at all on which, if the people were asked at this moment, or in my opinion for several years to come, to say Aye or No.  think the overwhelming majority of the people, no matter what respect they have for the Executive&mdash;not even if Moses himself were leading the Executive&mdash;would not willingly vote Aye for a war that would involve the life and blood and treasure of the Irish people. Take even the present position of the Turks, the near Eastern position, it is quite a possibility, though it might seem a big flight of the imagination, that Great Britain would call upon the Governments of all the Dominions as she has done in the case of some to join in a war against Kemal Pasha.  Does any man in this Dáil think that there is a single Irish citizen who would want to send a single young Irishman out to fight the war of the oil owners against Kemal Pasha or anybody else?  Not a man in the Dáil would say that such would be done.  Anybody who knows anything about the issues that lead to these big international wars knows that there are people working behind the scenes who can get a combination of States, in the interests of certain classes in these States, who upon this issue are not willing to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Everybody on this side of the Dáil, at all events, will oppose, tooth and nail, any Executive, at any time, that will want to keep back from the people this direct reference of the question of war, save in the case of invasion or preparations for invasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am strongly opposed to the amendment of Deputy Figgis, because I think the proposal of such an amendment is casting a great slur upon any future Parliament to be elected by the Irish people upon adult suffrage.  I maintain there is a far greater danger of swaying a mob in favour of war than there is in the case of a deliberative Assembly.  That happened in the case of Italy, where the Italian people were drawn into war by the action of the mob in Italy.  It is easy to incite a mob, and it is mobs that move Parliaments and not Parliaments that move mobs.  I take it that, in future, an Irish Parliament elected here in Ireland will not be tempted in the slightest degree by English interests, because we do not want English dictation in this country. There is not the slightest danger of dragging this country into any war abroad or into any war outside Ireland by leaving the Irish Parliament, which is elected on adult suffrage, to judge the issue for itself; and I think this amendment, proposed here, weakens our case, and makes the participation of Ireland in any war abroad a bigger danger.  I do not think there is the slightest danger, but by the adoption of this amendment you add to the danger, instead of leaving to the free choice of the Irish Parliament, elected by the Irish people themselves. Those Parliaments will not get stale, because they will be in constant touch with the Irish people, and there <Col N="1233" /> is not the slightest danger of an Irish Parliament being dragged into a war in opposition to the will of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I want to remind the Dáil of a case in point in recent history showing how easy it is for war fever to rage in high places while the infection does not catch the people.  It is a case of conscription, not a case of the declaration of war, but I think it is very analogous.  You remember that during the great war the Prime Minister of Australia, who is a very popular man, wanted to have conscription.  If my memory serves me, he had not only his Executive warmly with him, but he had Parliament as well.  The matter had to be submitted to a Referendum and the Referendum decisively rejected conscription.  A great deal of propaganda was done in the ensuing year in favour of war and there was another Referendum on the same question.  In spite of the advocacy of the big men in the country, the voice of the common people decisively rejected conscription.  The two cases you may say are not the same, but I think the principle is the same. The people would have been committed to conscription except for the fact that the Executive had to apply for their sanction by Referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing that has been said in the course of this Debate has altered our attitude upon this particular Article.  We feel that the assent of Parliament, by which is meant both Houses, is a sufficient safeguard, and we believe and hope that the collective judgment of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann in the future will be sufficient to pronounce rightly upon any issue of peace or war that may arise.  There was mention here of the war of 1914.  We all know that the late John Redmond and his immediate followers were not in that relation to the Irish people that they would have been if there was a Parliament at the time functioning here in Ireland. They were, and had been for a considerable time, divorced from the people.  Not a single one of them was in close contact with his constituents, and not a single <Col N="1234" /> one of them stood in the peculiarly intimate relation to their constituents and people as a whole that they would have been in if there had been a Parliament in the country responsible to the people. There was mention, too, of the President of America.  The President of America has very considerable powers, little short of the power of declaring war upon his own.  He can certainly bring things to a point when war is inevitable, and he can then make a present of the situation to those that have very little choice of the decision they will take.  One Deputy spoke of Switzerland and of the Referendum there, and of how Switzerland, almost in a miraculous manner, preserved her neutrality during the late European War.  And he hinted, if he did not state, that that was all due to the Referendum.  But the fact is that Switzerland, which has a Referendum upon many other questions, has no Referendum on this particular issue, and I think it is because it is appreciated there that situations may arise, and are more likely to arise, on matters of peace and war than, perhaps, on other matters, where Parliament must act immediately upon its own judgment.  I think it was a British naval man&mdash;the late Lord Fisher&mdash;that said: &ldquo;In time of war you must hit first, hit hard, and hit anywhere.&rdquo; That hitting may be necessary in the future in Ireland to safeguard this State, and we should not tie the hands of the Parliament.  We must not put the Irish Parliament of the future in a position where the enemy&mdash;or even a potential enemy&mdash;could be using its home waters and harbours because the votes were not yet counted, and give them another two or three days because we have still to count the votes of the Referendum.</P>

      <P>The Swiss analogy fails, because by international agreement Switzerland cannot send any of its soldiers abroad; further, the other quotation from the late Lord Fisher is, perhaps, very appropriate.  The arguments adduced are exactly the kind of arguments that &ldquo;Jackie&rdquo; Fisher would have used.</P>

      <P>I formally move Article 49, which reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Amendments of this Constitution within the terms of the scheduled Treaty may be made by the Parliament/ Oireachtas, but every such amendment must be submitted to a Referendum of the people, and shall not be passed unless a majority of the voters on the Register record their votes, and either a majority of the voters on the Register or two-thirds of the votes recorded are in favour of the amendment.&rdquo;  That is the Article as it stands.  I have to announce, and it may meet the mentality behind some of the amendments, that we are prepared to alter that Article to read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Amendments of this Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty may be made by the Parliament, but every such amendment passed by the Parliament after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution must be submitted to a Referendum of the people, and shall not be passed unless a majority of the voters on the Register record their votes, and either a majority of the voters on the Register or two-thirds of the votes recorded are in favour of the amendment,&rdquo; and to add: &ldquo;Any such amendment <Col N="1237" /> may be made within the said period of five years by way of ordinary legislation, and as such shall be subject to provisions of Article 46 hereof.&rdquo;  That amendment will enable the Parliament for five years to amend this Constitution by way of ordinary legislation.  It is realised that in all the circumstances of the time, this Constitution is going through with what would, if the circumstances were otherwise, be considered undue haste.  It is realised that only when the Constitution is actually at work will the latent defects that may be contained in it show themselves, and it would be awkward to have to effect changes in the Constitution&mdash;changes about which there might be unanimity in the Dáil and in the Senate&mdash;if it were necessary to go to a Referendum and get the majority of the voters on the Register to record their votes in favour of such amendment.  That would be a cumbrous process, and very often it might be out of all proportion to the importance of the amendment we might wish to make.  If the Article were to stand as it is in the text of this Draft Constitution we would have, for the slightest amendment, to go to the country and go through all the elaborate machinery of a Referendum.  Now we are providing, by this Government amendment, that for five years there can be changes by ordinary legislation in the Constitution, and after that time the Referendum will be necessary to secure a change.  The only provision is that while we are stating that amendments may be made by ordinary legislation, the provisions of Article 46 will apply, which provisions enable a certain proportion of the Senate to call for a Referendum, and in that case a Referendum would have to be held.</P>

      <P>As my amendment is first on the list in this matter, I appreciate the position taken by the Minister, and I think, so far as I am concerned, it will not be necessary to move my amendment.  I would like to say, having in view the strength of the arguments that were used at an earlier hour in regard to the activities of this next succeeding Parliament, that it will probably be engrossed in matters of immediate legislation, for two or three years at any rate, and will not, perhaps, have time to consider questions of constitutional moment.  But the five years' <Col N="1238" /> period is not adequate.  I would suggest for consideration without stressing it overmuch, whether the five year period could not be extended, say, to seven years or to ten, because it is obvious, that constitutional matters will not be in the minds of the people if these other legislative demands are being attended to in the Parliament.  I thought of, perhaps, two Parliaments, thinking, of course, of eight years.  But, I suggest that five years is hardly long enough to give play to the possible amendments that are required.</P>

It is an amendment designed to show, what is obviously the intention of everybody, that on any Referendum you might have more than one amendment proposed to the people; on account of the use of the words &ldquo;every such amendment passed by Parliament,&rdquo; and so forth, as read by the Minister, it is quite liable to be contended that you should have a separate Referendum for each amendment. Clearly, that is not intended.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The Executive Authority of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann is <Col N="1240" /> declared to be vested in the King, and shall be exercisable in accordance with the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the exercise of the executive authority in the case of the Dominion of Canada, by the Representative of the Crown.  There shall be a Council to aid and advise in the Government of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann to be styled the Executive Council/Aireacht. The Executive Council shall be responsible to the Chamber/Dáil Eireann, and shall consist of not more than twelve Ministers/Airi appointed by the Representative of the Crown, of whom four Ministers shall be Members of the Chamber/Dáil Eireann and a number not exceeding eight, chosen from all citizens eligible for election to the Chamber/ Dáil Eireann, who shall not be members of Parliament/Oireachtas during their term of Office, and who, if at the time of their appointment they are members of Parliament/Oireachtas, shall by virtue of such appointment vacate their seats; Provided that the Chamber/Dáil Eireann may from time to time on the motion of the President of the Executive Council determine that a particular Minister or Ministers not exceeding three, may be members of Parliament/ Oireachtas in addition to the four members of the Chamber/Dáil Eireann above mentioned.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose first to deal with the parts of this Article which touch on our relations with England under the Treaty settlement.  We can pass from that to discussion of this new Executive proposal which is affected by the Treaty, and which is very much a matter for the Dáil to consider freely.  In two respects this Government is standing on that Article, and feels that it must stand on that Article, and these two respects are in so far as the Article states that the Executive Authority is vested in the King.  You notice after that it goes on to say that the authority shall be exercised in accordance with the law, practice and constitutional usage, as in the case of Canada.  It struck me during the course of the debates on this Constitution, and more particularly yesterday, that there is a mentality here which sees this country very much in the role of a stalking horse for all the Dominions&mdash;that we are supposed to be a &ldquo;devil-may-care&rdquo; kind of people, rather irresponsible, and <Col N="1241" /> very much prepared to take risks, even when dealing with the fate and destiny of our own country, and that, therefore, we should go ahead and force the pace for all the Dominions.  That is one view, and there is another view which is not quite that, and is more cautious, to the effect that we should aim rather at stating our position in such a way that a challenge to us, or an encroachment upon us, is a challenge to all and an encroachment upon all the Dominions, so that, if a situation like that were to arise, it should be fought not by any one country taking particular risks or acting in an irresponsible way on its own, but it should be fought collectively by all the countries as a matter of common concern and common interest. Now, I am trying to put the thing fairly and without heat.  It does strike me that in discussions here yesterday these two particular points of view were very much in evidence.  I am standing for the point of view that we should, in stating our position, stand absolutely on the letter and spirit of the Treaty, stating it in such a way that if our position were to be challenged in the future that would be a challenge all round which we could reasonably look to other countries to take up, inasmuch as it would be a challenge to themselves. Now, so much for this matter of the Executive authority of the King.  There is a second respect in which we are standing for this Article&mdash;that is, in so far as it provides that the Ministers shall be appointed by the Representative of the Crown.  If Deputies will turn to Articles 51 and 52 they will find that, in fact, Ministers are not appointed by the Representative of the Crown.  &ldquo;The President of the Executive Council shall be the Chief of the Executive Council, and shall be appointed on the nomination of the Chamber/Dáil, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the other Ministers who are members of Parliament/Oireachtas shall be appointed on the nomination of the President of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  So the Dáil appoints or nominates the President, and the President nominates both the Vice-President and the other Ministers.  In Article 52 you have Ministers who are not members of Parliament, but who shall be nominated by a Committee of members of Dáil Eireann.  Dáil Eireann <Col N="1242" /> selects the President, the President selects the Vice-President and the other Ministers who will be members of the Dáil.  As for the Ministers who, it is proposed, will not be members of Dáil Eireann, they are selected by a method to be determined by the Dáil so as to be impartially representative of the Assembly as a whole.  So, in fact, the Representative of the Crown has nothing to do with the selection of Ministers, but he automatically appoints them, either on the nomination of the President or the Dáil itself, and on an analysis wherever, in this Constitution, there is power stated to lie elsewhere than in Ireland, you will find it is not real power, that in fact all real power under the Constitution lies in Ireland and in the Irish people, and any statement to the contrary is merely the keeping up of certain symbols.  Now, if Deputies will turn to page 356 in their large volume giving Constitutions of the world, you will find the position as laid down in Canada:&mdash;&ldquo;the Executive Government and the authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.&rdquo;  There is no use wasting time turning to the Constitutions of the other countries with whom we are associated by Article 1 of the Treaty, but in all you will find that the constitutional usage and practice as well as the law, vests authority nominally in the Head of the Commonwealth, but in fact the real power in the country is in the hands of the Parliament and the people.  That is, of course, a thing from which we could not break away, in accordance with the Treaty.  Therefore, in these two respects we stand absolutely on that Article.  Now to consider the Executive itself.  We are not standing on that as a matter of confidence.  It is not a question on which we would go out, but we do very strongly recommend it to the Members.  We have examined it carefully, and having regard to the political conditions which we consider likely to prevail in the country, and having special regard to the Proportional Representation system of voting now prevailing in the country, we consider it is a system most likely to lead to stable and orderly Government in this country. Under Proportional Representation you will have not so many great solid parties like in England, which make the party system a fairly good working arrangement, <Col N="1243" /> but you will have rather a lot of groups in this Dáil not bound together particularly, but voting independently on the different issues that may arise.  Now, if you had the party system of Government here, and such condition of things prevailing in the Dáil, with small groups, you would not have stable conditions, but you would have, we consider, Governments going in and out far too often to admit of stable conditions and to admit of continuity of policy in the chief Departments of the State.  This system is modelled on the Swiss system, and it is a system which was found to work very well in Switzerland, and the conditions in Switzerland may be considered roughly to resemble those which are prevailing here.  I think it is advisable to spend some considerable time on this proposal. It is a new proposal, and our minds have always been directed towards the English party system, and sub-consciously and unconsciously we think along those lines. This proposal opens up lines of political thought, and it would be well for Members to scrutinise carefully and to weigh its merits and demerits very carefully before deciding on it.  To that end I propose to enter rather on a detailed analysis of the new proposal.  The scheme proposed is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  AN EXECUTIVE COUNCIL responsible to the Dáil (Art. 50).</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)  THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL to consist of not more than TWELVE (12) MINISTERS (Art. 50).</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)  OF THE TWELVE (12) MINISTERS,</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(i.)  FOUR (4) at least MUST be MEMBERS OF THE DAIL (Art. 50).</P>
      <P>(ii.)  EIGHT (8) chosen from all citizens eligible to the Dáil (whether they are Members of the Dáil or not), SHALL NOT DURING THEIR TERM of office BE MEMBERS of either House (Art. 50).</P>
      <P>(iii.)&nbsp;&nbsp;PROVISO that upon occasion a particular Minister or Ministers of the Eight (8), not exceeding Three (3), may be Members of either House if so determined by the Dáil on the motion of the President (Art. 50).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that the normal would be that you <Col N="1244" /> would have four Ministers of the Dáil and eight not members of the Dáil, and you might have seven Ministers members of the Dáil and only five outside Ministers.</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)  THE EIGHT, though not members of the Dáil, are to HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF MEMBERS EXCEPT the right to vote.  They may be required to attend the Dáil and to answer questions (Art. 55).</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>)  THE FOUR (who are to be members of the Dáil) are to include (Art. 51):&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Executive Council, who may also hold a Portfolio (say external affairs).</P>
    <P>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-President of the Executive Council, who may also hold a Portfolio (say Finance).</P>
    <P>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence.</P>
    <P>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;A Minister for Home Affairs (in present circumstances where the restoration of order is vital to stability).</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>)  OF THE FOUR</P>
    <P>THE PRESIDENT is to be appointed on the nomination of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The other three (including the Vice-President) are to be appointed on the nomination of the President (Art. 51).</P>
    <P>(<i>g</i>)  THE FOUR must GO OUT of office if the President fails to be supported by a majority in the Dáil.  (They continue until their successors are appointed.) (Art. 51.)</P>
    <P>(<i>h</i>) THE EIGHT are to be nominated by a Special Committee of the Dáil. The Committee is to be chosen in a way to be settled by the Dáil so as to fairly represent the Dáil.  (Art. 52.)</P>
    <P>N.B.&mdash;The Committee is to nominate each Minister of the Eight for a Ministry with special regard to his suitability for that particular office.  (Art. 52.)</P>
    <P>This is an essential feature of the Scheme, and distinguishes it from:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;the British System, where every Minister is appointed by the Premier for party services rather <Col N="1245" /> than for special suitability for the office;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;a System under which a number of Ministers are appointed in group, distributing the offices amongst themselves after appointment.</P>
    <P>This Scheme is capable of helping towards a scheme of Ministries hereafter resting on a basis of Functional or Vocational Councils.  (See Art. 53.)</P>
    <P>The nominations made by this Committee are to be submitted to the Dáil for acceptance individually, and the Committee is to keep putting up names for each office until one is found acceptable.</P>
    <P>The broad idea of the scheme is that (<i>a</i>) the four members who are to be members of the Dáil are to be collectively responsible to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(1)  These include external affairs (whether policy, negotiation or executive acts).  This would include our relations with England and the rest of the Commonwealth, <i>i.e.</i>, the Treaty position.</P>
    <P>(2)  National defence which must be closely associated with saving and maintaining the Treaty position and preventing any other than constitutional opposition to the Government and Parliament.</P>
    <P>(3)  Finance upon which the whole National position and every department of it must be firmly based.</P>
    <P>(4)  Probably Home Affairs in present circumstances; (b) the eight (who are not to be members of the Dáil) while acting collectively as an Executive with the four are to be only individually responsible to the Dáil for their respective Ministries. The intention is that the eight should hold the Ministries for the internal government of the country, <i>e.g.</i>, (1) Education; (2) Justice; (3) Post Office;</P>
    <P>(4)  Trade and Commerce; (5) Local Government; (6) Public Health; (7) Agriculture; (8) Labour; (9) Fine Arts.</P>
    <P>Each of these Ministers would (1) have all the privileges of the Dáil save voting; (2) hold office for the whole term of Dáil, that is 4 years, and until successor is appointed; (3) would not go out of office on defeat of the President and the Four; (4) would not be removed from office during his term unless on a report by a Committee of the Dáil that <Col N="1246" /> he had been guilty of malfeasance in Office, incompetence and unsatisfactory performance of his duties and failure to carry out the expressed will of Parliament. The intention of the whole scheme is to forestall the party system of government. The party system, as in England, depends for its effective working on two great parties.  Where there are a number of parties, as in Italy and France, or as would be here under Proportional Representation, it would be practically impossible to get a stable government.  Now, there is further this side to it&mdash;that we are launching a State.  We have not the tradition of government here.  We have not been governing ourselves for a very long time, and we have not been running our own departments, and it will take is a very long time to build up anything like an efficient Civil Service machine that the older established Governments have at their disposal.  It would be very important and very valuable if it became possible to select Ministers solely on the basis of their peculiar fitness for their office, and not on the basis of political service or perfervid rhetoric that they may have poured out on the platform, or anything else.  It is important that at the launching of a young State that a Minister should be able to bring forward proposals here and have them freely discussed by the Dáil without the feeling that their rejection would endanger his whole Ministry arid his whole administration, and endanger the President, and the policy that the President stood for.  That is one of the evils of the Party System of government.  In England if the Minister for Agriculture, or the Minister for Education, or some other Minister brings forward a measure, and if he is particularly keen on that measure, the defeat of that is a defeat for the whole Government, and the whole Government goes out.  Now, it does not make for freedom of thought, and it does not make for freedom of judgment that the Deputies must feel, &ldquo;Now, I must support this measure; personally, I do not approve of it, things were very well as they were, this measure is either evil or unnecessary, but if I do not vote for it there is danger that the whole Government goes out, and the whole policy, external and internal that the Government is standing for is in danger.&rdquo;  That is wrong.  That is one of the evils of the Party System.  Now, in view of the amendment that we have <Col N="1247" /> inserted in Article 49, it is very well worth while to make such an experiment as this if a good <i>bona fide</i> case can be established for it, and I submit that that case can be established rather by pointing to the obvious and glaring defect in the Party System, even as it exists in England, where you have two Parties pitted against each other.  There are glaring defects in that form of government, but these defects would be multiplied manifold here where you have a Dáil consisting of small independent groups, or even individual members, not bound by any ties to any others in the Dáil. We have such members in the Dáil now, and we are bound to have them in the future.  Now if you had a Party System of government things might go very well for a time, but then an issue might arise, such as we had here lately, and purely on the merits of that issue there would be a change in the voting, and out goes that particular Government, and then another comes in, and all the time you have in danger and in the balance the main planks that the President and his immediate advisers are standing for. The important thing, the internal and external policy of the Government, would then be endangered perhaps over some small measure like the compensation for damage to property that we had here last week, or something of that kind.  If this system is found not to work it can be changed under the amendment that we have accepted to Article 49.  We submit that it is very well worth trying.  It is a mistake to say that the outside Ministers would not be sufficiently responsible to the Dáil. They could attend the Dáil, they could be summoned here, and it might be made a matter of routine that they would attend and answer questions, and so on.  They have every right in the Dáil, except the right of voting, and they are under this arrangement left free to bring forward proposals without endangering their administration, and having these proposals discussed openly and freely, each Deputy using independent judgment, and voting on the merits of the proposal, which is a most important thing when we are establishing a new order here, and when we must go ahead with so much progressive legislation and reconstructive legislation.</P>

      <P>That is part of the proposal, part of the underlying object of the whole proposal.  If you want to get away from the Party System of Government, you will only get it by having many Ministers not members of the Dáil, and appointed simply because of their fitness for a particular office, and not for their political qualifications. And then they will be judged by the Dáil only by the efficiency with which their department is run, and the soundness or otherwise of the measures.</P>

      <P>It might be found, for instance, that a Member of Parliament would be the most suitable man to appoint to a certain Ministry, and yet to carry out this scheme you want a certain number of Ministers who are not Members of the Dáil.  If the man appointed was a Member, he would be expected to resign, as it is underlying these proposals. When you want a non-party system of government you are aiming at securing the best administration of each particular Department, and you are limiting the political aspect of the thing simply to the President and three Ministers around him.  They stand or fall on large matters of policy&mdash;internal policy, defence, and the general order of the country&mdash;while the other Ministers only stand or fall on the efficiency of their Department and the soundness of the proposals they bring before the Dáil.  He should be free to bring forward proposals to be discussed on their merits, and should not be in the position that a Minister would have to resign if a proposal he brought forward were defeated. We want free discussion and full deliberation on these matters, and he would only get the mind of the Parliament by bringing forward measures.  The Committee that appointed him can at any time sit and remove him under any of the three heads I have named; malfeasance in his office, incompetence or <Col N="1249" /> failure to carry out the expressed will of the Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the following amendment to Article 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all the words from the opening of the Article to the word &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; inclusive (in ninth line of printed draft before Dáil), and to insert in their place the following words:&mdash;&lsquo;The Executive Authority of the Irish Free State shall be an Executive Council responsible.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to say that I find myself very wholeheartedly in favour of the plan which the Government has espoused.  I only want to make one observation on it in case it escaped attention, as I did not hear the Minister for Home Affairs.  It seems to me it would be undesirable that this new scheme should come into operation until after the General Election.  I do not know the weight Ministers attach to that, but you must remember you cannot ask a person of standing outside to come and take an office for six or seven months, and then be out altogether.  If you are asking this man to give up his business and undertake some particular office under the scheme he ought to have the four years prescribed by the scheme.  I ask Ministers whether this Executive proposal shall apply to the present Parliament, conditionally, on the Constitution being passed, or whether it would come into operation after the General Election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move the amendment designed to remove the King from the Executive, and remove so much of the clause describing the Executive as makes an Executive Council to aid and advise the Government in the Irish Free State, with the result that if the amendment be accepted it would read:&mdash;&ldquo;The Executive Authority of the Irish Free State shall be an Executive Council responsible to the Irish Free State,&rdquo; and so forth.  I feel that it needs considerably less temerity to move this particular amendment to one of the major clauses on which the Government stands than <Col N="1250" /> it needed to make the amendments to the other clauses.  For this reason, one that I have no doubt the Minister for Home Affairs will himself admit to be true, namely, that the insertion of the King in the Executive is much more clearly a violation of our Treaty rights than its insertion elsewhere.  I would ask Members to recollect what is said in Article 1 of the Treaty.  By Article 1 Ireland is to have a Parliament with certain powers and an Executive responsible to that Parliament.  These are the exact words, &ldquo;An Executive responsible to that Parliament.&rdquo;  My submission to this Dáil is that it is a contradiction in terms to state that your Executive is vested in the King in one breath and in the other to say your Executive is responsible to Parliament, because the whole theory of the law is that the King is not responsible.  This particular phrase, &ldquo;An Executive responsible to the Parliament&rdquo; is the most cogent evidence you can get, in my judgment, of the fact that when that Treaty was signed and &ldquo;the law, practice, and constitutional usage&rdquo; were employed they mean, as I suggested before, a synthesis of all three.  They meant to convey and have expressed in our Constitution the truth as it is to-day.  If they had meant us to state first of all the old law and afterwards constitutional usage they could not have used that phrase, &ldquo;An Executive responsible to Parliament.&rdquo;  The King, according to the law which is being imported here, is a being clothed with absolute perfection.  He is a person who not only cannot do an improper thing; he cannot even think of an improper thing, and cannot ever intend to do a wrong act.  In Blackstone's phrase, &ldquo;the King can do no wrong,&rdquo; and therefore he cannot be responsible to Parliament.  If you bring him into the Executive you are bringing in someone who does not comply with the conditions of the Treaty.  It is true, in fact you would have Ministers who would be responsible to Parliament, but here the draft merely says these Ministers will aid and advise him.  In truth it is intended they shall govern and be the Executive. Why not say so?  That is what the Treaty says, &ldquo;an Executive responsible to Parliament,&rdquo; will be given to Ireland. That is why I say that this Constitution should state quite clearly that our <Col N="1251" /> Executive Council shall be the one proposed in such a way as it will be responsible to Parliament.  I think the proposal is a very simple one, and under this very Clause the concession claimed by England is a concession that should not be granted, in view of the very strong logical case we have.  The doctrine of Ministerial responsibility which has grown through many evolutions to be the actual practice to-day is one that ought to be expressed in terms, and we should not express a thing which is not quite true in our Constitution, and it is inconsistent with our Constitution to make the King the Executive.  Ministers have, naturally enough, scored all along the line on major issues because the people were afraid of losing the Treaty. I put it to them that this particular issue is one upon which they may graciously concede that the amendment proposed is right, and that there is no reason for objecting to it, because if they say to Downing Street we have secured that Parliament shall yield on so many points&mdash;ten or twelve&mdash;that you consider vital, but on this one we must stand upon the strict wording of the Treaty, we must insist according to what the Treaty says that the Constitution shall express the fact of an Executive responsible to the Parliament, I do not think they would find such enormous difficulty in getting the people across the water, who are so anxious to have their interpretation put upon certain clauses, to see they could not have it their way every time.  I therefore trust that the Minister will re-consider this particular clause and accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, the answer to Deputy Gavan Duffy is very simple.  He is confounding two things&mdash;the vesting of the executive authority and the exercising of it.  The maxim of constitutional law which he has quoted is undoubtedly sound.  No one would dream of questioning it.  But there is another, much more germane to the point at issue.  It says &ldquo;the King reigns, but does not govern.&rdquo;  There is nothing in the wording of this clause which is antagonistic to the doctrine, &ldquo;the King reigns, but does not govern.&rdquo;  You must have the executive authority vested somewhere. The exercise of it is another thing.  The exercise of the executive authority in <Col N="1252" /> Ireland is given into the hands of the Ministry&mdash;the Cabinet as you may call it&mdash;the Executive Council.  I ask Deputy Gavan Duffy to consider this, supposing he omits the clause vesting the executive authority, what will happen when one Ministry is voted out of office? Another Ministry must be procured Who is to summon the members of the Parliament to form a new Ministry? Where is the executive authority to be during the interval?  According to constitutional practice, everywhere, there must be something of this sort.  It is a necessary part of the machinery of the continuity of government.  If objection was to vesting it in the King, it would be a different point altogether, but, as I understood, or possibly misunderstood, the Deputy, he did not propose a substitute.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I think that Deputy Magennis's criticism of Deputy Gavan Duffy's amendment, and his statement supporting that amendment, was very sound but there is an even more fundamental objection to the amendment, and it is Article 2 of the Treaty&mdash;&ldquo;Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice, and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown, or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  The effect of that clause of the Treaty is to say that the relations of the Crown to the Dominion of Canada shall be those governing the relations of the Crown to the Irish Free State, and the effect of Deputy Gavan Duffy's amendment is to say that the relations of the Crown or <Col N="1253" /> the representatives of the Crown or the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall not be their relations to the Irish Free State.  The Article of the Treaty says they shall be the same. Deputy Gavan Duffy's amendment is to the effect that they shall not be the same, but otherwise.  That goes to the root of things, and on that ground, and on that ground only, we are bound to stand against that amendment.  It is not a view that was forced upon us elsewhere. We hold that view ourselves&mdash; that what is embodied and what is implied by that amendment of Deputy Gavan Duffy is inconsistent, with the Treaty.</P>

      <P>I propose a further amendment to add to this Article and before Article 51, to insert as a separate Article the following words: &ldquo;No Act of State shall be done and no executive action shall be taken in the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann otherwise than upon the initiative, and with the authority of the Executive Council Aireacht.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I trust that the Ministry will see no difficulty in accepting this amendment. I need not say very much in support of it, but I want to quote two or three authorities that prove, I think, conclusively that we are entitled to express the constitutional usage in that form.  Mr. Harrison, in a letter which has been circulated to Members, advocates inserting in the Constitution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a Declaration that while Executive action will be taken in the name of the Crown, no such action in Ireland shall be taken save on the initiative and sole responsibility of the Minister answerable to the Irish Legislature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He says that that should go into the Constitution, and he adds&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Can it be seriously argued that Great Britain would be any the <Col N="1254" /> weaker for thus abolishing sources of immediate and ultimate friction, and for relying upon quasi diplomatic action as between Government and Government for the protection?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he has a suggested amendment drafted which is very much the same as mine, except that it speaks of the Royal Prerogative, which I have not mentioned in terms.  He suggests&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All Executive Action taken in the name of the Crown and every exercise of the Royal Prerogative shall, within the territories and sphere of authority of the Irish Free State, be based upon the initiative, advice and responsibility of Ministers directly accountable to the Irish Free State Parliament,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and he defines that&mdash;I quote his words, which will have much more authority than any I may use&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is to provide in express terms that which is implied in the recognition of Ireland's Dominion status, but which is not clearly prescribed, nor conclusively secured by the Terms of Articles 2 and 50 of the draft Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Harrison goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been alleged that the British Crown is written all over the Constitution. The Crown is, however, in its Constitutional aspect as regards Irish internal affairs, no more than the emblem of an authority to be exercised by the Ministers directly accountable to the Irish Parliament, and as regards Irish external affairs, the symbol of certain neutral interests and a common purpose in regard thereto in world politics upon which the Independent units of the Community of Nations known as the British Empire are voluntarily agreed. When this is made clear the jibe above referred to is seen to be pointless. The Amendment puts the King's representative in Ireland in the same Constitutional position as regards the Irish Ministers, the Irish Parliament and the Irish people as the King himself occupies as regards the British Ministers, the British Parliament and the British people.  It prevents any action of an executive character whether based on the Royal prerogative or not from being taken in Ireland at the <Col N="1255" /> instance of British Ministers.  No Constitutional lawyer will under-rate the importance of securing this declaration in the clearest possible terms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is important that we should, in the clearest possible terms, make provision against the interference of British Ministers in this matter of the Executive; they are the people who have access.  I might remind the Dáil that Professor Keith, who has been quoted here before in dealing with the subject, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not compatible with the idea of the equality of status between the Dominions and the United Kingdom asserted at the Imperial War Conference of 1917 that a Ministry which represents the choice of Parliament and the Constituencies should be subject to control in their actions by a nominee of the Imperial Government, even though his action is taken on his own initiative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may conclude this by reading what Mr. Duncan Hall, another very well known authority on the Constitutional practice of the Dominions, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was intimated at the debate in the Imperial Conference of 1918 that formal recognition must be given to the fact that in practice the position of the Governor-General is now that of Viceroy.  As General Smuts has said recently, the Governor-General should be the representative of the King and nothing else.  This may involve a change of name.  It will certainly involve a strict recognition of the rule that the Governor-General should act in all cases, even the most trivial, as a Constitutional Monarch, that is, solely upon the advice and responsibility of his Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will see the desirability of making that clear in the draft Constitution by accepting either my amendment or putting in other words designed to the same purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter, as in so many other matters, our minds do not click with Deputy Gavan Duffy's. Deputy Gavan Duffy is the chief exponent here of a great Imperial Conference that is to sit to arrive at definitions, which will be completely satisfactory to all parties.  On the other hand we have the letter from Mr. Harrison stating that <Col N="1256" /> this Imperial Conference on which Deputy Gavan Duffy has his eye fixed, sat last year, and decided not to decide anything or arrive at any definition.  But assuming in the near or far future they will sit and arrive at definite definitions, is it sound for us to attempt, as Deputy Gavan Duffy does, to anticipate these definitions?  and is it right, particularly without any consultation whatever with Canada, to take it upon ourselves here to define the Canadian position?  Is it not both sounder and more considerate simply to claim the Canadian position, and let that be fought out, as it should be fought out, by Canada and this country, if you will, and the other Dominions collectively as a matter of common interest.  In this Amendment again, as in other Amendments, we come up against that mentality which says this country has no more dignified role than that of a stalking horse for the left wing of Dominion thought.  We object to this country being used as a stalking horse for any left wing, or for any thought other than Irish thought.  And we will state the position always in such a way that when we are challenged other parties in the Commonwealth are likewise challenged, and when there is an encroachment on us that encroachment will <i>ipso facto</i> be an encroachment upon other parties in the Commonwealth That is a fair position, and a more constitutional position than to expect one country to act as a stalking horse, getting all the kicks and taking all the risks, while other people get any problematical advantage that may be won without either kick or risk.  We will not accept that position, and we do not consider it either statesmanlike or patriotic to advocate the taking up of such a position by this country, having regard to the special conditions at the moment.  I submit it is sounder to leave these matters undefined&mdash;simply the Canadian position&mdash;and leave that Canadian position to be defined at this Imperial Conference, which Deputy Gavan Duffy assures us is going to bring in the millennium for the Dominions.  It may bring such millennium, but if it does it will be a millennium in which we will automatically share by the very wording which we have ourselves inserted in this Constitution. The amendment is not accepted by those who are standing sponsor for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I must disclaim the epithet &ldquo;Left Wing&rdquo; for this amendment.  This amendment is designed to express the admitted Constitutional usage.

      <P>Before we are asked to vote, may I take the liberty of asking the Minister in charge of the Bill to return to the point just for one moment?  In my view, so far as my limited knowledge extends, what Deputy Gavan Duffy has declared is absolutely correct.  His amendment does declare the present state of Constitutional usage. Last evening, on Article 40, I took up the attitude which the Minister takes up on this Article, namely, that we are in a much safer position, more fully guarded by using the language of the Treaty than by departing from it.  What I should like to have added for my own benefit, and, I presume, to some extent for the benefit of our colleagues here, is this: though the Canadian Constitution was set up ostensibly by the enactment of the Imperial Parliament in 1867, that British North America Act merely gave legislative body and being to proposals that had been formulated from within the provinces of Canada.  There were, as you know already, several Provinces, Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia, and so on, and they had debated amongst themselves what claim they should make to the rights and privileges they were entitled to as between themselves, and the British North America Act therefore set down, in the language of the draftsmen, many things which had been arrived at by negotiation. Since then the genius of the Canadian people, largely that of the mother country, England, developed along lines which have made their Constitution expand, as the British Constitution itself has expanded, by natural evolution; so that the ordinary onlooker is deceived.  He is likely to imagine that the Canadians have a written Constitution, whereas the Constitution of Great Britain is unwritten.  As I said a few evenings ago, on another point, we must not let ourselves be deceived by what seems to be obvious logic.  One may argue in regard to other Constitutions that it is either a written Constitution <Col N="1258" /> or an unwritten Constitution; but here you have the case of Canada where a Constitution is partly written and, in very recent years, is largely an unwritten Constitution.  So you have what to a layman would appear an anomalous position.  There are many things which, under the British North America Act, are legal, but they are not to-day Constitutional, and one might seek the Courts in Canada under the law, and yet, in the result be defeated by the fact of the Constitution having grown into what it is.  What I state is, I think, beyond all question, and I am insisting upon this, because the Law, Practice, and Constitutional usage of Canada, as implied in the Treaty, confers upon the Irish Free State an infinitely better position than many of the critics of the Treaty are able to realise; but in order to get these benefits we must not take the Law or Practice or Constitutional usage by themselves.  We must take them all together, because that formula is an effort to express what I have indicated at greater length&mdash;the fact that the Constitutional position of Canada is a growth, and that whereas no document could be produced, if it were called upon, to establish the claim of Canada, yet it is a well understood thing, as between Downing Street and the Canadian Federal Ministry, that this is the rightful claim of Canada.  That will not be contested.  To use the happy phrase of Viscount Haldane, who, as you know, is the greatest authority living on the questions of the relations of Canada to the Crown and Imperial Parliament, because he has decided so many cases dealing with the inter-relations, they are bound by a silken cord.  A silken cord of practice and Constitutional usage is replaced, if I might enlarge his metaphor, by the iron chain of legal enactment.  I am at one with Deputy Gavan Duffy in trying to claim for our own Free State the fullest measure of Constitutional liberty and advantage that Canada has achieved for herself.  But, anxious as I am to support the Minister in his desire that we shall not come into collision prematurely, unadvisably and to our detriment with the British Imperial Cabinet, I should like to have this point considered.  My preface is exceedingly long, but very often the longest way round is the shortest way home.  Suppose, under the Clause as it stands, <Col N="1259" /> Downing Street should claim to exercise restraint, or indulge in interference with us, pleading the law, and pleading the legal position of Canada, it would then become incumbent upon us to plead the practice and Constitutional usage of Canada.  The appeal is not there to any legal instrument, or any document or Treaty.  As I understand Deputy Duffy's position&mdash;he is better able to express himself than I am, but I wish not to interpret him so much as to see what the effect he produces upon my mind is &mdash;he wants to preclude the necessity hereafter of this thing being adjudged before some tribunal; he wants us to claim now what we think we are entitled to claim, and have it on record from the very beginning.  On the other hand, the Minister is convinced it would be better policy to allow Canada, or the Union of South Africa, already militant, and thousands of miles away from the other party to the contest, to develop a discussion themselves, and for us to become inheritors of whatever they may achieve. It, therefore, resolves itself into a question of policy; it is not so much a question of principle as a question of prudence and policy.  Are we now to announce this is the Irish interpretation of the Treaty, or should we leave it to other members of the Union of Free Nations to have that determined?  Let us suppose the case has to be adjudicated upon.  Before what tribunal will it come?  Will it be before the Privy Council of Great Britain, or do we look forward to the creation of a Dominion, or, to use an unhappy word, which is the only word I can use, an Imperial Council?  Here is one of the things which have not yet come into being, and yet we talk at times as though they did exist&mdash;that Imperial Council.  During the War an Imperial Cabinet was called together, and out of it arose a great many of the concessions which Great Britain had to make to the demands of the Dominion Premiers. There is no such Commission as a recognised agent of Arbitration.  There is no authorised Imperial or Dominion Council, and, so far as I know, it would be within the power of England to-day to claim that adjudication upon differences of this sort should come before the Judicial Committee of the Cabinet; that is to say, should come before what is to a large extent a British constituted body. I wonder if the Minister has considered <Col N="1260" /> that point.  I should like to have his view, if it is not asking him too much, before I am called upon to vote.</P>

      <P>Something of what frequently was said during the Treaty debates might be said now: that too much attention can be given to theory, and too little attention to reality, and the tendency of everything that Deputy Gavan Duffy proposes is to give attention to mere theory and not consider what reality is or what reality is likely to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ERNEST BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing that we can state in the Constitution in a matter like this will alter the reality in the least.  The reality in regard to the doing of acts of State, and the taking of Executive action will depend upon the fact that an Irish Army will hold this country and the armed force of the country will be an Irish force.  That is a reality of the situation.  It was pointed out many times in the Treaty, and these trappings, which are of much importance to the British, are of little or no importance to us.  Now the British effort in the Treaty, and in the negotiations in connection with the Constitution, was to preserve a certain symbolism and a certain number of forms.  I take it, the reason that we had not in the Treaty simply practice and constitutional usage of Canada was in order that the forms might be preserved.  The law was put in because it is in the law that the forms and the symbolism are preserved.  Now, you could not preserve the symbolism, preserve the convention, if you set down further in the law, that the law as already existing in Canada is hereby revised and repealed and that the King is to have no power whatsoever, and that he is to be, if you like to put it, a rubber stamp.  That underlies the whole Treaty.  That is what the British stood for in the Treaty, that certain symbols should be preserved. You cannot preserve the symbols, if you put it down in black and white that the symbols stand for nothing, that they are wiped out, and that this proposal be substituted.  That is an additional reason to the reasons of expediency, the reasons connected with the advantage of linking ourselves up <Col N="1261" /> with the strong and distant Dominions. That is the reason why we take broadly the law and in this case the practice and Constitutional usage of Canada; and why we stand for the unwritten Constitution of Canada in all its length and breadth, and do not attempt to cramp and put it down in any particular formula of our own.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Constitutional position of Canada is one of growth and one of change, that things have become obsolete, and that things are obsolescent means that nobody could determine at the present moment what is the constitutional position of Canada, because a thing that has not been done in the past can only be determined to be obsolete if it is not done in the future.  It is by the future as well as by what we can judge from the present and the past that we find the exact constitutional position of Canada.  That is a thing entirely apart from the question of future growth. But future development is a thing which will show exactly to what stage Canada has got at the present moment.</P>

The proposals admittedly are an experiment, and I should know something about experiments, and I know that sometimes they are dangerous. My first feeling with regard to this was, that it was a dangerous experiment. On later reflection, I must say, I was very much influenced by the argument put forward by the Minister for Home Affairs when speaking on this clause previously, and again to-day.  He made me think that the proposals perhaps would not in themselves in the main be dangerous&mdash;that, at any rate the danger could be avoided.  It was easy to see that they might lead to things, I think, we would wish to avoid.  One would always like to avoid the tendency to establish an inner Cabinet.  It is possible this proposal might lead in that direction.  We should have a big 4, and there might be a tendency for that 4 to be too big a 4. In another direction, I think, it is rather hard to perceive how persons who are Members of the Ministry, and who are in a peculiar state as regards responsibilities would act in consultation with the Executive Council.  According to the general tendencies of the proposal, we should have eight Ministers, who are, so to speak, in a safe position consulting with four who are in a more or less difficult position and a more or less unsafe position.  It is rather hard to see how their advice might act in future. but I admit very much the force of what has been said as to the action of the party <Col N="1266" /> system in England, and how it might act here.  There is every reason to expect that the evils of the party system in England would be very much exaggerated over here, and further, in the comparatively small Parliament we shall have, I think it is likely to be the case that the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister in the next Dáil, in other words, Prime Ministers generally, might find a difficulty in getting the 12 men most suitable for being in charge of the different Departments from the small number in the Dáil.  And this and other considerations have brought me into a position that I am quite prepared to support the general principle put forward by the Minister, but I think the details of it require very careful examination. I am not quite sure that the Ministers are prepared to stand over all the details, and neither am I sure that we are going to consider the details in a full Dáil here in the best way.  Therefore, we should adopt here the general principles and keep away from details. Therefore, I ask the Ministry to appoint a small committee to go into details and make a further report later on.  In that way we can discuss the general principles and probably the details can be discussed better with a small number there than with a large number in this Dáil.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose this motion and to ask this Dáil to reject the fantastic part of this Article. The difficulty about this Article is, where the part is vital to the Treaty I want to stand by it, and the second part, which I think fantastic and impracticable, I will vote against, and it seems to me I can only do that by exercising both votes for the constituencies for which I sit&mdash;one for, and one against.  I am afraid, however, that is not according to the Constitutional law and practice of this Dáil.  I want to support the Government upon the matter which is vital to the Treaty, but I do not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The matter before the Dáil is an amendment which comes away altogether from the first part of the Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but it is important to suggest that if those of us who disagree with the second part want to support the first part there should <Col N="1267" /> be a method of doing so.  Both parts should not be put simultaneously.  I object to this being referred to a committee, for this reason.  I think the whole thing is an experiment that Ireland cannot at this stage afford to make, and therefore I want to have the thing disposed of, and the Dáil to get on with the real work of getting the Constitution through.  Now the argument has been put forward that we are on the verge of becoming a victim of the party system in politics, and we should try to avoid that.  Well, I see no indication in this Dáil or outside of it that there is going to be any cessation of party organisation in the near future.  But I believe that all parties will endeavour to get a majority in this Dáil in order to become the responsible heads of authority in this Dáil.  And another point that was made is, that any adverse vote in departmental matters might involve the resignation of the entire Government. I do not think that is necessary at all.  I think it is perfectly easy to make provision in the Constitution, by which it shall be agreed that an adverse vote on some departmental question which may involve the resignation of that particular Minister, of that particular department, need not necessarily affect the position of the Government as a whole.  I think that particular object can be secured by recourse to something ordinary that appeals to the commonsense of everyone.  This is what appeals to me.  I gather from the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs that what we are going to do is to appoint those eight Ministers who are not in reality Ministers at all, but heads of departments, Civil Servants.  That, to my mind, would lead to a peculiar situation; if, upon an adverse vote, four of the elected Ministers resign, the eight unelected were left in possession of the reins of Government.  I am not at all certain that Civil Servants do not already exercise quite sufficient influence upon the administration; and people who would carry out the functions of government or administration, responsible heads, should be able to stand the test of the people's verdict.  For the life of me I cannot understand why it is deemed something calculated to bring a menace to this Assembly and the country, but of every man who fills the onerous and responsible position of <Col N="1268" /> Minister&mdash;I see no menace or danger to the country in the fact that he has received the approbation of the people by his election.  I see considerable danger, on the other hand, if the reins of Government fall into the hands of non-elected persons, who might possibly be rejected by the electors if they went up before them.  And after all is said and done the people must be the final court of appeal or decision, and there is no use in trying by ingenious, I had almost said fantastic experiments, to get round that right of the people with regard to the reins of government in the country. So far from being something that would lead to, or is calculated to lead to, stable and ordered government, to my mind this experiment is more likely to lead us to a stable oligarchy, and bureaucracy.  Because I take that rather emphatic view of this second portion of this Article, I think there should be some means devised by which the two portions can be put to this Dáil separately.  It had been my intention to have moved an amendment to this Article which would convey my opinions on the matter, but unfortunately I overlooked that the thing was approaching so near us.  I decided to defer the putting forward of such an amendment until a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to catch the significance of that remark.  But my object in deferring it was, that while expressing my decided opinions against it, I intended to listen to the arguments for this proposal, and if I could be convinced that I am wrong, I am open to conviction.  But I want to frame my amendment as a result of any benefit I get from the discussion, so that we can meet, or remove, what, in my opinion, are objectionable phrases in this proposal with the least degree of difficulty. Therefore, I think, at least I presume, that this Clause will stand for the present. But I think that the Dáil should make up its mind when it comes to a later stage, if it does reach that far, to consider the fact that the Ireland that is emerging from the old bad conditions of social and political governmental life, that is emerging into the new conditions of things, is not a fit subject for the fantastic experiments which may lead us <Col N="1269" /> anywhere but where we want to get.  It is not dilettante politics that should be the guiding light of this matter, but the practical everyday facts of life that should guide men in approaching a subject like this.  Some Minister to-day spoke of the impression having been given to him that certain people wanted to make Ireland a stalking horse for the Dominions.  That may be so.  But certainly there are certain people who want to make Ireland a subject of every experiment that the wit of man can devise.  They want to try it on the dog first.  If it suits Ireland, well, then, they might try it elsewhere.  Now, I say that is not right.  I say the first thing Ireland wants is to get on its feet on lines that leave no shadow of doubt as to the stability and safety of the position, and then when we have recovered some degree of normal strength and outlook then we can consider this experiment of social evolution such as is indicated in this motion.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy Gavan Duffy favours this Executive scheme.  He has spoken to that effect. I do not see how his motion would turn on Deputy Thrift's amendment.  No doubt he has reasons that he could explain. As a sponsor of this particular Bill, I think this proposal of Deputy Thrift's solves just that difficulty which Deputy Milroy states he was in.  It takes out this Executive proposal from any other matter, and proposes to consider it as a thing apart.  It also enables a clear vote to be taken on the new Executive proposal.  Personally, I would favour the acceptance of Professor Thrift's motion.  We think it meets admirably the difficulty we found ourselves in, as discriminating between the novel Executive proposals and certain other things in the Articles, such as the position of the King as regards the Executive.  Deputy Milroy is apparently lost in admiration of the Party system of Government, as evidenced in Great Britain, and he fears some consequences, if this new proposal were adopted, which I think are scarcely accurate.  He spoke of the possibility of the four Ministers being defeated and going out, and of power being left in the hands of the eight.  As a fact, the four must go out of office if the President fails to be supported by a majority of the Dáil, but they continue in office until their successors are appointed.  So that particular bogey man is disposed of.  I do think that Article 49 amended permits of easy changes in the Constitution in the future.  It is well worth trying whether we could not devise a better system of Government than that system by which men constantly, as a matter of routine, vote against their own judgment, and almost against their own <Col N="1271" /> conscience, for fear of bringing down the particular Party Government to which they adhere.  We should try that. There is nothing admirable in the Party system of Government.  There is much that is evil and open to criticism.  If we can find, or think we can find, a better system, we ought to try.  It is time to begin, and it is, at any rate, a thing that can involve no very disastrous consequences, and it is not right to speak in superlatives or in a lurid way of the terrible consequences that might follow if it was adopted.  If the consequences are bad, and if the defects admitted in this system are more glaring than in the Party system of Government, then this Dáil will, no doubt, face the fact and avail of the power in Article 49 by wiping out this Executive System and returning to the Party System of Government, with all its errors and anomalies and men voting constantly against what their judgment dictates, simply at the crack of the Party whip.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best form in which to discuss this matter is for me to move an amendment that the words &ldquo;should be&rdquo; be inserted after Executive Council, and that the words &ldquo;should not be members of the Dáil&rdquo; should be deleted.  It would then read:&mdash;&ldquo;That this House approves as a general principle of the proposal that certain members of the Executive Council should be nominated by the Dáil, and individually responsible to the Dáil alone for the Departments respectively under their charge, and that the details of the provisions for appointing,&rdquo; and so on, leaving out the sentence which says &ldquo;These Ministers should not be members of the Dáil.&rdquo;  From my reading of these clauses and many conversations about them with people who claim to understand them, and people who claim that they are not understandable, I have still an open mind, and I am hoping that the discussions here will enable me to come down definitely on one side or the other. My present views are shortly these, that it is desirable that there should be Ministers who are not exactly irremovable, but firmly established, who are not likely to be subjected to mere political party pressure, or who need not necessarily resign when the Ministry may be defeated on a matter of general policy not affecting that particular Minister's Department. I do not understand the argument in favour of insisting that a man, having received the confidence of the electorate, and having been elected as the most fit man for a particular office, should then throw back upon the electorate his mandate, and, in view of Proportional Representation, throw upon that same electorate the responsibility of choosing a man of entirely different way of political thinking from him.  He may have been one of the minority elected under Proportional Representation.  He is a fit man, and it is because he is not a party man, perhaps, he was selected. He is a fit man for a particular office, and he is chosen by the Dáil for that particular office.  He is appointed, and immediately he has to resign, leaving that particular constituency under our present electoral arrangements to elect a man by the ordinary single vote who would be a member of a party, almost inevitably and not filling the same functions for that electorate that the man displaced was intended to fill so <Col N="1276" /> far as he is a representative.  I do not understand the strength of the argument in favour of compelling this Minister to resign.  Nevertheless, I think it desirable that the Dáil should be free to elect a Minister who is not a member of the Dáil, even though he has not been selected by the electorate for membership of the Dáil.  He may be a man not of the mind or quality, or of the temperament to face the electorate, and if the Dáil thinks him a fit man for a particular office I think it ought to be understood that they have the right to elect him. Now, on the question of collective responsibility, it seems to me it is the real crux of the question.  I think that it is necessary that the Ministry should, in the main, be composed of men who are in agreement upon general questions.  I think there is need for something like a common understanding on general questions of policy in the Ministry, and, therefore, I feel that if these proposals are accepted we ought to make up our minds that it means that the real responsible Ministry&mdash;the Cabinet&mdash;is going to be a small body, smaller than the Ministry.  The body that will have general responsibility for policy will be the Cabinet within the Ministry, though the use of the term Executive Council seems to connote the whole of the Members of the Ministry.  If this plan is adopted we have to face the likelihood &mdash;the almost certainty&mdash;that the real Ministry and the real Government, so far as general questions of policy are concerned, will be the smaller number who are responsible to the Chamber, and would have to resign upon a question of confidence, while the other members of the Ministry would not be members of the Cabinet, and, therefore, not responsible for questions of general policy. I think that is a position that we can contemplate with hope and satisfaction. In practice in other countries, and, I think, in practice here we have had that very state of affairs.  We have had a number of Ministers who, because of certain virtues perhaps, have become the inner Cabinet, and while we may not like to put that in the form of a Constitutional provision, it is inevitable in every country that there are a smaller number who become the real guardians and advocaters, or formulaters, of Cabinet policy, and we ought to face that and put it into our Constitution.  There are <Col N="1277" /> other Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet, but who may still be Ministers, and continue their offices after the Cabinet has forfeited confidence.  We have been reminded of the British practice. We know there that all the Ministers have been appointed on the nomination of the Premier, but if the Premier forfeited confidence all these Ministers, even the Postmaster-General, who should not be a political appointment, had to resign.  Now, the position that I would support would be this, that the Cabinet should be responsible to the Dáil as a whole for general policy, but that there should be a Ministry outside that dealing with more technical affairs, which should not be compelled to resign on the failure of the Cabinet on a matter of general policy to retain confidence.  Ministers who are responsible for Departments of the kind I am speaking of&mdash;administrative Departments and somewhat technical Departments&mdash;would be respecting proposals for legislation necessarily to a very great extent at any rate dependent upon the Treasury for sanction in regard to Bills. I can conceive of a Minister making certain proposals to the Dáil which might involve finance, and the Treasury would say that it is not fit or right that this particular Bill should be brought forward because of the state of finances, and because of the responsibilities that such a Bill would impose upon the financial resources of the country.  But if that Minister thought it was a very desirable measure, and was worth the money, I think he ought to be free to explain that to the Assembly, and that the Treasury should be free also to explain its implications and the responsibilities, and even show an apparent cleavage on that particular issue, and leave the Dáil to decide whether the financial responsibility should be undertaken.  Therefore, I think in the main that what was called by the Minister for Home Affairs the normal number of 4 in and 8 out should not be considered normal, because 4 is too small to have as an inner Cabinet, and I would think that the larger number, shall we say 7 or 8, was small enough to be a Cabinet, leaving such other officers as may be necessary to be appointed by the Dáil to be free as, shall I say, Ministers on the fringe, who are not necessarily political appointments, and who <Col N="1278" /> need not be Members of the Dáil, but who should not be forced to resign if they are members of the Dáil.  If this motion is pressed to a division in its present form, stating that the Dáil approves as a general principle that these Ministers should not be members of the Dáil, I shall oppose it.  If that proviso is left out, and if the proposal would be accepted that the members of the Executive Council should be nominated by the Dáil, and individually responsible to the Dáil alone, and that the details may be considered, then I am prepared to support the motion with that particular change.</P>

It is impossible for one to retain the significance of each sentence by just hearing it here.  It is a motion of a rather serious kind, because it commits us to the approval of the principles of this Bill.  Before we do that, I think we ought to have a fixed time to sit down and think out the implications of these things.

      <P>Exactly, but you must not lose sight of the fact that this motion is not merely facilitating procedure, but that it is also committing the Assembly to the very principle that <Col N="1280" /> is embodied in the Article.  It is a motion having these implications, and it has only been handed to me now, and I presume a good many members have not seen it yet.  It is unfair to this Assembly for the Ministry to entertain the idea of getting a vote to-night, and I, for one, will protest strongly against it.  I think it would be most unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not facilitating anything, but obfuscating a great deal on what is at present proposed, because there is more than one principle in this thing.  There is not merely the principle of allowing the appointment to Ministries of men who have not been returned to this Dáil, or to the other Dáil, who have, in fact, not stood before the electorate at all.  Now, that is one doctrine, and we are asked to approve that.  There is another principle that if, by chance, A. B. has undergone election, and is selected by this Dáil to be a Minister, that he shall, <i>ipso facto</i>, vacate his seat, and a new election shall be held.  There is a third principle involved, namely, that there shall be an Inner Cabinet of a certain number; in other words, a minor Ministry and a major Ministry.  There is a still further principle, namely, that the major Ministers are to be appointed by the President of the Dáil, and the minor Ministers by the vote of the Dáil.  All these things are implied in the scheme, and it is quite possible to approve of one of them and disapprove of two or more of the others, and it seems to me the discussion is being burked upon what is more important.  I have no objection to the selection of those&mdash;if I may use the term&mdash;shy birds so eminently marked out for office, who are yet unwilling to submit themselves to the choice of the people.  I have no objection to a President of the Dáil or the Dáil, with almost supernatural vision distinguishing these from the crowd and appointing them as Ministers.  I have no objection to that, but I retain doubts as to whether or not it can be done successfully.  There is another question which, I think, requires a great deal more consideration than we are able to give it now, after all the discussions we have listened to and joined in.  Why, I asked of the Minister in the beginning, should it be necessary for an elected member to resign?</P>

      <P>I understand the insertion of certain words in the motion now before the Dáil does not make that imperative, and, further, when the Committee that it is proposed to appoint reports to the Dáil, it is provided that it will report during the Committee stage of this Bill, so that everything the Committee suggests&mdash;if the Committee is appointed&mdash;will come up for discussion before the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understood that, but I submit an important part of this proposal is not being left to the Committee.  Consequently, if we leave over the Article with a view to a subsequent debate on the report of the Committee, it is just conceivable we may lose sight of the thing which is more important than what the Committee has been dealing with.  The idea that this is a necessary part of the proposal is sprung upon the Dáil.  I wanted to point out the utter&mdash;I will not say the &ldquo;folly&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bedlamite&rdquo; character of the proposal&mdash;but the extreme novelty of it.  I believe in experience and precedent; precedent has been rightly declared to be embodied experience.  What precedent is there in support of this idea, that because A B has got the stamp of the electorate upon him, and has further received the additional <i>cachet</i> from this Dáil of being selected for Ministerial office, that he is to plunge his constituency into an election to replace him upon a different basis of election.  There are further implications of an arithmetical character that have been pointed out to me just now.  It is quite conceivable through the necessity of vacating offices and going through a fresh election that what was a majority before will be converted into a minority, and <i>ipso facto</i>, the very party to which the Ministers were appointed would go out of office, and you will have the whole confusion over again.  There is no history in support of this thing.  I challenge any Minister to show us a single country in which it has occurred.  I object to my country being made the <i>corpus vitae</i> for an experiment of the kind.</P>

      <P>It is quite true Deputy Thrift's proposal does raise the whole question of the principle of &ldquo;some in and some out.&rdquo;  I am opposed to the second part of Article 50 as it stands in the draft Constitution, but I can vote for Deputy Thrift's proposal. In passing, let me say those who want to discuss the principle of &ldquo;some in and some out&rdquo; had a considerable length of time during the past two or three weeks to think over the matter and balance one argument against the other, so that it is not a legitimate argument against this motion that the principle only comes before us now.  I, and other Members of the Dáil, are in this position, that we want individual responsibility to the Dáil on the part of Ministers.  I want, if it is possible, to get away from what is known as the collective responsibility of the Ministry on practically every proposal that comes before the Parliament. There are certain big and grave questions on which I think there would have to be collective responsibility, and that the whole Executive Council would have to stand or fall on.  There are others, the administrative acts and general fitness of a member of the Executive to fill his office properly, and on these I think there should be direct individual responsibility, and the Parliament should have the power to dispense with services or turn down a proposal of that kind.  I can vote for this proposal of Deputy Thrift in the form in which it is before the Dáil now.  If it is carried by a majority it will commit this Dáil to the principle that there may be in the Executive Council one or two, or maybe more, who are not Members of the Dáil, yet I am quite willing to go as far as that.  I am not willing to go as far as saying there shall, or may be, eight out of twelve who shall not be members of the Dáil.  I have much the same objection as Deputy Prof. Magennis to the Ministers coming in as Deputies and then having to resign and throw back their constituents into by-elections, in which they may lose the advantage they won at the General Election.  It is a novel proposal, but I do not think we should be afraid of novel proposals, and I do not think we should object to it merely because there is no precedent.  I hope we will do a good many things that there are no precedents for.  I think we have already done a number of things <Col N="1283" /> there are no precedents for.  I think it is worth while to make the experiment. I would leave the door open for the bringing in of a certain number who are not Members of the Dáil.  One of the reasons would be because you would get a man who would be most competent to fill a particular office and carry out its administration, but he might be turned down at an election, not because he was unfit for office, and not because of his political views or the policy of his Party, but because of some personal or local grievance or argument.  We have all to take our risks on that.  I support Deputy Thrift's proposal, though I do agree that those who are out-and-out objectors to the original proposal&mdash;those who say every member of the Executive Council must, and shall, be a Deputy&mdash; are bound, of course, to vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WM. SEARS Mr. WM. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Thrift's amendment.  As Deputy Milroy said, this is a departure from the policy in every other Parliament. Of course, there is substantial reason for that, for we have the new principle of Proportional Representation now introduced which implies the introduction of groups.  Therefore, it follows that we should not follow the system in other countries, where Proportional Representation does not exist and where the Party system prevails.  I agree with Deputy Johnson, with regard to the number of Ministers that should be nominated by the Dáil.  Certainly, it would be a very serious thing, if the eight non-members, as part of the Executive, could outvote the responsible members.  That is a matter which may be settled in detail.  It is possible we might get excellent members for some Departments who would have no chance of election.  I would remind the Dáil of one instance.  There was in Wexford a well-known public man, now dead, Mr. M.A. Ennis, and he certainly would not be elected in any Rural District or County Council in that Division.  He was co-opted on the County Council and became Chairman of the County Council, and Chairman of the General Council of County Councils.  It was admitted there was no abler man on financial matters.  That is a case in point.  The great objection I see to that proposal is that if a man is in charge of a department, and if he is not bound <Col N="1284" /> to go out of the Ministry, he may become so popular that you could not stir him at all.  That is quite possible, and you have seen examples of it in Public Boards in Ireland.  I understand in the American Senate they have a rule under which they associate the Ministers' Departments with small Committees of the whole Dáil, whether elected on Proportional Representation or otherwise, I cannot say.  I think, if there was in connection with all these Ministers Committees of this Dáil elected on that principle, and associated with the Ministers, they would become responsible and you would take off the Cabinet a large amount of work.  Why should the Cabinet have to go into all these matters, agricultural, educational and others, of which a number of them would have no expert knowledge.  If a number of farmers were elected on the Committee of Agriculture, and Professors in the Dáil were elected to act in conjunction with the Minister for Education, you would subdivide the work of the Cabinet, and you would interest many of the members of this Dáil in the work of the country, and a larger number than at present, and I think it would be found to work satisfactorily. For that reason I support the amendment of Deputy Thrift.  I hope that when the Committee go into this matter, it will be amended and that it will come back to this Dáil again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister in charge of the Bill to let this matter rest till to-morrow, rather than give a decision on it to-night.  I do not think any harm can come by leaving it over for a short time, so that we may have an opportunity of thinking it out. It is clear there are points for and against the various proposals, and I do not think it would be a wise course to come to a decision on them hurriedly. If we adopt Professor Thrift's amendment, we would be committed to the principle.  It seems to me that a great many of the arguments used in favour of the appointment of Ministers who would not be members of the Dáil, would be met by the fact that there would be a Senate.  There is no reference to the Senate.  Surely, several of the men who would be nominated, in the way suggested, could be Members of the Senate.  I imagine that a number of these, who would, perhaps, be specialists, <Col N="1285" /> would not care for the turmoil of elections, and that sort of thing, and would be included in the Senate.  There are two very strong objections, to my mind, to the proposed form of Executive. One was referred to to-day, in the discussion on the power of declaration of war, and the other is the rather hateful idea of a Government within a Government, which would lead to endless intrigue and want of confidence all round and uncertainty in the Dáil, as to which of the two was really the Government; as to whether one Government was in agreement with the other, or at war with it.  I think that would be a very undesirable form of Government to have.  In any case, I quite agree that the Government should be of one mind, whatever Government we have, and that it should go with all its force in one direction, and let us know where they are going.  But if it is possible to have in a Government four or three out of five, there is a possibility that three men might be chosen from the Dáil, and it would be very hard to know what was the relation of these three to the others.  Then, again, there is this point of view, that enormous power has been put to-day in the hands of the Government, and the Executive that is to be; that Executive has been invested with practically the power of life and death over the Nation.  They have been given power to declare war.  If you are going to have a part of the Government, not elected by the people and who are a part of the Government who have power of declaration of war, I think that is taking a tremendous power away from the direct control of the people, and as democrats, I think this Dáil should not agree with it.</P>

Some Deputies have spoken about us in a way that is a surprise to ourselves. We had no idea that we were criminals and we did not think that the things written on the dead walls were true.  Some Deputies think they are true, and it has shaken our confidence in our goodness to find Deputy Milroy and Deputy Magennis inclined to that belief.  There is no springing and no rushing.

I think I have given him a hint already.  My considered judgment is this, and I assure him I have been thinking about this before I arrived here to-day.  What I was complaining about was not that discussion on Article 50 was rushed, but that this particular motion, which is committing us in the Dáil to the fundamental principle of that Article has been brought on without adequate notice. That is a fair comment to make, and I suggest it requires time to consider it. I would be prepared to agree, if this alteration were made, that this Dáil were not committed to approval of the general principles, and if it agrees to appoint a Committee of the Dáil to examine into it.  I do not see why this Dáil should be committed to it before this Committee reports what its considered judgment on the matter is.  I think it is reasonable that we should not bind ourselves before this Committee reports. It does not hold up the business of the Dáil, but it enables us, while this Committee of Constitutional Experts, who are providing internal association with other Ministers, sit, while they are weighing up this, to give attention to something which will have a very far-reaching effect upon the whole future administration of the country, and something we should not rush into until we have understood all the implications involved.

      <P>There was one point mentioned by Deputy Magennis that I think ought to be explained.  He complains that a man having been elected for a constituency, and having come here, and having got the additional imprimatur of being appointed a Minister, suffers some wrong by no longer remaining a member of the Dáil.  Let us take one Department, say Local Government, <Col N="1288" /> in which the Minister who was appointed was developing a scheme of amalgamation of Unions.  I think the Deputy has no experience of that kind of work.  Suppose the constituency he represents has several Unions.  Perhaps he does not know, and the members do not know, what power and responsibility and interest surround an institution of that sort in the country&mdash;the number of people employed, the number of contractors, the number of members of Boards of Guardians, and all the rest of them, each in his own constituency, up against such a scheme.  The Minister's position would be difficult, and he might be asked to walk the plank at the next election.  There is at least one Deputy here who knows what a disadvantage it is to arrive at a position of that sort.  The same thing would apply to several other Departments of the Government, and it is to give a Minister doing strictly internal work, to give him a position in which he is absolutely independent of political preferment, and that he can give the best that is in him to the whole of the country, not having his eye on his own little bailiwick and seeking to placate those who would be affected by any legislation he would introduce.  As regards the second part, supposing he were a minority member, there is a disadvantage by reason of his being a minority member, because a majority member will go in for the seat he vacates.  He is not lost to the Chamber, but he has much more real power.  He has an opportunity of putting into practice all he stood for, and he really is exercising very much greater influence in the Dáil than the majority member who comes instead of him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Because there is an election for that seat, and there is another man elected to fill the vacant place.  The minority man, supposing he were such&mdash;and it is a stretch of the imagination to say that it must always be a minority man&mdash;that minority man gets an opportunity of putting what he stood for into practice, for in the ordinary way people think that it is only majority men would have the right to originate proposals.  Now, the second point; I do not personally <Col N="1289" /> agree with such a small Cabinet as four, but you are not bound to it.  There is an opportunity of bringing in three more.  Sometimes you get very good Ministers, but gabby ones. You know what a disadvantage it is across the table if you have one man always laying down the law.  Well, the next point is, that every single one of these Ministers is responsible to the Dáil, and can be removed by the Dáil.  But there is a certain procedure laid down for the removal of what you call extern Ministers, which, I think, is fair to them.  It will be observed, sir, when a Committee representative of the Dáil examines and finds that he is guilty of certain sins against the Dáil, he is reported and excluded.  But supposing, for a moment, that a Minister had a very bitter tongue, and rendered himself personally obnoxious to members, and that his popularity was on the wane, that would not be sufficient reason to kick him out.  It should be that he was incompetent or guilty of malfeasance.  But he is under the control of the Dáil, and the Dáil really can dismiss him.  The other points in favour of the proposal mentioned by Deputy O'Shannon and Deputy Johnson are that there is continuity of policy.  In the English Parliament, as at present constituted, legislation may be three-fourths through in certain matters.  A snatch vote comes, and the Government goes out.  You do not take up that legislation afterwards, as would be done here.  The President is kicked out; the Ministers responsible for internal administration carry on, and that is what we are more concerned with than with political preferment or who is in the inner Cabinet then because irrespective of the political disruption that takes place, the internal administration goes on.  Another point that is important is that you give the Members of the Dáil an opportunity of exercising their free vote on this matter&mdash;a very desirable thing, as gentlemen from the benches opposite and gentlemen from the benches on the left, gentlemen from the Universities all voting together against the political party; and the sooner we get away from political elements in this country the better.  We know what they mean, and they mean that certain people in the country have, let us say, very pronounced capitalistic leanings. Let us say, some very large farmer of <Col N="1290" /> 1,000 acres or so, the moment he will see a Labour candidate going along the road he would have him arrested.  The same thing happens with the Labour candidate when he sees a big farmer going along the road.  We want to get away from that, and get these men to put their shoulders to the wheel for the nation, and get away from the line that a Sinn Feiner of twenty-five years' standing takes up when he sees a much younger member of that Order, or perhaps sees an ex-member of the British Army going along, when people who have no war records come up against those who have very brilliant war records, and all that sort of thing.  We ought, if possible, exclude from our minds the acute differences that have arisen within the last twenty or thirty years.  There is one weakness in regard to this&mdash;and I expected a very big barrage from Deputy Figgis, but it did not come off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is only one weakness, and that is, when a Minister with a seat who has had to resign loses his Ministerial post a very strong critic is lost to the Dáil.  I think if he loses his post the Dáil could do without him.  That is my impression.</P>
