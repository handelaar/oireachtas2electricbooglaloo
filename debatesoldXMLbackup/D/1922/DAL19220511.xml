      <NameTxt>MR. SEUMAS O'DWYER:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to read, and the Committee has agreed to the course, the Report which you have in your hands from the Pro-Treaty side of the Committee.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Dwyer then read the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10th May, 1922.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We desire to report that the Committee set up under the terms of Dr. Hayes' motion at the Session of An Dáil on Wednesday, May 3rd, has held in all eleven sessions.  At the first session we arranged a meeting of the Army Officers of both sides with a view to an immediate cessation of hostilities and subsequent Truce.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the first full meeting of the Committee the Anti-Treaty Party refused to accept the document signed by the following signatories as the basis for our discussions:&mdash;Dan Breen, Tom Hales, H. Murphy, S. O'Hegarty, Seán Moylan, R.J. Mulcahy, Eoin O'Duffy, Gearoid O'Sullivan, Michael O Coileain, F. O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We pointed out that while we understood that we were not confined to the examination of the solutions outlined in that document, we had been brought together as a result of these Officers' intervention and of Deputy Hayes' motion based on that intervention.  We were unable to reach agreement on this matter and after putting in from our side several alternatives, we put in as our final basis for an agreed Election the following Documents:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1a.  Mindful of our obligations to the Irish nation and recognising that our common ideal is the good of Ireland, it is realised that the most pressing necessity at the present moment is unity of the forces that have worked together for the past six years.  We realise further that practically the whole country has the strong feeling that peace and order must be restored and preserved, and that means must be found for looking after the urgent social and economic needs of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2a.  We are of opinion that the minority in Dáil Éireann can agree to our recommendations without <Col N="399" /> sacrifice of principle, without prejudice to what they consider the best future interests of the nation, and without departing from their ideals.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our recommendations to the Dáil are:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  Recognising also that it is a fundamental duty of Government to make available for the people the advantages gained by the War for Independence, and that the people so desire, and accepting the fact that Dáil Éireann has by a majority approved of the Treaty which is the vehicle of these advantages, and accepting also the position created in the country by this approval, we are of opinion that a contested election now might be attended by civil strife which might result in a dissipation of these advantages and the worsening of our national position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accepting this and desirous of avoiding such a conflict in the best interests of the nation, we recommend:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)  An agreed Election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)  A Coalition Government after the election which will have the confidence of the whole country.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  At an earlier session we had put in our idea that an agreed election could be arranged as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>)  That in each existing constituency under P.R. the pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty parties would nominate one additional candidate. Such candidate would go before the electorate without public speeches, without public meetings, and the elections would be carried out on one day throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In constituencies where vacancies have arisen or may arise from whatever cause, the party to which the retired member belonged in January, 1922, shall have the right to nominate the person to fill the vacant place on the Panel.  No candidate to be allowed to appear on more than one Panel.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Election a Government having the confidence of the whole country would be formed.  We think it possible that such a Government might be chosen on non-Party lines, or at least that it might follow not very rigid Party lines.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had definitely stated that in our opinion agreement having been reached on the political side, that army unification could best be accomplished by the officers who are meeting at the present time representing the Dáil forces under G.H.Q., Beggars' Bush and the forces under the Four Courts command.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Their numbers could have been increased if it were thought necessary by the addition of officers from each side, those officers to report direct to the Dáil on this separate subject.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is necessary that the Dáil should be clear as to how this final document came before us.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Early in the afternoon session of Tuesday, 9th May, it was evident that we had reached a stage where a break was inevitable, and before breaking Deputy O Maille proposed that we invite the five southern officers who had waited on Dáil at Wednesday's Session, so that we might put them in possession of exactly where the difficulties lay and invite their assistance to find a solution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was agreed to call these officers in, and the officers having heard both sides, Deputy McKeon proposed that the Committee adjourn for an hour or an hour and a half to give the officers before us an opportunity of considering the position. We agreed on this course and the Session was adjourned until 8 p.m. with that object.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Immediately on resumption Comdt. Seán Hegarty, while pointing out that they had no desire to withdraw an inch from the position which they took up in their published statement, stated they had drafted this Clause 1 as an alternative to the Clause which was before the Committee at the moment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He expressed on behalf of the Delegation a desire to simply place this formula before the Committee, and without taking part in any discussion to recommend it to us for adoption.  The Delegation of Officers then withdrew.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The two sides of the Committee immediately separated to consider this draft as an alternative to our proposal (That is the pro-Treaty proposal) contained in Clause 1 of the Document which we had handed in at the Session held on the evening of Monday.  [Appendix A].</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We came back again, and Deputy Boland asked us if we were prepared to put in this new draft as our proposal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy O'Dwyer pointed out that as far as he was personally concerned he <Col N="400" /> was not at all satisfied that it covered his position.  Deputy Boland stressed the fact that since this document was not the work of any of either side of the Committee but of an outside body, it could not properly come up for consideration unless either side adopted it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order to put this document in order for the Committee, without arguing on Deputy Boland's assertion, Deputy McKeon accepted the responsibility of putting it in himself.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was agreed by both sides that we should again separate until 11 o'clock that night, Deputy McKeon undertaking on his side to endeavour to get this new clause accepted by the other four as an alternative to the proposals which we had already put in.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Boland speaking for the other side of the Committee undertook to let us know at 11 o'clock whether they were prepared on their side to accept it as a basis for an agreed Election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the resumption at 11 o'clock Deputy McKeon put forward the Officers' Clause as our alternative, on which we were prepared to discuss this scheme for an agreed Election and a Coalition Government after the Election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was quite evident that the anti-Treaty Party were not prepared to agree to this as a basis.  Deputy Moylan was not present.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Boland invited us on our side to immediately tackle the question of a scheme for an agreed Election and he pointed out that a certain advance had been made, asserting that we had on our side turned Clause 1 from &ldquo;an article of Faith&rdquo; to a &ldquo;preamble.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy O'Dwyer immediately stated that as far as we were concerned on our side that this Clause was the basis on which we could consider a scheme for an agreed Election contested or uncontested, and that if the other side were not prepared to accept it as such that we could not discuss the scheme for an agreed election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On this statement the Conference broke down.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Mr. O'Dwyer then read the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;APPENDIX A.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)  We recommend that the Third Dáil be formed on the following basis:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)  Acceptance of the fact that the Treaty has been approved by the majority of Dáil Éireann, and, in the circumstances is accepted by a majority of the people.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Clause (<i>b</i>) was subsequently altered by us to:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recognising the fact that the Treaty having been approved by a majority of Dáil Éireann, would, in the circumstances, be accepted by a majority of the people if put as an issue at a contested election, and desiring to evade such a contest and its attendant conflicts we recommend that an agreed election without contests be held and a Coalition Government be formed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(Report and Appendix were handed in).</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to read Appendix B for that is Deputy Boland's draft.  I wish to say that the Committee has agreed that I should propose and the other side of the Committee will second the proposition at the right time &mdash;that the Dáil adjourns now without discussion of the Reports until next Wednesday.  We have agreed to meet in the meantime with the hope of finding a solution.  We have also agreed to ask the Speaker to hand both Reports as coming from the Dáil and to secure for them equal publicity as far as he can.</P>

    </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="&ldquo;REPORT OF THE" RHead="REPUBLICAN DELEGATION">
    <Title>&ldquo;REPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN DELEGATION.</Title>
    <P>&ldquo;We the representatives of the Republican Party on the Committee appointed by An Dáil having failed to obtain any basis of agreement with the representatives of the other Party, beg to submit this supplement to the joint report.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the first meeting after the truce was arranged, Deputy Boland on his own behalf handed in the following proposals as a rough basis of discussion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following principles be accepted, as suggested by Labour, and passed by resolution in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1 (<i>a</i>)  That all legislative executive and judicial authority in Ireland is, and shall be, derived solely from the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)  That Dáil Éireann is the supreme governing authority in Ireland.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  Taking cognisance of the dangers that beset our country, we recommend that Dáil Éireann decree that the forthcoming elections declared by England be not contested, but that the present personnel constitute the Third Dáil (except that the Deputies representing two constituencies vacate their seats in Clare, Cavan, Cork, and the National University, these vacancies being filled by arrangement) and that it be accepted and understood that no issue is being determined by the election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.  That pending the adoption of a Constitution for the nation the Constitution of Dáil Éireann be revised so as to provide for a President and Council of State as sole Executive, the composition, personnel, duties, functions, etc., to be arranged by agreement between both sides.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.  That the Provisional Government is to act solely as a taking over or Transfer Commission, and to cease all executive functions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;5.  That to unify the Army, the Army Convention to be held as soon as may be, the Convention to consist of the delegates chosen for the banned (recent proposed) Convention and those only.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  That this Convention elect a representative on the Council of State who shall be Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7.  That it elect also an Army Council which shall be in administrative control of the army and responsible for nominations, appointments, commissions, etc.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After some discussion 1 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the above proposals were unanimously agreed to, except that the words &lsquo;as suggested by Labour&rsquo; had to be deleted to meet the other side.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On coming to discussion of 2, the other side asked for an adjournment so as to prepare counter-proposals.  On resumption, these counter-proposals were submitted by Deputy O'Dwyer on behalf of his group.  We could not agree to these as agreement would definitely commit us to acceptance of the Treaty.  A deadlock was accordingly reached, and at this stage Deputy O Maille suggested that Commandants O'Hegarty, Hales, O'Donoghue, Breen, and Murphy be invited to attend.  These Officers were immediately available, and as a result of further parley, Commandant McKeon submitted the following alternative proposals:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recognising that it is a fundamental duty of Government to make available for the people the advantages gained by the War for Independence, and that the people so desire it, and accepting the fact that Dáil Éireann has by a majority approved of the Treaty, which is the vehicle of these advantages, and accepting also the position created in the country by this approval, we are of opinion that a contested election now would be attended by civil strife which would result in a dissipation of these advantages and a worsening of our national position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accepting this and desirous of avoiding such a conflict in the best interests of the nation, we recommend</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)  An agreed Election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)  A Coalition Government which will have the confidence of the whole country.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having suggested the deletion of certain portions of the above which were the expression of the pro-Treaty point of <Col N="402" /> view and absolutely opposed to our position, Deputy Boland further suggested that Commandant McKeon would secure the assent of his colleagues and place before the Committee proposals as from his whole Party.  This was agreed to, and the delegations adjourned to consult their respective Headquarters.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On resumption, Deputy McKeon handed in the following on behalf of his Party:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mindful of our obligations to the Irish nation and recognising that our common ideal is the good of Ireland, it is realised that the most pressing necessity at the present moment is unity of the forces that have worked together for the past six years; we realise further that practically the whole country has the strong feeling that peace and order must be restored and preserved and that means must be found for looking after the urgent social and economic needs of the nation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recognising also that it is a fundamental duty of Government to make available for the people the advantages gained by the War for Independence and that the people so desire it, and accepting the fact that Dáil Éireann has by a majority approved of the Treaty which is the vehicle of these advantages, and accepting also the position created in the country by this approval, we are of opinion that a contested election might be attended by civil strife which might result in a dissipation of these advantages and a worsening of our national position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accepting this and desirous of avoiding such a conflict in the best interests of the nation, we recommend:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  An agreed Election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  A Coalition Government after the election which will have the confidence of the whole country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In representing these proposals, Commandant McKeon stated that, in his opinion, there would be little difficulty in matters of detail for a settlement if an unanimous consent were given to the preamble as a basis.  We again objected to the portion of this preamble which was inconsistent with our position, and suggested that we leave for the moment the preamble without prejudice and get down to the details of the settlement which were, after all, the essential and vital concern of the Committee.</P>
    <P>This the other side would not agree to, and insisted that the preamble should be accepted by us, without alteration, as a preliminary to any further discussion. At this point, regretfully we came to the conclusion that it was useless for the Committee to continue its labours, our opinion being that the other side were more concerned with committing us to an acceptance of the Treaty than with working out a detailed scheme of settlement.</P>

    <P>APPENDIX B</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(7)  That it elect also an Army Council which shall be in adminstrative control of the Army and responsible for nominations, appointments, commissions, etc.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Clauses 1 (a) and (b) were unanimously accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Eoin MacNeill">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask if there is any official report on behalf of the Delegation of Officers.</P>
      <P>COMMANDANT SEAN O'HEGARTY (who was present with the Delegation of Officers) said: This is merely a report of incidents, and it is only tending to show how we approached the problem that was put before us.  The following is the report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We, the undersigned five officers, who had signed the statement appearing in the Press on May 2, were summoned to a meeting of the Dáil Committee of ten at the Mansion House about 5 p.m. on May 9. The situation, we were then informed, was: Both groups had submitted proposals and of those the following points submitted by the Anti-Treaty side had been accepted by others, viz.&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)  That all legislative, executive, and judicial authority in Ireland is, and shall be, derived solely from Irish people; (<i>b</i>) that Dáil Éireann is the supreme governing authority in Ireland.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the other hand the Pro-Treaty group had submitted the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recognising the fact that the Treaty, having been approved by a majority of Dáil Éireann, would in the circumstances, be accepted by a majority of the people, if put as an issue at a contested election, and desiring to evade such a contest and its conflicts we recommend that an agreed election without contests be held and a Coalition Government be formed.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Anti-Treaty group would not accept this proposal as it stood, and demanded the omission of the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;The Treaty ... would in the circumstances be accepted by a majority of the people if put as an issue at a contested election.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>The Anti-Treaty point of view, as expressed by Mr. Boland was that while desirous of availing to the full of the advantages of the Treaty, they were not prepared to agree to a settlement which, in their opinion, committed the people to the acceptance of the Treaty as a settlement.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Pro-Treaty point of view, as proposed by Mr. O'Dwyer, was that they were not justified in taking any risk which might jeopardise the Treaty and lose its advantages which omission of the words objected to might do, and that the people should get some reason for disfranchisement, which an agreed election would entail.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We were asked to find a formula of words which would reconcile both views.  We realised, and so stated, that what was needed was five lawyers, but that we were doing our best.  We remained at the Mansion House, and at 8 p.m. submitted the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recognising that it is a fundamental duty of Government to make available for the people the advantages gained by the war for independence, and that the people so desired it, and accepting the fact that Dáil Éireann has by a majority approved of the Treaty, which is the vehicle of those advantages and accepting also the position created in the country by this approval, we are of opinion that a contested election now would be attended by civil strife, which would result in the dissipation of those advantages and the worsening of our national position. Accepting this, and desirous of avoiding such a conflict, in the best interests of the nation we recommend as above.'</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This was submitted as an honest attempt to reconcile the two points of view and make a basis for agreement.  In this formula of <Col N="404" /> words we believe that all fair minded people will realise that we have adjusted, as far as can be done, the two positions.&mdash;Signed, Dan Breen, Tom Hales, H. Murphy, F. O'Donoghue, Seán O'Hegarty.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryBoland" hpid="MR. BOLAND MR. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>MR. BOLAND:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if it was agreed that a separate report be handed in from the group of officers. We on this side of the House had no idea that the group of officers attending here were going to submit a report.  At the third meeting of our Committee we found it necessary to issue a statement to the Press clearly defining our position and our terms of reference, it being clearly understood that the document submitted originally to this House, and signed by this group of officers had not the consent of this side of the House. Had we understood that those were the terms of reference that Committee, so far as this side of the House is concerned, would never have met.  We called in these officers when we found that a crux had arisen, hoping that by their intervention we might compose our differences. I took particular pains to point out to the men of the Pro-Treaty side that we could not entertain these proposals in Committee until such time as they came from one of the members of the Dáil Committee.  If ever we do get down to deal with the position, we hope to have official representatives from each side.  I had no idea the third report would be handed in, and I am sure Mr. O'Dwyer had no knowledge of it.</P>

      <P>The answer to both questions is in the affirmative.  The following incidents occurred since the truce, i.e., that is since the 4th May, 1922, 1a.&mdash;Late on the afternoon of the 4th inst. warning notices, headed &ldquo;Oglaigh na hÉireann&rdquo; were handed to several newsagents in Dublin ordering them not to purchase or sell any copies of the <i>Freeman's Journal.</i>  2a.&mdash;On the 5th inst. a delivery van belonging to Messrs.  Eason was held up on the Drumcondra Road, and all copies of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> were removed from the van and burned in Fitzroy Avenue. (<i>b</i>) Copies of the paper were removed from the train at Limerick Junction and burned.  (<i>c</i>) Copies of the <i>Freeman</i> were removed from the train at Castlebar and burned.  (<i>d</i>) Other warning notices were delivered to individual newsagents during the course of this day.  The notices were delivered up to 10.30 p.m. that night.  3 (<i>a</i>)&mdash;On the 8th inst. papers were again burned at Limerick Junction. (<i>b</i>) The proprietors received a telegram which read &ldquo;Stop sending papers. <Col N="405" /> Raided here.&rdquo;  It is signed &ldquo;Mulranny.&rdquo; (<i>c</i>) And another which read, &ldquo;Stop <i>Freeman</i>; burned again.&rdquo;  Signed, &ldquo;Colbinstown.&rdquo;  (<i>d</i>) A notice was served on the newsagents in the Fethard area, signed &ldquo;Delahunty, Adjutant,&rdquo; as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I.R.A. Barracks,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fethard,</P>
      <P>5/5/22.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The <i>Freeman's Journal</i> will not be allowed into this battalion area.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Newsagents are hereby warned that if they persist in selling the same they will be severely dealt with.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  All Standing Orders for this paper should be cancelled at once.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By Orders, Chief of Staff,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;G.H.Q.,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;J. Delahunty, Adjt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>4 (<i>a</i>).&mdash;On the 9th inst. papers were burned at Limerick Junction, Colbinstown, Clonmel, and Baltinglass.  (<i>b</i>) Newsagents in Clifden and Dungarvan wrote requesting the proprietors to discontinue the supply of the <i>Freeman</i> and <i>Weekly Freeman</i> as they were prohibited from taking delivery.  5.&mdash;Yesterday, the 10th inst. papers were again removed from the train at Limerick Jnction and burned.  In addition to the typewritten notices referred to above verbal threats have been made to Dublin newsagents that if they buy, sell, or assist in the sale of the <i>Freeman</i> their premises will be burned.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To whom does the Minister for Finance expect to refund the £3,050 mentioned in his note of the 28th ultimo?  By whose authority was this money paid?  Has the official auditor visited London yet, if so, has he examined into the £1,000 as the Minister said he would, and with what result?  By whose authority was that £1,000 paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. MICHAEL COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>This money has now been refunded to Dáil General Funds and will appear in the next statement of accounts presented to this House.  The money was paid on the authority of Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff.  It was reported to the Cabinet at the very first opportunity. With regard to the second part of the question the official auditor visited London on 3rd May.  His report on the accounts, 1st January to 31st March, 1922, is before the Dáil Cabinet at the present moment.  The accounts for the half year ending 31st December, 1921, were withheld for audit and the Finance Department is in communication with Mr. Art O'Brien on the matter.  This money was paid by the authority of President Griffith and myself, and reported to the Dáil Cabinet at the first possible meeting.</P>

      <P>I desire to move that the Dáil adjourns without discussing the reports from the Committee set up under Dr. Hayes' motion until Wednesday next, and I desire at the same time to say to the Dáil that we have agreed to meet in the meantime in the hope of finding a solution, and further, to ask you, Sir, to see that both reports are handed to the Press as coming from An Dáil, as they undoubtedly are, and to secure in that way equal publicity.  I desire to move the adjournment.</P>

      <P>Might I not ask if it would not be possible to meet on Saturday, or at the very latest on Monday, instead of adjourning until Wednesday.  If the Joint Committee is to meet again to-morrow they can make up their minds between this and to-morrow whether they can or cannot agree.  We can meet on Saturday for the necessary business, and that would leave us until next Wednesday to attend to our much neglected private business. I am sure I am only one of many who have to neglect our private concerns. It seems unnecessary to take us away in the middle of every week.  Later, say in the week-end, it would not matter so much.  Any teacher would know what it would mean to a class to have one teacher on one day and another teacher on another day.  In order that that should not happen I have had to get somebody in my place for the last two weeks.  In stating my own position I am stating the position of the majority of the members <Col N="406" /> of the Dáil.  It would suit them if the Dáil could meet on Saturday, if possible, and I move as an amendment that it does meet on Saturday.</P>

      <P>There was a truce on last July and it led to a compromise. Are we going to have another one? Every man sitting here will be accused of taking part in a compromise.

      <P>The Committee was appointed last week in the hope that some solution or agreement between both parties could be arranged.  There does not seem to be any way by which it can be done.  I saw here at a meeting of the Dublin Corporation how some members of this House openly flouted the authority of the Dáil.  If we wait another week it seems to me there will be no agreement at all.  I think the sooner we face the issue the better and have no humbug about it.  I would not object to an adjournment for a month if any good were to come of it, but in every move that is made for peace an obstacle is placed by the other side.  If these ten people come together and have an agreement I will not object but I do not want to be coming here to be making a fool of myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryBoland" hpid="MR. BOLAND MR. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>MR. BOLAND:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious to take every opportunity to find a basis of agreement.  We who have been on this Committee have had 13 sessions, and we are satisfied we have reached a point where a definite answer must be given.  Now I think it would be criminal if there is an opportunity to compose our differences if we were not prepared to wait and give another opportunity to this Committee.  I do not see any reason myself why we could not find a basis within one hour after we meet on Saturday.  So far as we are concerned that is our position.  If there is any possibility of restoring harmony and unity to this country it is our duty to pursue it.  I agree with the proposal made by Deputy O'Dwyer and I second it.</P>
