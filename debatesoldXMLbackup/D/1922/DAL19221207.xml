      <P>To ask the President if his attention has been drawn to a Resolution recently passed by the Institute of Architects of Ireland, putting on record its conviction that the partially destroyed public buildings of Dublin, such as the Custom House and the Four Courts, should be most carefully preserved and, as far as possible, restored to their former condition, and that, in the meantime, all necessary steps should be taken to protect the walls and structure generally from injury by weather or otherwise, until restoration is possible?  And to ask, further, what measures are being taken to attend to these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Resolution in question has been brought to my notice. The necessity of the preservation from weather of the remains of the Custom House, the Four Courts, and the Post Office, has not been lost sight of by the Government.  Inspections have been made by the Board of Works from time to time, and it has been definitely ascertained that no appreciable injury has so far occurred from the effects of the weather to those parts of the ruined structures which there is a reasonable possibility of preserving.  The question of reconstructing the buildings in whole or in part is a very large question which is receiving the careful consideration of the Government.</P>

      <P>Payments amounting to £60,594 3s. 3d. have been made by the Ministry of Finance to the Tipperary S.R. Co. Council in respect of Local Taxation Grants for financial years 1920-21 and 1921-22 which were withheld by the British Government.  The Estate Duty Grant and one moiety of the Agricultural Grant in respect of 1921-22 have so far been retained in the Guarantee Fund in connection with a charge under the Land Purchase Acts.  As regards the Grant in respect of Approved Scheme for Relief of Unemployment payments amounting to £11,000, the sum allocated to the Co.

      <P>To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the serious inconvenience and loss caused by the continued stoppage of the Railway service between Dundalk and Greenore, owing to a damaged bridge.  If he will take the matter up with the Railway Company with the view of opening the line for traffic.  If he can state whether it is a fact that passengers and goods are carried from Bellurgan to Newry at the same rate as from Greenore to Newry to the detriment of Dundalk, the natural market for the district, and if it is intended to continue this preferential treatment, and if he can say if that was the reason for interfering with the bridge.</P>

      <P>The Ballymascanlon Viaduct on the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway between Dundalk and Greenore was blown up some time ago.  It was repaired by the Company and again blown up within ten days of its being repaired.  Up to the present the Company did not consider it prudent to further repair the Viaduct, but they are now investigating the possibility of doing so.  The Dundalk Chamber of Commerce is approaching the local Military Authorities with the object of securing protection for the Viaduct.</P>
      <P>The Company deny that passengers and goods are conveyed from Bellurgan to Newry at the same fares and rates as from Greenore to Newry, and consequently this could not have been the reason for the dámage to the Viaduct. I have learned since I came to the Dáil that the Engineer has been instructed to proceed with temporary repairs immediately.  I have just got that information from the Company.</P>
