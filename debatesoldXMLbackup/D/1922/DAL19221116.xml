      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that Michael Loftus, William Hans, Patrick Colleran, James Burke, and Timothy M'Hugh, all of Tuam, have recently been arrested by the National troops; whether it is true, as stated in the local Press, that these men, or most of them, had, in response to the invitation of the Government, and on the advice of the Bishops, severed their connection with the forces acting against the Government; is he aware that the arrest of these men in the circumstances has caused much surprise in the district; and will he say why they have been arrested.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that very great distress exists in Arran Islands because of the failure of the fishing industry; whether this failure is not largely due to the activity of British and Scottish steam trawlers in encroaching on the fishing grounds; what action the Departmen has taken to prevent illegal trawling in this area; and whether he considers that one patrol steamer is sufficient to protect the fisheries all round the Irish coast; whether it is proposed to increase the measure of protection now available by providing a sufficient number of patrol boats and by increasing the limit within which trawling is prohibited from three to at least six miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins),</NameTxt>
      <P>replying for Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;I am aware that during the past two years there has been a universal slump in the fishing industry, which has adversely affected the people of Arran in common with other communities of Irish fishermen.  I am taking steps to deal with any present encroachment by steam trawlers, and am arranging to supply the Deputy with written particulars of the measures which are being taken.  I may say that within the past twelve months there have been three successful prosecutions in this area for contraventions of the trawling regulations. I think the Deputy is confusing the three mile limit, which is an international arrangement, with the limits defined by the Fishery By-laws.  As a matter of fact, the by-law limit which applies in this particular case extends, in parts, to more than two miles beyond the said three mile limit.</P>

      <P>The only land held by the Congested Districts Board in Arran is the Killeaney farm which they are arranging to sell to a committee of the Islanders, with a view to providing grazing for the live stock of those householders who have little or no land.  This is the best method of utilising the farm, in view of the large number of uneconomic holdings on the island.  In the matter of the relief of congestion the population of Arran has to be treated exceptionally, as it must be dealt with as a fishing rather than as an agricultural community.  Pending the sale of the lands to the committee, stock is being taken on for grazing, and some small portions are let for tillage to labourers living adjacent to the farm.</P>

      <P>As I said yesterday, the Resolution will be that the Dáil, sitting in Committee, considers the Estimates for Universities and Colleges, and having passed a vote on account of £90,050 to the period to the 6th December, recommends that the full estimate of £110,800 for the financial year 1922-1923 be adopted in due course by Oireachtas.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the non-recurrent grants, it was represented to us that the particular sums voted were insufficient by reason of the increased cost of living, and they were increased by particular non-recurrent amounts that were voted for the year 1921-22.  This sum, which is now put up, is less than that by reason of the decrease in the cost of living.  It is in a sense an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, and it was estimated in connection with the various other commitments of the Government.  There is really no great balance with which we can play with, and this expenditure ought to be considered in relation to the general financial ability of the Government to meet all their claims.</P>

      <P>I hope that Deputy O'Connell's remarks were really made with the idea of drawing attention to the smallness of the grants rather <Col N="2123" /> than the reverse.  I think probably that was his intention.  I want to make a comment on the footnote appended to this Estimate, where, no doubt, Deputies have observed that the years referred to appear to be different.  I daresay it also has been said, and rightly said, that these estimates are for the current financial year, and this is only a term of explanation. No doubt that is true.  I want to make it quite clear, so that the point may not be raised against me later, that the grant given under the University Grants Committee to Trinity College&mdash;and here I speak entirely for my own University&mdash; that that grant was explicitly given as a grant for a particular financial year. We received grants of £12,000 a year for three different financial years from the University Grants Committee&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 1919-20, 1920-21, and 1921-22.  After the Treaty, owing to the necessity of the time, the Government, and I am grateful to them for it, realised the urgency there was for continuing these grants until matters could be put upon a proper and permanent basis, and pending arrival at that desirable stage they agreed to give this grant of £6,000 as part of what had been given in the previous year to carry us on over our present difficulty.  Now, I fully agree to what the President said as to the need for economy.  Perhaps it is due to my name that I should urge it as strongly as anybody, but I want to draw a sharp line between the different kinds of expenditure. There is productive and unproductive expenditure, and I hope the Government will not take up the position that cutting down expenditure on education is a good way to begin the cutting down process.  Expenditure upon education is probably the most likely expenditure to be productive, not merely ultimately, but at an early date.  I hope we shall not fall into the mistake that has been made in other countries of attempt ing to curtail expenditure by starving education.  Now, I ask the indulgence of the Dáil while I make a statement, because this is surely the time when it is necessary to discuss whether such a grant as this can be regarded as an adequate grant for the year, and it may be said later if I refrain now, &ldquo;You should have raised this point sooner.&rdquo; This is the financial estimate for the year 1922-23, and I think it necessary for members of the Dáil as well as the Government to be aware how the position <Col N="2124" /> stands with regard to the Universities. In the year 1919 Universities with more or less fixed incomes were faced with enormous increases in maintenance costs.  It was agreed that salaries were inadequate, and as in many cases indeed they were.  They were not able to call upon the State for bonuses for their staff.  Bonuses were given and given broadcast in many departments of the State, but the officials of the Universities could receive no such bonuses unless State aid was guaranteed.  The Universities Committee recognised it, and made this plan regarding grants to enable Universities to tide over the difficulties. With reference to Trinity College a Commission of inquiry was appointed and their report was favourable.  As a result they recommended to the British Government that the grant should be £49,000 a year, and in response to that recommendation in the 1920 Act, there was a grant guaranteed to Trinity College of £30,000 a year.  That grant was in addition to the capital sum also recommended by the Committee, which also did not materialise.  Nevertheless, on the strength of that Act the College felt itself in a position to act immediately with reference to its employees, increasing wages, and, in many cases also, increasing salaries.  To give one example: The salary attached to the Chair of Irish was doubled on the strength of that grant, Now, when the Government of Ireland Act did not operate, and when negotiations began to take place in London on quite a different basis, it was represented to the British Government that these promises made to the University should be maintained in the Treaty established between the two countries, and although that was not done, an assurance was given by Mr. Griffith that the guarantees in the 1920 Act in reference to University finance and independence would lead to no difficulties with the new Irish Government. It was true that when the Treaty came to operate there was no reference to this matter, and the Prime Minister in England could only state that it would be necessary for Trinity College to rely on the goodwill of the Irish people.  I am perfectly content to rely on the goodwill of the Irish people.  I think this Dáil has already given evidence of that goodwill, and has shown that the Irish people appreciate the good work universities are doing, but, at the same time, I want the <Col N="2125" /> people and the Dáil to realise exactly what the change has meant to the universities. Instead of given guarantees of definite sums to the universities &mdash;take, for instance, my own college &mdash;instead of being guaranteed £30,000 a year, it is now in the position of having no guarantee at all.  The result of the 1920 Act was that the grants from the Committee immediately dried up, and it was with the greatest difficulty, when the 1920 Act failed to operate, that the grant for the next year, 1921-22, was continued.  I make a further point. Now, if those grants were necessary at that time, how much more necessary are they to-day?  With reference to our University&mdash;a considerable part of its funds is derived from landed property and old endowments.  The result of the last year has been that the revenues of Trinity College have been depleted to a very large extent.  Roughly speaking, we can say it received less in revenue by £10,000, and that falling-off in revenue means that against £22,000 we have only to set this £6,000, for which, nevertheless, we are very grateful to the Government and the Dáil.  But I urge that it is not sufficient, and that we shall not be able to carry on our work and maintain it at its former efficiency unless we get some further support than this £6,000.  I have two points, one general &mdash;one of the increased cost of maintenance of the various Universities&mdash;and the second that we have the claim that much of our revenue comes from the rents due to us from landed property, which revenue has fallen this year owing to the state of the country.  Perhaps I have said enough to make it quite clear that, while I recognise the Government has done all that it can do at present, I hope they will feel that this grant made now will not preclude them from making a supplementary grant when we see how we stand at the latter part of the financial year.</P>

      <P>I hope I can soften the heart of Deputy McCarthy.  I am as fond of games as he is.  My professional work makes me take an interest in all those old games, and hurling is probably the oldest game in civilisation; and though we have ceased playing it in Trinity for twenty years, we kept it going in Ireland when it was not played in any other college, and it is at the present moment being revived at Trinity College. My colleague, Deputy Thrift, who is Chairman of the College Athletic Union, has just passed to me this piece of paper; it is a letter asking for special facilities for ground for hurling purposes, and I am sure the Athletic Union will do their best to encourage and revive a game which has only been dropped for twenty years. When I entered college first I remember seeing plenty of camáns there, and I am sure we will turn out heroes fit to meet Deputy McCarthy's team in the future, and perhaps we soon will have a team.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Universities were hit by the war it became necessary that some assistance should be given to Universities.  A Committee on University Grants was set up in England, and certain annual and recurrent grants and certain non-recurrent grants were recommended.  Those are set out in the Estimate presented, and no recurrent grant has heretofore been made to Trinity College, and no provision has been made in this respect.  I have a sort of suspicion that some of those Universities may not possibly be run on the most efficient business basis; in fact, I think somebody has told me that at least one of them carried out its work with the idea that sooner or later the British Government would have to foot the bill.  While the Government are in harmonious relations with the rest of the country, it is not because people are high educationalists that we should allow them to plunder the public <Col N="2127" /> purse, and before any revision of grants to Universities is undertaken by the Government some sort of enquiry should be set up.  I cannot promise in the present state of our finances to recommend any expenditure or to reconsider the amounts we have set out.  The information regarding grants that were made, I am informed, for 1920-21 were intended to be final, except in the case of Trinity College, Dublin, and Professor Thrift is right when he said the Royal Commission had considered a rather generous scale of grants for Trinity.  But I cannot undertake any promise with regard to that.  I know there was special mention of the huge sum of £30,000 in the 1920 Act, but it is right to say that I am not very well versed in the statement made by the Professor with regard to the circumstances of an undertaking given by the late President.  The grant of £6,000 included in the present Estimate has been made with respect to the academic year 1922-23, and that is non-recurrent and strictly without prejudice as to future arrangements, as to which some further enquiry will be realised by the Dáil to be absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>Motion made and question put &ldquo;That the Dáil in Committee having considered the Estimates for Universities and Colleges in 1922-23, and having passed a Vote on Account of £90,050 for the period to the 6th December, 1922, recommend that the full Estimate of £110,800 for the Financial Year 1922-23 be adopted in due course by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The next estimate is the Old Age Pensions.  The sum is £3,326,900.  This is one of the largest votes, but no substantial reduction is possible, unless by alteration of the law, reducing the amount of the pension or increasing the age limit, and it is not intended by the Dáil to make any alteration in these, but in fact, it is possible that some savings might be affected if investigation was agreed to by the local Pension Officer and the local Committee. I have been, for a number of years, a member of these bodies.  I know the charitable view that is taken of these applications when they come along, and I have known cases of persons who had many years to run but who were passed by the Committee&mdash;at least one Deputy <Col N="2128" /> here can bear me out in that.  The rules for the payment of these pensions are well known and there is no necessity to refer to them now.  It ought to be remembered now that every case granted is out of the revenue of the country which is sorely needed for what Professor Thrift has wisely called constructive work, and that no claims or demands should or ought to be made on the Exchequer which cannot be morally sanctioned.  The procedure at present is that a claim is sent to the local postmaster, and he forwards it to the Pensions Officer.  The Officer of Customs and Excise has charge of that duty.  He investigates the cases and reports on them to the local Committee who decide. Either of these&mdash;that is the applicant or the Pensions Officer&mdash;can appeal from the decision of the local Committee. That is if the Pensions Officer is dissatisfied with regard to the granting of a pension to an individual, he can appeal; if on the other hand, the Committee will not allow the pension, the individual applicant can appeal, and that appeal comes before the Local Government Department.  The details of appropriations represent recoverable cash payments overpaid to pensioners.  I formally move the vote.</P>

      <P>I would just like to ask if the Minister can explain the decrease of £70,000.  Are we to take it from that, that the number of people coming under the pensionable age is declining, or rather, are we to take it that there is stricter supervision, or a hardening of the hearts of either the officials or the appeal court, or the Local Committees?  I may say, that I have had brought to my notice, rather more frequently of late than earlier, a number of complaints of applicants having been refused on the grounds of the difficulty of the proof of the year of birth.  At least the difficulty is increased. The evidence has passed by one means or another, burnings and such like, and that the only evidence they can rely on is the evidence of the oldest inhabitants, that is, local evidence of reputable people.  I would like to know whether there has been any increased stringency in that respect on the part of the Department.  Because it is well known to those having experience of the administration of the Pensions Act that in very many cases it is <Col N="2129" /> not possible to bring evidence of the Census papers or marriage certificates. And the sins of the young people are very often coming against the same people when they are old, by virtue of the fact that they put themselves down as much younger than they actually were when they were being married.  But there is evidence available of a fairly satisfactory kind in a locality where there are reputable people who could give evidence of the ages of the applicants. My information is that there has been a much greater stringency in recent months in regard to accepting the evidence of reputable local people.  I would like to know whether that has arisen from any instruction or whether it is just the chance of many circumstances coming together at the same time.  I think in practice the local Pensions Officer is the person who decides whether the pension is allowable and the local committees are only able to confirm the Pensions Officer's judgment.  If he disagrees with the Pensions Committee, the Pensions Committee has not much weight, and I am told that in many cases the local Pensions Officer may be convinced of the age of the applicant and that the appeal court, whatever department of the Local Government it may be decides the case because of the absence of documentary evidence of a satisfactory kind that the applicant is not entitled to a pension.  I would like to know from the Minister, whether there has been any deliberate tightening of the bonds in that respect for the purpose of economy?</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Johnson in what he says as to cases being refused in the absence of documentary evidence.  I am speaking from a practical knowledge now, and I do know where the evidence of age cannot be got from the Census, that it is very hard in a great many cases to get a local Pensions Officer to accept the declarations of people who are willing and able to make these declarations.  I have known several cases where people certainly, to the knowledge of very respectable inhabitants in the area, were over the age of 70 years, and these people were willing and did make declarations, and yet the Pensions Officer and the court of appeal would not accept these declarations.  That is a state of affairs <Col N="2130" /> that should be remedied, because, as we all know, that in several districts in the country, neither baptismal certificates nor Census certificates are available. Taking these things into account, I do believe that some system should be arranged whereby deserving people who are 70 years of age and over&mdash;some system should be evolved whereby evidence could be produced that would satisfy the Pensions law.  I further agree with Deputy Johnston that it is useless for Committees to make recommendations if the Pensions Officer thinks in his judgment that the applicant is not a fit person to get a pension.  Now, I say this knowing it as I do.  I am not speaking from hearsay or anything else.  I know it.  I hope some arrangement will be come to whereby those deserving people who are 70 years of age or over will be able to obtain a pension.</P>

      <P>I am interested in this matter, not as being responsible in any way for the money, but as being the court of appeal.  I have not got much grip of the general part of the machinery that deals with the ordinary Old Age Pensions.  There might be cases where the pension was refused to people who were entitled to get it, but I am equally sure that there are as many cases, or perhaps more cases, of people getting it who should not get it, and I think that if one grievance is remedied the other should also be remedied.  I have a report here dealing with the part of the scheme that applies to blind persons.  Every blind person over 50 years of age who is certified by a doctor to be blind and not capable of performing any work is entitled to the pension as if such person was 70.  There are medical certificates required in every such case.  Well, the result shows, to my mind, the need for stringency and care, and the need for more stringency and care in this matter, judging by the results of its administration in this country.  The twenty-six counties have a population of 3,139,000. The number of blind persons receiving the pension is now 3,282.  Scotland has a population of 4,760,000 and the number of blind persons receiving the pension is 1,436.  That is, there are more than twice as many persons receiving that pension in the twenty-six counties with a population only two-thirds.  The yearly cost of the blind pensions in Ireland is £82,000.  The cost in Scotland <Col N="2131" /> is £35,000.  These pensions were given on medical certificates, and it shows in respect of the blind that there is need for increased stringency rather than increased liberality.  I propose that there will be increased stringency.  It is an extraordinary thing how the disease of Irregularism manifests itself everywhere. Take the case of County Kerry.  There is supposed to be, at the present moment, one person over 50 years of age so reduced in means as to be deserving of the pension and blind, one such person in every 481 of the population.  In County Mayo, another Irregular county, the number is one in every 424 of the population, although in the County Monaghan, which I have the honour to represent, it is only one in every 5,104. My opinion, after examining this particular aspect of the matter, and as the person responsible for appeals is, that while there are probably deserving people who are not getting pensions, but who deserve them, and we will try our best to see that they are not wronged, still I believe the need is, if possible, for increased stringency more than anything else.</P>

      <P>Now, about these pensions for the blind in Mayo, I know several cases in the county.  I have been informed that they are receiving these pensions under the Blind Clause of the Act.  It is not the fault of the people who apply for the pensions at all.  It is the fault particularly of the doctors.  Although I have seen some of these certificates of these doctors, well, if I was the Pension Officer I would not really give the pension.  There is nothing definite or specific in the certificate, yet the Pensions Officer, who is also liable, should be condemned in the same manner as the doctors.  The Pension Officer passes the candidate for the blind pension even though the person might not be actually blind.  Two such cases came under my notice within the last month.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Dáil that it is not because of any attempt to re-organize these services on a sound basis that the reduction of £70,000 has taken place, but because of the fact that the financial year varies, to an extent, as far as the estimates are concerned, once every four, five or six years, according as a leap year occurs or not.  This year instead of estimating for 53 weeks, as was the case last year, we <Col N="2132" /> estimate for only 52 weeks.  That is really what is responsible for the reduction of £70,000.  I would not like it to be understood from that that it was not our intention to investigate, as far as possible, any cases where extravagance or claims which cannot be properly substantiated, or that such payments will be paid in the future, or that they will continue to be paid.  I have been informed that in this Service alone something like half-a-million can be saved from persons who could well afford to loose it.  In certain houses there are people drawing the Old Age Pension whose income by reason of living in such houses and with people who support them would disentitle them to receive any such moneys.  In other words, that in well-to-do families people are drawing those pensions which was certainly never intended when the Act was introduced, and as far as I know, and members of the Dáil know, such people living with well-to-do families were never entitled to draw pensions.  A number of these cases of appeal came before me when I was Minister for Local Government, and I must say that, as far as I could see, every Pensions Officer who put forward a case put it forward honestly and carefully, and gave in any case that came before me every possible consideration to the claim of the applicants.  That was my experience of, I should say, 70 or 80 per cent. of the Customs and Excise Officers I was dealing with when I was a member of an Old Age Pension Committee.  I think that will be borne out.  I might say that the greatest number of complaints come from persons on whose behalf claims for pensions were made, and who really had no case.  I do not mean to say no case in the matter of evidence, but no real case for a pension by reason of the fact that they had not reached 70 years of age.</P>

Undoubtedly there would be a very large number of old people who physiologically, <Col N="2133" /> or by ancestry or breeding, would include a large number of blind people.  I think one has to be a little bit careful of these statistics and I would like to examine them much more closely before accepting them.</P>

      <P>I move that the sum of £16,788, recommended for these services, be approved of.  I understand this is a service which is not in the estimate of the English Parliament at all, the grants provided for have been paid over a great number of years, and the estimate has been practically unchanged for 50 years.  The two subheads A. and D. are fixed by Statute, grants under C. were recommended by the House of Commons in 1884 and slight alterations were made by a Commission in 1885 and have remained unchanged ever since.  The grant to the Female Orphan House has remained unchanged from the same date, 1884. E is in gradual course of extinction.  It is only a small sum, I think there is only one pensioner now drawing it, and after the pensioner's death no charge shall be made in respect of that.  I have only one thing to mention in respect of that Commission in Dublin in 1884. That went very exhaustively into the whole subject of hospital accommodation in the city.  One thing transpired in the course of the enquiry.  I think it was an antiquarian who was under examination, and he explained that the first hospital established in Dublin was in 1154 by a man called Alfred Le Palmer, a Dane.  This hospital was situated in Thomas Street, I think it was on the site of St. Augustine's Church and it had accommodation for 55 patients at the time.  It was under the charge of some Religious Order, and at the time of the confiscation of the property of the Religious Orders by Henry VIII this particular place was confiscated to the Crown.  The lands were subsequently sold.  I believe they were sold mainly to persons with English names.  In the case of the English confiscations I think it was Guy's Hospital or St. Bartholomew's Hospital that was mentioned.  In the case of the confiscation there the hospital was handed over to somebody else.  I think these grants were to some extent a sort of repentance <Col N="2135" /> by the English Government for the confiscations which had taken place.  I formally move this Estimate.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister is there any control, and, if so, what is the manner in which this money is spent by the hospitals to which it is granted?  I was just wondering, for instance, whether the Government could insist on certain conditions of employment in the case of certain nurses who are employed in these hospitals, for I think it is pretty well known that the conditions under which these women are employed at the present time are not very satisfactory.  I was wondering whether the Government would have any control over the manner in which this money is spent so as to provide that better conditions would prevail in the hospitals receiving the grants.</P>

      <P>No.  These grants are given unconditionally.  As I explained in the case of A. &amp; D. they are according to Statute.  I think it will be admitted after an examination of the tables showing the estimated expenditure that, as far as the Government contribution is concerned, it is utterly insufficient to keep the hospitals.  I think it is generally admitted that in the case of practically all the Dublin Hospitals that unless further revenue is collected by them or a re-organisation or reconstruction or something of the sort takes place they will not be able to keep on.  The grants are now unconditional, as far as we are concerned.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter that I think it would be wise to call attention to, and that is with regard to the salaries and wages and allowances to the lower paid staffs.  I recognise, of course, that these are pre-war rates, and they are what might be called basic wages, but in many cases they are of a kind that the State as an employer ought to be ashamed of, but I am not going out of my way to advocate the cause of men and women who are not prepared to advocate their own cause, or assist the general body of workers whether they are in Government employment or outside.  But, as representing the employer in this matter I want to put in a demurrer against paying wages, such as:&mdash;writing assistants, 17s. to 34s. per week, as the pre-war scale porters 18s. to 24s. per week; coalporter, 18s. per week; superintendent charwoman, 18s. per week; charwomen, 13s. per week, and so on.  It is not creditable to the State as an employer that such wages should be paid even at pre-war standard, with bonus allowance.  I put in that objection in the hope that when these questions are being considered, as they will have to be, when the Saorstát is on its feet, as we may say, that that particular side of its responsibility will be considered.</P>

This <Col N="2137" /> is dealing with that sort of work, and a general re-valuation is hardily desirable at present.  Re-valuation has taken place in two cities within the last ten or fifteen years&mdash;the case of Belfast and the case of Dublin.  I think that Waterford has also made an application for re-valuation, and I believe that there is some support for the re-valuation of Cork.  Under the existing law general re-valuations may be made except in the County Boroughs, and fresh legislation on the subject of a general re-valuation may doubtless be brought before the Dáil at an early date.  Half the cost of re-valuation falls on the State and half on the Local Authority.  The re-valuation of Waterford, I think, should be complete next year, and the total cost would be about £2,000.  Five temporary valuers under this head are being employed in connection with the Compensation Commission, that is, Lord Shaw's Commission.</P>

On page 2 of this Estimate there is the annual grant to schools and classes of Science and Arts and Technical Instruction of £64,000.  I wish to know whether I am in order, on this particular item, in drawing attention to the dissatisfaction that exists in the case of a very large number of Technical Committees throughout the country in view of the refusal of the Department to allow the payment of the cost of living bonus to teachers who were appointed under the Irish Language Schemes that were adopted by the various counties.  We know there has been a great desire within the last two years for the learning of Irish, and I think it is only right and fair to pay a compliment to the Department for the work it did in helping on the study of the Irish language. There has been a considerable extension this year of these classes, and various County Committees have drawn up schemes making provision for the teaching of Irish, but they find themselves handicapped by the decision of the Department in not allowing the usual cost of living bonus to the teachers appointed to carry on this work.  The consequence of this was that the Committees had to alter the provisions they made for the teaching of Irish.  When enquiries were made, the reason given by <Col N="2140" /> the Department, or by the Minister, was to the effect that these estimates were adopted before the schemes were submitted to the Department.  I think that was scarcely a sufficient excuse.  I think the Department in its wisdom could have foreseen that there would have been a particular demand for the teaching of Irish, and proper provision should have been made.  I would be glad if anything could be done even now to encourage Committees, by the payment of this cost of living bonus, to continue the provision they made.  Under this Vote, too, provision is made for the College of Science.  I would be glad if the Minister informs us what exactly is the position in regard to that now, or has any change taken place in the position since it was last under discussion at the Dáil, whether in view of the practical closing down of the College any reduction is to be made, or is there likely to be any saving in the Vote in consequence?  A statement with regard to the positions of Professors and the Staff generally would be welcome.</P>

      <P>There are one or two items in this to which I would like to make reference.  I think everybody appreciates the necessity for economy, but there is economy and economy.  Sometimes the best economy that any Nation can make is wise expenditure. There are items allowed for here that are, I think, altogether incommensurate for the constructive work that lies before this Nation, or that would be incommensurate for the constructive work that lay before any Nation.  It would be invidious to distinguish some for mention and omit others from mention, but I do so, not because I think the cases are more deserving of mention than others, but simply because they come chiefly to my mind, and I imagine they would prove illustrative of the rest. Take the case on Page 6 under the heading of &ldquo;Geological Survey of Ireland&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances.&rdquo; There is an allowance made there for a Professor of Geology at the College of Science.  That is a small item, and I do not think the amount of work the Professor does at the College of Science is very great.  But, when we come to the practical working staffs, we see that the Senior Geologist receives £520.  Last year it was £600, it has been reduced by £80.  The Senior Geologist <Col N="2141" /> there at the present moment is an exceedingly efficient man.  Geological Survey in the immediate future will be a matter of the very greatest importance in this country, and for any person undertaking that kind of work a salary at this figure is altogether incommensurate.  I mention this because I believe it would be a very wise thing to revise these items.  I imagine the salary carries a bonus; exactly what that bonus is, is not set out here, but it would be <i>pro rata.</i> Whatever it is, here is an item of information that will indicate how important this matter is.  The late Senior Geologist who was at the Geological Survey a short time ago was offered a position in England. He was a man of very great skill and a man who understood the geology of this country, which is quite special, and he should have been kept for this country.  He was offered a position in connection with quite a minor department of the English Survey, but at a salary that made his salary here appear ridiculous.  And, although this was his special work, and he loved his work here, he was nevertheless compelled to leave this country.  I think that is a calamity we ought to attempt to avoid by the proper payment of those undertaking very important work for this Nation. After all, what is this country but on a larger scale a business concern, and every business concern sees that its technicians are given adequate payment. The salaries under the heading &ldquo;National Library,&rdquo; although that is closed now, and not available, are equally inadequate, and in spite of that fact several of them are cut down.  In these departments&mdash;I mention everything under the head of this &ldquo;Science and Art&rdquo; Vote&mdash; everything should be very carefully regarded in order that men of the kind I have referred to should receive proper salaries in future, because they are doing work of very much greater importance than the work done by a good many permanent officials, in spite of the fact that these officials are receiving twice, and, in one case to my definite knowledge, three times as much.  I think that is a matter of very great importance.  I would like the Minister of Finance to give us some information as to the progress of negotiations, under the Treaty, with regard to the Lane pictures.  There have been some negotiations for acquiring those pictures for Ireland, to which country they really belong.</P>

      <P>There is one portion of this Vote I must take exception to.  It is under the heading of &ldquo;Schools of Science and Art,&rdquo; and deals with grants for Day Secondary Schools. There is a Vote of £25,000 for these Day Secondary Schools.  If this country is going to vote £25,000 to these schools, the least the schools might contribute in return would be to give the games of the country some kind of preference over the games of foreign countries.  I believe that in a great many of these schools and colleges Irish games are altogether banned.  If that is the case it is a National disgrace that such a thing should happen here in Ireland.  For the purpose of bringing this matter before the Dáil I move that this vote be reduced by £100.  I think that is the proper way to bring it forward.  I am very much in earnest in this matter, because our Irish games deserve all the encouragement we can give them.  We ought to encourage and foster them whilst people who should foster them seem to give them the kick and foster the games of other lands.</P>

      <P>I desire to second the motion put forward by Deputy Hughes.  I have in mind a particular college in Co. Dublin.  I headed a deputation there, and I might as well go to a college in Whitechapel and interview three Cockneys for all the satisfaction that was obtained.  The colleges in the past looked to the British Government for assistance and the British Government sneered at the mere Irish.  We are in power to-day and we are going to put the colleges in their right places with regard to Irish games.  During the Treaty debate we pointed out what we could do in Ireland if we got control of Irish education.  Now we have control and we do not want the colleges of the future to bring up a race of shoneens. Our games are fit to take their place with any foreign games, and the colleges getting grants from the Irish people must give a proper place to Irish games on their programmes.  I am speaking on behalf of the Gaelic Athletic Association one of the oldest and strongest of our National organisations, and the members of it are determined to make themselves felt at the coming elections by discouraging the election of candidates who fail to give proper support to Irish games, and who fail to back us in the action we are <Col N="2143" /> taking here in this Dáil to make the colleges give a proper place to our native games.</P>

      <P>I think I ought to join in supporting this because in the University College, Dublin, for which I can more particularly speak, we are affected very considerably by the lack of Gaelic spirit in colleges such as that to which the Deputy has just alluded.  Everyone knows that the men of the future are shaped in the playing fields; it has been repeated so often as to become a mere truism that one smiles on hearing it repeated.  Undoubtedly the influence over character exerted in the games that are played is beyond all question, and the spirit of the shoneen to which allusion is made is propagated largely through certain sports that are regarded as peculiarly the privilege of wealthy classes and belong to a British tradition.  If we have a large influx into the colleges of the National University from schools in which this shoneen spirit prevails, it will be very hard, in fact exceedingly hard, to preserve the Gaelic tradition and allow the Gaelic influence to permeate through all the activities of the colleges where this disturbing influence is at work.  In connection with Gaelic games in our own Colleges, one of the things in which we are exceedingly hampered at the present time is the want of funds for the promotion of these games and the provision for proper playing fields.  In a broad spirit of tolerance we have provided in our limited enclosure space for the cricket club.  It is regrettable that there should be a desire in the Schools to play Rugby football with the idea that it is representative of the classes and that in some way it gives social dignity to those who play it.  One very peculiar thing in connection with our national games, and one that it is very interesting to know, is that most of the spirit and enthusiasm in our Colleges in devotion to Gaelic games exists amongst the girl students.  It is rather a strange reflection upon our Secondary Schools, from which we recruit our students, that so few are really interested in the national pastimes and have so little regard for the promotion of them.</P>

      <P>I take exception to one remark made by the last speaker in which he deprecates Rugby football.  I have played Rugby football and it did <Col N="2144" /> not make me less an Irishman.  It is congenial to the Irish temperament, and there is room for Rugby football in this country.  I believe in reviving the good old Irish games, and I am strongly in favour of the Government supporting them.  I took part in Rugby football in my young days, and I feel it necessary to say what I know about it, and I say it is not the game of any particular class; it is a man's game.  With the general sentiment expressed in this debate I am in accord.</P>

      <P>I would wish very heartily to support the motion of Deputy Hughes if it did propose to delete or to reduce this grant by such an amount as might ultimately reach any particular College or Colleges which proposed any boycott of Irish games, but I am afraid I cannot support the motion to reduce the Vote by such an amount as would not affect the income of the very Colleges which are doing the mischief. Allusion was made to a School or a particular College in the County Dublin.  I think the way to get at it would be to move a reduction of this Vote by such a sum as could ultimately reach such a College in County Dublin or in any other county which persists in boycotting Irish games.  I am sorry to learn that the representative of University College, Dublin, finds Secondary Schools in Ireland so deficient in their Gaelic outlook, and I would point out that the Gaelic movement of the past few years would hardly bear out his remarks in that way.  Secondary Schools contribute largely to making the Ireland of to-day what it is to-day.  I am in sympathy with the object which the mover of the resolution has in view, and with the object which the seconder has in view, but I can only support it if they proposed to reduce this Vote by such an amount as would ultimately reach any College that boycotted Irish games.</P>

As this has been proposed, however, I am prepared to support it.  This particular grant, I understand, is a grant for the teaching of Science in Secondary Schools.  And of course there is a well-known connection between science and football.  I do not agree with Deputy Whelehan's point that this particular reduction should be such as would bear hardly on a particular college, but it should be such as, without seriously mitigating against the particular grant for scientific teaching, would register a protest on our part against the action of those colleges which in the past, and as some say at the present, boycott Irish games and prevent their introduction into the school and college.</P>

It is not the games that are so important but the spirit they bring along with them.  The old days of &ldquo;Seoninism&rdquo; are gone, and it is the <Col N="2146" /> duty of all those Colleges, and even Universities, to throw themselves wholeheartedly into the movement, to make this country Irish.  I saw some days ago that the students from Trinity College thought it was their duty, of all those bodies, to help on the development of Irish ideals in Ireland.  It is on those lines that the country will make progress.  Every College and School in the country should support Gaelic ideals, and if they would not fall in with the ideals they ought not to get the money of the people.</P>

      <P>On this question I would like to express one thought that is in my mind.  I do not want to depreciate the importance of encouraging Gaelic games, but I want to say that there is something else besides games required if one wants to generate right through the country and in the minds of the people a distinctive national atmosphere. One knows of domestic architecture&mdash;the houses that we build ourselves&mdash;and one wonders whether they are being designed as an expression of the Gaelic ideal in houses.  We know, as a matter of fact, that science and art classes are engaged in the realm of design and are encouraging Gaelic designs, <Col N="2147" /> but I fancy when we come to the designs affecting the daily life, such as clothing and houses of the people, we cannot but believe that we are simply copyists, and that the lessons taught in these classes are taught with a view to capturing the market wherever that market may be; and, inasmuch as the bigger market is England, you are designing clothing to capture that market.  That will not apply to domestic architecture; but we are over influenced by the practices, the habits in England in regard to domestic architecture. These are things that affect the mind for six days out of the week, while the games will only affect the minds for one or two days in the week.  I want to put in that plea. If we are going to be Gaelic in the common life of the people, we have to think of the day-by-day surroundings &mdash;their clothing, their houses, as well as their games.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Deputies in this case not to press the amendment.  I presume it will be quite possible to do this without reducing the Vote by £100.  I am not satisfied it would be advisable here that it should be indicated that you are going to use the big stick on those institutions.  I am satisfied that the reduction of this £100 would affect the object in view.  I think the idea the Deputies had in mind to bring home to those colleges the necessity of having national games would be adversely affected by a vote of this sort. It is the first opportunity the National Assembly has had of taxing people of this country for education, and, having regard to that fact, I think it would be rather a pity that it could be alleged against this Dáil that the first real act of the Dáil was to reduce the vote on education, and I think that having made the case that has been made, having brought to the notice of the colleges their desire, the members should be content.</P>

I only asked for as good a show, and I am expressing the opinion of this Dáil, when <Col N="2148" /> I say that they will have to do it, whether they like it or not.  I think the Minister for Local Government said that it would be better if people devoted a lot more energy to the learning of the language, and the games would not matter so much, that it would not be too much for people to spend an hour or so learning the native language.

      <P>There was another point raised by Deputy O'Connell with regard to the claims to bonus by a number of teachers.  This question of the teaching of Irish had been under consideration of the late Dáil, and through some typist's error the Resolution I introduced, or the decree that I brought forward in the last Dáil, was not considered, and the necessary authority to local bodies to strike a rate for Irish in excess of the amount allowed by statute was not passed.  I got the Provisional Government to authorise the passing of a Decree for that purpose.  Now, it did not specify Irish, but it specified a sum allowed for technical purposes under the Technical Instruction Act.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Agriculture was not approached by the Minister for Education and myself, whose duty, I take it, was to acquaint him with the fact that we had struck this amount, and that it would be necessary for him to strike a like amount. It will only occur for this year.  It is the only contribution we ask from teachers, and if the teachers would agree to make that contribution to the extent of the bonus for this year, I think they would not regret it.  It is one of those things which occur owing to the circumstances of the times.  It was certainly an innovation and an advantage to get the local authorities to strike that rate and to get an equivalent amount from the taxpayer, but the other thing for some reason was forgotten.  It will occur only for this year.</P>

There is nothing to show if there is any bonus with that rate of wages and if that is so it makes one wonder what rates are paid to the labourers and the general attendants around this building.  I understand that the attendants in and around this building are paid the miserable sum of £2 a week; and that advantage has been taken of them because they are ex-soldiers with a very small pension, and those who employed them took jolly good care that the pension would come against their wages.  Now I would ask any fair-minded man in this Dáil if £2 a week is a fair wage for an employee of a Government building?  I only suggest to those in charge of this building that if these men will make application for a fair wage that they will see that it gets fair consideration.  There is another item here referring to a female attendant&mdash;I am told that this attendant is not a little girl in an office.  You will note that she is only getting 4d. per hour, otherwise £1 per week as a living wage in a Government building.  Only £2 weekly are paid to general attendants. I ask those in charge of this building to see that when application is made these unfortunate people will receive sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I wish to call the Minister's attention also to the case of some assistants in the National Library. I had occasion to ask the Minister of Agriculture about the rate of remuneration of those officials about four weeks <Col N="2150" /> ago, and I made a statement to the effect that the employees with 15 years' service and over were receiving a basic wage of £80 per year, and the Minister of Agriculture contradicted that.  He denied that any employee of 15 years' service had a basic wage of under £80 per year.  Now my information is that there are men at the present time between 15 and 18½ years' service in the National Library who are receiving £75 per annum plus the bonus, so that their basic wage may be said to be less than £80 per year, and that the bonus is being reduced according to the reduction in the British Board of Trade figures every half year.  They have already suffered three reductions under the British Board of Trade figures.  I think the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture was to the effect that the whole conditions of their service in the National Library were being considered.  I think they ought to be taken into consideration. I do not see any provisions or allowance made for improving the scale of remunertion of these employees.  There is an allowance made or there is provision for the books to be purchased, but there is no allowance at all made for an increase in the salaries of these officials.  As a result of further enquiry into the conditions that exist there, I would like the Minister to take into consideration and to make the allowances that are necessary.</P>

I have not consulted the Minister for Agriculture. There is some sort of statutory recognised principles upon which these payments were made.  I do not know sufficient about it to be able to bring any contribution to bear on the subject.  On the face of it I think it is strange that we should be expected to pay more than the British Government paid them.</P>

Deputy Thrift will bear me out when I say that the staff was thoroughly satisfied.  We have both received, though we did not expect it, votes of thanks from the staff, in which they acknowledge their satisfaction with the issue.  The college as a corporate body continues to preserve its corporate existence.  The Professors are paid their salaries, and if, in the interval between <Col N="2152" /> now and whatever time may ultimately elapse until they return to the buildings, or whatever may be the issue with regard to the use of the buildings, the Professors reaching the retiring age are to be dealt with precisely as if they were in occupation of the building.  The students of the College of Science are under the direction and control of the Professors as heretofore. The buildings are not interfered with materially, nor a room taken over, without first consultation with the Dean of the Faculty and with his consent and approval.  I think that is an accurate account of what took place, and the promise was made, to which the staff wholeheartedly assented, in fact, they seemed to welcome what was promised&mdash;the institution of a Commission of Inquiry to consider what part the Institute of Technology and a National Physical Laboratory should play in connection with the future Government, and the relations that should subsist between it and the other Universities.  It is merely because some students are dissatisfied with the physical conditions under which they are obliged to pursue their studies, and in some cases because of the natural desire of youth for pranks and &ldquo;rags,&rdquo; that the newspapers are filled with complaints, and the public are under the impression that the professorial staff are suffering from any dissatisfaction.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Professor Magennis has said very strongly.  As I understand it, the staff of the College of Science were completely satisfied with the assurance given them by the Minister for Agriculture; both as to their own status and as to the intention on the part of the Government not to interfere with the building to any extent without consulting the staff.  On the next point, as to the intention of the Government not to make any permanent changes in the College of Science without inquiry, that is the chief point, and I understood the staff were completely satisfied with the assurance given them. Of course, I am bound to admit that the work of the students is being conducted under great difficulty.  Everyone recognises that.  They are under a disadvantage to a certain extent, but, considering the situation, the other Universities are doing their very best to make up to the students in every way they can for being deprived temporarily of the College <Col N="2153" /> of Science.  I think the Government can rest assured that the staff are satisfied and are not making any complaint.  While I am on that, I would like to make a brief reference to a remark made by Deputy Figgis.  He referred, of course, to some special case, no doubt, that will come under the consideration of the Government, but it is to the principles underlying his remarks that I wish directly to draw attention.  Of course we are only beginning and therefore one does not expect to see ultimate elaboration after a first essay, but I hope the time will soon come when we shall see that money spent in developing the country, and spent in advancing science, not only in itself, but in its subsequent, application, will not be wasted money, but will be reproductive money, and that expenditure can be urged from motives of economy.</P>

I was perfectly satisfied that was a task beyond the Board of Works or the present Government. The Minister for Agriculture is unwell to-day and I am a child in this matter. That is the reason I expect members opposite are not informed more fully with regard to it.  I was unaware of this particular deputation that met Deputy Magennis and Deputy Thrift, but, as I understand the situation, there is no change in it, nor any alteration from the Government point of view.

On this I would like to invite the President to make a statement on a subject, that is a matter of very great concern to a number of people, and which is with regard to the Lane pictures.  The late Commander-in-Chief himself happened to conduct these negotiations, and he had led a number of people to believe that we were to retain possession of what was intended to be our national property.  We would like to know if these negotiations have continued, and whether the hopeful prospect he saw is likely to be fulfilled. It seems now that, when the date is coming forward when the Treaty will be finally ratified on each side, that with the start off of Saorstát a very excellent opportunity <Col N="2155" /> would be furnished for what would be not only an act of goodwill from a neighbouring and friendly country to this, but also an elementary act of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this Estimate for the National Gallery I should like to say just a few words, This is a very important element in the national life&mdash;more particularly on the cultural side of the work of construction which we are undertaking.  It may appear out of place at a moment when the National funds are being diverted to compensations for malicious injuries to ask for more money to be devoted to the promotion and the study of fine art. While I am conscious that it is somewhat audacious to ask for more, I would like to draw the attention of the Dáil at any rate to the insufficient allowance that can be given in aid of the purchase of works of art.  I rather feel inconsistent in what I say, because I rose to congratulate the Finance Minister on having the courage to make a grant of even £1,000 in aid of it, and it seems rather peculiar that in congratulating him on doing this that I should at the same time complain that it is not more. It would be better if instead of appearing to complain of the Finance Minister I were to complain of the situation which makes it impossible for him to do more than to recognise the duty of the Government towards art with this small dole. When you consider that the Director of the National Gallery has to be a man of world wide eminence as a connoisseur on paintings, a man of established reputation, who has merely a salary of £500 to tempt him, one is inclined to think that if it were not for the self-devotion of some men our National Gallery would be in a parlous plight.  You will notice that the item &ldquo;Expenditure&rdquo; is expenditure on the Director's journeyings&mdash; £150.  Now, these are not journeyings from one art sale to another in the hope of picking up some admirable work of art at a small price, so as to bring it within the compass of the miserable £1,000.  This expenditure is merely for travelling from his own home in England to the Gallery from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were not that he is willing to put himself to that trouble, and to accept <Col N="2156" /> this small remuneration, we should not be able to have the services of a man who stands in the opinion of Europe as one of the greatest authorities, for example, of the Primitive Italian Art, and it is a great thing for the position of Ireland among the nations that it should have in Art circles its name associated with a very eminent connoisseur, a man who is a recognised authority.  I thought it really worth while to intrude myself for these brief moments to draw attention to this.  We hope in future Dáils to find a very much more generous contribution under this head, and we hope to interest our people not merely in the &ldquo;Lane&rdquo; Gallery, but in the priceless works of art which have already been secured for the Nation.  It is a subject of endless regret to me that the National Gallery is not in close association with the Universities.  In German Universities, such as for example at Dresden, there is a public fund which provides for students being brought around under a competent director and lecturer to the great Art Galleries, so as to have their taste cultivated, and the interest in these things stimulated.  One great thing in the new Ireland should be the great value attached to the cultural elements of the nations, and, therefore, I properly conclude by congratulating the Minister, even although the amount is so small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On this particular vote, I would like to make a suggestion, that we should encourage attendance at these Art Galleries of school children and adults, with some kind of lectures and descriptions, explanatory of the various Art objects, pictures, etc., so that one can generate in these, few perhaps, but still select and valued citizens, who would be willing to attend such visits under such kind of direction, a proper appreciation of Art.  Most of us who have only an elementary school education, and many of those who have had higher education, read Art criticism, but we know nothing at all about it.  We only know that a thing pleases us for the time being, but we do not know why it pleases us.  I think it would be a very good thing if we were to get this National Gallery to start this work, which I think is common in other countries for schoolchildren and adults, and give lectures on Art subjects in the Art Galleries.  Deputy Magennis has pointed out how eminent <Col N="2157" /> the Director of this Gallery is, and it has occurred to me several times within the last month or two that there should be some authority in the country, now that we have not a Minister for Fine Arts to whom we could appeal.  The Minister for Fine Arts might be very willing to collaborate with, say, the Director of the National Gallery in improving the public taste in regard to mural decorations. We are all familiar with the examples of the new Art.  I do not know what description it has&mdash;I have read of Cubism and post-impressionism, but I do not know what particular school this is&mdash;but I am sure that the late Minister for Fine Arts would be very willing to assist in explaining what these particular wall paintings which we see about the city at the present time mean.  It is a matter of some concern that the public taste should be improved, and that even the artists should be brought under a more strict training.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Lane pictures, I have not done anything further than what has already been done by the late Commander-in-Chief.  I made up a list of the various items, which are of very considerable importance.  There are twenty of them on the list I have. However, I intend to take up the matter from the point at which he left it, and see if it will be possible for us to get possession of these pictures.  We have discussed so far, I think, eight Estimates, and only one generous Deputy appeared to consider the needs of the Exchequer by reducing a Vote by £100.  Everybody else wants them increased.  I do admit that there is a case for an increase in this matter.  Alderman Kelly spoke some years ago of cities in which there were some examples of Art schools&mdash;painting and so on&mdash;and he said that there were no slums in these places.  I quite agree with Deputy Johnson that the evidence of art which is to be seen on our walls would want the immediate attention of either the Minister for Education or some specialist in mental gymnastics.  However, having regard to our funds at the <Col N="2158" /> moment, I do not think that it is possible to hold out any great prospect of a material increase in this sum, but I will take note of what the Deputy has said and see if any improvement can be made in the future.</P>

      <P>If it were not for that I would be inclined to move that the whole thing should be thrown out, for this reason: The Congested Districts Board was established, I believe and I fully understand, for the purpose of acquiring properties in the congested districts and distributing them to the people as quickly as possible.  That is the legend, in any case.  But what is the reality?  We have heard a lot about beef trusts in the Argentine and in the United States, and it appears that the Congested Districts Board has been turning itself into a beef trust or a cattle trust in Ireland, and that that alone was their primary existence at present, and that the object for which they were established was simply a side show.  There are properties under the control of the Congested Districts Board for a considerable number of years&mdash;I believe any number of years up to twenty&mdash;that have not been distributed, while they have an army of surveyors and an army of officers all through the country, to whom no common man could really talk or make a suggestion. Now, what is to be done in this matter?  They have been calling upon this nation to admire their success as stockmasters and jobbers, and I believe in one of their annual reports they called upon the nation to admire their <Col N="2159" /> administration because they had turned themselves into insurance agents and saved a particular sum of money on commissions.  Now, they were not established to become stockmasters or insurance agents.  They were established simply to do the duty that this country demands of them, and that was to buy land and distribute it immediately.  They are not doing that, and for that reason, and for that reason alone, I would ask this Dáil to consider seriously whether this Board is going to continue as it is in the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to emphasise the general complaint which has been made by the previous speaker. I am aware that there is a very general complaint throughout the greater portion of the West of Ireland with regard to the action of the Congested Districts Board in this matter.  No doubt in the past they did very good work, but of late years they have, for some reason or another, adopted as an apparently settled policy the practice of buying ranches and continuing the grazing system, which they are supposed to do away with.  I know that there is very considerable dissatisfaction among the people in the neighbourhoods with regard to this practice.  I do not know, of course, and I am not prepared to make a suggestion as to what should be done, but the Congested Districts Board, at any rate, as such has passed its time and we should see if arrangements could not be made by which this considerable sum of money which is available would be put to better use. There is a general feeling that the money is not being spent to the best advantage. I quite appreciate that there are some difficulties in discussing this in the regrettable absence of the Minister for Agriculture who, I am sure, would be in a position to give us more information on this; and I wonder would it delay the business of the Dáil if this particular Vote were postponed until the Minister for Agriculture were present?</P>

      <P>I would just like to ask a question.  There are no details given, and in all the previous estimate papers we have had paragraph 3 giving certain details.  It seems to require some explanation as to why the same procedure is not followed when we come to, I think, subjects that are more directly under the control of the Provisional Government.  In the previous paper you have a statement of the salaries paid and of the way expenses are arrived at; but in this particular Vote, and in later Votes, we simply have a bald statement with regard to salaries, wages and allowances, and also with regard to carriage and transit, but there are no details.  Therefore, we really are not in a position to discuss these estimates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference really amounts to this: where new bodies have had to be fixed up the details are not furnished for many reasons. The Departments were formerly administered from London.  They were not what one might describe as self-contained Departments. They have only been fixed up, and it would be almost an impossibility to give the details with any degree of exactitude, or in the same way as in connection with Departments which were self-contained, and Institutions which were, we might almost say, self-supporting as far as they themselves are concerned.  That is, if all the other establishments went wrong, or for that matter if one of the establishments went wrong, it would not affect the remainder of them.  Those are different.  The Stationery Office was formerly a branch office of some place in London; it has now got to be fixed up and the estimates can be only problematical.  We have gone as near to them as we possibly could, and we are giving the information as far as it is available to ourselves, but the Estimates are different to the others where you have all the particulars.</P>

      <P>Yes, certainly.  Of course I do not want the Dáil to be under any misapprehension with regard to the word &ldquo;problematical.&rdquo; The Estimates are as near as we could get in the circumstances, considering the disturbances of the times and the peculiarity of having a new establishment set up which you <Col N="2162" /> might be quite satisfied one day is sufficient to deal with the business, and another day you might think would require improvement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation is not at all clear or satisfactory. Reference was made to the Stationery Office as an example.  The same complaint arises in connection with other Departments, and if I take the Valuation and Boundary Survey, which we have passed, there are estimated expenses in regard to travel, and estimates in regard to incidental fees, to referees, and so on. We are not expecting that you are able to tell us precisely what the amounts will be under those heads, but it is quite within the realms of possibility to say how the amount for salaries, wages and allowances is made up, if you can make an estimate at all, because you must be making an estimate on something fixed as far as rates go.  In the other cases we have something like detailed particulars of the number of persons employed and the amount paid in cash, but in none of these later cases have we any such particulars.  We are not, therefore, in a position to say whether we are doing our duty to our employees, or whether we are getting value from the employees for the money.  We are not in a position to criticise the Estimates, and that ought not to be sufficient for the Dáil.  We ought to know what we are paying for and the rate at which we are paying for it.</P>

      <P>Obviously if he had not enough money for, let us say, Dáil Debates, and if he had a balance from salaries, wages and allowances, while each one of these is accounted for by itself, he could not say &ldquo;I have no money for Dáil Debates; I have something over from salaries, etc., but could not pay that.&rdquo; Obviously he must discharge his liabilities.  As far as the Exchequer is concerned, any unexpended monies must flow into the Exchequer. If it be in the mind of anybody that if we ask for £234,000, and spend £230,000, the Accountant can put £4,000 in his pocket, that is the wrong interpretation.</P>

On this question I would like also to raise a complaint in regard to the purchase by the Stationery Office of non-Irish made paper for its office use. It may be said that this was an old stock. I do not know.  I hope it will be said with truth that it was old stock, but I hope there will be a very definite instruction in future that when paper is obtained it <Col N="2164" /> must be Irish paper.  I can tell the Minister with absolute knowledge that non-Irish made paper has been used in the office in connection with this Vote. I will not go into more details now, but I can say with absolute certainty that that is so.</P>

      <P>Be fore the President replies he might consider this.  We are asked to vote £25,000 for salaries and wages and allowances under a total of £240,000.  Surely it could not be suggested by the Stationery Office that if they have out of that £240,000 any sum unexpended that they could place that to another sub-head and reconstruct the entire of the details in which we are asked to vote and then say they have not exceeded the £240,000. Supposing for instance the printing and paper exceeded £20,000, but that there was a corresponding saving upon the Official Gazette, the proper course would be to come here with a Supplementary Estimate for the excess printing of Dáil papers and say &ldquo;We will ask you to transfer the surplus we hold on other items to meet that extra expenditure, and if that is not sufficient to give us an additional Vote to cover the balance.&rdquo; But it would be a very dangerous innovation to allow it to be said that after we passed certain heads but have not expended the money under them that they could be recast by the Stationery Office and that they could claim that that was in order simply because the Minister proved they had not exceeded the amount of the whole Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance must sanction transfers, but he has to exercise very careful discretion. Otherwise it would mean that one would have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for every particular point.  It is very advisable in a case like this where these sums are problematical that this sum should not be objected to if you are to have the business of the Dáil carried on at all.  If you had these things fully established in such a way that you would know exactly what amounts you required there would then be some reason for objection, but here you are fixing up a new establishment.  To ask for Votes upon A, B, C and D., if further sums are required or readjustments necessary, would, I think, be unreasonable.  The Stationery Officers cannot transfer of themselves <Col N="2165" /> from one to another, but the Minister for Finance has the discretion.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few remarks with regard to the register. Our experience in Cork is that when the registers are sent out to the rate collectors and others dealing with the register of voters, the local additions inserted by local printers are nearly as costly as if these men had to print the whole matter locally.  Some of the papers sent to Cork have been printed in Athlone, and I should like to know if the local contractors have been given an opportunity of contracting for these lists.  I think, having regard to the fact that the local printers are large ratepayers, they ought to be given an opportunity of contracting for these things, and if they have not got such an opportunity I would like to know why they have not been given it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter, I think, on which a question might be put down.  With regard to Irish paper there is a certain percentage or allowance for Irish manufactured goods.  It is a fair percentage and any addition to that, except with the special permission of the Minister for Finance, should not be incurred.  I do not think it wise to increase that percentage.  It is fair and within the ambit of it Irish manufacturers should be able to compete with others.  I have not heard, nor has it been reported that the Stationery Office bought foreign paper.  There were stocks of it on hand.  Some of them were used; some of them were kept back for a while, and will be occasionally used, and some of these stocks may be non-Irish manufactured paper.</P>

      <P>In reference to the item under the heads of Industry and Commerce I would like to ask the Minister if he could possibly arrange with the Railway Companies, so that migratory labourers going to England and Scotland as they do annually from my constituency and some of the neighbouring constituencies could be carried backwards and forward at reduced fares.  I may point out that the railway fare at the present time, though perhaps a comparatively small amount of money, is a very large sum to these men.  They have very little money going away but they bring back very considerable amounts of money which they spend in the country, and it should not be cut into, if possible, as it is at present with excessively high railway fares. Another question I would like to have <Col N="2167" /> answered is this; whether provision could not be made for the encouragement of shipping in the future in Ireland.  It is well known that the workers in the shipping industry should receive encouragement as well as those engaged in ordinary labour.  All the theories of the professors in the country will never work out unless you have the brawn and enterprise that will carry these theories to their successful conclusion, and at the present time there is no encouragement to enterprise in this country either to the ordinary labour or to shipping.  The shipping is mainly owned by foreigners, and so far as encouraging that enterprise goes the assistance or encouragement given to it is infinitesimal.  We hope there will be a change in the future and we would very much like to know if the Ministry of Labour and Commerce have arrived at any scheme which they could produce to this Dáil for the encouragement of the shipping industry of this country.</P>

Those people have a right of appeal, but in most cases they live twenty, thirty and forty miles away from the place where their appeal is heard.  If their appeal is allowed by the Court of Referees, their fares are returned to them, but if the appeal is disallowed they are at the loss.  I know cases of people who prosecuted these appeals and were turned down and they had to lie at the loss of these out-of-pocket expenses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister in charge of this debate to the fact that contracts are being given away by railway companies to firms across the water which results in serious unemployment to the railwaymen <Col N="2168" /> of this country.  I would like to inform the Dáil in regard to this matter that a contract amounting to £84,000 was recently given to an English firm by the Great Southern and Western Railway Company, whereas the work in this particular case could have been carried out and carried out better in the Inchicore works of the Company.  The result of the giving away of this contract by this Company was that in the Inchicore Works the men had to be put on short weeks of three or four days each.  I hope the Minister will inform the Great Southern and Western Company and all other Companies in Ireland that work of this kind should be kept at home, and that he will use his influence to bring pressure to bear upon the Companies concerned to see that contracts of this kind are kept in the country and that the revenues of the Irish railways, collected from the Irish trading and travelling community, will be expended in the country.  If that is done, the number of unemployed in this country will be considerably reduced. I hope that the Minister will take action in this matter.  I may say that the giving away of this contract valued at £84,000, and the giving away of other contracts of a similar kind, is a scandal, and I hope the Minister will take immediate action in regard to this particular question.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would draw attention to many complaints received with regard to the administration of the Unemployment Fund more particularly the hardship that is thrown upon the men of congregating around different offices, and wasting hours and hours, sometimes in most unsalubrious surroundings and circumstances, without any regard to the morale of the men or their dignity or self-respect. It makes them feel as if they were going for pauper relief.  That seems to be the feeling and that because they are unemployed they have no right to be treated with anything like consideration.  I must not be taken as saying that paupers should be treated in any disrespectful way, but the impression you get with regard to these labourers is that they are treated as if they were without any rights and do not deserve very much consideration, and that the ordinary respect due to ordinary men is not due to men who are out of employment.  That complaint is pretty general, and I intended to bring forward to the Minister proof of what I <Col N="2169" /> am now saying, and more detailed evidence. But I want to draw public attention to the complaint that men have with regard to the necessity for hanging about an employment office for long hours sometimes, waiting for the official to attend to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out, before replying to the actual questions raised, that the amount down here under Administration is for the whole Department of Economics; Industry and Commerce include the Department of Economics which was in existence.  The sum of £6,000 includes the taking over of the staff of the old Dáil.  There is, of course, no mention in this of the Transport Department and the Marine Department. They will come up under separate Estimates. Deputy McBride's point about migratory labour has been made.  I do not know if it would be possible to get specially reduced rates for migratory labourers any more than for any other labourers in the country.  I think the whole thing is bound up with rates generally throughout the country.  However, there is no harm in having a shot at it.  I do not think it comes under this heading at all.  As regards the shipping industry, I think the Speaker dealt with that as it should be dealt with.  After all, it is not a time for asking what schemes we have on foot or prepared.  I think it was Deputy Morrissey who mentioned the question of providing payments of travelling expenses to Appeal Courts.  Of course that is a very big question.  I think it was the experience in the early days that every individual who was turned down would come along with a claim which was no claim at all.  They went and had a day's outing&mdash;perhaps to go into the next town, perhaps twenty or thirty miles away.  The expenses under that head would be enormous if that safeguard were not there.  I think the number of cases that are actually turned down are very few.  I was asked about umpires and referees.  Well, the Chairmen of the Court of Referees are appointed by me, and so also are the Deputy Chairmen and umpires are arranged in the same way. Deputy Davin mentioned £84,000 having been sent away to England on some contract or another.  I do not know the details.  Naturally the first thing I would take up with the Railway Company would be a matter like that and get the details.</P>

      <P>If it is a thing that happened recently I am surprised I did not hear of it before now.  As things are at present it is only possible to take it up with them and point out to them that Irish industry, of course, should be encouraged wherever possible, and where possible even a little more should be paid so as to keep the work in this country.  I doubt, however, if we will be able to get firms like this, to pay more for Irish manufacture than they would have to pay for the same article abroad.  The point raised by Deputy Johnson I heard as far back as last March.  I heard it but not from a member of the Labour Party.  He was a member at one time and made a similar complaint, and I asked him to give me some details.  If we do not get details it is useless to make allegations. I do believe there is a good deal in it. There is this much in it: the very men he complains of as having treated the unemployed waiting around in that fashion are officials of the temporary type in most cases.  They are organised men themselves, and they are Trades Unionists.  It can be very easily brought home to them if we are given the details. I think that deals with the points raised by the various Deputies.</P>

      <P>I feel that the protest I made at the beginning against the merging of these Departments has been justified by the speech made by the Minister who has just sat down.  It was an excellent speech for a Minister of Labour, showing that he had a full grasp of all that concerns the ramifications of the Labour question, and the question of unemployment, the question with reference to wages and other questions such as that, but it was not a speech of a Minister of Trade and Commerce.  There seems to be absolutely no cognisance of the fact that such a thing as trade and commerce is as vital to the country as labour.  As a matter of fact I think that it would be conceded that the healthy condition of labour is contingent upon a healthy condition of Trade and Commerce.</P>

I think it was a vital mistake, and I am still convinced of that, and I hope that the absence of any allusions to that vital thing known as commerce and trade in the discussions of these Estimates will bring home to the minds of the Deputies of this Dáil that what I said at the beginning of the Session was very much to the point and very necessary.</P>

With regard to the other matter, the Local Loans, that is to provide sums, loans, to farmers and others for hay barns and other improvements that may be required by them.

      <P>I would like to raise now a matter that I raised yesterday. It was a personal explanation. The President was not here when I raised it, and did not get an opportunity of making his position clear with regard to the question.  In reply to a Deputy on this side who asked a question, he stated the number of people employed and paid in the service of the State, and he included my name in the list.  I understand that his reason for including my name was that I was a member of the Post Office Commission, and as such got such incidental expenses as are usually paid to members of Commissions.  I just want to make the position clear, as it is reported, without any explanation or comment, in some of the papers to-day that I am one of the members of Dáil Eireann who are employed in the paid service of the State.  I want to make that explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is due to Deputy O'Connell that a statement should be made.  Questions are sometimes put down by Deputies rather hastily, I think.  I do not want to pass any remark on that.  Two questions were put to me yesterday, and it would be open to any person, if I had not included Deputy O'Connell's name in the list, to tell me in a month or less that I did not give a full and complete answer.  Now, I inform Deputy O'Connell that, as far as the inclusion of his name in the list I gave was concerned, it was in the same way as I would employ a pencil.  That is a peculiar interpretation of the term. In so far actually as being a paid servant of the State, Deputy O'Connell is not so; but if the question had not been open to some extent to some misinterpretation it might have been very easily answered. In the circumstances I think it was my duty to mention it in the one way I did. I did not actually say he was in the employment of the State, but nothing in it reflects on Deputy O'Connell's character in any way I know, and I think he is doing exceptional work on the Postal Commission, and rendered exceptional service during the recent strike in effecting a settlement.  I do not intend certainly to cast any reflection on the Deputy.  Whatever fees are paid in connection with the Postal Commission are not fees paid in the way that one would look upon a person as in the employment <Col N="2176" /> of the State.  I think it was as well the matter was stated in the way in which it was as no person can say afterwards that any name was kept back in a matter of that kind.</P>

      <P>I think it is important that there should be no misunderstanding in the public mind with regard to members of the Dáil placed on Commissions.  As far as I know, there are no payments for acting on Commissions. There may be allowances for those who actually suffer loss and have to pay expenses, to recoup them for such, but it is necessary for the clarification of our position that the public should understand that there are no payments for services on these Commissions.  The Railway Commission is mentioned here; also the Constitution Committee.  I cannot speak about that.  No members of the Dáil were on it, as far as I know As regards the Railway Commission, I do not know that any expenses were paid to any person except such as might be called out-of-pocket expenses.  I think this item of £100 was for actual expenditure paid to the servants of the Commission for actual out-of-pocket expenses.  No fees were paid to members of the Commission, to my knowledge.</P>

Now, in the ordinary way, you would have in No. 3 (a) £1,000; (b) £2,000; (c) £1,500; (d) £1,400, and so on, so that Deputies will understand that it would be physically and otherwise impossible to describe first of all who the persons were who were getting the advances.

It is quite impossible to understand from <Col N="2179" /> this description what the term Secretariat applies to, and this surely is a case where we might have had, without much difficulty details of the salaries of the Ministers of the Dáil, and of the Ministers without portfolios.  That is not difficult to set out in detail.  Then there are the expenses of Envoys to the United States of America.  I do not think that this Dáil knows anything about Envoys to the United States, and I think we should have some explanation of that, who they are, what is their purpose there, and what is their particular business? Are they there as Trade Envoys or Diplomatic Envoys?  Have we any similar Envoys anywhere else, and if so, why are their expenses not included in this Estimate?  Then there is Publicity. Some details in respect of this, I think, are demanded.  Is this for the Minister's salary, or is it only office expenses? What kind is the publicity, and is it still going on?  I think we are entitled to have some information on this Vote.  A bald statement of this kind recommending that the Oireachtas shall adopt it without any further discussion is not at all satisfactory.

      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Johnson has said, because all these items, particularly those he has mentioned, practically are not Estimates at all; they are legislation. Now, we have already legislated in support of A, that is, salaries, etc.  I did not know that a decision was taken by this Dáil that Envoys should be sent to the United States of America. I am not aware that any Envoys were sent by the Second Dáil, the responsibility of which devolved on this Dáil. We did decide, I understand, not to create a Minister for Publicity; rather it was suggested that he should be merged in some other Department, or obliterated altogether.  In view of that decision it seems rather strange that we should have an item here for Publicity.  If we were asked to legislate in respect of publicity of this kind there are some grave questions one would like to raise, because there are forms of publicity that are not very happy or very fortunate.  The right way in which that should be brought <Col N="2180" /> before us is by asking that these things should be authorised by the Dáil in the first instance, and then provided for in an estimate and not by retrospective action to create legislation in respect of the monies to be voted.</P>

      <P>Surely the Deputy who has just spoken is not correct in saying that it was the intention of the Dáil to suppress the Publicity Department? If anyone had specifically brought forward a resolution to that effect I do not think I am entering into the realms of prophecy when I say it would have been defeated.  There never was a time when proper propaganda was so requisite as now, and it is the one thing I think in which we have legitimate reason to complain in regard to the Ministry that it is not so active or so effective as it ought to be.  It seems to me that there is no heading under which money could be more effectively expended at the present moment.  The first effort of anything like propaganda that I have seen is a large placard, very badly displayed for the purpose of striking the eye, the reproduction of a letter read recently by the Minister for Defence as part of the correspondence of Mr. De Valera.  For months we have seen nothing at all in reply to the very active and, I must say, the very able propaganda of the other side.  I have received this morning, for example, a typewritten document.  It is made up in paragraphs and I can well understand that a man who is not thoroughly conversant with all the truth of the situation would easily be converted by that document.  It seems to me that the Pro-Treaty Party are doing very little, and surely to ask them to do less, by objecting to the devoting of any sum of public money, is very retrograde.  I should like to see, instead of £38,050 for undefined Commissions&mdash;a thing which we passed a moment ago without a word of comment&mdash;I would rather see a very large amount set down for printing expenses and the rest, not merely incidental expenses like £200, under the heading of &ldquo;Publicity.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>By exactly the same Government, by exactly the same people, with two exceptions.  Now this particular Vote is, as far as (A) is concerned, for certain Ministers who have not got Departments under which their salaries would appear.  They are the cases of the late President, two Ministers without Portfolio that I mentioned here, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has no Departmental Vote.  There may be one later on, but at the moment there is not.  There is also the Chairman of the Dáil while he was acting as a Minister of the Second Dáil and not of the Provisional Government.  Do I make that point clear?  That is with regard to the Dáil Ministers and those who are not in charge of Departments, under which salaries would be charged in the ordinary way?  As regards the Envoys to the United States, that is in the same position as the Constitution Committee to which Deputy Figgis does not take objection.  It was done by the Provisional Government somewhere about last March, and the two people we sent to America I believe were Mr. O'Meara and Mr. O'Sullivan.  They went to America on the work of the Provisional Government. The Secretariat is what has been under the operation of the Provisional Government from the beginning. There is a Secretary, and there was formerly a Secretary and Assistant Secretary and several typists, and so on.  I do not know, under the circumstances, that it is possible to do without that staff. As regards publicity, there was a Dáil Publicity, which was somewhat different to the Provisional Government Publicity. <Col N="2182" /> The Dáil Publicity was on a different footing and was different work, and that work is not so much propaganda as publicity, if we can distinguish between the two.

      <P>The responsible Minister told me he wished to get away this evening.  I would like to say that the Minister for Home Affairs works very hard, and his health is scarcely equal to the strain he has put on it recently. He was at work last night until practically 11 o'clock, and this evening he has some other business on hands.  As far as this particular Estimate is concerned, I would prefer if it were discussed or criticised now.  Criticism might probably be based on policy or finance. I think the Minister is satisfied anyhow with this force.  As has already been stated here, the force is young.  It has not had a fair chance&mdash;a fair chance to the extent that the necessary time has not been available for having the force instructed in police work.  It is a young force.  It has all the disadvantages, or <Col N="2184" /> perhaps all the advantages, of youth. It has the advantage of being very well received wherever it has gone through the country, and I think the Minister is justified in the hopes he entertains of the people appreciating the value of the force, and giving it every possible assistance. I would like to say with regard to the financial end that the rates are based on those that were in force in the R.I.C. and the D.M.P., which were in turn based on the English rates of pay. One or two of the allowances have been slightly reduced in the country, but, in the main, they are unchanged.  Barrack furniture and repairs, etc., are obtained through the Board of Works, and the other estimates for supplies are put through the hands of the official in charge of the Trade Section of the Local Government Department.  Those acquainted with him or his work know he is the sort of man who usually gets value for his money.  As I have said, it is a young force.  We may have to be patient with it in that respect, because there has not been any opportunity for having the members of it trained in police work. The Depot in the Park is being used by the English military.  I expect the English military will be leaving Ireland about some time in January.  If we were in a position to take over the institutions that they are now in possession of &mdash;I do not want that to go to the public &mdash;they would leave to-morrow.  They are anxious to leave, and if it were not for the activities of people misled by fantastic notions, there might not have been a single English soldier in this country for the last three months&mdash;not one. Owing to the small accommodation there is for the remaining English troops, we have been unable to get that Depot, which is essential to have this force properly trained.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate what the Minister has said with regard to the force being young and the necessity for patience on our part on that account.  The criticism which I was specially anxious to make, and which I shall confine myself to now, is one more appropriate to the beginnings of the force than otherwise.  I would be anxious to find out what the position in the force is with regard to the Irish language.  I believe a complaint has been made&mdash;I am not fully aware of the details&mdash;that in the qualifying examination for the <Col N="2185" /> Civic Guard Irish does not get a fair show.  I do not say it ought to be compulsory at this stage; later on we hope it will be.  It certainly should get a better show than it is getting at present.  We know one of the chief reasons for the decay of Irish in the Irish-speaking districts in the past was the belief the people had that Irish was of no use to them.  If it could be found that the possession of a spoken knowledge of the language was an essential factor in securing a situation or a position as a Civic Guard&mdash;quite a good position as things go&mdash;it would help the spirit of revival which it is hoped to inspire into the people in the Irish-speaking districts.  We know, too, that the sending of purely English-speaking Government officials, such as policemen, coastguards, etc., into the Irish-speaking districts had a very deleterious effect on the language, and it would be a source of encouragement, apart from the actual necessity of the thing, to the people in those districts, if they saw that those who represent authority and law and order were speaking their own language. From the point of view of expediency and necessity, as a matter of fact, it is essential that officials who will be dealing with purely Irish speakers should be able to speak the language, and I wish to impress specially on the Minister for Home Affairs the necessity for seeing that Irish speakers, or Civic Guards able to speak Irish, and only those, should be sent to the Irish-speaking districts, and that in all cases the possession of a knowledge of Irish should be insisted on as far as possible amongst those joining the Civic Guard.</P>

      <P>Earlier this afternoon when we were on the Vote with regard to the Congested Districts Department, and certain other Votes, it was decided to postpone their consideration because important matters would arise that the Minister responsible could himself only deal with.  The Minister <Col N="2186" /> for Finance with his usual courtesy and his usual &ldquo;dig&rdquo; now and again to show us what his form can be, dealt with the Departments of his colleagues very well in their absence, but it is unfair to him and to Deputies&mdash;because this is the only opportunity the Dáil will have of bringing the various Departments under review in regard to these estimates&mdash;and I do urge that Votes of this kind with regard to the Civic Guard and other Votes that deal with specific Departments should not be gone into until the Minister is here to answer any questions that may be raised, and that in voting money the Dáil may do so in full knowledge of all that it is necessary it should know in regard to each Department.  I think that is an important matter, because it is linked up with that responsibility in the control of finance which is essentially the responsibility of every democratic body.</P>

      <P>The President has referred to the fact that furniture for which £21,000 is provided in this Estimate is a matter for the Board of Works.  I had occasion very recently to go to the Board of Works people with some Trade Union representatives who were very much concerned as to the way the furniture was got for Departments such as this and also for the military people.  I am reliably informed that a good deal of the furniture provided for the use of the Civic Guard and the Military Authorities was imported from the other side.  I am aware that a number of workers engaged in the furniture trade are at the present time out of employment both in Dublin and in districts throughout the country and I fail to see any good reason why the Government should give contracts to cross-Channel firms when they might save money by employing men in the manufacture of furniture who are now receiving the dole, and who could produce it at a better and a cheaper rate.  I hope the Minister will impress upon the Board of Works or those responsible for giving away contracts that it is essential for the saving of money to keep these contracts at home and to give them to Irish firms who could employ people who are now starving.</P>

Now this particular Ministry has only been set up since the beginning of the year and it has been extended since it was originally formed. It is not yet possible to say exactly what the establishment will be like when we reach stable conditions.  The establishment is still to some extent fluid and things in the Office as regards the Staff are not yet quite clear.  They have taken in Officials from other Departments; they took one from the Local Government Board when I was in it, and they took two others from the Finance Ministry, so it would be manifestly impossible to set out the exact numbers to be required in this Department at the moment.

I find the Ministry of Home Affairs is the only Department that will give members satisfactory replies to the complaints sent into them.  Every other Department from top to bottom will not give you a reply within a period of fourteen or fifteen days after <Col N="2188" /> you make the complaint.  Now, I think that is not fair to members, especially members in central places, such as myself, where we get letters in dozens daily, and yet find the Department concerned will not send a reply to our complaint for a period of fifteen or sixteen days.  I think that is a matter that the heads of Departments should take notice of.  I suggest it is easy to get things done properly by sending notices round asking those in charge to acknowledge letters within forty-eight hours, and to pay attention to them.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well to be humorous, but there is a serious side to this question, and it is to that that I want to draw attention.  The Minister cannot be allowed to hide behind the fact that he is invaded, and relieve himself of responsibility unless things are done against his intention and desire.  The intention of the President is to show that the military authorities have taken control from him.  But it is with his consent, and he is still responsible for the condition of these prisoners.  I am only <Col N="2189" /> in a position to speak of alleged defects from statements made and laid before me as to the condition of the prisons and to the allegation of overcrowding. Of course, it is very lamentable, and it might be laughable if it only lasted for a day or two.  But if it is true that cells built for the occupation of one prisoner are occupied by four or five prisoners for any length of time it is not worthy of the administration.  It is not enough to be satisfied that some buildings have been taken over.  Some steps ought to be taken very rapidly to ameliorate the conditions.  Punishment is one thing, but this particular kind of punishment ought to be avoided, and I am speaking in this matter not because of any particular sympathy with the sufferers, but out of regard for the good name of the Government, and for the people responsible for the administration. I may say in that respect that whenever we take up a question of this kind&mdash;I am speaking for myself&mdash;I am not thinking particularly out of sympathy for the sufferer or the prisoner; I am thinking of the good name of the administration and the Government to which we give support.  Statements have been made&mdash;I have not got them with me now &mdash;but they have been put forward with a certain amount of authority, and are substantiated in the case of Limerick of a rather horrible state of overcrowding and insanitation.  We are warned by various people about the possibility of a smallpox outbreak.  If these jails are maintained in an insanitary condition, a smallpox outbreak would have a very serious effect not only amongst the occupants, but eventually amongst the general public.  I would like some assurance that steps have been taken, and are being taken, even with the overcrowded state of the prisons, to ensure that every danger to the physical life of the prisoners is minimised to the last degree.  We hear a lot about the dirt and filth and the general insanitary conditions of the prisons. It has been said that the responsibility for keeping themselves clean has been thrown upon the prisoners.  I do not know the circumstances.  We have been kept in the dark from the Government side and are only informed of matters that come out in the way of anti-Government propaganda.  That is not satisfactory.  I think we ought to be put <Col N="2190" /> in possession of the main facts and particulars of the sanitary condition of those prisoners, because the whole city in the case of Dublin and Limerick is dependent upon the health of one spot in the city.  We cannot isolate a prison and say that nothing that happens in the prison is going to affect the public life.  If infectious disease breaks out there, it is likely to contaminate the whole city and damage it, and for the good name of the Ministry we should have some assurance that every possible step is taken by responsible departments to ensure that the sanitary state of these jails is kept as near perfection as possible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson started his address by saying that I should not be allowed to hide behind the fact that the military have taken over these prisons.  He assumes that it was with my consent and that therefore the responsibility was mine.  Now, without going very deeply into the logic or soundness of the argument, let me say that I have no desire to shirk any responsibility, whether individual or collective. The burden of the complaint with regard to prisons was that there was congestion and there is congestion, deplorable, no doubt, but I submit inevitable under the circumstances.  There are approximately, I suppose, 7,000 prisoners or very close on it.  We could not have foreseen that so many people would be imprisoned.  If we were to take it on the estimate of how many people through the country opposed the British Government so actively as in any way to warrant imprisonment, we could not arrive at a figure anywhere like 7,000 prisoners.  There are men in arms against the Government who were not in arms against the British Government, and who never would have been in arms if the British were still here for many a long decade.  We are doing our best to relieve the congestion and it will be found that energetic steps are being taken to lessen it.  We deplore it.  If they had succeeded in burning Maryborough prison there would have been more congestion.  As to cleanliness, it is hard to maintain sanitary conditions when prisoners use lavatories in a way that lavatories were never intended to be used; when they put down the lavatories articles to stop drains, perhaps carelessly but more likely with a view to providing material for such complaints, <Col N="2191" /> as we see in print and have seen written up on walls throughout the city.  I have made careful enquiries into the complaints that have reached me from Cork through Deputy Day.  I have also made enquiries about Limerick and got the answer, the same in each case, that portion of the men were peaceful, orderly and doing their best to keep their cells clean, but against that there was a section of the men absolutely determined to obstruct and generally to make things as uncomfortable for themselves and others as possible, and those men were putting things down lavatories and so on.  I am sorry to have to discuss details of this kind here, but it is necessary, and, as Deputy Johnson said, a very practical matter.  I am no more fond of smallpox than Deputy Johnson is.  I doubt whether a vaccination of 30 years ago would render one immune if it were to break out through the city, but we are doing our best and we will do our best within human limits to provide against congestion and insanitary conditions. If the men are absolutely determined to proceed in that way and to do all that is possible to render prisons uninhabitable and insanitary it is beyond human power to prevent them.  Without going into the question of Departmental responsibility, I readily undertake that any complaint forwarded to me, either of bad conditions or ill-treatment, will be very thoroughly investigated. I do not want to discuss this thing in any spirit of flippancy or in any hardhearted spirit.  There are many in jails in the country simply because they followed the lead of men to whom they gave habitual allegiance, and they take it for granted these men were right.  The man who started off on the words &ldquo;There is a Constitutional way of settling these differences, in God's name let us not depart from it&rdquo; has a very grave responsibility in the whole matter.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Finance I will move Vote 44. These grants that come under the heading of Relief of Distress amounting to £298,000 were passed before I was associated with the Local Government Department. I have no particular knowledge of the details of them.  Those under the heading of B. were special grants for the relief of acute distress following military operations in midsummer. Some grants were expended in Dublin, Cork, and Waterford, I think. The details of each are given below; £20,000 for the relief of Belfast refugees who were housed first at Marlborough Hall and afterwards in Workhouses at Ardee and Castleblayney.  I think they are nearly all off our hands now.  I could not say whether the item No. 3 has been paid or not, but there is no doubt that we were responsible for the relief of many people who were driven out of various parts of the country, whose houses were burned and whose lives were threatened.  It does not follow that everybody who claimed to have been obliged to leave the country was actually obliged to do so.  I daresay amongst these refugees there were many pretenders and undeserving people, but on the other hand, there were undoubtedly many who were really forced out and who were cases for commiseration and who were very deserving and entitled to relief.</P>

      <P>With reference to that item and the grant to Dublin Port and Docks Board of £18,500, I would like to have some assurance from the Ministry that they would continue to back this scheme.  It is of the greatest possible importance to the Port of Dublin and to the entire country.  Three works of a very ambitious character, estimated to cost £250,000, were embarked upon some twelve or eighteen months ago, and the British Government, then functioning here, undertook to pay a certain percentage of the wages cost of these schemes, and the present Government took up the scheme and gave a certain grant. Unless the Government is prepared to continue some assistance, these works, I think, will have either to be abandoned or suspended for a considerable period, and the Port and Docks Board will not be able to provide sufficient revenue for the purpose of carrying it out.  I would impress upon the Ministry the great importance of making provision for this. When it is considered the very great amount of money that is paid for unemployment insurance, I would like to stress the necessity of spending the money in this direction rather than giving doles, which lead nowhere, and result largely in a demoralisation of the people who receive them.  This work is of the greatest possible importance, and it will increase the facilities for shipping in Dublin, and enrich not only the City of Dublin, but the entire country, by providing better berthage and greater accommodation for vessels trading to the port.</P>

      <P>This is the largest Vote that will be put before the Dáil. I move this Vote of £10,020,000.  It is in connection with compensation for pre-truce damage.  £5,000,000 compensation for pre-truce damage and £5,000,000 for compensation for damage after 11th July, 1921, and for miscellaneous expenses, £20,000.  This is a Vote upon which one might certainly address the Dáil at very considerable length.  It appears to me that scarcely any useful purpose would be served by doing so.  The damage as far as B. is concerned is damage done by people who will probably claim to be imbued with love of their country, and they are showing that love, so far as this particular item is concerned, to be a very costly one to the country.  I do not expect anything we would say here would have any effect upon their attitude, or upon what they are doing.  I think that in any discussions that took place here we have not said anything which these people or their supporters might take reasonable exception to.  The work we have done here to-day is evidence of the extraordinary change that has come over the country since the 6th of December last.  At that time, and previous to it, while we were operating in what one gentleman declared grandiloquently as &ldquo;a Dáil which, having declared its independence, should not abandon its independence&rdquo;; at that time we were operating upon borrowed funds amounting to, perhaps, less than £2,000,000, and to-day we are dealing with sums of money amounting to upwards of £37,000,000.  If that is not evidence of an extraordinary advance, I am at a loss to know what advance means, and must get some other word for it.  Unfortunately, there are people who think that, by prosecuting this war on the people of this country, and on the vital and economic interests of the country, <Col N="2196" /> they are advancing a cause which would only succeed if there was united action on the part of every single citizen of this country in the direction in which they are, to their own mind, moving.  It is not a time&mdash;and this Dáil has not been used as a political platform, but I think that this particular estimate, amounting, as it does, to such a huge sum of money &mdash;an estimate which is required to repair some of the damage and ravages of the war&mdash;ought certainly give some of these people, who are engaged in this particular activity of doing damage, to pause. Somebody will have to pay this money. If we do not pay it, our children will have to pay it.  If they do not pay it their children will have to pay it.  The country is ours now.  As the Minister for Home Affairs, speaking of the late President, remarked:&mdash;&ldquo;the country is ours for the making, and we have got to make it.&rdquo; We start with a big handicap&mdash;a huge sum of money to make up for damage that has been done.  But all the money that we could possibly pay, either for the damage or for any other ravages that have occurred since December, or, in fact, since the Truce, could not restore the National honour to the position it was in on the 11th July, 1921.  I think that every member of this Dáil would willingly leave public life if the price of it meant the advancement of his country, and it appears&mdash;and it has certainly been borne in on some of us&mdash;that if we were not here possibly the opposition would not be so strong. But if they pay the price these people want I think this Dáil is perfectly willing and anxious that it should be paid. This money which we have to vote now is money which would have been very useful if we had started from scratch instead of going many milestones behind the starting point.  Unfortunately, anything that would be said here, or outside, or any influences that could be exerted would be of little avail.  I am personally of opinion that these people who are engaged in this onslaught on the country's economic resources are scarcely mentally responsible for the damage they are doing, because I do not think that any man who loves his country could willingly start out interrupting the nation's business and reducing the nation, as far as they possibly can, to a condition of beggary.  If that were the price we have got to pay for the position <Col N="2197" /> we are in certainly it is very severe on the country to have to pay that price for its own citizens to be allowed to live their lives.  Although one is certainly inclined to lose temper at a time like this I think it is advisable, at least, to give those who are opposing us no real case for saying that we do not appreciate the extraordinary strain that they have brought upon themselves, and which unfortunately they are also bringing to bear on the country.</P>

      <P>I think that with the general remarks that the President has made everybody will be in very hearty concurrence.  I am rising now, not in any measure to criticise this Vote, but to ask for some further information with regard to it, which I think ought to be in our possession.  The heads under which this Vote appear come under A. B. and C. A. deals with compensation for pre-Truce damage.  I would be glad to know exactly how that sum of £5,000,000 was assessed for damage prior to July, 1921.  B. relates to compensation after that date, however, and it is perfectly clear that £5,000,000 is not going to be adequate compensation from July, 1921, up to the present moment.  At least I assume it is clear, because I had gathered that the compensation in the recent hostilities would amount to a very much larger figure than the one represented here.  I could only come to the conclusion that the amount set forth in &ldquo;B&rdquo; deals with some period from July, 1921, until some day not stated.  I would be glad to know in the first case how A was assessed; and in the second case how B was assessed, and further, if an assessment was made from July, 1922.</P>

      <P>I would like to call attention to a matter which arises out of this Vote.  As we know, there was a considerable amount of looting by Black-and-Tans during the pre-Truce period&mdash;what I might call &ldquo;unofficial looting.&rdquo; If my information is correct, the Shaw Commission that went into this thing ruled all such looting out and ruled that it was not within their terms of reference.  The reason, I take it, was that this destruction, although obviously done by the British military authorities was not done in an official way, and I think where there are claims&mdash;as there <Col N="2198" /> are many such claims made&mdash;on behalf of people whose property was looted, and whose business was destroyed by Crown Forces, compensation should be given to them, the Ministry, of course, taking care to see that their claims are properly established and are <i>bona fide.</i> I think the mere fact in itself that such looting or destruction of property was not officially ordered by the British authorities should not be sufficient to prevent a man who has lost his property and his business from receiving fair and adequate compensation.</P>

      <P>One of the great agencies upon which we were relying to secure the unity of Ireland was the attractive power on the Northern mind of the fact that we should be able to secure for him exemption from the heavy burden of taxation to which he would be inevitably submitted if he made himself or continued to be a citizen of Great Britain.  It seems to me that if, after the expiration of the month allowed to Northern Ireland to exercise its option, that if the decision be for Partition, the responsibility for that in large measure should be understood by the people of Ireland to rest and rest heavily upon those men who have set out to devastate the country and to destroy the body of Ireland in order as they allege to save her soul.  It is this fantastic idea, that by impoverishing the country we could restore, as if restoration were needed, this vision of a lost ideal.  It is the worst thing we have met with since this Dáil began to sit, that instead of being able to institute large measures of reforms, which would have constructive efficacy, that we have to set aside such huge amounts merely to make a small effort towards the restoration of what would have been a National asset, had it not been for this insane interference with the property of the country.  It was not to reinforce, on the part of a private member, what the President has just said, that this insane policy, which is being pursued in the name of patriotism by some of our countrymen, to whom we had so long looked up to, even with a certain amount of idolatry, that I rose, but it was to ask a question, which deals with a matter of which perhaps the Minister for Finance will say I am obsessed.  I see that in the footnote it is declared that the Provisional Government has the responsibility <Col N="2199" /> in the first instance of paying Awards under this head.  I gather then that reimbursement is to be made by the British Government.  Is not that a reversal of the arrangement that the country was led to believe that it was entering into, that the British Government would bear, as from the be-beginning, its share of the damage inflicted in its interests upon the country, and that the Provisional Government will be held responsible only for compensation that could be fairly traced to the operations of the Army of the Republic. Now if this arrangement has been made, I should imagine it is done by virtue of some financial arrangement with the British Cabinet and&mdash;I hope it is not an indiscreet question to ask&mdash;if any measure of progress has been made in arranging the financial question with the British Government; because, to my mind at any rate, it is one of the greatest problems for those who negotiated the settlement.  I have always felt that it was one of the weak spots in our armour, in the armour of those who advocate the Treaty, that the financial question still remained an open question awaiting determination.  I hope that the answer will be&mdash;if there is an answer forthcoming&mdash;for I recognise that if the question is indiscreet there will be no answer&mdash;I hope the answer will be that a considerable measure of progress has been made in determining the relations on questions of finance between the two Governments, for it is of great consequence to us to feel that we are to have not merely reimbursements of this sort at an early date, but also reimbursements of the huge sums that are due to us for years and years past&mdash;due for over-taxation and various other injuries done to the Nation.</P>

      <P>I want to re-echo the words of the President in moving this Vote as a general expression of sorrow at the plight of the country in consequence of the state of mind which so many of its citizens&mdash;I will still call them its citizens, though they may not always be entitled to that&mdash;have been led into. I feel that the consequential damages are infinitely greater than the direct, damages, and I am trying to moralise in this way: that not only is human life cheap, but that the expression of the human life that is embodied in material things is also held to be cheap, and the <Col N="2200" /> passion for destruction that this leads to is thought so little of.  After all, we ought to understand that a railway line, or a bridge, or a building is so much embodied human energy, is an expression of human life; and the mere destruction of these things for passion's sake is a destruction, indirectly, of human life.  That is the thought that one would hope some day to get into the minds of the people. In this matter for the compensation for pre-Truce damage particularly, although it applies to both, I want to urge again upon the Ministry the necessity for insisting that money paid in compensation shall be used to reconstruct every class of business that was destroyed, or something equivalent&mdash;not only the buildings, but also all the machinery that existed in these buildings. We have had a promise that conditions would be laid upon the recipients of compensation that the structure would need to be rebuilt, or something equivalent; but in the case of Balbriggan a condition was made that, I think, £5,000 out of something like £60,000 was to be used for rebuilding, or it would not be paid.  Well, that was very little value, because on receipt of that compensation it would be an easy thing for the proprietors to say, &ldquo;Well, we can forego £5,000. That does not matter.  We have got the remainder for the machinery and the contents.&rdquo; While we cannot insist that the stock should be replenished, certainly the building, as an instrument for production, should be rebuilt out of any compensation that is paid, and I think, in making any condition as to the expenditure of this compensation, we should insist that not only the building be reconstructed, but that the machinery, if it happened to be a factory, should be replaced out of the compensation money. I think that is rather important, because it goes to the heart of the question of the utilisation of these compensation monies, that they will be really used for the purpose of putting back what was destroyed, and I would press upon the Minister the necessity for bearing that in mind when the payment for compensation for losses suffered after 1921 is under consideration.</P>

      <P>I personally can never understand the mentality of any individual or party of men associated with any patriotic party in this country who would consider that the burning of a signal cabin, or the destruction of a railway bridge was another landmark on that royal road to the visionary Republic. I believe that the idea originated, in the first instance, in the mind of a gentleman who has no claim to citizenship either in a Free State or in a Republic, so far as the people of this country are concerned. I had been told that railwaymen are accused of many actions, even by members of this Dáil, that the railwaymen of Ireland have taken, and are taking, an active part in the destruction of the property of the companies from which they derive their means of livelihood.  Now, I think I can safely say, on behalf of 99 per cent. of Irish railwaymen who have given in the past proof of their patriotism when the real fight for the Republic was going on, that they had no hand, act, or part in that destruction. When the best minds of the Republican Army and the people of Ireland, who were making a fight against the British forces in this country, were called upon to devise the best means to gain the object that they had in view, I do not think that they considered at that time, even when they were faced by 100,000 soldiers and police of a foreign country, that it was necessary to destroy the means of communication in order to attain the object they had in view.  If that was the case at the time, when we were fighting a common enemy, an alien power, I cannot understand why now any party in this country consider that, when they are fighting a few Irishmen, they are going to achieve the objects they have in view by the destruction of railways and means of communication.  In a certain part of the constituency, where I happened to be recently, and where a certain kind of destruction has frequently taken place in regard to the railways, I was reliably informed that the destruction constantly happening in this case was done by a few men who own motor <Col N="2202" /> cars, and who were reaping a rich harvest, when the railway was not operating in that particular place, but I wish to make it quite clear to the Dáil that the railwaymen of Ireland&mdash;99 per cent. of them, at any rate&mdash;who left their jobs without being called on, to help the Irish Republican Army, and the Irish people as a whole, in the fight with a foreign army, that they have not hand, act or part in the destruction of the Irish railway communications.  I wish that to be thoroughly understood by the members of the Dáil, and by the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained, in answer to Deputy Davin, that this is only an estimate of the amount of money we will have to discharge by the 1st April.  That point was also raised by another Deputy.  With regard to loot, the English Government have refused to pay for loot.  I believe the terms of refusal were, &ldquo;We lost no war and we will pay no indemnity.&rdquo; It has been the subject of continual conference between us, and each time it was disposed of we brought it up again.  The last time we were over I think Deputy O'Higgins painted an excellent picture for the consideration of the British Government. When he said you will pay for commandeering but you will not pay for confiscation, they said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have a picture of a Black and Tan lorry escaping with a motor bicycle, and I see an Irishman chasing wildly after the motor asking the officer, &lsquo;Are you confiscating that motor bicyle, or commandeering it?&rsquo;&rdquo; If it was commandeered he would get compensation, but not if it was confiscated.  Now the question of loot has again arisen in an acute form, for we have at least undertaken to make some attempt to compensate the people whose property has been looted since July, 1921.  In a great many cases I think the claim for loot is much greater than the claim for damage.  We have undertaken to do that, and I think that that may have some effect on the English point of view, for it would certainly be an anomaly that a man who was looted on the 12th July would be entitled to compensation and that a man who was looted on the 11th July would not be entitled to compensation.  Now there is a distinction in the cases that come before the Shaw Commission and the cases we have to deal with by legislation <Col N="2203" /> here.  In the Shaw Commission we can only get a clause in that rebuilding or reconstruction will have to be borne in mind, to this extent that the economic and industrial amenities of the district will have to be considered when awards for compensation are being made.  That is as far as we can get.  In the cases from the 11th July we are entitled to put in conditions, and the Dáil must remember that there are certain cases in which claims will be made for compensation, which I think it would be scarcely fair that that condition would have to apply, and that some other method of compensation will have to be made.  I expect the Dáil quite understands what I mean by that, that where certain people's lives could not be guaranteed by us it would be unreasonable in such cases that we should make a condition that no money would be paid unless the buildings were restored.  However, when that matter comes up for legislation the Dáil will have an opportunity for discussing it.  Now as regards terms, the terms were that as far as compensation is concerned the damage which was done by the British would be paid for by the British, and the damage which we did we would be responsible for. And the details were, that we were to pay in the first instance and that at the end they would reimburse us.  However, they agreed that should it be necessary to get something on account to pay for certain cases that there would be no objection to do that, but at the time these Estimates were first made up that was not the case.  From the point of view of accountancy it would be necessary to pay them in this order.  I do not anticipate any difficulty in that way of paying out a million to-morrow and getting them to reimburse us.  I do not think there would be any difficulty in having the matter settled.  I think that these are all the points that have been raised.</P>

This particular service has been transferred, but the officials constituting the service have not been transferred.  They are under the British Government, and at the moment they are simply discharging the duty of their particular service for us, and it is estimated that this sum of £360,000 will cover the cost of administration of that particular service.  It was found necessary to come to an arrangement with the British Board of Customs and Excise to continue temporarily to administer in the 26 Counties as our Agents. That is what they are doing in this instance. This arrangement is in operation, and it is subject to termination at any time but will not extend beyond the 31st March next.  I do not think it would be possible to terminate that arrangement until the 31st March.  We simply repay to the British Government the actual cost of these services, and it is estimated that the sum of that will amount to £360,000, and we will have to pay this.

      <P>That is not the point I wanted to raise.  It is not whether duties under the Customs and Excise Acts will continue to be carried out by the officers who are doing it at present. Supposing the Oireachtas, in its wisdom, decides to alter taxation, are we bound to the present rate of taxes of Customs <Col N="2206" /> and Excise until the 31st March, or will it be in the power of the Oireachtas to impose higher taxes or to reduce taxes? What I have in my mind is&mdash;and I make mention of it because of a certain correspondence which has appeared in &ldquo;The Economist&rdquo;&mdash;it has reference to the possibility of the six Northern counties opting out or agreeing to remain in. The question has arisen of the possibility of Custom barriers between the six Northern counties and the twenty-six counties, and I want to suggest that if the Dáil decides to reduce taxes on tea, for instance, even if we are to make it up by increasing the taxes on something else&mdash;if we reduce the tax on tea to something lower than the taxes on tea in England, it may necessitate the Northern Government putting Custom-houses on every roadside station between our territory and their territory.  They might not desire that there should be a contraband traffic in these easily movable articles from the twenty-six counties into the six counties.  And if we decide to reduce taxation on these things, the necessity for putting Customs barriers would be upon them, and not upon us.  That, I think, has been overlooked in some of this correspondence.  I am asking the question whether it will be in the power of the Oireachtas, immediately it comes into being, to make reductions in the taxation on such easily movable articles as tea and tobacco.  It might have a very considerable effect on the judgment and decision of the Northern Government if they knew that we are in a position to do that and had a mind to do it.</P>

      <P>Of course it would be a very dangerous thing to alter the taxes right away.  It would certainly complicate Revenue matters very much. I see the point with regard to Deputy Johnson's recommendation.  The question is, upon whom is the responsibility going to be put for the erection of these Customs barriers?  As somebody said in the North, it would be ours, but, of course, if what Deputy Johnson suggests was done, the onus would be upon them. I expect it is within the power of the Free State Government to do that, but I do not know that it would be good business.  I do not think that it would have the effect intended.  I thought the taxes as they stood were fixed in the Constitution for this transitory period, <Col N="2207" /> but if they are not I expect notice could be given to alter them, although it is not a course I would recommend at such short notice at any rate.</P>

If we decide to make it 3d. per pound there would be a great temptation for the Northern trader to invite tea from Dublin over the Border.

If you put one of the sub-departments of the Ministry in charge of the promotion of National Games in continuance of these things which are in Ireland the counterpart of Olympic Games in other countries we might vote annual sums and make the thing really a National institution.</P>

      <P>The late Dáil put up a Vote of nine or ten thousand pounds for the Tailteann Games.  I think it was done before this time last year, and when there was every prospect that they would be a success.  They spent that much and there was no more money voted.  When it was put to us that they would not be a success unless this money was expended on Croke Park we decided to advance the money until the Games would be held, and we would get back the money then.</P>

      <P>It has.  When the old Dáil decided on the introduction of the Tailteann Games, the provision of a proper stadium was found necessary. Some of you who follow sport will remember that the United States were sending across a very strong team of athletes&mdash;something like 120&mdash;and one of the imperative conditions from the outset was that a properly equipped stadium should be provided here by somebody.  The G.A.A., as all of you know, suffered very severely during the last three or four years.  Its resources have been heavily taxed through matters over which it had no control, and mainly through the fact that its members had been the principal contributors in the fight against England.  I think you will all agree with that.  Were it not for these facts I think the ordinary resources of the Association would have met this contingency, but it would not have been fair to pledge the future resources of the Association for a great programme of this kind, which had only a part bearing on the G.A.A.  I do not know that I can quite agree with the President that this sum will have to be paid back by the Association. I am afraid we will have a quarrel over this in the future.</P>

      <P>If I were in order I would move to increase the Vote by £4,500.  The grant is £10,000 to build a stand, and it cost us £14,500 to build it.  I hope the Minister for Finance will take that into consideration.  It was to carry out the Tailteann Games by order of the old Dáil, and you come along, as if the G.A.A. were pocketing £10,000, where actually it is at a loss of £4,500.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest the creation of a Ministry of Sport, but I do certainly think that this is part of our organisation of publicity as well as part of our educational system, and part also of our policy with regard to the national life.  Consequently, when it is described as a grant in aid it should be a grant, and treated as a grant and not on the principle of a loan to be repaid at a future time.  If the thing were put on a proper basis I should be certainly in favour of annual grants for this purpose.  It would be an enormous benefit, and there is no doubt Ireland would benefit from the great publicity given and from being the centre of those notable competitions from period to period.</P>

      <P>I beg to move this Estimate, amounting to £220,000.  Before moving it I would like to make a short statement, as questions have been asked and allegations have been made as to the purpose of this Vote.  I wish to make it perfectly clear that not a penny of this money has been or is being spent on espionage, or in connection with the present police force or military operations.  This money was <Col N="2211" /> required for a particular service which has now been brought to an end.  I do not think that the whole of that sum will be required, and I think there will be a saving in respect of it, and that the item will not appear on the Estimates of the Saorstát.</P>
