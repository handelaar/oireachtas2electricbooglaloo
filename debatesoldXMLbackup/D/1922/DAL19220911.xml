      <P>In accordance with the resolution passed here on the adjournment on Saturday, I met to-day representatives of the Ministerial Party, Labour Party and the Farmers' Party to decide upon the Standing Orders Committee.  There were no official representatives of any other group.  We came to an agreement, and I am sure the Dáil will endorse that agreement, which is embodied in a Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you proceed I rise to a point of order.  I gave notice two days ago of a question of very considerable urgency.  That question does not appear on the order of the day, and if I draw your attention to the Standing Orders adopted, on Saturday&mdash;&mdash;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Deputy Darrell Figgis was Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee, may I ask why is his name left off? We, as Independents, if not a Party&mdash; we do not claim representation as a Party&mdash;but I do think that men who prepared, or who helped, to prepare, Standing Orders ought not to be left off it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no Standing Orders, and no one's name is being left off.  The arrangement made was that representatives of the Parties would meet me for the purpose of appointing a Committee.  These representatives met me and agreed upon certain names.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE:</NameTxt>

      <P>I have given notice of my desire to ask for the suspension of the Orders of the day to deal with a matter of urgent National importance. I have a resolution which I propose to move with the permission of the Dáil; it reads as follows:&mdash;That this Dáil repudiates the statement issued by the Minister for Home Affairs beginning with the words: &ldquo;The Government does not recognise the right of Civil Servants to strike&rdquo;...</P>

      <P>It is not aquestion of comparative importance.

I have no particular interest in this question, and I probably shall not support the gentlemen in their views on the subject they wish discussed.  It is absolutely essential in this Dáil that this particular rule should be observed, and that the Orders of the day should be suspended for discussion of a matter of National importance when the request is supported by ten Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year five Members of Dáil Eireann were chosen as plenipotentiaries on a delegation, to meet an English delegation with a view to seeing how &ldquo;The Association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire may best be reconciled with Irish National aspirations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This delegation had secret instructions, but these instructions did not violate or restrict, according to International Law, the plenipotentiary authority conferred by Dáil Eireann, and expressly set out in the credentials over the hand of Mr. de Valera to be produced to the British Government and Delegates, and these are the terms that were given tp the Plenipotentiaries:&mdash;</P>
      <P>TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS COME, GREETING:</P>
      <P>In virtue of the authority vested in me by <i>Dáil Eireann,</i> I hereby appoint</P>
      <P>
        <i>Arthur Griffith,</i> T.D., Minister for Foreign Affairs, Chairman;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Michael Collins,</i> Minister for Finance;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Robert C. Barton,</i> T.D., Minister for Economic Affairs;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Edmund J. Duggan,</i> T.D.;</P>
      <P>
        <i>George Gavan Duffy,</i> T.D.;</P>
      <P>as envoys Plenipotentiary from the elected Government of the REPUBLIC OF IRELAND to negotiate and conclude on behalf of Ireland with the representatives of his Britannic Majesty GEORGE V., a Treaty or Treaties of Settlement, Association and Accommodation between Ireland and the Community of nations known as the British Commonwealth.</P>
      <P>IN WITNESS WHEREOF I hereunto subscribe my name as President.</P>
      <P>Done in the City of Dublin, this 7th day of October, in the year of our Lord 1921, in five identical originals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a considerable lapse of time and many negotiations, reports concerning which had been transmitted here to the Cabinet of Dáil Eireann, the Delegates returned, and presented an instrument which represented, at that time, the <Col N="66" /> maximum terms which the English delegation were prepared to accept.  This instrument was rejected by the Cabinet, the late President Griffith undertaking not to sign that instrument&mdash;namely, the rejected instrument, without first coming back and informing the Dáil Cabinet that he would sign.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for face saving, and no one's face is going to be spared to any disadvantage or any discount to our great and mighty dead.  There sleeps at present in Glasnevin the late President and the late Commander-in-Chief, earning a rest they were denied on earth.  One of them, President Griffith, honest man that he was, told me in London on the occasion that we were there in last May or June, that Mr. de Valera, then President of Dáil Eireann, in November, 1921, said to him previous to the Cabinet considering the terms that had been for warded by the British that it was a grave responsibility to turn down that instrument without consulting the people.</P>
    <P>President Griffith kept his word, and he did not sign that instrument, and with General Collins and the other members of the delegation, returned to London. Negotiations were broken off, and subsequently resumed.  Material concessions were made by the British delegation.</P>
    <P>These great men signed the Instrument, but it was not the Instrument that President Griffith undertook he would not sign.  They signed on behalf of the Nation that they represented, and on whose behalf they had so valiantly fought, and they died&mdash;one with his Ministerial harness on his back, and the other wearing the uniform of the soldiers of the Nation he had laboured so hard for, and for whose honour and existence and for the supremacy of whose Parliament he poured out his blood.</P>
    <P>The late President also informed me when we were in London in May and June last, that Mr. Barton&mdash;and wherever he is let this message reach him&mdash; said to General Collins on the way to Downing Street to sign the Treaty: &ldquo;I will never let you down, Mick.&rdquo; This gentleman, Mr. Barton, before he signed, went out of the room to discuss the matter with his friend and cousin, Mr. Childers, and returned in five minutes and said that he would sign&mdash;and let that message reach Mr. Childers wherever he may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> These are just words now.  They are not told for the purpose of influencing a single Member of this Dáil, but they are true, and the Irish people should know the truth.  The rejected terms of accommodation which Mr. de Valera in the responsible position he occupied had said would entail a serious responsibility on those who would reject them without consulting the people, was not the ultimate Treaty, and if it were a serious responsibility to reject the one, how much more serious was it to reject the other?  And to reject that other every conceivable device was invented to prevent the people from expressing their opinion.</P>
    <P>When the Treaty was under consideration, Mr. de Valera issued a statement saying that there was a constitutional way of settling our difficulties.  The constitutional decision having been against him, more elaborate designs were engineered against the Nation.  A section of the Army was seduced from its allegiance to the Government.  Amongst the papers of the late Commander-in-Chief there is a report of a convention of the disaffected section of the Army held on some date in March last, at which, amongst the matters that are entered as principal discussions, there occurred the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That matters of immediate concern for the Executive will include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Maintaining of Ireland as an Independent Republic.</P>
    <P>2.  Appointment of C.S. who will appoint G.H.Q. Staff Appointments can be vetoed bv Executive.</P>
    <P>3.  Declaration of Dictatorship (for this purpose the Executive shall be empowered to secure services of others who need not be members of Executive) with a view to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Ordering dissolution of all pretended Governments in Ireland by prohibition of Parliamentary Elections until such time as an election without threat of war from Britain can be held on adult suffrage.</P>
    <P>The Dictatorship would overthrow the four Governments in Ireland opposed to the Republic, viz., Dail Eireann, Provisional Government, British Government, and Northern Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Treaty position being regularised by Dail Eireann and by a meeting of members elected to sit in the Southern Parliament, the work of taking over the <Col N="68" /> administration of the country from the British began immediately.  The Castle, for centuries the seat of alien Government in this country, was formally handed over, and that institution is now entirely and completely in the hands of the people's Government, and under the control of the Executive, and is manned at this moment by Irish troops.  The transfer of the Executive has taken place, and Ministers appointed by the representatives of the Irish People have taken control of most of the public services, some of which are still reserved, but will eventually pass into our hands as soon as satisfactory arrangements are concluded.</P>
    <P>In the papers left by the late Commander-in-Chief it is stated that &ldquo;Mr. de Valera and his supporters were asked to take part in the Interim Government without prejudice to their principles, and their right to oppose the ratification of the Treaty at the elections.  They were asked to help in keeping an orderly united nation with the greatest possible strength over against England; exercising the greatest possible peaceful pressure towards the union of all Ireland; with the greatest amount of credit for us in the eyes of the world; and with the greatest advantage to the nation itself in having a strong united Government to start the Departments of State, and to deal with the urgent problems of housing, land hunger, and unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the Ard Fheis an agreement was arrived at, the elections being postponed for three months, those who were against the Treaty pledging themselves to allow the work of the Provisional Government to proceed.  Already the political situation had affected business.  The subsequent activities against the popular will, and for these activities the political sponsors, <i>i.e.</i>, the Party in the Dail who are described as Anti-Treaty, are and will be held responsible by the people of Ireland.  Neither age nor sex, not even religion were spared.  Roads were blocked to prevent meetings; firearms were used against speakers, and in one case a meeting to be addressed by the late President was proclaimed.  The elected head of the Nation was to be dominated by an army despot; the man who worked for thirty years in the service of his country was not to be terrorised in that fashion.  At the risk of his life, and leaving behind the late Commander-in-Chief as President's <Col N="69" /> substitute, he set out for Sligo determined to die before he would admit the right of any person, armed or unarmed, to restrict liberty, and he declined to barter the people's liberty even at the risk of his life.  I bear witness to the cheerfulness with which the late President set out on that journey, and to the satisfaction expressed when he had returned from his encounter with these armed despots.  In an adjoining county a deputy of the last Dail who was informed that he would get short shrift at the elctions, said a few revolver shots would settle that.  Very few revolver shots were fired by that gentleman during the late war. The late Commander-in-Chief, General Michael Collins, who was unquestionably the most hunted man by the British during the late war, encountered armed opposition at meetings held in various parts of the country.  In those places there was overwhelming support for him and his policy, but an armed minority sought to prevent the people hearing what he had to say.  Trees were felled and placed across the roads to prevent people attending the meetings; rails were torn up to prevent people travelling by trains; newspapers were seized to prevent the people reading about the meetings, and terrorism of the basest kind indulged in under a political label, and few and feeble were the protests by the Anti-Treaty party against this new onslaught on democracy.  There were merely individual expressions of opinion; no man on the Anti-Treaty side had the moral courage to stand up and say if these onslaughts did not cease he would retire from membership of that party.  The ultimate policy of the Anti-Treaty party was now apparent, <i>i.e.</i> destruction.  When a peaceful arrangement with Ulster was entered into and signed by President Griffith and General Collins, armed raids took place on goods coming from Belfast under an edict issued by the Irregulars, <i>i.e.,</i> the Belfast Boycott.  Every constructive effort made by the Irish Government was made the object of attack by the Irregulars or the overwrought members of the Anti-Treaty party.  Meantime a business slump set in and economic chaos became inevitable.  The Four Courts were occupied and barricades were set up.  This institution had been handed over by the British and had become the property of the nation.  Its use as a public building was very largely availed of. <Col N="70" /> Offices in that institution were utilised to administer funds of orphans, widows and the insane.  Documents important to the life of the nation were stored there. The Record Office was of inestimable intrinsic value; the only Brehon Decree in existence was housed there, and due and sufficient notice was given to these armed gentlemen of the value of these documents and of the necessity of safeguarding them.  All these attacks on the people and on public and private property notwithstanding, the Government still continued a peace offensive, always in the hope that a statesmanlike appreciation of the situation would eventually command the attention of more responsible elements of those opposed to the Treaty. The fact that such a presumption was correct was evidenced when the Southern Officers published a statement.  Meeting after meeting was held between representatives, and on the Treaty side the mere terms of any agreement counted for nothing.  No price was too high to pay as long as the Treaty position was kept and the Treaty secured, and while that position was maintained, even though it shook the confidence of our friends and supporters and brought us very near the edge of a precipice, no action was taken, no statement was made, no word was uttered by the late General Collins that would give offence, or even umbrage, to the humblest member of the Anti-Treaty party.  In all these efforts to effect stabilisation, the Government were being constantly reminded by their own supporters that they were playing with fire. Every act of grace, every effort made for peace, every consultation tried to bring about friendly co-operation on the points, which before the public were admitted to be common ground, was taken, as the sign of weakness.  Reviewing the whole course of events now, and in the interim absence of proof, one is driven to the irresistible conclusion that a way was being fashioned for a return of the English troops and English administration, as if after the disorganisation so deliberately planned, the Nation could look to the same leaders with any degree of confidence. After making fruitless attempts to secure accommodation, a formula was found, and only the great heart now no longer beating, and lying in Glasnevin, could have out of its illimitable generosity given so much away.  But what change of heart was seen on the Anti-Treaty side.  It is well <Col N="71" /> that those who talk so lightly now of peace as if it were something which could be had as easily as saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; should thoroughly appreciate the position.  Peace with the politicians, or an apparent peace, was not the peace for which we had bargained.  Well might the Anti-Treaty Party bargain for peace and demand and get the highest price, knowing well that another peace had had to be made with the Irregulars in arms.</P>
    <P>On the 12th June&mdash;during the absence of Gen. Collins&mdash;an advertisement appeared in the Press over the names of Michael Collins and E. de Valera, which was not authorised by Michael Collins, and on the 14th he published a repudiation of it.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to read the Coalition Panel Agreement, but it is right that this should be read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the absence of Messrs.  Griffith and Michael Collins in London on <i>Monday, 12th June,</i> 1922, the following advertisement appeared in the Dublin papers of that date.  It occupied a treble column space of about ten inches in each column. Here is a copy of the advertisement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;The English are furious with the Collins-de Valera Pact because the English fear Irish unity.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you play the enemy's game, and destroy the Pact, or will you stand by that Pact and vote for the Sinn Fein panel?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;You won't get it by voting for a Dail of warring sections and interests.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will get it by voting for the Sinn Fein Panel which will secure a united effort from the forces of Irish Nationality.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Peace, stability, order can only be secured by the two effective National forces, united by the Collins-de Valera Pact.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your only security against the Nation's enemies, foreign and domestic.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>CUMANN NA POBLACHTA.</P>
    <P>On the 13th June, Mr. Michael Collins was shown this advertisement which appeared in the Press of 12th June.</P>
    <P>The following statement appeared in the Press of the 14th June:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On Mr. Collins' attention being drawn to the advertisement inserted in Monday's papers by &lsquo;Cumann na Poblachta,&rsquo; he said he had not seen it before it was inserted, nor did he believe that Mr. de Valera had seen it.  The Pact agreed upon by him and Mr. de Valera stated <Col N="72" /> clearly in Clause 4 &lsquo;That any and every interest is free to go up and contest the Election equally with the National Sinn Fein Panel.&rsquo; In his opinion the statement in the advertisement: &lsquo;Do you want peace?  You won't get it by voting for a Dail of warring sections and interests; you will got it by voting for the Sinn Fein Panel which will secure united effort from the forces of Irish Nationality,&rsquo; was not in keeping with the spirit of the Pact, and to suggest that non-Panel candidates, by contesting the Election, branded themselves as national enemies was obviously contrary to the agreement signed by him and by Mr. de Valera.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 15th of June, negotiations having been going on with the Irregulars, the following document was handed to the Minister for Defence by Messrs. O'Connor and O'Malley from the Four Courts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>RESOLUTION PASSED AT EXECUTIVE MEETING HELD ON 14/6/22.</P>
    <P>That we instruct the Officers deputed to meet the Beggar's Bush Officers to inform them that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For the purpose of maintaining the Irish Republic, the Executive has decided that:</P>
    <P>(a)  Negotiations on Army unification. with Beggar's Bush must cease.</P>
    <P>(b)  We take whatever action may be necessary to maintain the Republic against British aggression.</P>
    <P>(c)  No offensive will be taken by our troops against the Beggar's Bush forces.</P>
    <P>On the 18th June&mdash;after the Election&mdash; forces from the Four Courts seized munitions at the Curragh, the property of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have positive evidence that on Sunday, 18th June, Rory O'Connor, Ernest O'Malley, and Thomas Barry, with an armoured and Lancia car, and a force of Irregulars from the Four Courts, held up members of the Civic Guard, disarmed them, and took possession of their arms, at the Cross at Kildare.  The disarmed Civic Guards were there and then informed by the O'Connor-O'Malley-Barry party &ldquo;that they had declared war on England, that they had issued an ultimatum for Monday morning, and that they did not want to be fighting with Irishmen,&rdquo; and they asked the Civic Guards &ldquo;to come along with them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> On the 26th of June motor cars to the value of £9,000 were seized under the pretext of the Belfast Boycott at Ferguson's Garage.  The Government being made aware of it, National troops were despatched to the premises, and they arrested an Irregular leader named Henderson. It was the duty of the Government to prevent illegal seizures not authorised by any Court functioning under the authority of Parliament.  The following day one of the highest Military Officers of the State, General O'Connell, was kidnapped and taken prisoner to the Four Courts.  These actions were a direct challenge to the authority of the people, as expressed in the elections, and to the authority of the Government.  It was now evident that neither peace, order nor security could possibly be maintained if the Government did not take strong and definite action.  An ultimatum was sent to the Four Courts, and military operations were begun against those who defied the authority.  These actions were only taken after every possible effort had been made to effect a peaceful settlement. It must, however, be definitely understood that in all these efforts for a peaceful settlement the Government was bound to see that the Treaty position was maintained. At that time the Irregular forces could have withdrawn from the Four Courts, bowing to superior force, and still maintained, should it be so desired, an attitude of opposition on constitutional lines to the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>If peace be made now it must be on well defined lines: it must be a constitutional peace.  There must not, and will not, be an armed body in the community without the sanction of Parliament, and Parliament must have control of all arms, and an armed opposition to its will cannot be permitted.  There must be no misunderstanding about that.  We do not contemplate, and never said we would fire the last shot to consolidate the supremacy of Parliament.  It won't be necessary to do so, but if those at present in arms, or at any future time in arms, think that the Government fears to assert the authority of Parliament, they are mistaken.  Members of the Government may fall in that, task which it is their duty to carry out, and others will take their place and accept the same responsibility.</P>
    <P>During the progress of the military operations within the last two months <Col N="74" /> there has been an utter indifference on the part of the Irregulars&mdash;in their attacks &mdash;to the vital interests of the community. It is well known there is a house famine in Dublin, and throughout the country, but that did not prevent the occupation and the destruction of the habitations of the people.  The Provisional Government had already taken steps to provide for 2,000 houses.  It was evidence of their appreciation of the house famine.  Hotel accommodation was strictly limited; that did not prevent a large number of hotels being seized by Irregulars, and during the occupation by Irregulars of the hotels, and other places, members of the Dail belonging to the Anti-Treaty party were in these hotels.  Sniping and ambushing had taken place on a much larger scale than during the late war, and in one of the ambushes a most promising Officer&mdash; General Collison, with four Officers of lesser rank&mdash;was killed.  I recollect the late President saying that he would at all costs attend the funeral of General Collison, and of four Officers that were killed in the ambush at Leix.  The 25 men who took part in that ambush surrendered almost immediately to a force of six of the National troops, after doing their damage.  They put up a white flag and screamed for mercy.  General Collins went down and interrogated these twentyfive men, and not a single one of them had fired a shot against the English in the late war.  Piers have been destroyed, roads trenched and mined, bridges blown up, railways seriously damaged, and signal boxes destroyed.  In a word if there is to be war let us concentrate upon cutting the arteries of the Nation! Valuable mansions have been burned and the policy in this line of action cannot but have one effect, that is the driving of the wealthy classes out of the country with a consequent loss in the revenue of the country, and the attempt to develop a sense and feeling of insecurity which will damage the future prospects of the Nation.  In one case a mansion was visited, and &ldquo;The Book of Lismore&rdquo; and numerous other valuable Irish manuscripts including the &ldquo;Crozier of St. Patrick,&rdquo; were sprinkled with petrol, and but for the unexpected arrival of the National troops would have been consigned to the flames.  In Cork, they took possession of the Custom House and seized the revenue of the country and the money belonging to the people to the extent of £100,000.  They <Col N="75" /> went so far as to make a demand for the payment of Income Tax.  These particulars give a picture of the extent to which they are prepared to go to further the proclivities of those people until every man who possesses a revolver becomes a despot.  While these operations are in progress and until order has been restored, reconstruction and reparation are obviously impossible.  Only last night news was brought of a further attack on the people, namely, damage, to the Water Works.  Action taken by the Government in this connection is solely and entirely with the intention of restoring order and taking steps to secure that life and property must be respected and that the laws of the country must be obeyed.  The Nation is suffering now, and all this suffering, great as it may be, is less than that to which all the activities of those who are in arms against the Government wish to commit the Nation, <i>i.e.</i>, renewed war with England.  Peace must be on the basis of the Treaty and it is open to any section of the community to oppose it politically and constitutionally.  Amongst the documents that have come into the hands of the Government in connection with this struggle occurs the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;HEADQUARTERS,</P>
    <P>KERRY No. 1 BRIGADE,</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(Signed) A. O. MURCHADHA,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;O/C Kerry No. 1 Brigade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The man to whom this despatch was directed, Mr. Martin Howard, is now a prisoner in our hands.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, the 29th August, Erskine Childers and a party of Irregulars damaged one and attempted to cut a second Transatlantic cable at Valentia, Co. Kerry.</P>
    <P>In July last an honourable Truce was entered into between the English on the one hand and the Irish on the other, that Truce was never called off and those are breaches of the Truce.</P>
    <P>The Nation which has struggled so long against the most powerful foreign aggression will not submit to an armed minority which makes war upon its liberties, its institutions, its representation and its honour.  During its long and bitter struggle Irish honour was bright and resplendent.  An Irishman's word of honour was dearer than his life, and no political advantage can have any respect without honour.  There must be clear thinking on this subject of peace.  We demand no concessions which cannot be given without honour.  We insist upon the people's rights.  We are the custodians of the rights of the people and we shall not hesitate to shoulder them.  We are willing to come to a peaceful understanding with those in arms, but it must be on a definite basis.  We want peace with England on the terms agreed to by the country.  Apart from the question of the honour of the Nation we are satisfied that the Nation stands to lose incomparably less from the armed internal opposition than from a reconquest.  The National Army is prepared to pay the price, and so are we.  Last December Ireland was in a position of power and of influence of great promise for the country. Foreign Nations expressed their appreciation of the settlement, and for a short period there was a boom in business. The action of the opposition destroyed that boom, lessened that power and damaged the reputation of the Nation. These potentialities must be restored. Great material loss has been inflicted on the Nation.  It is impossible to estimate the extent of this loss, but it is easy to appreciate how much was needed to restore the country after the war with the English; war with the English in this sense meaning not the last 3 or 4 or 5 years, but the war which restricted National development, which left us a poor Nation, which left us industrially and politically on the same level with the <Col N="77" /> smaller Nations of Europe, and the education of the country fashioned as if Ireland were a Province and not a Nation.  Hard work lies before the Parliament of the Nation, and with the active and cordial co-operation of both and of the various sections making up the community it will be possible to restore the Irish Nation not alone to the position in which it was at the time the Treaty was signed but to the potentialities which the Treaty offered and which it is possible to get out of the Treaty.  There is now no reason why blame should be shifted on the British or any other Government blamed if we do not succeed.  This Parliament and this Government is of the people and expects to get that support which is essential to a Government and a Parliament.  We must realise our responsibilities not to one section or to one order of the community, and we must seek to make the administration of this country and the business of the Parliament something worthy of the people. Our Army and Police Force must be efficient; the Courts must command the confidence of the people, and the Parliament must resuscitate the Gaelic spirit and the Gaelic civilisation for which we have been fighting through the ages and all but lost.  The Nation is still full of vigour and is conscious that a mere handful of violent persons is for the moment standing athwart its upward and onward march towards the achievement of its highest hopes.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say right at the beginning that so far as we here are concerned we are not at all satisfied with the Presidential statement of policy we have just heard. It is not the statement of policy we asked <Col N="79" /> for on Saturday.  As a matter of fact it is not an answer in any particular to the questions we put to the President on Saturday, or to the Executive; instead of that it is a declaration of its policy with regard to people who are altogether outside this Dáil.  It is an answer to a number of questions on certain propaganda conducted outside the Dáil.  It is not an answer to the questions we put. We asked for a Declaration of Policy on certain specific points, and we have not got an answer on any of these points. He began his statement by recalling the history of Ireland since the Treaty between England and Ireland was signed last December, but we did not question the Treaty on Saturday.  We did not cast any doubt on the credentials of the signatories of the Treaty.  We did not question the right or authority of a Second Dáil to carry that Treaty or any other Treaty.  Not only that, but, personally to my great regret, instead of facing the future as the President of this State ought to face the future on the strength, courage, resolution and authority of this Dáil, be turns round and does what we have condemned other people in Ireland for doing; that is&mdash;he rattled the bones of the dead in our faces.  I have as much respect for the late President Griffith and Michael Collins as anybody, in Ireland, but I do not think it is fair that when questions as to the future policy are put that the reply should be to relate the many risks they ran and many brave and courageous things they did; we want something more than that.  We have really in the statement a kind of time table give to us. Now, the order of events is of some importance. As a matter of fact he has given us some information to-day which nobody has made public in Ireland until he made it to-day.  He has told us that a Declaration of War was made by the Executive Forces, or the Republican troope, upon England.  Why didn't we hear of that before to-day? Last March, he says, there was a Convention of the Republican troops.  That Convention brought up as matters of immediate concern the question of the maintenance of an Independent Republic, the question of a Chief of Staff and of Army appointments, and also the question of a Dictatorship and the dissolution of the four Governments in Ireland.  We are not concerned with that. <Col N="80" /> We are not concerned with questions of Dictatorahip or of the Independent Republic, or of different positions in the Army at all.  This is where the whole importance of his statement came in. He says these things were done in March. In April certain proposals for Peace were made.  The Executive of the day turned down these proposals and said they could not negotiate with the people in the Four Courts.  April passed over, and May came along, and then June came with a General Election.  A Pact was entered into between, the people with whom the Executive did not negotiate&mdash;the people who declared they were going to abolish the four Governments in Ireland, and who were going to set up a Dictatorship, and who were wrangling and squabbling about the higher jobs.  But the lower jobs were disregarded; there was no squabbling at all about the private soldiers' jobs.  In May and June that Pact was entered into and a panel between the two parties was arranged for the purposes of the Election.  The President has spoken about the Ard Fheis Agreement.  We are not concerned with that and the Dáil is not concerned with the Ard Fheis Agreement.  The Ard Fheis Agreement was an agreement entered into between the two wings of one political Party ignoring everybody else in Ireland belonging to other political Parties, and ignoring those who belonged to no political Parties.  There was not a single word of condemnation of that Panel or of that Ard Fheis Agreement. Agreements were entered into, and broken as soon as they were entered into, and it doesn't matter to us by whom they were broken.  We have an idea they were not entered into for the general good of the country, but in order that the dominant party in the country might retain its dominance by reconciling its two sections.  We are told that on a certain, date certain seizures were made at the Curragh.  Certain other things were done.  That declaration of war on England and these seizures were made on the 16th June.  No, the election was on the 16th June.  That declaration and these seizures were made on the 18th June, two days after the election.  Between the 18th June and the fatal 28th June these illegal seizures at Ferguson's and other places were made, and on the 28th June the <Col N="81" /> bombardment of the Four Courts was begun.  Now we are not denying the competence of the Government to take any measures that were wanting or that they required to take at any time, but we want to know what became of all the negotiations.  Why was it that between these dates the utmost friendliness could prevail between the two sections in outside negotiations?  Aye, Mr. Chairman, on the very night before the bombardment of the Four Courts, officers of the two armies were fraternising with one another, and at four o'clock in the morning they were attempting to blow one another to pieces.  Why is it all these documents have not been produced so that the country might know?  We are not concerned with who is at fault or who is not at fault, but we want to know where the fault is.  We are not specking on behalf of the Republicans.  If they want to speak they have their own means and methods.  We are speaking for a great part of the population of the country which is suffering from the actions of the two armies, and the two sections of Sinn Fein, and the two parties in the Dáil.  The innocent people of the country have to suffer, to bleed, to starve and to die, while the Government keep all these negotiations, and the documents concerned with these negotiations, as secret and as hidden as it is possible for anyone to keep them secret and hidden.  On the 1st July the new Dáil was to assemble. How could it assemble two days after the civil war had broken out?  We asked the President on Saturday whether this was a war or a police operation.  The President has not answered that question. It was either one thing or the other thing.  It is either the one thing now, or it is the other thing.  We want to know which it is, because we wish to know where we stand.  It will be only making a debating point, and I do not want to press it at all, but the President said the hotels were seized by certain troops.  But they were destroyed by other troops.  The question raised on Saturday, and we want to raise it again to-day&mdash;a question raised outside by certain gentlemen elected as Independent representatives, and we hope they will have the courage to raise it inside&mdash; is, who is going to pay for all the destruction and the ruin?  The President has not said a single word about the <Col N="82" /> payment of these things.  We know very well who will pay in money as well as in blood for it.  We know the row there will be kicked up by the people of money in this country when this bill has to be met.  The Treaty put a big war debt on Ireland; it put obligations for a war in which we had no concern.  We will have to foot the Bill for the Irish war&mdash;for the Irish Civil War as well.  But the President is silent on it.  He does not say a single word.  He does not say how he is going to meet the obligations that the war has put on him and on us.  He has spoken about the deaths.  We all deplore the deaths that are occurring up and down Ireland.  We are deploring the deaths that are caused by the deliberate shooting of people on one side against the deliberate shooting of people on the other side.  But the President does not say a word about the scores at least, if not hundreds, of Irish boys who, for one reason or another, are accidentally shot.  I am not referring to those who are alleged to be shot escaping.  I am referring to those who are shot within the ranks of national troops by accident.  He has not a word to say about those.  He says that until all this is finished there can be no reconstruction. He says he does not want to fire the last cartridge or seize the last gun. Can he tell us, or can anybody tell us, how these things are going to be done so long as a considerable body of armed mea are in the country?  You have either got to disarm them or make, peace with them. No one knows better than those on the other side, particularly those who went through the guerilla warfare, that it will take many months, maybe many years, and a big army, and millions of pounds, to suppress a considerable body of armed troops who want to obstruct tfae Dáil and prevent the functioning of the Free State or of any State in Ireland.  He says he will go on as he is going on. And why does he not tell us what is the military position at the moment?  We know pretty well what the political situation is; we know what the social and the economic situation is&mdash;it is chaos, it is almost anarchy.  Why doesn't he tell us how much better the position is than it was on the morning of June 28.  We were told the Dáil could not meet; that it was not permitted to meet.  We were told that probably <Col N="83" /> two or three weeks would settle all.  Two or three months have gone past.  They have not settled it.  Are two or three years going to go past before these Irregulars, Republicans, or Anti-Treatyites are suppressed and disarmed? He will find in the long run, just as between England and Ireland, his friends and colleagues will sit down and come to an arrangement.  The Lord preserve us from that arrangement, if made as several were made in Ireland during the last two years.  He has nothing to say about unemployment, except that nothing will be done until this little scrap is over.  He has nothing to say about the landless men in the many parts of Ireland.  When we went to the late Executive we were told that it was not the season of the year for interfering with land.  This is the season of the year, or it is coming on?  We were told the Executive had up their sleeves plans and specifications for dealing with the land question and land problems and unemployment, only these terrible people the Irregulars would not let them do it.  There is no one here, there is no gunman up there to prevent them bringing the plans and schemes and putting them before us.  They might not put them into operation now. Let them produce them, and not let them be fooling the country, as this country is not going to be fooled all the time.  There is great support in many quarters for this Government.  The majority, the great bulk of the people, without any denial, are at the back of this Government.  They were at the back of the late John E. Redmond for many longer years than they are at the back of this movement and Party, and they are just as ready and willing to change to-morrow if thwarted as they were in 1916 and 1917.  We ask that the Government should tell us what is their policy about prisoners, and what is their policy about arming the civil forces. We were told the Criminal Investigation Department, the Civic Guard, and I suppose the D.M.P., were under the Minister of Home Affairs.  I asked on Saturday if the Army was going to be responsible to the Dáil.  I have not got an answer.  We asked on Saturday if the Government was going to continue the policy that has been carried on for two or three months all through Ireland of raiding and going into houses without <Col N="84" /> authority, without a warrant, without a scrap of paper or anything else.  Not a single answer was given to these things. We were told by the late Executive that no officer had any authority or any warrant to arrest or raid without civil warrant or authority, but it is happening not only here, but in every part of Ireland. It is happening here in Dublin every night.  It is happening to all conditions of people, civilians.  We are not talking about combatant men going out to fight, as presumably they go to fight.  If they do not go to fight, that is not our business.  From Tirconail to Cork, and from Baile a Cliath to Galliv, there are hundreds or thousands of men who can prove their cases if they are given a chance.  They got no chance; they are arrested without warrant or authority ; they are put there without trial or investigation, or hope of trial or investigation.  They are told in one breath that if they sign a form it will be all right, and then they are told that their case has to be investigated.  Who investigates the cases?  The combatants have been released, but scores, hundreds of thousands, have not been released. We asked that something should be said about the jails and barracks.  Are they under the Home Office or are they under the Minister of Defence?  I should be sorry that the jails and the conditions of the jails were under the Minister for Defence.  We all know, particularly those of you who have been in prison, that a certain amount of propaganda has always been made about barracks and prisons.  We all know that a good deal of that propaganda has been exaggerated; that little incidents have been exaggerated; but there is not a county in the 26 counties, there is not a barracks or jail out of which has not come information which is a disgrace to any Irish Government.  These things may not be true.  If not true, deny them.  We asked for something in the nature of a definition of the Army Regulations.  We have not got any. No one in Ireland knows if an Army officer is entitled to arrest or shoot.  No one knows if the operations are in charge of the civil authorities, or whether the Army is in charge.  You had to-day the arrest of a number of strikers.  It was a surprise to everyone to find that they had been arrested by the D.M.P., and not by a party of National troops.  It was <Col N="85" /> a surprise, and the reason, I suppose, was because the lawyer was on the job. The reason, I presume, was that the lawyer had been on the job to prevent a <i>faux pas</i> being made.  Last night the troops fired over the heads of pickets. Now the censorship, it is reported in the morning papers, has been removed. Hundreds of thousands of these incidents are happening up and down the country. We have no code of Army regulations. Complaints have been made by friendly foreign visitors who have travelled through Ireland on business and who have seen the condition of barracks here and there and the lack of discipline. Not a word about these things or what is going to be done to prevent these things.  Reference has also been made to the Civic Guard.  The Civic Guard, I think, deserves a place altogether to itself.  I am not going to deal with it in anything like a detailed way to-day, but I would ask the President, whether it is a fact that a special Commission was set up to enquire into the affairs of the Civic Guard, and if so, what report has that Commission made?  We have heard a good deal about Irregulars.  I have here a report from a Kildare paper, in which our old friend, John Fitzgerald, whose name will be familiar to gentlemen on the other side, set out to establish a kind of volunteer or state reserve. It states that on the motion of Capt. S. Ahern the chair was taken by Quartermaster J. J. Fitzgerald, Co.C., who amongst other things said, on the question of starting volunteers in the district, &ldquo;I appeal to every man present to join the National Volunteer Reserve. I say this, but not in the nature of a threat, that every man in this battalion area, I do not care what his age, is going to sign this declaration.  It is not coercion, but it is coercion in this sense that we want to carry it out.&rdquo; I do not know whether that is a matter for the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Home Affairs, but I think it is a matter for somebody to look after.  Jack continues: &ldquo;Those who are not present will also be asked to sign.  On those who refuse to sign that declaration punishment will be inflicted!  and they can go out and fight with the Irregulars.  They won't ride two horses, and by the time we finish we will know who are on our side.  Now we want to know all about the Civic Guard.  We want to know how <Col N="86" /> many of them are in Dublin and how many in Kildare, and about their remuneration and various other things. There are other matters which may come up later.  There are declarations and tests being put to Government Servants just as in Belfast.  I have heard about the seizure of motor cars as a very serious crime.  I have in my hand a letter from a gentleman whose motor car was seized by the First Meath Brigade of the National Army.  I am told by the Minister for Defence, and I should not expect anything else from him, that there was no particular reason why this particular car should be detained.  But it is detained, and has been detained for several weeks.  It was commandeered by a Commandant-General of the National troops.  The man whose car was commandeered is not a rich man.  He is not a man like Ferguson's.  I am not apologising for or excusing the people who went to Ferguson's.  I do not think they had any business to go there at all.  I want to refer to another statement of the President, that is with reference to peaceful negotiations and peaceful relations with Ulster.  I deny his right to talk about Ulster.  Ulster is Nine Counties and nothing less.  And of the Nine Counties of Ulster Sir James Craig's Parliament is a little Parliament for Six Counties.  In fact, it is the Parliament of one city.  He talks about peaceful negotiations and pacts, and he talks about Irregulars&mdash;Republican troops &mdash;breaking these, and fighting and smashing up and bringing on chaos.  I want an answer to one or two questions. Is it a fact that an arrangement was come to between Officers of the Four Courts and the Officers of Beggar's Bush by which certain things would be done within the Six Counties?  I want to know if anybody from the National Forces was brought to his death working in Beggars Bush on that particular Job?  It is all right to talk about peaceful relations, but if there are peaceful relations on one side there should be peaceful relations all round.</P>

      <P>Now I hope that the President will take steps to find out whether there is anything that has not been reported to him, and that there will <Col N="87" /> be no more of these secret negotiations between any section of people, in Ireland, whether armed or unarmed, whether one Government or another, and that everything shall be brought up and put before us here, and that we shall have no further secret negotiations with Belfast or London or Mallow, or wherever else the headquarters of the Irregulars may be. I want to know, and you also want to know, how much the Civic Guard is costing. It has been said that we of the Labour Movement wanted an unarmed Police Force in Ireland.  We do, but we have never suggested for a moment that at present the Force should be unarmed.  We understand the Civic Guard is being formed, not as a Peace Force or a Police Force, but just as an ordinary semi-military R.I.C.  The Minister for Home Affairs will deal with, that. There are Members of this Dáil who are, or were, in control of the Civic Guard. It is the first time in my life that I heard of the Chief Commissioner of a Police Force being a Legislator.  There are many other things now which I could go into, but I wind up with one thing. The President has said that the Executive intends to restore order and intends to make property and life respected.  I think that reveals the whole mentality of the Executive.  That property comes before life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the President says he meant it the other way, but there was no bombardment of the Four Courts until property was seized.  You are more concerned with property and rights, not rights, but seized privileges of certain sections, of certain groups in Ireland, than you are with the lives of the ordinary men and women of Ireland.  Talk about the common people of Ireland.  It is just talk. The common people of Ireland don't matter a single snap of your fingers provided that you can get into authority, and that the old gang who are looking for dead men's shoes are all right.  The President has evaded all those questions that were put to him on Saturday.  He has given us the history of Ireland for the past six months.  We want to get down to realities.  We want to get rid of the humbug and of the sentimentalities and things like that.  There is a <Col N="88" /> stern task before the people of Ireland, and if that task is not faced in the proper spirit, and with the trimmings cast aside, if we do not get at the root of this you will find that there will be no tasks before the Irish people or the Irish Nation, because there will be no Irish people or Irish Nation.</P>

      <P>There is rather an important matter of order raised by the Deputy for Mayo.  The President made certain statements covering a number of matters.  All these matters have been traversed by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon.  It seems desirable that all these matters should be open for the discussion of the Dáil.  The Motion that has been made by Deputy Sears confines the Dáil to one point.

      <P>Those who are taking part in this discussion can also take part in the discussion to-morrow.  Deputy O'Shannon, in his comments on the President's speech, said that several points raised by his side were ignored.  They were ignored by the President because he was replying to questions raised by people outside, not raised across the benches, but raised in ambushes and in burning and in other forms of destruction. Now the questions raised by the Labour Party are of considerable importance, but the question troubling the country at present is the question dealt with by the President.  The country wants to know if this policy of destruction is to continue from one end of the land to the other, and what are the intentions of the Government. Every Deputy in this Dáil that has gone through the country has been met with the question as to the origin of the present war, and the President dealt with the very root of the matter in connection with this.  Undoubtedly there are instances&mdash;questions like the Civic Guard, or questions like the Military Code, that Deputy Shannon raised.  The Government is fully prepared to meet all those questions, but after the President's <Col N="92" /> statement, the question which concerns this Dáil and the country primarily is the general policy of the Government. It is necessary that that general policy should receive the approval or disapproval of the Dáil, and afterwards any minor matters could be dealt with, whether the Civic Guard should be armed or not, or any other question raised by Deputy O'Shannon.  Those on this side of the Dáil fully sympathise with the expressions of sympathy by Deputy O'Shannon as to the sufferings of the people and as to their liability for the cost of the war now proceeding in Ireland, and we yield to no one in our sympathy for those.  But there is a more vital question as to the rights or wrongs of this fight that is now going on and that cannot be pushed aside.  You have to take a part, one way or another as to that, openly and above board.  The other questions&mdash;whether the Civic Police should be armed or not, and as to the condition of the gaols&mdash;are important too.  We have sympathy for everyone suffering. But the chief question is this&mdash;are the majority of the people to prevail, or is the minority to rule, because the minority has a larger proportion of revolvers than the majority?  That is the first question to be settled.  The country looks at this Dáil to take a decided attitude one way or the other in connection with the policy of frightfulness, which is driving this country into ruin and disaster.</P>

      <P>The remarks of the President in his address were that he did not mean to continue the fight to the last cartridge.  He was asked questions from the Labour benches on last Saturday as to his intention with respect to the unemployed.  So far he has not yet answered the most important question which a Labour man could put before the Dáil.  We have hundreds and thousands of unemployed owing to the political state at the present time.  I know personally that a great deal of destruction has been done.  Questions have been asked as to who will pay or who will foot the bill.  Personally I know that a great deal of the Deputies here represent the ratepayers, and I know also, as well as they do, that when it comes to the day of payment for this destruction, the common working man is the one who pays the greatest part of it.  He may not be a great ratepayer, but he will have to pay <Col N="93" /> for the necessaries of life to keep his family and body and soul together.  The Minister for Defence is at present plotting and planning to reduce the wages of some of those who will suffer later on.  I do not say that the President will not answer the questions put to him by the Labour Party last Saturday.  We have listened to his history of the Irish Movement since 1916.  He explained to us in detail the negotiations which took place up to the fighting of the Four Courts, but as Deputy Cathal O'Shannon says, why was not all this correspondence published, so that the whole Irish Nation would be able to see it?  Are we to continue in the future as you have continued in the past by keeping every negotiation and every promise made to one side or the other a secret to yourselves, or will this Parliament be like the Ulster Parliament, not a Parliament of the people, but a Parliament of jobs?  Personally I do not say that this Parliament shall be such, but if we are to continue and, if we want to bring peace to the country, it is no use sending out armed lorries at night, it is no use to have your soldiers firing shots in the street.  Outside in the villages you will find shots going off in the night. This thing must be stopped.  Why does not the Minister for Defence and the President see to it?  If the question is asked we have to give notice, and when notice comes on it will be the same as the English policy in years past&mdash;&ldquo; Wait and see.&rdquo; I want to ask the President one question.  I know the people who are put down as being anti-Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know did this Government give those Deputies the same facilities as was given to the Deputies of Dáil Eireann in 1920 by the British Government, namely, the guarantee that if they entered this Parliament they would not have been arrested, and did this Government or the Cabinet Ministers of this Government offer to release any of the T.D.'s arrested on the opposite side in order that they could attend this meeting if they thought well.  There is another question I would like to put before the President, that is the question of unemployment. He says that nothing can he done for the unemployed until such time as the present warfare is settled. If we cannot assist the unemployed until you have succeeded in patting down this armed body which is up against the working of the Government <Col N="94" /> what steps should we take?  What are you to do?  Are you to see hundreds and thousands of children dying of starvation, and thousands of workmen thrown out of employment?  Are you going to tolerate propaganda from any opposite section?  Your first duty would be to relieve the unemployed by giving an advance of money to each public council in order that they may start schemes of industry to give employment to the unemployed.  If you do that you will have the country much more in favour of you than you have now, because the people will see that this Parliament is a Parliament out for the industrial welfare of the nation, and not for the destruction of public property.</P>

      <P>There were some remarks made by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon to-day to which I propose to refer.  One remark was &ldquo;I want to get rid of humbug, I want to get down to realities.&rdquo; I say that is a laudable ambition.  I share it also.  I want to get rid of humbug and get down to realities. The principal reality with which this Parliament is faced is the object for which it came into being&mdash;the establishment of the State with a Constitution in accordance with the Treaty signed in London on the 6th December last. Another reality we have to face is that basic principles are challenged, and until they are vindicated there can be no democratic state established in Ireland. Democracy!  I was surprised that the leaders of the Labour Party should show, so little appreciation of the real meaning of democracy.  I have a shrewd suspicion that I am a better democrat than Deputy O'Shannon, because I believe in the rule of all the people, whereas I am inclined to think Deputy O'Shannon believes rather in the rule of a section of the people.</P>

      <P>In an opening statement the President could not very well cover all that ground, but I think his statement covered the thing that matters most to this Parliament, aud that is whether this Parliament is to be the ruling voice of the Nation outside, deciding all issues of policy, great or small.

      <P>The last Dail approved of a particular Treaty, knowing well that in doing so it was voicing the will of the people, that it spoke through the authentic voice of the people of Ireland.  It is not quite in order to say that because the people of Ireland were not confronted with a perfectly free choice that it was not their will but their fear.  That was an epigram raised by Or Deputy at the last Dáil.  It was pointed out that the people of Ireland were confronted with a state of facts that they were powerless to alter.  To say that we are not free to judge on that set of circumstances and free to choose within these circumstances is unsound; to say that people have no right to do wrong is merely a clever epigram.  Mankind down through the ages has found no surer rudder or base of guidance in difficult phases than the free will of the community democratically expressed.  Now the Dáil, the elected representatives of the people, came to a certain decision. In such an election as it was possible to hold the people endorsed that decision, and certain armed men within the Nation said &ldquo;not so but otherwise, because we will it.  This course is wrong because it does not meet with the approval of our minds.&rdquo; They are now in arms against the people of Ireland and against the people's Parliament and the people's Government, and until that issue is decided there can be no democratic State founded here.  I submit that the thing that matters most to the Parliament is whether <Col N="96" /> this Parliament is to be a mere talking-shop or whether what it says holds in this country.  You cannot build where foundations are challenged; the issue must be decided one way or the other, and the chief business of this Parliament is to decide it.  I submit that the chief and primary duty of the Parliament is to decide whether it is going to give its whole support to the Government it has elected in deciding that issue.  One does not usually build in the path of a forest fire, one gets after the fire and faces the building afterwards.  We have been asked about unemployment; surely it is wheels within wheels.  Surely the thing that makes most for unemployment is the fact that there is no credit, no security and no system of justice&mdash;the fact that every man who has a five-pound note is sitting on it.  Until you re-establish normal conditions, unemployment will go on increasing, and no man and no Government could stop it.  Let us then consider arid follow the excellent advice of Deputy O'Shannon and get rid of the humbug and get down to realities.  He did cover some points in which I am interested and of which I have some little knowledge.  He spoke of prisoners and their right to trial and their right to very careful consideration of their cases.  Now the decision with regard to prisoners was this, that any man who recognised and signed a simple statement to the effect that he recognised the supremacy of the Parliament elected by the Irish people, and that he would not interfere unlawfully with the, person or property of his neighbours, that man's case was immediately considered, and in the early days of this fight men who signed that form were almost automatically released.  Then. there were some shocks; men who signed that form were found again in arms against the Government elected by the Irish people; and again interfering with the property of their neighbour.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, while the Minister for Home Affairs is dealing with the question of prisoners and the signing of the form, may I ask him whether the twenty-six or twenty-eight Derry prisoners in Kilmainham jail, who signed the form, have had their cases investigated?</P>

      <P>I would be glad to give the information at another <Col N="97" /> time; but, in fact, it is more properly a question for the Minister for Defence.  I am sure he will be glad to give a thorough explanation with regard to the Derry prisoners.  Now, one of the shocks we received in connection with the signing of the form was the case of three men from Dublin who were arrested at Athenry and sent to Galway prison.  In the pockets of one of them was found a letter from his father giving him eminently sound advice, saying he heard he was going wrong, asking him not to be a fool, and pointing out that he had never given him bad advice in his life.  Shortly after this young man arrived in Galway jail, he wrote to a young lady in Dublin and the letter started:&mdash;&ldquo;Such and such a cell, 7th year of the Republic.&rdquo; In the course of his letter he stated he was on his way to join a flying column in Galway when he was arrested.  Ten days after that he signed a form and made a statement to the effect that he had not any connection with the Irregulars and, it was almost superfluous to add, he would not have anything to do with them. While he was awaiting his more or less automatic release he wrote a letter to a friend in Dublin which, because we are not dealing with this man now, but with a type, I propose to read to this Dáil. It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Monday night, Galway Jail, No. 4 Cell, 7th year of the Republic.  Dear Billy&mdash;Just a line in answer to your welcome and lengthy letter which I received on Sunday.  I thought that you were gone down South but I suppose you gave it the slip.  All that I am thinking of is where to get guns when we get out, because I want a talk to some Bank managers and a few Railway Clerks.  So for God's sake if you drop across any keep them safe because I don't think we will be here very long.  If you are saying anything about guns in your letter just mention them as B.G. and I will know what you mean.  ...has been telling us some dead snips in places where he worked, and we mean to pull them off when we get out.  Even if you only get two B.G.'s keep one safe for me. It is getting dark now and I cannot write any more for the present, but the next letter I write I will tell you everything.  Do not say anything about the F.S. as all letters are censored. I get these out by a warder.  It is dark now and I do not know what I am writing, but I will write soon again.  Good-bye for the present.  I remain your old friend, Eddie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, but I do not propose to read it out to the Dáil, because it contains some rather foul language.  Now, that is not the case of the writer, but the writer <Col N="98" /> is a type, and in that single document you have embodied the disintegration that is at present proceeding apace in this country&mdash;the moral disintegration.  If we in this Parliament do not do the duty we are sent here to do, if we do not face the facts, then there will be no democratic State established in Ireland.  This will not be the Irish Nation, for it will go down in chaos, in anarchy, and in futility. Let us face the big thing; let us lay our foundations steady and sure; let us put a firm, cool grip on this fever-stricken land, or we are no Parliament, and we are not doing the duty the people of Ireland sent us here to do.  I gather Deputy O'Shannon had not a very high opinion of the Government.  I wonder if anything the President could have said would have improved his opinion of the Government. Surely we must all face the big fact that the question in this strife that is proceeding is whether the people shall rule in Ireland, or whether a clique of neurotics, a clique of pseudo-intellectuals, shall rule by the force of the revolver.  I would appeal, not merely to the Labour Party, but to every section of the Dáil, for a little sympathetic appreciation of the difficulties that the Government is faced with and of the tremendous responsibilities on its shoulders. I do think there might have been a more emphatic endorsement of the grave step that had to be taken by the Provisional Government&mdash;the gravest step ever taken by representative Irishmen, perhaps, in the history of the country.  We believe, and we still believe, that had we not taken this step this Parliament would not have met, and the very existence of the Parliament was at stake.  We had very good reasons to believe that we anticipated by a couple of hours the creation of conditions under which this Parliament never-would have met&mdash;conditions that would have brought back the British power&mdash; horse, foot, artillery and Navy&mdash;in hostile relations to this country.  And so we acted as we were bound to act, interpreting our oaths in the way they were interpreted by one who is not here to-day, by doing our best for the Irish Nation in any circumstances that would arise.  And we did what we thought best in the circumstances that did arise, and it is not fair or decent that we should be left, like Mahomet's coffin, suspended in mid-air. Why is there neither an endorsement nor a repudiation of the step we took?  Let it be repudiated, and there is an obvious <Col N="99" /> course for those who took the step&mdash;an obvious course which, if we only considered ourselves personally, would be a blessed relief.  Let us get rid of the humbug and get down to the realities.  We want to function as the first native administration in a century and a half.  We want to function as a Government responsible to the people.  We want this Parliament to be a real Parliament.  We want things discussed and decided here and to be carried out, and we do not want things decided otherwise than democratically. I hope I am a democrat and have a due appreciation of the relations that should exist between one holding the position I occupy in the country and the people of the country.  I think we all have it. I think we all understand the relations that should exist, what we are fighting for and will continue to fight for, to settle Ireland and put into the hands of the people of Ireland the administration of their own affairs and the making of their own laws&mdash;the making or changing of their own laws&mdash;regulating their own development, and the sovereignty of the people's will.  Surely we will get from that Party which claims to be above all things democratic, a measure of strong support to establish the sovereignty of the people's will.  I think we will, for I believe that they are sent here as Labour Representatives to this Parliament with the sound sense and true instinct of nationality.  The men that sent them proved it in the conflict with the British, and I know the men who sent them would not wish for mere carping or captious criticism for striving to establish sovereignty of the people's will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. W. DAVIN Mr. W. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. DAVIN:</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise as one of the young children that has found a home for the first time in an Irish Parliament, and I do say quite frankly, not for the purpose of placing a wrong construction or meaning on any words used by ministers or members of this Dáil, that the Minister for Home Affairs and the other Ministers in this Dáil can take it that our presence here is a proof that we are prepared to help them to put into operation the Treaty which was ratified by a majority of the representatives of the second Dáil.  Therefore I hope any other Ministers will not question our attitude on that particular matter.  I will say also quite frankly that so far as the President's statement is concerned it was more an explanation of <Col N="100" /> what has been done in the past than what he is determined to do in the future.  I must say he was quite frank and straightforward as far as I could follow.  I am surprised that the President in his statement did not outline in some detail the policy which he intended to pursue in regard to the things going on in the country at the present time.  I think he had a right to recognise&mdash;as some of us here must recognise&mdash;what is going on in our constituencies&mdash;that there has been a certain form of collapse so far as Local Government is concerned in this country. We all know what it is due to.  We know that for want of Local Government it is impossible to carry on the work of reconstruction. You have at the present time to face the fact that the County Councils are not getting the rates, and in one division of the area represented by myself and the Minister for Home Affairs the rates due amount to about £35,000. I want to know what steps are to be taken to have these rates recovered.  We, as Irish people, have always claimed our rights as citizens and I would say to the President as we claim our rights as citizens so the Head of the Government functioning in the country is bound to point out to the people who are not doing their duty that they have a responsibility, and to the ratepayers who refuse to pay rates, for reasons we do not understand, that if they do not do so the Local Government Board will take whatever measures they intend to take to make them.  The objection, so far as I can gather from it, is more concerned with the desire to place responsibility for the operations that started on the 28th June on the right shoulder.  Personally I believe the condition of affairs, as we see it to-day, is due, and due alone, to the split that took place in the Army in the beginning of this year.  Those men will have a heavy responsibility resting on their shoulders, for the split in the Army would not have arisen, I believe, but for the fact that you had in the second Dáil and in this Dáil, men who hold positions in the Army and at the same time pose as representatives of the people.  That may happen in regard to the troops of the Provisional Government in the future, as it has happened in the split in the Army. If you allow men to hold positions in the Army, on active service particularly, and if, at the same time, the people elect them to this Assembly, I hold he cannot <Col N="101" /> be master and servant at the same time, and when that man feels dissatisfied in this Dáil on questions of policy, he goes back to the division in the Army from which he came and creates division that should never exist.  The Pact has been talked of to considerable extent here. The Pact, in my opinion, was an agreement, at least it was stated to be an agreement, upon matters, upon which we did not know the people agreed to.  It was nothing more than an agreement between two contending parties both of them connected with the Dáil without consulting the people.  The Pact admitted that every interest in this nation had a right to representation, but what did we find when we went to the constituencies Many of the members sitting in these benches had revolvers and guns used against them by people who were party to that Pact.  I will take the case of North West Dublin, where there were four Treaty candidates.  The Civic Guard as I understand have been trained and paid by the people of Ireland to administer the laws that are made in this Parliament, impartially between one section and another.  That Civic Guard, as far as I understand it, were brought out&mdash;mind you, the Minister of the Civic Guard was candidate in that division&mdash;in mufti in the North West Division and used to go around in tenders of the Provisional Government to defeat the member put up by the Labour Party.  I make this statement, and I hope those responsible will enquire into it and repudiate it if I am wrong.  At any rate this is one instance where the pro-Treaty Party is concerned, where the Pact was not carried out in our case.  I will go further and say that a Commandant in the Army who was, as far as I know, an Assistant Commissioner at the time, stood outside one of the polling booths and shouted out: &ldquo;Don't vote for the Labour Candidate, a man who scabbed or black-legged in 1913 or 1914.&rdquo; I challenge anyone in this Dáil to prove that the man who went forward ever scabbed or black-legged.  I am only giving this example to the Benches opposite to show that the Pact was not carried out by yourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, and I am sure for the first time, and it is of great interest to the people of this Dáil, and the people of Ireland, a full explanation in regard to the Army Convention, and the cause of <Col N="102" /> the breakdown of that Convention.  So far as I am concerned, and I say it without fear or favour as regards one side or the other, if the Executive of the Irregular Forces stood for a Military Dictatorship I would not countenance that.  I have been anti-Military all my life; I am up against Militarism whether it is on the side of the Republic or on the side of the Free State Forces.  Perhaps it would be of interest to the Minister for Home Affairs if I read for him an incident in connection with the Free State Forces in one of our Constituencies&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Portlaoighise.&rdquo;&ldquo;As a member of the Irish Transport Workers and General Workers' Union I beg to bring under your notice the conduct of the Officer Commanding the Free State troops in this town. He raided the Gas Works at 12.45 on the morning of the 26th August, and assaulted me and put a revolver to my breast, and said he would plug me and the bastard of a Manager, and he would also blow the place to hell as it was us that made the mine that killed his men at Abbeyleix, and the Manager might clear out from Maryborough or he would do for him. Trusting you will bring this matter up at the Dáil, and have a stop put to these &lsquo;Black and Tan&rsquo; methods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs, who is the responsible Minister of the Government, will see that discipline is kept in hand, and if there is a charge such as this brought against any particular person that they will arrest him and give him a fair trial by his countrymen.  I realise fully, as a responsible member of this Dáil, that no amount of criticism or discussion can undo what has been done in this Dáil on the 28th June.  I would ask the people of Ireland, who are the judges of what happens in this Dáil, and the judges of the Government to place the responsibility on the proper shoulders when the next election takes place.  In saying that I do not want to be understood as making an election speech; as a matter of fact I could compliment the Minister for Home Affairs, and when I was listening to him I could almost believe he was a member of the Labour Party as regards part of what he said. He said many things uncomplimentary, but then he came along at the end of his <Col N="103" /> statement and glossed them over.  He said that a coup was being made at a particular time for the purpose of bringing England back to this country. That is the first statement we have heard about that.  We are glad if criticism brings out a statement like that. No member of this Dáil could object to reasonable criticism.  We are not here for the purpose of exploding any bombs.  We are here to help so far as we can by constructive criticism this Nation on its feet once more.  I will say this that I regret the state of affairs in Ireland to-day.  I do not believe that the shooting of one Irishman by another is going to end this business.  I believe no matter how we differ as Irishmen that we cannot solve our differences by shooting one another down.  I only hope that the Executive forces who are responsible for the document read by the President would take that view, and among these people there are as good Irishmen as in the Free State Forces. If they took that view we could hope for reconstruction.  One of the members of the Pro-Treaty Party stated that the people of Ireland were looking to this Dáil to save the situation, but the Dáil are looking to the people of Ireland. Every member of this Dáil will recognise a certain lack of moral courage that is helping to bring about the economic collapse of this Nation.  If the Nation is going to be saved it is only going to be saved by the people who can take one of two roads.  There are only two roads&mdash;the road to destruction, and the road to the building up of this Nation. I am a Republican in so far as that I do not believe in the Monarchical system. I accept the Treaty not as an end to anything we have been looking for, but as a means to an end.  I will never recognise so far as my conscience is concerned the right of any man in any country to be the nominal head of that country simply because he is the son of his father.  I am opposed to any principle of Government dominated by the Monarchical system.  I have to ask myself arising out of that whether the difference between the Treaty, and what can be got by the only alternative, Document No. 2&mdash;is worth the shooting of one Irishman by another.  I am not speaking for the Party; I am speaking personally.  This Document No. 2, so far as I could follow it, was not Republican <Col N="104" /> system of Government.  It meant that they were prepared to accept association with England by an arrangement under which England's King was head.  In any arrangement by which the Monarchical system is recognised there is from the Republican point of view no difference between one document and another.  I would ask the President particularly when he is replying to the question to deal with matters affecting the Local Government because if we allow matters as regards Local Government to collapse there is no hope for the Nation, and we of this Dáil cannot do anything to build up this Nation again.  We have been told from the Ministerial Benches that we are children in National Government.  In this connection I want to refer to a letter of Winston Churchill's written to the then Acting Head of the Irish Government concerning compensation for loss during the Anglo-Irish war.  I am not aware of what arrangement was entered into between England and Ireland on that matter, but I hope the Chairman will communicate with Mr. Churchill on this subject and tell him that the people of this Dáil or Nation are not children; that the Treaty has been accepted, and that it is open to us to put our own interpretation on the Constitution.  That is for this country, and it is for him to look after general reparations and mind his own business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is not at all unsatisfactory from the point of view of members sitting on those Benches that a question of this kind should arise so early in the history of the Dáil, and in the history, as I say, of a Government which was appointed but yesterday.  It is much more satisfactory to this particular group of the Dáil to deal with such a matter than with <Col N="109" /> matters which are more germane perhaps to the interests of other parties in the Dáil than this.  A statement appeared in this morning's paper, issued as it is said by the Home Affairs Department. It reads as follows: &ldquo;The Government does not recognise the right of Civil Servants to strike.  In the event of a cessation of work by any section of the Postal Service picketing such as is permitted in connection with industrial strikes will not be allowed. The Government has determined to offer the fullest protection to those Officers who, remaining loyal to the Government, continue to carry out their duties.  The Post Office Service is a vital State service. The Government is prepared to use, if necessary, all the forces at its disposal to ensure that no official who continues his service to the State is subjected to interference or intimidation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion that I propose to move is:&mdash;&ldquo;That this Dáil repudiates the statement issued by the Minister for Home Affairs beginning with the words &lsquo;that the Government does not recognise the right of Civil Servants to strike.&rsquo;&rdquo; Those are the words which I desire particularly to lay emphasis upon.  We had earlier in the day a statement by the Minister for Home Affairs that he was a good democrat, and all his professions were in favour of what he considered to be Democracy.  Now here we have a test. Here we have a test, a test not only of the Minister's democracy, but a test of the genuineness of the professions of human liberty which the Members of this Dáil have been protesting the last&mdash; how many years I do not know.  We are going to test to-night whether the demand for National liberty was impelled by mere hatred, distrust, dislike, envy of England, or whether it really had its roots in the desire for emancipation of the Nation or of the people, or of an individual from tyranny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are up against the question of the rights of men to combine, the rights of men to refuse to work for an employer under conditions fixed by that employer; we are up against the question whether a man or a woman entering the service of any employer, be that employer a private person or a Government, thereby sells his soul as well as his body to that employer. We are faced with the question of the <Col N="110" /> status of the human being in his social relations.  The Ministry for whom the Minister for Home Affairs speaks in this matter evidently conceives that once a person enters the employment of a Government he is not only selling his bodily powers, and mental powers, but he is selling his liberty, selling his soul. I can understand men who have been protesting against the intervention of State in commerce and in industry trying to make it an object lesson.  We have been told in evidence before the Railway Commission and in the public Press times without number, practically that the State is the very devil, and I take it that the Ministry wants to prove that the man or the woman who enters the services of the State is damnified hereafter, having sold his soul to that devil! I wonder whether the Democrats have considered how the working classes of these and other countries have arrived at the present stage of comparative freedom?  Do they know anything about the development of the Industrial movement, the struggle against the combination laws, the struggle for the right to bargain collectively; the struggle for the right to strike: do they think that the workers of this country are going to accept the position which places one section of the workers obviously and clearly in the category of slaves?  The Government does not recognise the right of certain Civil Servants to strike; it does not recognise the right of certain men to refuse to work and to take the consequences.  If it is a crime, prosecute them.  If it is an offence take it to the Courts; but to utter as a Ministerial statement that the Government does not recognise the right of Civil Servants to strike practically tells the Civil Servants that they have bound themselves body and soul to the State.  We are classed as amongst those who would ask the Government to take possession of the bodies and souls of the workers when entering into Government service when we talk of nationalisation.  Here you have the Ministry definitely laying down that those who have entered their service have given up their liberties. We repudiate that, and we say if you intend to pursue that policy we are going to get up against you every organised worker in Ireland.  This is directed particularly against Postal Servants who have decided to withdraw their labour, <Col N="111" /> because of an alteration by the employers in the conditions of their service.  English law at any rate recognised the right of any body of workmen to withdraw their labour.  It is not an offence.  If it is an offence, prosecute.  But the Irish Government's first act is to utter a statement to the effect that the man who has entered the State service has no longer the freedom to withdraw his labour.  But what is the occasion for this statement?  It is argued, it was argued officially on Saturday that the price of the labour these men have sold, or the price of similar labour in England, has gone down, that the price of similar labour in the North of Ireland has cheapened, and, therefore, it is said, &ldquo;You postal men must reduce the price of your labour&rdquo;; and when they decline to do that at the instigation, at the command of the Post Office Authorities and the Government, then they are told that they have no right to withdraw their labour, that the Government does not recognise the right to strike, and they are going to use all the force at their command to prevent them from exercising what has been allowed and is allowed in every organisation in these countries.  We want to put it to the Minister and put it to the Dáil: is the future going to be whatever appertains in England with regard to wages, with regard to the conditions of labour, whatever appertains in the North of Ireland with regard to the wages and the conditions of labour must also appertain to this part of Ireland?  Shall we go a little further and say if the price of labour is reduced in Germany, in Austria or China that the price of labour in Ireland must go down equally.  We want to know definitely whether it is your intention to treat the Irishmen in public service on the basis of conditions in Ireland, and whether you are going to deprive the men and women organised in any combination to exercise the rights which they have won and their fathers before them have won, to secure improvements and to resist&mdash; and this is more important&mdash;declinations in their conditions of life.  We heard a remark passed by one of the Ministers&mdash; the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;on Saturday about the slave mind.  I tell him and I tell the Minister for Home Affairs that a much more undesirable state of mind is that of the slave-owner, and it is the slave-owner's mind that issues a statement of that kind as it was the slave-owner's <Col N="112" /> mind that sent a telegram to the P.M.G. of England asking for black-legs last March.</P>

      <P>We trade unionists are often taunted with seeking nothing but higher wages and shorter hours. That is a libel upon the Trade Unions of to-day.  Here we have a test.  We are thinking in this of the status of the human being and we deny the right of any employer to say it is an illegal thing or that it is not within the competence of any workman or body of workers to withdraw their labour.  I submit that this right to strike is the one fundamental right, the one fundamental liberty which is left to the landless man, the proletarian.  Refuse him that right and he has nothing left but slavery.  You want to bind him to his employer on terms and conditions which you want to set yourselves; without consultation, without negotiation, and without consideration. I am not concerned with the issue of the strike at all, but I am concerned sincerely and honestly to save the Government in Ireland, to save this Provisional Government, this Dáil, to save these people from committing a cardinal error at this period of their history.  We were asked by the Minister for Home Affairs in the last debate if we could not recognise their difficulties.</P>

I therefore move:&mdash;&ldquo;That this Dáil repudiates the statement issued by the Minister for Home Affairs beginning with the words &lsquo;the Government does not recognise the right of Civil Servants to strike.&rsquo;&rdquo; I would ask the Minister before the debate closes to consider seriously the contention which this document will raise, and trust that he will withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I beg to second this, and I would like to call the attention of the Dáil to a statement issued on Saturday last on the cost of living figures in Irish departments and English departments.  We are accused of having a slave mind because we saw something worse coming out of an Irish department than we saw coming out of an English department. Labour Members generally claim that the Minister for Home Affairs' statement was really meant as it reads.  The person or persons responsible for it were really trying not alone to imitate the doings of British Government departments, but they were trying to be even worse than England, for in England and other civilised countries of the world there have been attempts by the workers to organise Labour Unions, and in all these countries there have been attempts by the Government on behalf of the property owners to prevent the workers organising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For over forty years, according to British law, any man or woman of the working class has a perfect right, not alone to withdraw his labour, but to carry on picketing operations in order to persuade other workers from attempting to carry out the operations they refuse to perform for a certain definite reason.  There was also, in what happened last night in Crown Alley an attempt on the part of one of the Departments of this Government to outdo the worst over done by a British Government Department.  In any strike in England, there was never any attempt on the part of the British Government to interfere with ordinary picketing.  It was only when the pickets attempted to molest strike-breakers, or would-be strike breakers, that the civil authorities, through the police, interfered, and, even in these cases, the civil police always made the first move, and it was only when the civil police found that, with their batons, they could not overcome the pickets, that they called in the military.  In Crown Alley about 6 o'clock yesterday evening, before the civil police forces&mdash;the Civic Guard or the D.M.P.&mdash;had notified the pickets they were doing wrong, and even before the pickets knew themselves they were doing wrong, they were fired, upon&mdash;although the shots were fired over their heads&mdash; by members of the Free State Army.  We claim that is hitting up against the rights <Col N="114" /> of the working classes in this country, and we want the Minister either to withdraw that proclamation or statement that was issued, or, if not, we want the Members, generally, of this Dáil to repudiate the action, and to give an equal chance to the workers of this country to carry on their ordinary operations&mdash;as they have a perfect right to do&mdash;as is given to the workers of any other country.  I, therefore, beg to second the resolution proposed by Mr. Johnson.</P>

      <P>I was so much carried away by Mr. Johnson's enthusiasm over the right to strike that, for the moment, I was almost tempted to strike myself.  He has raised the question as to why, so early in this native administration, we get up against a particular point.  A fair question.  There is the responsibility on us, just because we are beginning that the precedents we set, and the precedents we hand on to succeeding Governments, shall be sound precedents, healthy precedents, that will not re-act disastrously on the Irish State and on the Irish nation.  And so, we have to be, in a sense, even more jealous and even more vigilant than old established Governments. There was a good deal of general talk about selling souls.  In that particular market the Government are not buyers.  I want that to be carefully understood. There was talk on generalities, as if it were the right of anyone to strike when challenged.  I want it to be carefully kept in mind that is not the situation. There was general talk as if it were the right of picketing in any dispute, and I want it to be carefully kept in mind that is not the situation.</P>

      <P>Postal workers.  Now, the Civil Servant is in a very special position.  He is a servant of the State, a servant of the Parliament.  He is carrying on vital executive functions.  No State, with any regard for its own safety, can admit the right of the servant's of the Executive to withdraw their labour at pleasure.  They have the right to resign; they have no right to strike. Because of the peculiar position they occupy, they have certain advantages&mdash; certain hours, certain tenure, certain pension rights&mdash;and every person joining the Civil Service knows well the conditions on which he joins.  The question of the right to strike depends on the terms and conditions of employment, and Civil Servants are employed at pleasure. Suppose we take the position of a Police Force, or the position of the Army. Have they the right to strike?  Could any Government recognise it, or has any Government recognised it?  There is not a strict analogy, I grant you.  The Civil Servant occupies an intermediate position as between the members of an army or Police force and industrial workers.  In one sense the discipline is not so rigid; in another sense certain recognised rights of industrial workers are denied, and must be denied, if the State will preserve itself.  Now, as to why this was raised so early.  It was raised so early because it was vital.  If Parliament wishes to change it Parliament can, no doubt, change it.  It is sovereign in this land, and it can repudiate the act of any individual, or the act of any State Department.  But I would ask Parliament to consider very carefully <Col N="116" /> where this leads&mdash;to consider it in all its bearings, in all its reactions, in all its tendencies, and to remember that the State, as the supreme authority in the land, must hold for itself&mdash;must arrogate to itself&mdash;certain definite rights which are not conceded to individuals, and must have at its disposal an Executive and officials who, while they are perfectly free to resign, cannot, at whim, take advantage of circumstances which to them seem favourable to suddenly withdraw their labour.  An incident has been mentioned in Crown Alley.  Let me mention another incident.  At Amiens Street telegraph office the wire's and machinery were smashed and the Press wires to the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> and the <i>Independent</i> were cut.  Sabotage.  Let me mention that this question of picketing is not unimportant.  In the special conditions that exist in this country, the safeguarding of public buildings is a very real and a very serious problem, and we will not put Government servants&mdash; either military or police&mdash;in the position that a picket may be used as a screen for the sniper with bomb or rifle or revolver.  The right to strike and the enthusiasm of it was very touching; but members should not be misled by generalities; members must not be misled by emotional talk; members must understand if this State is to be founded, if it is to live and flourish, it must be able to depend on loyal and constant service from its officials.  In the position for which I am responsible to Parliament for the affairs of my Department, facing that position, I say I would have done a criminal thing if I had failed to issue that notice, and issue it promptly, the minute this problem arose.  A criminal thing.  Here, at the very birth and infancy of this State I would have set a precedent which, enlarged and acted upon later on, would lead to the destruction of the State.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate to protest as strongly as it is in my power to protest, against the right of the Government to claim as employers a right which no other employer can claim or has claimed.  I do not wish&mdash;I want to make it quite clear&mdash;we do not wish to discuss the merits of the present Post Office strike.  It has nothing to do with the immediate question <Col N="117" /> at issue.  As we look at it, this is a dispute between employers and their employés, and the dispute is just an ordinary dispute about wages.  If the Government has the right because it has the power, perhaps, to show that its employés should not strike, and if that is put into practice there is no reason why it should not go further.  We may have, and we hope to see, in the future a system of localised Police under the control of the local, municipal or county, administrative bodies, and let us suppose that some of the services controlled by these municipal or county bodies&mdash;such as electric light or work on the roads&mdash;and that workers on these services decided to go on strike on the matter of wages pure and simple, are we to take it that the administrative body, because of their control of the Police Force, could instruct that Police Force to take action even to the extent of the action that was taken in this instance, to take action against those workers? There is no reason why it should not spread to the great industrial work, and there is no reason why, if this is agreed upon, why a huge concern like Ford's could not organise its own police force to deal with their employés when they insist on their right to strike in connection with their wages disputes.  Now, it has been put forward by the Minister for Home Affairs that the Army have not the right to strike.  Are we to imply from that that the same conditions as apply in the Army are to be introduced into the Civil workers; or the system by which Civil workers work for the Government?  Is that the implication?  If that is so, then as soon as they set about regimentalising them and drilling them and ordering them to do just as they do in the Army, the better.  Then we will know where we stand, but that, I take it, is the implication, and if it is, it is Militarism naked and unashamed.  I can see no difference really except the difference in degree between what the Minister for Home Affairs contends should be the attitude of the Government and this militaristic attitude.  It betrays the militaristic state of mind on the part of those who issued it.  Now it is to me a matter for great surprise that the Government which claims to be democratic, and rightly so claims to be democratic, should adopt this attitude, and that at the time when the tendency <Col N="118" /> of the British Government with its workers is altogether the other way.  We know that during the past few years the English Government has set up a special Arbitration Board to deal with claims of Civil Servants, and has met representatives of Civil Servants, and discussed wages and conditions with them, and has set up Whitley Councils to meet representatives of the workers and Civil Servants, and this is a thing which I understand this Government or some Departments of it have up to the present refused to do.  Now why is a new Government claiming to be democratic afraid to deal with its workers and servants in a less democratic way than the Government which we have always been led to believe was an aristocratic Government? I would make a special appeal to all the Members of the Dáil to look at this matter from an independent point of view; it has already been declared in our statement, of policy here that we are not here to obstruct the Government in any way, but to criticise them and in a matter of this kind to oppose them as far as lies in our power to oppose them when they are doing what they should not be doing.  And I would appeal to Members not to vote on this matter simply on a Party ticket but to express their independent opinions as to whether or not a Government a body of employers has a right to claim privilege which no other body of employers can claim or would be allowed to claim, and which the Government themselves would deny that body of employers.</P>

      <P>Mr. Johnson began this debate by stating that this Government had taken up a certain attitude in regard to its Civil Servants, which no other Government would attempt to take up. Now the Minister for Home Affairs dealt with that, and he dealt with it so effectively that Deputy O'Connell takes up a totally different attitude.  His grievance is not that this Government is dealing with its Civil Servants in a different way from any other Government, but that this Government is making a distinction between Civil Servants and employés in an industrial concern.  It is well to have that much clear and to have taken the case that much far any way.  The Minister for Home Affairs stated, and he has not been contradicted, that no <Col N="119" /> Government in Europe recognises the right of its Civil Servants to strike, and recognises the inference from that, the right to picket.  That is so, and it simply cannot be contradicted.  Mr. O'Higgins gave you an example of an attempt in England on the part of Civil Servants to strike, and he gave you the result also, and that result is unchallenged and not protested against by the Labour Party in England.  Now, Deputy O'Connell professes to be afraid that this principle will spread through the Civil Service to industrial workers. Well, there is really no fear.  The principle has been spreading in the other direction.  But the real fact is now that certain people think that this is the proper moment to extend the principle from industrial workers to Civil Servants in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that it does not.  But we hope to persuade anybody who is malong those assumptions that those assumptions are unfounded, and that you cannot try it on us.  Now, it is perfectly obvious, it is perfectly evident, that there is good reason for denying this right to Civil Servants.  They have pensions, they have special hours, they have special conditions in other respects, and they have them as compensation for, if you like, this disadvantage; and they have that because it is universally recognised that the services which Civil Servants are engaged in administering are services <Col N="120" /> which are vital to the State, and services which should not be jeopardised at a moment's notice or at a mere whim. The terms of their agreements are there; they knew what they were coming into.  They thought that the compensations were worth those drawbacks, and they took them, and, as the Minister for Home Affairs has pointed out, we are not buying their souls and not buying their bodies.  They have a perfect right to resign.  They cannot have their pension, their special conditions, and all the other advantages which Civil Servants have, and have at the same time the other advantages which other workers have and enjoy.  We were asked here, do we intend to slavishly copy England in all these matters.  That is a perfectly fair question.  We do not intend, and it is for that reason there is a different cost of living figure applied to the Irish Civil Servant and the English Civil Servant. And the Irish Civil Servants in the Post Office at this moment are better off than the English Civil Servants in any city corresponding to this, and better off&mdash;and much better off&mdash;than any corresponding place in the North of Ireland.  And even if they accepted the terms which have been offered to them by the Postmaster-General, they would be still better off here, from the point of view of money and salary, than they are in England or in the North.</P>

      <P>I am answering the point raised by Mr. Johnson.  The conditions in Ireland are much better than those in England, notwithstanding that the Irish Civil Service is run at a loss and that the English Post Office is, run at a profit.  The arrangement made in England by way of Departmental Councils for settling disputes in the Civil Service have been referred to by Mr. O'Connell.  I assume he knows these arrangements are in existence in Ireland, and I assume he knows also that at the present moment there is in the Post Office a joint Departmental Committee for the purpose of settling wages, re-organisation, and that it will make recommendations to the Government in the ordinary way. <Col N="121" /> Deputy O'Connell appealed to the House to treat this regardless of Party.  I appeal to the Dáil to consider this matter very carefully, to consider that after all the experiences of other Governments&mdash;the experiences of other Governments are at least useful&mdash; all other Governments have found it absolutely necessary that the essential services of the State, which the Civil Service administers, should be administered by men with these disabilities and these privileges, and I ask you not to change them.</P>

      <P>I have read for the past six months many speeches from the Ministry about the rights and liberties extended to Ireland, which we hope to receive through the power of the Treaty. My conception of national freedom either through the Treaty or any other document or arrangement, is that it should be based on the rights and full recognition of the individual citizen. You cannot claim, and no one can claim national freedom when he is denied the ordinary rights of the individual. Labour, I think, has contributed more than its quota to the fight that went on for the liberty and freedom of this country. I think it is a very poor return that at the establishment of this Parliament a section of the workers who are organised in the Labour Movement should be denied the freedom which they thought they were fighting for.  I want to carry back the minds of the Ministers sitting on the front benches now, who pretended to be functioning as Cabinet Ministers under the Republican Government two or three years ago.  You will remember at certain periods the Labour Party had taken up a definite national attitude in respect to the fight going on with England at the time.  I refer to the fight against conscription in the first instance, and more particularly the two days' strike organised by the Irish Labour Party for the release of some of the men dying in some of the British and Irish Prisons.  You will remember in that particular strike the Postal Workers came out with the rest of organised Irish Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Republican Ministers did not repudiate their right to strike when pretending to govern this country in the interests of the Republican Movement. <Col N="122" /> Therefore, I cannot see any reason now that you have changed your clothes and turned over as Ministers of the Government established under the Provisional Government, why you should adopt an attitude different to that attitude adopted, two or three years ago, when the Postal Workers came out on strike for the release of the Irish Prisoners. The Minister for Agriculture laid great stress on the privileges&mdash;alleged privileges&mdash;supposed to be enjoyed by Civil Servants.  I have been connected with the Civil Service, the Railway Service, which may be a national service.  I am looking forward to it, but certainly not on the conditions you are laying down for your employment.  I am connected with that Service, enjoying pension rights.  I was warned when I was going on strike for the release of the prisoners that I was going to forfeit my position, just as you have warned the men who have struck for their rights.  I went on strike, and I went back to work and never heard any more about the denial of pension rights.  I suppose the Company I was working for thought it better not to come into conflict with the whole organised Labour Movement, and in fact, at the time, with the Irish people, on the question at issue at the moment.  Postmen, as far as I know, do not enter the State Service through competitive examination, and I fail to see why that particular section should be classed as Civil Servants and deprived of their right to strike, if necessary, in defence of the privileges they have enjoyed.  It may be strange to put forward the argument that you yourselves have already recognised the right to combine and the right that goes with that right, to strike and peaceful picketing.  If the Deputies will carry their minds back to March when there was a threatened strike approaching, you entered into negotiations with the officials of the Trades Union, and rather than allow the strike you set up a Commission, and allowed the Trade Union representatives, the nominees of the Postal Workers, to sit on that Commission and determine the conditions and wages.  The nominees of the Labour Party were the nominees of the Postal Workers.  By recognising the right of the Postal Workers to combine through the Trades Unions and have representatives on the Commission <Col N="123" /> I say you recognised the right to combine, to strike and to have peaceful picketing.  We have in the City of Dublin dual police forces watching men who have never done anything wrong, since the strike took place.  The statement has been made, and I am not prepared to accept it without proof, that the men left their work with the right to strike for better conditions.</P>
    <P>I accept that statement that you have made.  If they have done that work they have not done it at the dictation of this Party, as they never did that in any strike they were connected with.  You also laid stress on the fact that this thing has never been attempted in any other civilised State.  I always thought we were, or pretended to be, more civilised here than any other people in the world.  At any rate, I hope any laws we make in this country will not be based on the laws made and carried out in other parliaments. I am looking forward to this Parliament making its own regulations regardless of what is done in any other country.  At any rate the Birmingham incident referred to by the Minister for Home Affairs was merely a local question, but this is a national question denying that a section of labour had a right to combine in Trades Unions.

      <P>As far as I understand them it is to deny the men the right of peaceful picketing.  I do not admit the Government has the right to use forces for this purpose.  At any rate, I say to the Deputies in this Dáil, in Ireland at the present time there is a lot of robbery going on in the name of Republicans and Irregulars by criminals, I say if you have any surplus police forces send them down the country to stop the robberies and give protection to the people, and do not use them against men who, I am sure, are not doing anything that is illegal.  We put up the argument <Col N="124" /> that Parliament has a Minister, and that any Minister doing it should be answerable to the Dáil.  We challenge every member to show by his vote in this whether they are in earnest, if they recognise this right and liberty.  They will show they are genuine or not, and show the trade unionists of the country whether they stand for the things you said you stood for.  A document issued by the Minister for Home Affairs appears to me to be a statement copied from some of the documents taken out by you from Dublin Castle and handed down as historic souvenirs of things done by the Castle in the past.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this debate will lead nowhere.  Notwithstanding the terms of the motion, I think that what we should discuss is: Is there a possibility of ending the strike?  With regard to the general principles that have been put forward, I do think that the individual Members of this Assembly are altogether in favour of as much individual liberty as is compatible with having a State.  There is a great difference between individual liberty and licence, and even in the Trade Union movement, as is known to members of the Labour Party, the individual has not the perfect right to do what he likes.  He is controlled by the Trade Union movement.  With regard to the question as to whether other Civil Servants have the right to strike, it is a moot question.  There are arguments certainly on the side of the Government or the Ministry in this case, that if it upsets whole State organisation, neither to the Postal Servants nor to any other service of the Government, should the right be given to withdraw their services at a critical moment.  On the other hand, I should think that if this State were firmly established, that there was no question whatever of what we may call the loyalty of the community to the State itself, when, indeed, the right to withdraw labour at a particular time may be admitted.  The trouble in this country at the moment is that it is not a challenge to a particular Government or Ministry, or a challenge to this Assembly as an Assembly, but that there is a challenge in this country at the present tirne to any kind of Government. There is a challenge to authority of any kind in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>LIAM de ROISTE:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is the duty of whatever Ministry is in power to take up any challenge given to it.  I know many of the Postal Servants myself, and I know that as a body they have no desire to challenge the authority of the Ministry or the Dáil; and also I know, and I am sure the members of the Labour Party know it too, that there are sections in the country that are challenging the authority of this Assembly, and are taking advantage, or may take advantage, of any Postal strike or a strike by any other combination to forward their own ideas in challenging the authority of this Parliament. It seems to me that the more practical thing to discuss here is the question as to whether this strike can be ended or not.  Our general discussion on the liberty of the individual member or of any combination at the present moment, I think, will lead nowhere.  I may make the assumption that Members of the Ministry, and in fact every Member of this Assembly, is in favour of the fullest liberty of combination that can be accorded to societies and individuals. What we have to debate is: Is the strike to continue?  Therefore I submit that what we ought to consider in this Assembly at the present time is, is there any way out by which this strike dispute can be finished and the State services in the Post Offices continued? That is far more important than a discussion on the rights of individuals or of combinations to strike.</P>

      <P>I rise, not that I can add much to what my colleagues have said, but to answer some points made, and the first one I want to take up is, that an attempt is being made here and the attempt was made elsewhere to make it appear to the general public and particularly to the supporters <Col N="126" /> of the Treaty, that this particular strike is a political strike against the Government. Now there is nothing of that kind in this strike.  We do not want to discuss the merits of the strike at all. I do not want to go out from any Minister or any other Member of the Dáil anything that will belie the men and women who may be broken and crushed to-morrow.  You said that there has been sabotage.  Very well, if there has been it is the duty of the Minister for Home Affairs to find out those who committed the sabotage and arrest them, and, if found guilty, punish them.  It is not his duty to cast these things in the faces of men when he cannot tell who did these things or not.  Now a thing happened at Crown Alley, where the picket were driven off and shots were fired over them.  I understand the officer challenged two other members of the picket, one of them a lady on a bicycle, with a revolver.  Certain people contend that the right to strike did not apply to the Post Office Service and other Government services.  These principles that apply to the ordinary employé apply to the Post Office, and its servants have the right to withdraw their labour. As to the question whether it is a right or wrong time to strike, the Minister for Home Affairs did not say it out straight, but he wanted it to be understood outside that the Government is a weak Government, and that is the time for us to take advantage of the weakness.  If he could say these things out straight he could be answered.  Mr. Davin quite properly made the comment that when it was a case of striking against the British Empire in Ireland or striking on behalf of the hunger strikers or for the National cause, these people, who were servants of the British Government, did go out and risked their jobs and more than their jobs.  The Minister and everyone supporting the Government here applauded them as they applauded us.  But now they must not strike because it is an Irish Government.  It only shows that so far as the relations between employers and employés are concerned, Governments, whether in Belfast or in Dublin, have not an iota of difference between them and the Governments on the other side of the water. That has become known to the people up and down the country.  The people are not so stupid as that <Col N="127" /> they are not taking in these things, and those who sow those things now, bear in mind they will reap the harvest alright.  There has been talk that because these people have got pensions and privileges of one kind or another, that therefore they should sit down, be good boys and girls, and do nothing that the Ministers do not like.  I will just give the Dáil an instance of the change that has come over the whole outlook of the workers of Ireland in the organisation of the whole Postal Service. All the Postal Servants are linked up into a trade union, and bear in mind that this is the thing that the worker throughout the country would take note of.  The very essence of trade unionism as distinguished from other organisations is the right to strike.  I will give you an instance to show you the change.  The freedom of the workers&mdash;their spiritual freedom&mdash;is becoming of much more value to them than any question of wages or hours, or conditions, or anything else like that.  We had occasion before to tell the Minister for Home Affairs that he did not know what he was talking of when he spoke about the conditions of the working classes.  We tell him again.  I will give this instance.  There is down at the North Wall a body of dockers employed by the London North Western Railway.  As employés at the North Wall they have certain privileges of one kind or another which other classes had not, and which they were fighting for.  They wanted to be put on the same footing exactly with their fellow dockers in the Port of Dublin.  Fox that reason they were compelled to go on strike and they fought the strike for six months and they won.  In this particular strike the Government and the Ministry may smash these particular unions because they have got the power and the guns, and whoever has got the most guns is going to rule in Ireland. All the fine talk about democracy and all the other things is not going to go anywhere.  But all the guns and all the power and all the force in Ireland is not going to make the whole working class in Ireland lie down when the right to strike is challenged.  A Minister has said that the Association referred to by Deputy O'Connell is established in the Post Office.  I understand that that is not so.  I understand that there is a joint Departmental Committee.  The <Col N="128" /> Deputy Minister says that that Committee's job is to settle disputes between the Post Office and the staff.  I wonder why it did not settle this.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Departmental Committee to which the Minister refers is quite a different Committee.  This Committee, to which he refers now, was appointed, I understand, by the Postal Commission, so that the Government could not claim any credit for it at all. Has the Government called this Committee into consultation on this particular issue of the strike?  I understand it has not.  Has the Government set up a Whitley Council, or anything corresponding to the Whitley Council?  I am not particularly in love with the Whitley Council, but I understand it is the thing that Post Office employees wanted.  They did not get it.  They have not got it yet.  There has been some question of interference and intimidation. Now, we would be very glad to have an instance of the interference or intimidation.  Was there any interference or intimidation down at Amiens Street Station this morning when a D.M.P. sergeant, under no instructions except the orders of his Superintendent, placed under arrest a number of the pickets down there?  Was there any intimidation or any interference with the I &ldquo;scabs&rdquo; going into Amiens Street Station? Whoever ordered the arrest was pulled up a couple of hours later by the State Solicitor, who went down to Store Street Station and informed them that, legally, they had no right to do anything of this kind at all.  Deputy de Roiste has made a very good speech.  I would sum it up like this, that those who challenge the Government are the friends, aiders, and abettors of the Republican troops.  Let him understand that the challengers of the Government are not the aiders and abettors of the Republican troops.  To sum up Deputy de Roiste's speech, I think it would be like this: As much individual liberty as possible for everybody except Civil Servants. <Col N="129" /> Question put: &ldquo;That this Dáil repudites the statement issued by the Minister for Home Affairs beginning with <Col N="130" /> the words &lsquo;that the Government does not recognise the right of Civil Servants to strike.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Dáil divided: Tá 24; Níl 51.</P>
