      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether the Government have made, or propose to make any arrangements as regards Income Tax, Schedule A, on lands where the owners are unable to collect rents <i>(a)</i> at all; <i>(b)</i> only subject to large abatements; and also as regards Income Tax on lands where the owners have been prevented from using them; and what is the nature of these arrangements, if any such exist.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he is aware that many householders are receiving Notices to Quit because of their unwillingness to pay the full 40 per cent. increase in excess of standard rents allowed under the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, in some cases, because such householders <Col N="383" /> have been paying the increase of 15 per cent. allowed under the Decree of the Second Dáil of the year 1920, and in other cases because of assurances given in this Dáil that this matter will receive early attention?  If he will state when the Bill promised by him, dealing with this matter, will be brought before the Oireachtas?  And if, in view of the injustice of the present position, he is prepared to state that such Bill, if and when passed by the Oireachtas, will be made retrospective as from a given date.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that such Notices to Quit were being received by many householders.  The operation of the Rent and Mortgage (Restrictions) Act, 1920, has, however, been receiving my attention for some time, and at the moment a Committee is in process of formation to advise whether the Act should be continued, and if so with what modifications.  When this Committee reports, and I do not see any reason why its work should not be completed in a comparatively short time, I hope to introduce a suitable Bill.  In the meantime I am not prepared to anticipate such report by stating whether the measure to be introduced should be made retrospective as from a given date.</P>

Mackay Edgar, dealing, among other matters, with a probable shortage in the reasonably near future of the oil supply of the world, and if, having regard to the dependence of this country on oil, and to the considerable amount of national capital now locked, and increasingly being locked, in machinery dependent on oil, he will give particular attention to the recommendations on this matter of the recent Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland, in its Report on Industrial Alcohol, with a view to the consideration of legislation necessary to put those recommendations into effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no. The Motion is that the Bill as amended by the Seanad be passed.  Standing Orders are being drawn up bearing upon this matter.  But I think, at the moment, there is no occasion for debate; perhaps we could go into committee on this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of the procedure to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment that I suggest is in Clause 19, and I may say that was intended to be moved before the Bill left the Dáil on the last occasion and would have been moved but for the rather hurried method of legislating. It was to have been moved in the Seanad but for the same excuse.  I do not think there will be any objection to it.  It is to move after the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; so as to read &ldquo;every order and regulation made by the Executive Council,&rdquo; and to make the necessary consequential amendments at a later stage of the Clause.  I think that is made necessary by the addition of Clause 13, which, as it will be remembered, was brought in by the Minister on the fourth stage of the Bill.  The <Col N="387" /> effect of the suggestion is that not only every order made under other clauses, but every regulation made under Clause 13 by the Minister for Finance respecting the routes for trading should also be laid upon the Table, and I think that will be conceded as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is advisable to accept the recommendation, apart from the difficulty that would be involved of again sending the Bill back to the Seanad.  I do not think that that Clause can be regarded in the sense as an order made to which Clause 19 refers. Regulations regarding the importation and exportation of goods are things not very lightly done.  There is no other course to adopt.  One has no selection.  One is, as it were, bound by the circumstances of the case, to the particular routes, that would be most advisable, and I do not know that it would improve the situation, from the point of view of the Dáil, that these regulations be laid upon the Table. At any rate, supposing we were getting close up to the time, 1st of April, or any other period, and that sufficient time would not elapse to allow it to be laid on the Table for 21 days, its usefulness for the first few days would be spent.  I do not think the Deputy ought to press that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument, I think, lies here, that the Minister for Finance might, by an oversight, propose certain regulations which would hit very severely the constituencies of one or other members of the Dáil, and would be amended on a representation being made by the members.  It is undoubtedly a very important power, and without some kind of supervision and opportunity for representations being made before the Order comes into final operation, injustice or damage might be done to constituents and the Deputies concerned would have no influence or say in the matter. If the Minister insists that it is impracticable, I am not going to press it, but, I think it is rather a pity that we had not an opportunity of discussing the effect of such a regulation more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>No motion has been moved on this matter, and strictly it is out of order, as there is nothing before us but the amendment of the Seanad.  In consideration of the speed at which this was passed, and in the expectation that there might be <Col N="388" /> agreement, I allowed the matter to come up, but I do not think that we can allow discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it is a matter of order at all, but I wish merely to recall to your mind and the mind of the Minister that this was really consequential upon a certain understanding when the matter was last before the Dáil.  I do not wish to attempt to do anything that might seem to contravene any ruling of yours, but I might carry that reminder a little further and say that in Article 13, the words &ldquo;the regulations&rdquo; were brought in as a result of an amendment which I moved, because by turning to the English Act, of which these were an equivalent, it appeared to me, the words &ldquo;the regulations&rdquo; had been omitted, and, therefore the two did not tally.  The regulations in the English Act are specifically regulations that are laid on the Table of the English Legislature because they are made by the Customs and Excise, all such regulations requiring ratification, inasmuch as these words were introduced into Clause 13, because they appeared in the counterpart to the entire of that Clause.  It would be implied that the meaning that the words carry should also come in, and it had been my intention of moving an amendment such as that which Deputy Johnson expresses a wish to move. I was not in the Dáil when the last paragraph came up.  I would have made it my business to be here if I thought that he would not deal with it.  I think it was consequential and an amendment we ought to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the question of order in this particular matter does constitute a real difficulty, because the Constitution lays down that after an Act has gone to the Seanad for 270 days it shall become law in the form in which it was last passed by the Dáil. If the Dáil, having received a Bill back from the Seanad, were to be held to be at liberty to make changes in Clauses which had not been touched or amended by the Seanad, and not affected by the Seanad amendments, it might mean that shortly before the expiry of the 270 days some radical changes might be introduced.</P>

In regard to the definition Clause, I find that the actual definition as it stands would include the Dublin Port and Docks Board, but I do not know whether it would meet Deputy O'Brien's point, if I undertook that no order would issue postponing the election, rather than try to discover a new definition.</P>

The wisdom of deferring these elections until then, I think, is fairly obvious, but this amendment was drafted very hurriedly last evening after the discussion, and since looking over it I see that it is not worded exactly to meet all that is intended.  I think the amendment itself will require amendment, because it seems to me that if it were passed as it stands it would preclude an election to one of these positions in case a person at present holding the office resigned or died.  I think there will have to be some modification in order to meet that.  A further alteration will be required in the amendment to make it read instead of &ldquo;after an election held under this Act.&rdquo;  As far as I know the election will not be held under this Act, but under the Act termed the Franchise Act, 1923.  I do not think there is any controversy about that.  The amendment is simply moved in order to obviate unnecessary elections pending the operation of the new Franchise Act, but, as I say, it requires some slight alteration in order to meet the exact purpose for which it was intended.</P>

      <P>This amendment is one on which I have no particular feeling, and which I would be inclined to leave entirely to the Dáil.  As a matter of fact when the first draft of this Bill was made it provided that the election of Mayors and Chairmen should not be held in January, but should be postponed. Then it was thought perhaps that it would be just as well, in case there was any Chairman who was not liked by a Council, that his Council should have an opportunity of getting rid of him in January, and so the Bill was presented <Col N="391" /> in the form in which it is.  As I said, it is a matter on which I have no feeling, and would leave absolutely free to the Dáil to decide.  In case the Dáil is prepared to adopt the principle of Deputy Milroy's amendment, I got an amendment drafted this morning, after receiving a copy of Deputy Milroy's amendment, which would, perhaps, meet the case better than Deputy Milroy's actual amendment.  If the Dáil is inclined to adopt the principle I would suggest wording which would stand the test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>To substitute for Sub-section 5, Clause 4, which provides that the business of these statutory meetings shall not be abridged, as really the only business they are bound to transact at such meetings is the election of a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman or a Lord Mayor. Now, I propose, if the Dáil were disposed to adopt the principle of the amendment, to substitute words so that Sub-section 4 would read:&mdash;&ldquo;Every Lord Mayor, Mayor, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of or appointed by any Council, body of Commissioners or other local body, the statutory elections to which are postponed by or under this Act, who is in office at the passing of this Act, or on the prescribed date shall continue in office until, but not after his successor shall have been duly elected at the first meeting of such Council, body of Commissioners or other local body after the statutory elections thereto, and shall have made the declaration accepting office.&rdquo; That means that Sub-section 4 terminates after the election the term of office of any Chairman, whenever elected, who may happen to hold office when the election takes place.  Section 5, which was designed to meet the purposes of Deputy Milroy's amendment, would continue in office any Mayor or Chairman until the prescribed date.  One would meet the case of, say, a Mayor who is elected in January next, owing to a casual vacancy, or owing to the resignation of the existing Mayor.</P>

      <P>Would not the introduction of the words in Clause 4 after the words &ldquo;who is in Office&rdquo;&ldquo;at the passing of this Act or on the prescribed date&rdquo; meet the case and save another sub-section, because as I understand the Minister, Clause 5 is identical <Col N="392" /> with Clause 4, except for the words &ldquo;passing of the Act&rdquo;?  And therefore if you introduce in Clause 4 the words I suggest &ldquo;who is in office at the passing of this Act on the prescribed date&rdquo; that hits both of them&mdash;the man who was coming in and the man who was in office when the prescribed date arrives.</P>

      <P>I think this ought to be taken separately, because I am not at all sure about the deletion of Clause 5.  You see Clause 5 refers to an annual meeting or a quarterly meeting, and it seems to me quite possible that the second quarterly meeting might fall due before the statutory election would take place.  The annual meeting takes place in January, but the quarterly meetings would come in the ordinary course in March.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the Local Government Acts to say what it might be necessary for them to do at the quarterly meetings, and Clause 5 preserves the right to hold quarterly meetings when they fall due.</P>

The obligation is on the Council to retain him if he does not resign that position?</P>

      <P>I move that the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill be received for final consideration.  There was a question yesterday of an item in the First Schedule, Section 42 of the National Insurance Act, 1911.  Now, the National Insurance Act of 1911 is not an expiring Act.  It is not temporary, but that particular section of it when the Bill was moved read &ldquo;until the first day of January, 1915,&rdquo; and so on.  It went on to provide for the cases of insured persons who have not joined an Approved Society within the prescribed time or who having been members of an Approved Society have resigned or been expelled therefrom, and have not within the prescribed time joined another Approved Society.  It enabled them to use the Post Office in a certain way, and the amounts standing to their credit were credited to a special fund in the Post Office, and were made available from time to time as required.  That was an experiment, and consequently it was thought better to give it a trial <Col N="396" /> until the 1st January, 1915.  Evidently the experiment was satisfactory and gave good results, because this particular section of the Act has been continued from year to year ever since.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for permission to introduce a Bill for Criminal and Malicious Injuries.  The final draft of the Bill is not yet ready; it is under consideration.  It might be possible to circulate the Bill before Christmas, but it would not be possible, I think, to print and circulate it to-morrow.  As I have already explained, the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts go too far in some particulars and not quite far enough in other particulars, and those are the things that we are endeavouring to reconcile.  We have had several meetings discussing the various proposals and getting advice on them.  It is intricate. As can be readily understood where such a huge sum of money is involved every possible precaution must be taken that the taxpayers are not mulcted beyond what is fair.  We mean also to deal as fairly as we can with the persons affected, and this Act will specify what compensation is to be paid, or at least the lines upon which compensation will have to be paid.  We also have to deal with particular clauses of the Criminal and Malicious Injury Act which are at present inoperative, which would be oppressive if they were operative, and which at no time could be justified on any modern principles.  I refer to such things as the payment of 5 per cent. interest from the date of the award.  There would be no necessity for including that in the future. But should a person have had a decree <Col N="397" /> for some months, the 5 per cent. would run if we did not bring in a clause to prevent it running.  A person having secured a decree would be in a superior position to a person who did not take a case into court, since July, 1921, until now.  There are other clauses; in fact, we intend to repeal the whole, I think, of the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Act of 1919 and 1920.  As the law stands at the present moment, a person getting a decree against the local authority under the Criminal and Malicious Injury Act is entitled to go to the treasurer of the local authority and get paid the full amount of that decree, even though not even one single penny has been levied in that area under that particular service.  In other words a place like the City of Dublin may, in the early part of the year&mdash;let us say July or August&mdash;have altogether on hands five or six thousand pounds, and they would be liable to discharge all the Criminal and Malicious Injury claims which would come in, out of that five or six thousand pounds, which may be required for doing such work as cleansing of streets, keeping the sewers running, or maintaining a public water supply, or electric light, or any other service such as that. Obviously that could not be allowed to continue, and in addition to making regulations or laws in connection with compensation it is necessary to take into consideration such things as those.  I do not anticipate that the Bill can be printed before a couple of days.  We may possibly have it within a couple of days, but I do not think it would be possible that it would be in your hands to-morrow.  I formally move for permission to introduce the Criminal and Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill.</P>

Since this Committee sat we have set up the Seanad, and it would be necessary according to the Constitution to make provision for the discharge of our obligations to the members constituting the Seanad.  The payment of members and Ministers sanctioned by the Provisional Government or by the Dáil lapsed on the 6th December. An Act of this kind should, as far as possible, be an agreed measure.  I think that from the report of the Seanad which I have seen, that much the same terms were agreed to there for Senators as were fixed for Deputies here.  There are minor points on which it might be necessary to have the benefit of the advice of this Committee before bringing in the Bill.  I think that if the Committee which dealt with this matter before were re-appointed, or should the Dáil decide to appoint another Committee, we would be able to bring in the Bill immediately after the re-assembling of the Oireachtas somewhere about the first week in January.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the Dáil adjourns until January the 2nd or 3rd.  We are very much pressed for time; until 12 o'clock last night, and also for three hours this morning we were engaged on the Criminal and Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, and it will take some time to get through with it.</P>

      <P>That is the only thing I fear.  I have been told it is quite possible attention may be drawn to one Act omitted from the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.  If that were the case we could early in January run through a short Bill re-enacting that particular one.</P>

      <P>Before the motion for the adjournment has been put, it occurs to me that the President might be able to make some statement on a certain matter.  The Criminal Injuries Act has just been introduced and read for the first time.  It appears to me it cannot possibly be passed into law before the end of January.  The Government have stated that it will require careful consideration and will contain a good deal of new legislation.  I know professionally that many cases have been adjourned from the October Sessions until the January Sessions for the introduction of this Bill.  The Legal representatives <Col N="401" /> of the Government said that as they were going to be represented at the future hearing of any of these Malicious Injury Claims, the claims ought not to be taken up by the Recorder of Dublin or other Judicial Officers until this Bill had passed into law.  The cases were all adjourned until the January Sessions.  I know that in October many people attended with their witnesses hoping their cases might come on.  They were bound to attend as they were duly summoned. The same thing will happen in January, and it seems to me absolutely impossible that this Bill could pass into law in time to meet the January Sessions.  I venture to suggest that possibly the Ministry might be able to make a statement to-morrow, to the effect that these cases will not be taken up at the January Sessions, but will be further adjourned. That will save large expense to many people who would in the ordinary course be attending there.  If such a statement could be made it would be an enormous convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We had that point under consideration and it was our intention to insert in the Bill the date upon which these Courts would be assembled to hear cases.  I think it would be about the first week in February, but we will consider the point mentioned by the Deputy, and see whether a statement can be made here in the Dáil, or whether we can publish a notice to meet the case for litigants who have already been disappointed on one occasion and whom we do not wish to disappoint again.</P>

      <P>The Agenda to-morrow will contain nothing except Bills from the Seanad and Questions if there be any.  Should the Seanad make any amendments to Bills sent up to them it will be necessary for the Dáil to consider these amendments, and it is to provide for that contingency that we are meeting.</P>
