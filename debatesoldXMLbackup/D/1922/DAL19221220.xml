      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a 4-ton Halford Lorry, the property of Mr. P. Tierney, of 15, High Street, Galway, was commandeered by National troops at Ennis, on July 1st, and whether, in view of the fact that Mr. Tierney's business has suffered considerably in the meantime, he will see that proper conpensation is paid to him as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that the Commercial Hotel, Balla, the property of Mr. McEllin, was commandeered by National troops on 29th July, 1922, further, whether he is aware that through this action Miss M.J.

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Volunteer James Byrne, of the Dublin Guards, was wounded in an ambush at Duagh, Kilmorna, Co. Kerry, on October 13th, that the casualty was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of October 15th, and that enquiries were made by this Volunteer's mother, Mrs. Byrne, of 3 Willbrook, Rathfarnham, Co. Dublin, at Portobello Barracks, and Army Medical Headquarters, Merrion Square, during the following week, but failed to elicit any information; whether the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of October 22nd reported the funeral of this Volunteer from Portobello Barracks, although no notification of his fate had been sent to his relatives; whether, in answer to further enquiries, <Col N="405" /> Captain Stafford, the officer in charge of funerals at Portobello, told the mother on Monday, October 23rd, that he could not say if the lad buried was her son, and expressed the opinion that the soldier buried was either killed instantly, or else had died of blood poisoning; whether the same officer on the following day informed Mrs. Byrne's sister-in-law that the boy killed was Mrs. Byrne's son, and that he had made enquiries in Rathfarnham and had sent notice to the newspapers that an unidentified body was lying in the Barracks in order to enable him to get into touch with the relatives &mdash; statements of which no corroboration could be obtained in the newspaper offices or in Rathfarnham; whether, or subsequently, Army Medical Headquarters undertook to communicate with Abbeyfeale, and then notified Mrs. Byrne that the boy who had been buried was not her son but a native of Kerry; whether upon enquiry being made at Oriel House, a message was sent by Mr. Frank Fagan that Mrs. Byrne's son had not been killed, but was in hospital, not so seriously wounded as to require to be brought to Dublin for an operation; whether enquiries were also made of Commandant O'Connor, at Beggars' Bush Barracks, who promised to communicate with Mrs. Byrne, but failed to do so; whether Mrs. Byrne was left without definite news of her son's death until she received on December 14th, in reply to an enquiry she had addressed to the Parish Priest, a letter from Father F.J. Harrington, C.C., Duagh, Kilmorna, Co. Kerry, stating that her son was wounded in the abdomen on October 13th, was removed in a motor ambulance to Abbeyfeale that night, and died half an hour after his arrival there; whether he will ascertain and communicate to Mrs. Byrne the exact facts of her son's death and burial, with an apology for the treatment hitherto accorded to her, and whether he will establish such machinery of identification and notification of casualties as will prevent in future such unnecessary suffering as was inflicted in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 16th October, Capt. Stafford received from the British and Irish Steam Packet Co. the remains of Vol. James Byrne, supposed to have been killed in action at Duagh, Co. Kerry on October 14th.  Records were looked up, and it was found <Col N="406" /> that there were several Volunteers of that name, and many of them on duty in Kerry.  Exhaustive enquiries were made to ascertain the identity of this man, but without success.  Notices were inserted in the Dublin evening papers that the remains of Volunteer Byrne were lying unidentified in Portobello Barracks. A large number of people visited the mortuary for identification purposes, but as the man was beyond recognition, identification was, presumably, impossible. The remains were kept in the mortuary until October the 21st, when they were buried in the Army Plot at Glasnevin, with full military honours.</P>
      <P>It is much regretted that Mrs. Byrne should have been caused any unnecessary pain.  Everything possible was done to secure identification, but identification did not result.</P>
      <P>Enquiries have not yet been completed in respect of some of the details given in the question, nor as to what the final aspect of this matter is as regards identification.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether there is any usual practice on the part of soldiers to wear some identification marks giving their number, or discs, such as the British soldiers use?  It is a very important matter that relatives should, at least, know from the authorities when their friends have been killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at present the practice.  We have been able to identify all cases, I think, with the exception of this one.  And, considering the difficulties we have been working under, I think that it is hardly fair to make a parade of this particular case. We really have succeeded very well in meeting all the difficulties that have presented themselves to us in this matter, and very few people have anything like the cause of complaint that Mrs. Byrne has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand that, to Mrs. Byrne, it is just as important as if there were one thousand other people in identical circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite realised, but it is, as I say, not appreciating the difficulties that we have been working under, and not appreciating <Col N="407" /> what we have been able to do in these matters to make a parade of a question like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister there was no intention to make any parade of the question, and I will ask if he will write to Mrs. Byrne and explain in a personal way the position, because she is very hurt over the matter.</P>

      <P>I have just one announcement to make.  I have the honour to inform the Dáil that two Bills passed by the Oireachtas have received the assent of the Governor-General, and I understand the other two Bills have received the consideration of the Seanad and have been passed.  I regret to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot possibly be present this evening.  He is at present engaged in a conference in connection with the railways, and I do not see how it would be possible for him to be present.  Next there is the matter of the Amnesty Bill, which is down for the First Reading to-day. I have to ask the indulgence of the Dáil in connection with it.  At present it has received only consideration at one meeting of the Executive Council, and I do not know whether it will be possible to have it in print before Christmas.  Directly it is in print we will circulate it to the Deputies.  I expect it should be in print by the middle of next week.  I have just one thing to say on the matter.  There was a notice published on the 10th February last, signed by Micheál O Coileán, and it was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Now that a Treaty of Peace has been concluded between the peoples of Ireland and Great Britain, the Provisional Government hereby decree a General Amnesty in respect of all acts committed in the course of the recent hostilities.  This amnesty extends to all members of the naval, military, police or civil services of the British Government, and all other persons by whom acts of hostility against the Irish people were committed, aided or abetted, whether in Ireland or elsewhere, <Col N="408" /> during the past six years, and the full protection of the law will be afforded to all such persons against violence or injury of any kind.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Provisional Government appeal to all Irish citizens to respect this amnesty in the spirit and in the letter. In this, as in other matters, we must not suffer ourselves to be outdone by our late enemies in seeking that the wrongs of the past may be buried in oblivion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the Dáil is aware of the fact that we have got through four rather important legislative enactments, and considering the matter very carefully we came to the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to rush this legislation at this moment.  Therefore, it is thought desirable that we should further consider this proposed Bill, and also the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Bill that I spoke of yesterday evening.  I will ask the indulgence of the House in that respect to wait the re-assembling after the adjournment before considering either of these Bills.  If they are printed before the Dáil meets again we will see that they are in the hands of Deputies at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment of the Dáil is moved may I ask would it be possible or advisable for the President to make any statement with regard to the appointment of the Boundaries Commission, <Col N="409" /> and possibly as to the Irish Commissioner who will be upon that Commission. I think it would be desirable that the country should know, and I think the country would like to know, exactly what the position is in respect of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make any announcement upon that matter.  It has been the subject of consideration by the Executive Council on many occasions and also by the late Provisional Government.  It is one of those matters that really require exhaustive enquiries as to the most suitable persons.  Even in the case of suitable persons being on a panel for selection for this position one must have regard to the opinions of those affected in the area, and I think anybody who has any experience of meeting representatives or other persons from the six counties will quite appreciate the advisability of considering their views upon a matter of this sort.  I do not think it would be advisable to make any further statement upon that matter until the Dáil meets again on the 3rd January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he would take advantage of the opportunity that would be provided of making a statement on the Government policy with regard to the railways.  The Dáil will remember that last week he did not feel it possible, in view of the delicate stage in which the negotiations were, to make a statement with respect to this matter.  But, apparently the stage at which negotiations were then in has passed, because we see in the daily newspapers certain indications of the Government policy in this matter.  It would be well, and I think the Dáil will agree, that matters of national policy &mdash; especially matters under discussion &mdash; should be divulged to the Dáil in the first instance, rather than to other bodies.  But, in the absence of the Minister, of course we cannot expect him to make a statement.  I take it that if the opportunity arises he will either make a public announcement officially or reserve any further communication on this matter to the meeting of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. WILLIAM DAVIN Mr. WILLIAM DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILLIAM DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the President replies, I should like to say, as one who is taking part in the negotiations, that I do not wish to say anything in this Dáil or outside of it that would tend to widen the breach that exists at the moment between the parties to the negotiations.  I wish to say, however, as a representative of this Dáil, and one responsible to the people, that I feel it is very injudicious on the part of the Government, or on the part of a Minister, to make a statement to a Trades Union delegation concerning a matter of policy which should first be made to this Dáil as a result of the report of the Commission and the consideration of that report by the Government.  Certain inspired statements and misleading articles &mdash; I deliberately say misleading, because I know that some of the things in the papers are not a correct report of what the Minister actually said &mdash; have been made.  It is not correct to say that the Minister made a statement concerning the attitude of the Government as to their policy regarding the future of railways.  The statement that was made was actually a statement concerning <Col N="411" /> a lack of policy, and not a definite policy on the part of the Government itself. I realise very fully that there are certain difficulties in the way of the Government at the moment, and I do not wish to harp on them in this Dáil, because they might be made use of in other places to the disadvantage of people who represent this particular area in the Free State.  A leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> states:&mdash;&ldquo;The Free State will not begin to prosper until the national railway system has been reformed from top to bottom.  The companies must be relieved of their financial burden.&rdquo;  That is a very serious statement, and it is actually a correct impression, but what I gathered from the negotiations that I took part in, during the last week or fortnight, was that certain railway companies or the directors of a particular railway have informed the Government, that they are not prepared to carry on the work of that railway after January 1st.  Now, the adjournment of the Dáil is moved until January 3rd, and I feel it is a very serious thing for the Government to take a step that would mean the giving of a subsidy to a railway company to enable it to carry on, without acquainting members of the Dáil, who are responsible to the people for taxation in the Free State.  I do not wish to go into details for reasons I explained, but I certainly think if that is the position that the Government is likely to be confronted with, then we on these benches and other members of the Dáil also are entitled to some statement as to the policy of the Government in a matter of that particular kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have again to express regret for the non-attendance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is unavoidable, because he is engaged on these negotiations which I think have been well described by the word &ldquo;delicate.&rdquo; In this matter, as in all other matters, national policy should be first indicated to the Dáil, and I think the Dáil will recognise not alone is the Minister for Industry and Commerce likely to be the victim of reports put about of statements, or alleged statements, he made, published in the Press, but the same fate affects practically every other member of the Ministry.  I have seen occasionally statements attributed to me, which I have not made.  There is, <Col N="412" /> perhaps, occasionally some skeleton of truth about them, but the flesh was not the flesh that was attached to the statements when I made them, and, it is quite possible that any chance remark may be interpreted in quite a different way to that intended.  I have spoken to the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather casually to-day about this statement, and he was rather surprised at it appearing in the Press, and I gathered it was not a correct interpretation of what he said.  I have not read the statement he made, and am not in a position to express any opinion on it.  The situation with regard to the railways is delicate, I understand.  It would not, I think, improve, by reason of any discussion that would take place here.  It has scarcely come to the point on which a statement could be made, which would be of any value in dealing with the very difficult and very intricate matters that are in dispute.  I think, members opposite will appreciate at least one of the difficulties of the situation which has affected some of their friends as much as the different views of the various companies might affect some of the other members of the Dáil.  I refer to the fact, that these negotiations are not, I think, the subject of consideration by one particular union.  There are certainly more unions than one, and the matter is complicated to some extent, as far as the employees are concerned, by that fact. We have been unable to avail ourselves of the advice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the last day or two, so I do not think any useful purpose would be served now by discussing this matter.  I must admit as far as a statement of policy of the Government being disclosed, it is certainly the right of the Dáil that it should be disclosed here first, and I think Deputies may take it, that is the course we have in mind in all these matters.</P>

      <P>Before the Dáil adjourns might I ask the Minister for Local Government whether he intends, or whether he will consider the question of paying a small sum in advance on pensions to pensioned Civil Servants.  A number of Clerks of Councils throughout Ireland retired during the last twelve months, and their pensions have been held up.  I got a few letters to-day, asking if I would press their claims for an advance <Col N="413" /> of the pensions before Christmas.  I would like to know when these retired officials of local boards may expect a settlement of their pensions.</P>

      <P>I do not think the matter is one in which I can do anything, as I would have no power to make any payment.  That is a matter really between themselves and the various Boards. The Boards in certain places are not in funds and have not been able, owing to the peculiar state of the country to pay.  In some other cases, to which I think Deputy Byrne is referring, the matter is one, in which the difficulties were created more by the officials themselves than anyone else.  If he is referring to the cases I have in mind drafts were sent out to some of the people for part of the amount due them but they returned them because they had not got the full amount.</P>
