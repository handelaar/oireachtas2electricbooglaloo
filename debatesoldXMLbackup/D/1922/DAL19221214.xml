      <P>To ask the President of the Ministry:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  If it is the case that the collection of Customs and Excise lies at present in the hands of the British Government, and that that Government causes a commission to be payable on such collection;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  If so, what the rate of this commission is per centum;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(c)</i>  If it is not the case that the Post Office, with an annual loss of over a million sterling, was instantly transferred to the Provisional Government;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(d)</i>  Whether it would not be possible to make arrangements to write off the loss on the Post Office, as taken over from the British Government, against the collection of Customs and Excise;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(e)</i>  And whether the Ministry will now suggest such a course to the British Government, or, in the alternative, carry this suggestion forward to the final financial settlement between the two countries under the provisions of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>As this question appears to have been asked under a misapprehension, I will take the opportunity to explain the position in regard to the collection of Customs and Excise taxes.  The collection of taxes, including Customs and Excise taxes, was transferred from the British Government to the Provisional Government on 1st April last under the terms of the Treaty, and the Provisional Government became solely responsible for the collection of Customs and Excise in the twenty-six counties from that date.  For various reasons it was found convenient, as a temporary arrangement, to appoint the Board <Col N="204" /> of Customs and Excise to administer the Customs and Excise services as agents of the Provisional Government, but the general control and responsibility for collection remained with the Government. Under this arrangement the local Customs and Excise officials continued to be British officials paid by the British Government, and the Provisional Government repaid to the Board of Customs and Excise the cost of the services.  This cost was based on the actual expenditure involved in the running of the services, and did not bear any relation to the revenue collected.  Since the passing of the Constitution the position has altered. The local Customs and Excise officials have become officers of the Irish Free State, and are now functioning as Irish officials payable directly out of Irish funds.  The agency arrangement with the Board of Customs and Excise has terminated, but, pending the completion of a Free State headquarters' staff, the Board of Customs and Excise are rendering certain assistance to the Ministry of Finance in connection with headquarters work.  For this assistance the Ministry of Finance will pay to the Board of Customs and Excise a sum to be agreed upon between the two Departments.  The amount of this payment will be quite small, and will cease as soon as the new headquarters' staff has been completed. There is not, and there never has been, any question of paying a commission to the British Government on the collection of Customs and Excise taxes in the Free State.</P>

      <P>I would like, if I am in order, to say a word or two with regard to this appointment. First of all, I question very much the advisability of having such an appointment at all as Postmaster-General.  I doubt if there is any necessity for such an appointment or for having a special Minister in this Dáil whose duty is confined entirely to the postal service.  It seems to me that we are copying England in this respect, and that one of the reasons they created this Ministry in England was owing to the necessity for a large Ministry they wanted to get an extra place, and they found this position of Postmaster-General would suit for the purpose.  I do not want to labour that at all now except to mention it.  It seems to me it would be well if this post were amalgamated with some others mentioned by one or two of my colleagues some time ago, such as the Ministry of Transport or a Ministry of Ways and Communications or Post and Telegraphs and Communications.  So far as the appointment generally is concerned I would like to say this much that the occupant of the office should confine his work rather to big questions of policy in connection with this post and broad questions, and I do not know that that has always been the case.  It is always an invidious and difficult thing when an individual is put before the Dáil to make criticisms of him which may appear to be personal, and I would be very sorry personally to do any such thing, or to be taken as doing any such thing.  I do not know how far I would be in order <Col N="210" /> in referring to a few matters which I believe arise in connection with this question. I refer to matters for which I believe the Deputy who is now proposed as Postmaster-General is, to some extent, in any case, responsible.  In a recent issue of the official Post Office Journal I note that provision was made whereby men who withdrew their labour for three or four weeks last September are not entitled to claim any payment for such time, and not only that, but that period is to be disallowed for purpose of pensions, increments and all such things which it would naturally count for in the ordinary way.  While perhaps one cannot grumble at that, men are being punished by reduction of their salaries, by transfer to other positions for acts which they did during the strike and while technically out of the service.  I do not think that that is fair. I made reference on one or two occasions before to this, and I do not think it will help in efficient administration if the Postmaster-General persists in a policy which is tantamount to victimisation, and I just wish to draw the special attention of the candidate for this position to this particular matter at this stage.  It is one of the matters on which I would like to get an assurance before voting for this appointment, and I hope, if he is appointed, he will not persist in the policy of punishing men for acts which they did during a time when they were actually outside the service of the Post Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this matter, but I take it the principal objections divide themselves into two parts&mdash;first, the necessity of a Minister in charge of these services; and, secondly, in regard to the happiness, or otherwise, of the selection that has been made.  Considering the very large sum of money involved in the immediate control, which is, so far as I can see, essential, I do not think that this service could be very well administered in conjunction with other services under the one Minister. As regards the objection to the individual, I say that the last nine or ten months is not a happy criterion to take of a man's suitability for this position.  The difficulties at that time have been very marked.  The difficulties in this particular service administered by Deputy Walsh while Postmaster-General were very pronounced. In the early part of the year a <Col N="211" /> very large claim was made by officials of this service, which was not founded on any sound basis so far as the Government knows.  Having established that claim, and it having been conceded by the Government, and when information was available that the basis of the claim was not sound, naturally the Minister in charge of this Department was faced with very difficult circumstances.  To extricate a Department from circumstances so difficult, and with feeling so intense, was certainly a work that was bound to lead to violent criticism of the work.  I do not think it would be possible for any man occupying that position to have got out of the difficulties of the case without having some very severe criticism of his work.</P>
      <P>Motion made and question put: &ldquo;That Deputy J.J. Walsh be appointed Postmaster-General.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before this appointment is carried I wish to renew a protest I made yesterday evening on the ground that at the moment there is no necessity for a Minister for Fisheries. We need not go over all that ground again because I say that no case has been made out for a Minister and Ministry. A very strong case, and one with which I am in thorough agreement, has been made for the development of Irish fisheries, and for a competent and efficient department in order to develop these fisheries and to carry out the necessary re-arrangements that will have to be made within the next two or three months, but no case has been made out for a Ministry of Fisheries between now and the thirty-first of March.  Furthermore, I shall be glad, and I extend an invitation to the Ministry to tell us exactly the qualifications necessary for the Minister, and I invite the mover of the motion to tell us the qualifications of our colleague Deputy Lynch for this particular Ministry.  To me, and I think to a good many others, what is required in this job is a Department, a <Col N="212" /> staff, and a Head of the Department who will be able to initiate schemes for the development of our fisheries, but who will not be merely a non-expert Head coming into the Dáil to answer questions, and which answers are drawn up by the permanent staff of the Ministry. That, I think, is not the function of whoever is to be Head of this particular Department.  If his function is to be anything at all it is to proceed as rapidly and efficiently as may be with the development of the work of the Department and the fisheries, and not merely to be a Minister put up to answer questions, which answers are drawn up by someone else.  It may be that the Deputy nominated has all the qualifications required, but I invite the mover to give them to us.  I know that in many other matters, education, for instance, and military affairs, the Deputy nominated for this particular job has got certain qualifications, but I want an assurance from the mover and seconder that he has got specific and expert qualifications for this particular job.</P>

      <P>In reply to the question raised by Deputy O'Shannon, I do not think, in the first place, that this is the time to ask whether there should be a Ministry of Fisheries or not.  I think that should have been done before the recommendation was sent to the Committee appointed to select these Ministers, and I understood there was a general agreement in the Dáil that there was a necessity for a Minister for Fisheries. The Dáil will remember that some time ago a Commission was set up by the old Dáil, and that it made exhaustive inquiries into the fishing resources of Ireland, and brought out many facts, the biggest being that there was a big field for improvement in the fishing industry, which, if properly attended to under a capable Ministry, could be made a matter of great financial assistance to the country, and a great benefit to the fishermen, who are now earning a very small livelihood along the sea coasts of Ireland, and whose lot might be very much improved indeed.  Personally, and on the big question, I think it would be a matter of national advantage and a big financial advantage if this was done.  Now I come to the point about the qualifications of Deputy Lynch for this position. The Committee discussed this matter at <Col N="213" /> great length, and they looked around the Dáil for a man who would be capable of organising such a Ministry on good business lines.  The Committee unanimously agreed that Deputy Lynch had the ability, that he was capable of developing this industry, and that in his hands it would be capably managed; that he would have the push and energy to make the industry what it should be&mdash;a great financial advantage to the country.</P>

I admire the assurance of that question being put to the proposer and seconder from the Labour benches.  There were two members of the Labour Party on this Committee, but they did not attend to give their views. This was a unanimous recommendation, and I certainly am abolutely confident that Deputy Lynch has the ability to make this Ministry a success.</P>

      <P>As one who is also a member of the Committee, apart altogether from the personality of the Minister, I am convinced that fisheries form such a large and important question for the community that they deserve a Minister to deal with them.  I put agriculture first, as being of the greatest interest to the people of this country, being the chief industry on which the nation lives.  After that I put fisheries, both as regards the number of people employed and making a living by them, and also as to the value of fish as a food stuff to the nation.  I wish to goodness more of the fish caught about our coast could be brought to the doors of the people for use as food, instead of sending it to foreign countries.  As to the fitness of Deputy Lynch to fill this position I have nothing to say, but I certainly think that he is as good, if not better, than any other Deputy in the Dáil for it.  I make no apology for this appointment.</P>
      <P>Motion made and question put: &ldquo;That Deputy Finian Lynch be appointed Minister of Fisheries.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before the Dáil goes into Committee on the Adaptation Bill I would like to get authority from the Dáil on another matter. <Col N="214" /> The Committee on Procedure appointed some time ago held a number of meetings and decided upon a set of draft Standing Orders to govern intercourse between Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann.  The Committee met again this morning and passed the following Resolution:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee on Procedure be empowered to invite co-operation with Seanad Eireann in relation to Orders bearing on intercourse between Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann, and to such other matters of procedure and privileges as may from time to time arise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that proposal meets with the approval of the Dáil I would like to have if formally proposed and seconded, so that we shall have the authority of the Dáil to get into communication with the Seanad.</P>

      <P>As I understand this resolution it means that the Committee is being given a very wide power, and, I think, that in view of that fact at least one member of the Ministry ought to be on the committee&mdash;&ldquo;Matters of procedure and privilege as may from time to time arise bearing on intercourse between Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  I think that a reasonable request.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to obviate any further difficulties in the future that I make this suggestion.  I do not know that you will be troubled with the attendance of a Minister unless matters arise which the Ministry would consider of importance. It may help to get the work of the committee through more evenly, and it may also avoid having to reject recommendations from the committee should such recommendations not be found suitable by the Ministry.  I do not think that is an unreasonable demand, and it is mainly for the purpose of facilitating the work of the committee that I am making this suggestion.</P>

      <P>The remark I made in connection with the matter is that if the Chairman knows, and he does know, what has been in dispute, it could have been regularised if the Ministry had been communicated with.  The Ministry is not asking for anything exceptional; it is asking to be consulted on matters in which the relations between the two Houses are being considered.  Certainly, as I understand the business, the Ministry is a sort of spokesman of this Dáil, and ought to be consulted on matters of this kind, and I do not see that I have got to withdraw anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest an amendment, not of great moment, perhaps, but it will help to prevent a possible misunderstanding.  The amendment is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, Sub-section 3, line 45&mdash;&ldquo;To insert after the word `Section,' `and subject to the limitations imposed upon the powers of Seanad Eireann by the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point of the amendment is that not knowing how many Acts of Parliament place special powers in the House of Peers or give that House special privileges we do not know what may be involved in the Clause, and Sub-section 3 as it stands might be taken to suggest that we are elevating the Seanad here to a position commensurate with that of the House of Lords as compared with the House of Commons in England.  That, I think, ought to be avoided.  Even though this amendment is not absolutely necessary, it at least emphasises the position that the Seanad in relation to the Oireachtas is not in the position of the House of Lords in relation to the House of Commons, or the Imperial Parliament as it is called.

      <P>I would like to draw particular attention to what perhaps is an oversight in this sub-section.  We have no definition of &ldquo;Stipendiary Magistrate.&rdquo; Am I right?  It strikes me that perhaps this clause is premature unless we put in another clause or proviso stating that the term &ldquo;Stipendiary Magistrate&rdquo; shall be read as meaning the District Justices recently appointed under the resolution of the Provisional Parliament. We want something of that kind defined. We have no Stipendiary Magistrate and in the absence of such this clause would probably have no effect unless we have a defining clause.</P>

      <P>There is another matter in that connection which I think arises here, though I do not quite see how it could be brought in myself in the wording.  I think it is a matter of some importance, and I may say now in advance that I had intended to have raised it before, but withheld any question about it lest it might create any trouble outside in the process of the Courts.  I understand that these recently appointed Stipendiary Magistrates were appointed under the Constabulary Act of, I think, 1834, or thereabouts, and they are appointed under the powers and forms of that Act.  And under that Act a certain archaic oath is required, which was not put to these Stipendiaries, and it also required that a writ be issued by the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper.  I am not sure that their appointment under that law, unless some provision is made now, would not be appointments that would be held valid to such an extent that in respect of such commitments made by such Magistrates a writ of Habeas Corpus might issue.  I think a phrase or two might very easily meet that matter and put it in order, as I suggest it is out of order.</P>

      <P>I suggest it is not out of order, because if the Deputy will read it again with sufficient consideration he will see the two sections together constitute a definition for our purposes of &ldquo;Stipendiary Magistrate.&rdquo;  The Stipendiary Magistrate is a magistrate on whom is now, by the operation of this, conferred all the jurisdiction hitherto exercised by certain Justices and certain Resident Magistrates.  We are operating according <Col N="224" /> to Article 73 of the Constitution, by virtue of which all previous Statutes referable to Ireland continue in force, and all those governing the appointments of Stipendiary Magistrates, for we had such an institution, continue to exist until repealed, and this I say is, by implication, in a manner or measure a definition of Stipendiary Magistrates.</P>

      <P>I do not think the point raised by Deputy Magennis does answer Deputy Johnson.  I think, if the clause stands as it is in the Bill, there will be a certain amount of confusion.  Of course, it all depends on the powers and position and everything else of the late Magistrates.  But take the case raised the other day and dealt with by the Minister for Home Affairs&mdash; the case dealing with the powers of Magistrates in committing lunatics.  The Minister has made an arrangement by which, for instance, representatives on public bodies would act to some extent as Justices in such cases.  What will be the position if this clause stands?</P>

      <P>I take it the effect of any arrangement I have made with regard to the members of Local Authorities would not have the effect of depriving a District Justice of any powers conferred on him by this clause, or Clause (2) in particular.  It would merely mean that, in addition to the power of the District Justice, pending the appointment of Honorary Magistrates, two representatives of Local Authorities, on a doctor's certificate, might commit a lunatic.  The force of Clause (2) is to enable one District Justice to perform any functions with regard to which in the past it was provided that two Justices sitting together would be necessary.  For instance, as from the passing of this, licensing business could be done by a Justice sitting alone, and one of these District Justices could commit a lunatic to an asylum.</P>

If that is clear, and the Law Advisers consider it so, there is nothing more to be said; but it seems to me to require some little defining clause indicating that a Stipendiary Magistrate equals a District Justice.</P>

      <P>I press for consideration of the point that I raised. I am advised the point is one that ought to be rectified if confusion is not to ensue. Under the Act by which these Stipendiary Magistrates are to be appointed they must observe two qualifications. There must be a certain ridiculous form of Oath which they must take and there must be a certain writ of habeas corpus that must issue. Neither of these two qualifications has been fulfilled.  Under the Act we have taken over the Justices that have now been appointed have not fulfilled the qualifications and are therefore not legally appointed.  Therefore in taking over that Act these matters require to be revised.  Now is the occasion to take advantage of the opportunity to make the necessary revision.</P>

The amendment I would like to move <Col N="226" /> is in paragraph 3 of this Section, in the paragraph (a) before the words &ldquo;the expression&rdquo; so that it would read&mdash;&ldquo;Justice includes the expression a Justice of the Peace and does not mean or include a Divisional Magistrate of the City of Dublin, and nothing in this Section shall affect the powers, authority and duties of such Divisional Magistrates&rdquo;, and (b) the expression &ldquo;District Justice&rdquo; means a Magistrate appointed under the British Statute 6 and 7 William IV., Chapter 13, since the 6th day of December, 1922.&rdquo;  It is defining the word District Justice.

      <P>This Sub-section affects the rights of the Board of National Education and the Board of Intermediate Education, and it confers powers upon the Executive Council to remove these Commissions, and the second Sub-section, to which I may perhaps be allowed to refer, I hold empowers the Executive Council to create new bodies of their own motion.  That is a great deal more than the adaptation of an Order.  It means repealing certain Statutes. I draw the Minister's attention to the peculiar character of the National Board which I think was overlooked. The National Board is a Chartered Corporation as well as being a Board of Commissioners.  It is of a character altogether different from the Intermediate Board, and it can be denuded of its functions only by having its charter surrendered voluntarily or by having its charter withdrawn.  I think it well to mention that to the Ministry because these are matters of Education that might have escaped their vigilance.</P>

This deals with Chartered Commissioners who are empowered to hold property, and as under their Charters the National Board Commissioners are holders of property, the cutting off of their existence might lead to difficulty.  There is another point that seems to be wider than what is intended by this section.  It refers to the statutory powers of the Commissioners, so that they are a statutory body.  I would like some assurance that that might not go further and would not affect the Board of Trinity College, which is a statutory body.  It seems to me it is quite open to that interpretation, and that that might affect the very existence of the Board of Trinity College.</P>

For instance, an Order might be issued abolishing the Intermediate Board&mdash;I take that as an instance, because I am interested in education&mdash; and then after that has been done we may have a resolution of this Dáil disapproving of an edict of that sort, but the thing would have already been done, and under Clause 18 any such resolution would not operate to prejudice the validity of any such thing previously done under such an Order.  Whereas in the amendment of Deputy Johnson we have an opportunity, before it is too late, to see the proposal, to estimate its <Col N="231" /> consequences and results and then the considered verdict of the Dáil is pronounced upon the proposal.

I do not think it is intended, but possibly it may be rather more serious than a mere departmental Order.  My suggestion is that in this connection, something rather stronger, some greater safeguard should be provided than a general Order in relation to other clauses in the Act.</P>

That is obviously a piece of mere machinery, and it would be a great pity that such a salutary change should be held up for 21 days, possibly the Dáil might not be sitting, and it would be another 21 days before it would be sanctioned.

It seems rather as though we are taking authority which we cannot use. Whether it is quite clear, or whether it is a slip, I do not know, and I have suggested deleting the words after the words &ldquo;and made by such order.&rdquo;  To put in a Bill a claim that the Minister for Finance may apportion the sums as between two countries rather puts us in a position of authority over the other country, and I am not sure that we are entitled to do that.</P>

      <P>With regard to this clause, it raises acutely the point which was discussed under Clause 8, and I trust it will be received with the careful consideration of the Government before this Act finally becomes law.  In Clause 8 you will remember when any statutory body was in existence, had jurisdiction and so on, the Executive Council might establish a Board of Commissioners to exercise those functions.  There is not a railway company in this country which is not constituted by a Local and Personal Act, and it would appear to me under the construction of this Statute we are now passing, the day that it became law the Executive Council could, if they so thought fit, turn out the Board of Directors of every railway company and every private company that is working <Col N="242" /> under a Private Act of Parliament and send in a Commissioner to do their job. I am perfectly certain that that was never in the contemplation of the Government, but I am almost as certain that that is the effect of this Bill as it now comes before the Dáil, and I do trust the matter will be re-considered. Now that this Bill has to go through many stages, not only here but elsewhere, there are abundant opportunities for correcting any oversight that may be made under the great pressure under which the Government are undoubtedly working.  This matter ought certainly to receive very careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I suggest it is necessary that an amendment to the preamble be made in order to make provision for what we have in Sections 14 and 15 of the Bill.  The preamble appears to be confined entirely to Acts. Even the title is confined entirely to Acts, but under Sections 14 and 15 we have gone beyond that, and we are adapting pending Government contracts and the application of statutory rules, orders and regulations.  Therefore, I would suggest generally that words of some kind be introduced into the title and the preamble to cover that point. I think it is a general rule of Parliamentary procedure and construction of Statutes that the preamble ought at least be wide enough to cover everything included in the Bill.  I will suggest you would include the words &ldquo;orders, regulations and other matters,&rdquo; or words to that effect.  I have not thought it out sufficiently carefully to endeavour to impose an amendment on the Government, but if they would consider what I have said and make an amendment on the Report Stage in some such words as they consider most advisable it would be very desirable.</P>

      <P>I move for leave to bring in this Bill.  The main object of this Bill is to give legal force to the proceedings which have already taken place in Committee, by which certain sums have been agreed to be devoted to the maintenance of the public services for the current financial year. There are certain sums comparatively small in amount which are payable out of the Exchequer in pursuance of permanent Acts, and which are not subject to discussion and variation from year <Col N="246" /> to year.  The present Bill does not affect such sums, but deals with the general requirements of the ordinary Government services, that is with the services which are usually described as Supply services, and requiring discussion from time to time in Committee of Supply.  The figure of £38,051,086 mentioned in the first section of the Bill corresponds with the aggregate amount covered by the resolutions of Supply which were adopted yesterday.  This figure represents the estimated Supply requirements of the entire financial year, and includes sums already issued during the period of the Provisional Government.  I move for permission to bring in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I now move the Second Reading.  The first section of the Bill grants the authority necessary for taking the approved amounts out of the Central Fund.  You may have remembered that it was estimated that our income would be somewhere about £27,000,000, and the total of the estimates is in the neighbourhood of £38,000,000.  The second section of the Bill is required for the purpose of conferring on the Minister of Finance the borrowing power that he may need for the purpose of giving effect to the grants of money which have been authorised by the Dáil.  If affairs in the country were normal, and if the business of public finance could be conducted according to the principle of keeping expenditure within the bounds of revenue, it would be possible to manage with a very limited borrowing power.  In that case, if expenditure became temporarily <Col N="247" /> in excess of revenue, and borrowing was consequently necessitated, it would be possible to lay down that moneys borrowed should be repaid within a very short period, as it would be assumed that the inflow of revenue in the normal course would soon redress a temporarily unfavourable balance.  But, unfortunately, the conditions which confront us are not of this character.  As the Dáil has already been made aware, the revenue of the current year will probably fall seriously short of expenditure, and it appears to be inevitable that the actual outgoings of the Government for some time to come must continue to exceed available revenue, especially during such time as the Government are under obligation to find large amounts in cash for the payment of compensation. It will be noticed that the borrowing power is limited to a maximum amount determined by the issues which may be made under Section 1 of the Bill. Section 3 of the Bill is the really effective portion of it as regards the appropriation of money.  The first section enables a lump sum to be issued out of the Central Fund.  The third section says how the money issued is to be applied, and the details for this purpose are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. The last sentence of the third section concerns a point of technical detail.  In certain cases Departments, besides using the ordinary grants covered by Resolutions of Supply, are also permitted to make use of certain defined classes of receipts which they obtain from one source or another.  These receipts are set out in the Schedule under the heading Appropriations in Aid, and the third section gives the necessary authority for using them to the extent indicated. Section 4 of the Bill deals with another detail, but a detail of importance.  It lays down requirements to be observed in connection with payment of any pension or payment of that character, which is made out of the Votes set out in the Schedule.  The necessity of requiring strict precautions to be taken in regard to the payment of pensioners require no comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I wish to raise, and it <Col N="248" /> may be argued that it is a Committee point.  I notice in Clause 2 that &ldquo;the Minister of Finance may borrow from any person, and the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Ministry of Finance on the credit of the sum authorised to be issued by Section I.&rdquo;  I did not know that it required an Act of Parliament to advance to the Minister of Finance and for him to borrow from any person.  Surely &ldquo;any person&rdquo; includes the Bank of Ireland?  I doubt the wisdom of specifying the Bank of Ireland in this connection, as though we had already decided that the Bank of Ireland was to be the only Bank with whom the Government wished to do business.  It may, in practice for the time being, be the Bank of Ireland with whom the Government has to do business, and it may be that the Bank of Ireland will be the official banker, but that we should specify that the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister of Finance certain monies seems to me to be quite unnecessary, and seems to be singling out that Bank without any necessity.  The Bank of Ireland is a private Bank; and Deputy Cole, I am sure, will agree as to the unwisdom of nationalising a private Bank while leaving all the powers and profits still in the hands of that private Bank.  It is very undesirable, I think, that we should, without consideration, single out the Bank of Ireland in this connection, and it is not necessary.  If the Minister for Finance is to be allowed to borrow from any person and any Bank in Ireland there is no need to single out the Bank of Ireland at all.  That is the only criticism I have to make at the moment; it is really a criticism for Committee rather than a criticism on Second Reading, but it might save time and trouble if the Minister would agree that the name of the Bank of Ireland is not necessary to the Bill and would consent to delete it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get authority from some Bank to advance. If you put in all the Banks that would mean giving a large commission to the Minister of Finance.  It is usual to specify some Bank.  It is our Bank, and it would be unwise to insist on putting in all Banks.  If we were in a position to go to any Bank we would have each Bank inquiring from its <Col N="249" /> brother bank how much the Minister of Finance was indebted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We are simply giving the Bank of Ireland permission to advance. They have that already.  The Munster and Leinster Bank and all the other Banks have permission to advance if they will.</P>

      <P>It is purely a verbal criticism that the Deputy is suggesting, and belongs more properly to a later stage of the Bill, because, as I understand him, all Deputy Johnson desires is that the Minister for Finance may borrow from any person, and may secure a loan from the Bank of Ireland on the credit of the nation, and he wants to change the words that &ldquo;the Bank may advance&rdquo; into that &ldquo;the Minister may borrow.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Clause 2:&mdash;&ldquo;(i.)  The Minister of Finance may borrow from any person and the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister of Finance on the credit of the sum authorised to be issued by Section <Col N="251" /> One of this Act any sum or sums not exceeding the amount so authorised, and for the purpose of such borrowing the Minister of Finance may create and issue any securities bearing such rate of interest and subject to such conditions as to repayment, redemption or otherwise as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(ii.)  The principal and interest of any securities issued under this Act and the expenses incurred in connection with the issue of such securities shall be charged on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.</P>
    <P>(iii.)  Any money raised by securities issued under this Act shall be placed to the credit of the account of the Exchequer, and shall form part of the Central Fund and be available in any manner in which such Fund is available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we must have some Bank.  You can, if you wish, have several Banks, but at any rate we must consolidate in one Central Fund the resources of the revenue of the State, and it is obviously essential that we should deal with one Bank.  One Bank should have some authority to permit of the overdrawing of the account or the providing you with the money you require.  I read in the Press yesterday that the Provisional Government was reputed to have gone to the Bank of Ireland and borrowed one million at 6 per cent.  I read the announcement in three papers, and I did not find any of them telling the same story.  It is not a fact that we borrowed one million at 6 per cent. from the Bank.  We did not borrow it at 6 per cent.; we did not borrow it at all. How people outside the Government know all the things they know and state them soberly before a Committee is more than I can understand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first I have heard of any million pounds.  I did not read it even in the newspapers, but I think it is undesirable that we should put into this Bill this particular phrase: &ldquo;And the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  As I understand <Col N="252" /> it the Bank of Ireland has power without any Act of Parliament to advance to the Minister for Finance any monies. The Bank of Ireland has been advancing, I take it, monies, small or large I do not know, without an Act of Parliament, and I am not objecting to the Minister for Finance fixing upon the Bank of Ireland as his banker for the time being.  But it seems to me to be unnecessary to single out the Bank of Ireland here, for it is the only body that is selected to advance to the Ministry for Finance certain sums.  The Minister for Finance may borrow from any person.  Any person means any Bank as well as individual, but we are asked to go further and say that the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister for Finance on the credit of the sum authorised to be issued any sum of money.  I want to enlarge the powers of the Minister, and I do not want even to imply that only the Bank of Ireland is capable of advancing to him sums of money. And I think it is unfortunate that he should select the Bank of Ireland and advertise it in this way when it is quite unnecessary.  I propose to amend this by striking out the words &ldquo;of the Bank of Ireland&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;any Bank of good repute having its head office in Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;any bank of good repute which may be selected by the Minister for Finance.  I am prepared to go as far as that.  But I am not prepared to agree to advertising this private institution&mdash;the Bank of Ireland&mdash;over and above any other Bank that may have its headquarters in Ireland.  Its only claim to preference is that it has hitherto been the agent of the British Government. I do not think it has a claim for preference from the Irish Government, and there are other Banks capable of assisting the Government here, and you should not select one and put it in the position by Act of Parliament, on the initiative of the Parliament itself, not by special application from that Bank, and that we are to ennoble by Act of Parliament the Bank of Ireland over and above any other Bank in this country is to me a quite unnecessary and an uncalled-for advertisement.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>

It gives one Bank an undue position over the rest.  Unless there is some particular reason no Bank should be made the Government Bank at all.  If there is a sane reason I will support the Bill, but if there is not I will seriously consider Deputy Johnson's amendment.</P>

      <P>I am quite in sympathy with Deputy Johnson and take up much the same position as Deputy Gorey.  If the Government could find out some way of making it clear that all the Banks would get any advantage there may be in being practically the repository of the enormous funds of the Government&mdash;I mean in normal times, for of course it is different now, when the Banks lend to the Government&mdash;I think it would be a very popular thing in the country if there could be an impartial distribution of the revenues of the nation amongst them all.  I do not know whether it is possible to have any such system carried into effect as that which prevails in Insurance Companies, which re-insure with one another the sums they receive from clients.  I do not know whether that could be done so that the national revenue would be pooled among all the Banks, but it seems to me that it would be a very fair way of dealing with the system if some system like that could be carried into effect and all the Banks could receive and give, as their revenues fluctuate.  If that could be done, I think it would be very desirable.</P>

      <P>Surely the intention is to authorise the Ministry to pledge the security of the Saorstát in the Bank for loans, and when we come to the later Sub-section, that any moneys so raised shall form part of the Central Fund to be available in any manner in which such Fund is available.  We shall find ourselves creating not merely difficulty for the Minister for Finance, but serious difficulties for the Banks if they all simultaneously are to be pledges of the National security. Furthermore, it has been the custom to have armed guards or sentinels in the Banks in which the National securities <Col N="254" /> are deposited, and there might be a very serious difficulty as regards this.  But I suppose we all look forward to the time when a Bank shall be created, which does not now exist, and which shall be something in the nature of a State Bank, and pending that time we may authorise the Minister for Finance to raise money to secure advances in any Bank he may select.  Personally, I happen to be interested in the National Bank, which precludes me from advancing its claims.</P>

      <P>I see a difficulty in Deputy Johnson's motion.  Are you not tying the Government to get money at a price which they might find to be higher in Ireland than elsewhere? If the Government decide to get the money&mdash;the Bank of Montreal has been mentioned by the President&mdash;then Deputy Johnson's motion would knock that out.  I think the suggestion of Deputy Gorey is the right one, that the Minister of Finance may borrow from any person or Bank he likes.  There is no use in paying out money here because a Bank has a head office in Ireland if you get it cheaper elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could accept the amendment.  The Bank of Ireland is at the present time acting for us, and has control of all these funds and accounts.  It understands, as it were, the Government business, and I would not be prepared, without giving the matter very careful consideration, to agree to the amendment.  It would seem that no direct authority would be given to this Bank to advance the money, and a general direction such as that which would include four or five people is not, to my mind, at this moment good public business.  I have not heard of the same thing happening before with regard to any public account, and I do not think it would be advisable.  If you were thinking of making such an alteration it would be necessary, in my view, to specify the particular service and the amount for such a Bank, and I am not prepared at the moment to recommend the Dáil to accept such a proposition. In other words, a limit should be fixed to the sum for each particular institution. <Col N="255" /> I do not think that would be easily found at the present moment, and you would place the Banks in a very difficult position.  You would have to undertake to declare that you were not dealing with other Banks.  We are dealing direct with an institution which is authorised to advance to us, on the authority of this Act, a sum of something like £10,000,000.  That might be on short loan, and it might not be necessary to get it from them at all.  That is, if we were raising it from any source it might not be necessary to borrow, but at the moment I do not think it would be practicable to adopt the suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly true, as Mr. Gorey points out, that the amendment does not insist that the Minister will have to go to a number of Banks. It is leaving him that discretion, which he has already exercised.  It is leaving him in the same position under this Act as he had been under the Provisional Government.  He then exercised discretion, and he used the Bank of Ireland. I am proposing to leave him with that discretion, but I object to ennobling the Bank of Ireland over and above every other Bank by inserting the title in this Bill.  I am not sure whether, if we passed this in its present form, we would not require a definition of what is the Bank of Ireland.  This is a new assembly. We have the third bill, and we are, as a matter of fact, dealing with matters of which we have had no concern before.  We do not know, as an official body, whether there is such a body as the Bank of Ireland in existence.  We would want to know something of its character; who are its shareholders; and what are its reserves.  Why should it be given special credit by this Dáil?  If you are going to leave this title and this institution, which presumably exists, then we should have a definition Clause as to <Col N="256" /> what that Bank consists of.  I submit the amendment is very much more in conformity with law-making than the draft as proposed, because we propose to leave to the discretion of the Minister who is responsible for Finance the right to choose which bank he shall deal with between now and the end of March. Now that is a discretion which he has already exercised.  I am anxious to leave that discretion with him, but I am very much averse to advertising, and that is the whole thing, advertising the Bank of Ireland in an Act of Parliament No. 3 of 1922.</P>

I did not know that the Bank of Ireland was going to be mentioned, and I did not know until this evening that there was a statutory disadvantage suffered by the Bank of Ireland, that they must get statutory authority or they could not advance money.  I undertake to look into it for the next Appropriation Bill, and to see if some other terminology cannot be used in order to remove any misconceptions that there may be that we are doing something for the Bank of Ireland here that we would not do for another Bank.  I will undertake <Col N="260" /> to do that.  The damage will not be covered by the ten millions, and there is plenty of time to allow of that being considered by the Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is now that in one half line of a Bill dealing with appropriations we are to pass legislation enacting that the Bank of Ireland may do henceforth what it has never done before.  Now, that is the suggestion of Deputy Figgis, and I think the Minister for Finance is supporting that suggestion.  Surely if the Bank of Ireland is precluded by its Charter from lending money to the Government the right course for that Bank to adopt is to come to the Parliament for Private Bill legislation to increase its powers and authority.  But we are asked here to remove that disability which is alleged to exist without any reason being given for its removal. We have the right to assume that if there was a disability imposed upon the Bank there was some reason for it, and we are asked now, incidentally, without any explanations, to remove that disability, to enlarge the Charter, to enlarge the powers of that Bank without any <i>quid pro quo.</i>  Now, that is an entirely unwise and unsatisfactory proposal to make. The Dáil has defeated the amendment, and I rather gathered that the reason for voting it down was because there was a provision in the amendment that said that Banks must have their headquarters in Ireland.  Many Deputies expressed the view that that was limiting matters too much, and that we should not limit it to Banks having their headquarters in Ireland.  If that phrase had not occurred in the amendment I am sure 20 other Deputies would have voted for the amendment.  But I want to assist the Minister, and I want to assist him to this extent, that if the Bank of Ireland required this permission, and he is prepared to agree to the insertion of the words after the Bank of Ireland, &ldquo;The <Col N="261" /> Munster and Leinster Bank,&rdquo;&ldquo;The National Provincial Bank,&rdquo;&ldquo;The National Bank,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Hibernian Bank,&rdquo; I will even go so far as to say &ldquo;The Ulster Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Northern Banking Company,&rdquo; and such others as the Minister himself may suggest.  Now, that will give the Bank of Ireland all the powers which this clause would give, but it will not ennoble them over and above other Banks.  I ask the Minister if he will accept that.</P>

      <P>Mine amounts to the same thing as the President's proposal, with this difference that his still leaves the objection that resides in the minds of some Deputies that the Bank of Ireland is getting a special advertisement by being the sole Bank mentioned, and my amendment removes that difficulty by mentioning other Banks.  Deputy Johnson seems to refuse to take the Law Officer's advice that the President has conformed to, to wit, that the Bank <Col N="262" /> of Ireland would be excluded unless now authorised.  I accept that legal opinion that the Bank of Ireland is excluded unless it is empowered especially to make an advance.  Consequently the most harmless form in which this thing can be proposed is to put it in the discretion of the Minister to secure advances from any Bank that he desires, at the same time not putting the Bank of Ireland under a disability by pretending something else.</P>

      <P>I would like to explain that if you put in &ldquo;any person or banking corporation in Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; you are giving authority to the Minister for Finance to borrow from them, but if you say &ldquo;and the Bank of Ireland may advance and the Hibernian Bank may advance and the Munster and Leinster Bank may advance,&rdquo; so far as those banks are concerned you are conferring no authority on them; you are not giving them any advantage that they do not at this moment enjoy.  You do give an advantage if you put in beforehand, &ldquo;any person or banking corporation,&rdquo; and we can borrow from them. We can borrow from them at this moment without their being mentioned. But my information is this&mdash;I have not <Col N="265" /> seen the Charter of the Bank of Ireland &mdash;that unless the Bank of Ireland is mentioned there in that respect I am not in a position, and the Saorstát is not in the position, to borrow a single sixpence from that Bank, and that is why it is mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press my amendment after the discussion, but I take it that the meaning of it is that the Bank of Ireland has got a certain grip upon the Ministry, and intends to tighten that grip as hard as they can, and having got that grip they intend to get their powers enlarged by a side wind, by one line of a Clause in that Bill which does not directly concern them, and I question very much whether it is in order to bring in a matter of that kind in such a Bill.  It is bringing in, by a side wind, a proposal to enlarge the powers of a private corporation.  We are told that it has not powers at present, and now we are asked, by this side wind, to insert in an Appropriation Act a line which enlarges those powers which, for some reason or other, were denied to them when the Charter was approved, and I protest very strongly against any such procedure.</P>

      <P>The Treasury of Saorstát Eireann is just as independent as the rest.  I went with the late General Collins for the first time to the Bank of Ireland.  The Treasury did not go.  We were acting on behalf of the Provisional Government at the time.  I was amazed at that time to hear the then Governor of the Bank of Ireland asking us what authority we had.  It is well known that we were an illegal assembly at the time, from the point of view of strict law, and that the position was not legalised until the 1st of April.  The terms that are here are the terms that are in any Appropriation Act, I am informed, that passes through the British Parliament in regard to the Bank of England.  I do not know whether they had any dealings with the Bank of Ireland or not, but I must say I never heard a more ridiculous or senseless or rhetorical expression of opinion than that the Ministry and the Treasury are in the grip of the Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have not much to add to complete what I intended to say yesterday evening when the adjournment was moved.  I would just like to say a few words about the expression of regret that is here that the Executive is not dealing with the report made to the Government by the Commission on Irish Railways.  Personally I think it is very wise for the Government to postpone consideration of this big question until we can discuss it, having established ordered government, until we can discuss it in normal times and look at it from a normal point of view.  I feel sure there will be big differences of opinion on the question, and I am certain that many Deputies in this Dáil will take different points of view.  I do not intend to express any point of view at present until it comes <Col N="269" /> up in another form.  I merely say that I think the Government are wise in postponing consideration of this big question.</P>

      <P>I have heard with surprise the remarks of the Deputy on my right, and the references to the policy of the Government in deferring consideration of the railway question.  The railways, it has always been said, are the arteries of a country. If they are, the arteries of the body are always looked after by a doctor, and if you neglect the arteries of the body, the body will not live; and I expect, if you do not look after the arteries of the country, the country will not live.  To my mind, the railway companies at the present time are in a precarious condition, and it is the duty of the Government to look after this very vital question, which will not admit of delay.  It must be attended to.  The Government well knows that the agreement between the men and the company is nearing its completion.  The thing must be gone into thoroughly.  It will not bear to be put off from day to day; it must be dealt with at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. Joseph McGrath)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that with practically every word in Deputy Johnson's speech of yesterday I agree.  That is, of course, if the times were normal.  There is no doubt about it, if the times were normal I would agree with almost all of what he has said.  I believe he mentioned in his speech yesterday&mdash;I unfortunately did not hear the whole of it, but I read the report of it&mdash;he admitted that the times were not normal, and he said that he expected to be met with the answer from the Ministerial benches that there was no money.  That is a fact, of course.  There is no money.  I would like to point out that, even if there was money, and any amount of it, at the disposal of the Ministry ready to expend, I would say it would be very foolish if the Ministry attempted to expend that money without first having prepared proper and well-considered schemes&mdash; schemes that had been considered by men who knew what they were considering. I would like to remind you of an occasion about four weeks ago when this question of unemployment came up.  A <Col N="270" /> very direct question was put to me by Deputy Johnson as to what our policy was.  I think he congratulated me upon being so frank as to say that we had no policy.  At that time I said it was our intention to see if it were possible to get at the root of this unemployment evil.  We have not lost time since then, we have been investigating it and we have been doing everything humanly possible to get at the bottom of this.  This week we had definitely decided that a certain Commission must be set up.  We decided it before the Address was framed.  The personnel of this Commission or Committee has been named.  The members of it must be, and will be, approached this week, I hope.  The idea is that all that count on representative bodies will be represented on the Committee, and they will investigate and inquire into and will approach all bodies that are now&mdash;numbers of them at least &mdash;overlapping in the payment of moneys from different sources&mdash;I refer to St. Vincent de Paul Society, the White Cross, the Poor Law and others.  There is absolutely no one body knows what the other body is doing.  The idea of this Committee will be to find out what money is spent, yearly, for instance, by those bodies, and the class that benefits. Along with that they will see the actual amount, and put that along with the money expended on unemployment and uncovenanted insurance.  Now, about unemployment insurance, what is commonly known as the Capitalist class come along to you and say this money is absolutely thrown away, and you get no return.  Some members on the Labour benches will know what I am referring to now.  But when you put it up to those people to put some concrete proposal before you, they can put up nothing, and in the end the bubble is burst, and there is nothing there.  They must admit that the payment of unemployment insurance benefit is necessary.  The Government is, and has been, for the last six months&mdash;particularly the department that I represent&mdash;receiving deputations from every part of the country and from public bodies in general.  They all come to us with the suggestion that it is a question of Government Grants.  There is no money.  The Government cannot do anything.  Then the question of Unemployment Benefit comes up, but when we put a definite <Col N="271" /> concrete proposal before them they can do nothing.  This Committee I have referred to will, we hope, go into all these things.  It will be a really representative Committee, and the matters to be investigated are ones on which we are hoping Labour will give us assistance. We are hoping that a Scheme or Schemes can be brought out within a couple of months.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that it is not right that we should say until this war is over nothing can be done.  The Ministry agree with me in that.  But, even if we had the money, we must have some definite scheme before expending anything.  I have recollections of money being spent in this city to relieve unemployment, and Deputies will know very well how that money was spent, and whether it relieved unemployment or not.  Consequently, I am sure, members of the Dáil will agree with me that we must have definite schemes before we lay out any money.  It may appear from the Governor-General's Address that matters were indefinite, but I am hoping that when in April next we will be budgeting, provision will be made for definite schemes that will be brought before us.  We will then know what we are doing, and I hope we will be able to get a fair amount of money to carry out these schemes, the object being to help the country generally and relieve unemployment. It is hardly fair, and I do not think it was really meant, that we should be expected to be in a position to definitely state beforehand what we intend to do in regard to this question of unemployment, or the economic condition of the country generally.  Undoubtedly, had things been normal, we would be in a position to do something, and if we were not in a position we would be deserving of criticism.  Things are not normal; I think that is recognised. We have not got any opportunity of deliberating or seeing the people whom we should see, or settling down to those things.  Deputy Johnson yesterday was quite correct when he said that the enemy, as he called them, were out simply to destroy us economically.  He pointed out at the same time that there were portions of Ireland where we might introduce some schemes.  He is correct there also, but if those people are out to destroy us economically, naturally the first thing they would do would be to <Col N="272" /> go to the portions of Ireland where we would be introducing those schemes.  Deputy O'Shannon would say to that, that it shows we are not competent to govern, when we could not prevent those people going there.  That is the fact all the same. We cannot do these things.  As to the railways, we have not shelved the Railway Commission's report.  We have not pigeon-holed it; by no means have we done so.  The position at the moment is extremely delicate.  The Government have made up their minds on the matter. The position, as I say, is delicate&mdash;so delicate that I do not want to say anything in this Dáil about it.  I think the real anxiety of the Deputies on the other side was as regards whether we were letting things drift&mdash;not dealing with the report, not looking ahead, and forgetting that the agreement ends this month.  I can assure them there is no reason for such anxiety.  We are not overlooking those things.  The situation is so delicate that any statement here might, perhaps, render all our efforts up to the present fruitless.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will take it from me, let me assure him that we, too, recognise the delicacy of the situation so far as the railways are concerned.  So far as the Ministry is concerned, I do not think that the report of the Railway Commission will be shelved.  I fancy the report is haunting them by night as well as by day rather than that it is shelved.  Now, we have always recognised the difficulty in which the Government is.  Nobody has been more ready to make allowance for the Government than we on these benches here.  If the times were normal and this Dáil were normal, you may take it we would be much more severe in our criticisms, and would take much greater pains in our attacks in certain directions upon the Government.  But even the abnormality of the times is not, to some of us, sufficient excuse for all the things that are being done and all the things that are not being done.  As I listened to the Minister speaking about the difficulty and the abnormality of the times and the particular task upon which the Government was engaged&mdash;the task of restoring order and orderly government throughout the country&mdash;it occurred to me again, as it occurred to us frequently within the last month or two, and particularly in the last <Col N="273" /> week or two, that it might be well worth the Government's time to see if they could not devise some means of using what I may call the ordinary governmental functions of Governments different from those functions which they are at present required to carry out in the conduct of the war.  I think, if we had some kind of separation of functions like that, perhaps even the war might get a chance of being carried on better, not to speak about the better carrying on of the ordinary civil functions of the Government of the country.  I think if the Government to any extent devoted less of their attention to the military&mdash;I am not making a concrete suggestion upon that because I am a little out of order&mdash;but if they consider that aspect of things, perhaps it would be better.  The Minister says a Commission has been set up.  I hope his last reference to it more accurately describes what it is going to do than his first reference; but while that Commission is being set up, and pursuing all the investigations he has been speaking about, he knows perfectly well there will be people dying who are now on the verge of starvation, and he knows that there are people now on the verge of starvation.  I came across a case last night of two such people, both of them adults, but one considerably up in years, and they have got to exist on about 22s. a week, for the two of them.  That cannot go on for very long, and while this Commission is probing, rooting and investigating the whole situation is getting worse, and worse.  Has the Government in the meanwhile anything at all to offer to the unemployed beyond the Unemployment Insurance?  Can it do anything in the way of making a stop-gap.  I notice that the British Government and the Belfast Government are making some little effort in this direction.  I think the effort is altogether insufficient, but they are making a little effort.  There is something that they define as loans granted to meet not the whole situation that has been created by the tremendous unemployment, but temporarily to bring in to employment certain people not presently in employment, and will it be only until such time as this Commission places its investigations before the Ministry that any scheme to meet the unemployment existing can be carried out by legislation? Now, in this amendment we are making objection that the Government <Col N="274" /> does not apparently contemplate legislation on these things.  In the Government's programme here is laid down nine or ten measures that are to be proposed. I heard Deputy Cole say yesterday evening that one would think from Deputy Johnson's speech that the thirty or forty millions we have passed were going to be spent upon administration and not on reconstruction.  Now, if the Deputy will look over the list of legislation specified he will find that 9/10ths of it is administration and war legislation of one kind or another.  I agree that in order that you may have reconstruction you will have to complete some kind of framework first, and that a good deal of money will have to be spent upon that.  The Government did not meet fairly and squarely, with few exceptions, the case put up from these benches. Deputy Dolan referred to the Land Purchase Act which is to be brought in. Of course Deputy Dolan knows that the Land Purchase Act is not an Act that is going to be the legislative fruit of the Agricultural and Land Commission presently sitting.  He knows that it is really an Act intended to complete the British Land Purchase Acts passed for Ireland.  He said that it would bring a certain measure of land to certain landless people and small farming people in the West.  Quite true, and in other places too, but the great bulk of the unemployment is not in the West, and it is not going to be remedied to any extent at all by the Land Purchase Act, and Deputy Dolan knows that very well. I was glad to observe that the Minister, with that frankness which is characteristic of him, did not pretend that this Government is only in office for a week as other Deputies are apt to do.  We used to hear the sing-song that this or that cannot be done before the 6th December. We now hear a number of Deputies with a variation of that sing-song that it is too near the 6th December and that the Government has only been established for a week and that they should get a chance of seeing where they are.  Deputy Wilson yesterday evening made a speech after which I think we should invite him to come over and sit on these Benches, because he put all our case when he said, and I presume he had authority for the statement, that if all the people of Ireland or of the twenty-six Counties were <Col N="275" /> employed for three weeks in the production of textiles they would produce as much textiles as the people of Ireland required, and that if they were engaged for another period of, I do not know how many weeks, in agricultural production, they would produce all the agricultural produce necessary for the people of Ireland, and so on through the gamut, if engaged in certain production or distribution.  They would be able to produce enough for the whole population in Ireland, but in spite of that there are people who cannot get enough textiles or agricultural products or any other things produced in Ireland.  Why?  Deputy Wilson did not answer, because he knows why.  Tinkering with those things will not solve these things at all, and we know that the root of the whole trouble is the system. Deputy Wilson says, &ldquo;Do certain things in three weeks, and certain other things in three months.&rdquo;  When you have got all those products, you mismanage the whole distribution of them.  They are distributed in such a way that some people have got too much of them and other people have got too little; and while people are suffering and while stomachs are empty in Ireland, some of those products are shipped away to other countries. There is something rotten in the state of Ireland there.  The whole system is wrong, and it is the job and the duty of the rulers of the country to see that the system is so changed that those old evils which we suffered in the past are minimised now; and they can be minimised now if the job is gone about in the right way.  Another Deputy seemed to take it as a grievance that we here, Labour Deputies, are desirous that the working people of Ireland should have higher wages than the working people of anywhere else.  We do.  We are not in the least ashamed of the desire.  To us the general interest is not what it seems to be to Deputy Milroy&mdash;a means of getting away from the particular needs of individuals.  We are concerned with the good and decent living of the individual, because to us his general interest is not an abstraction at all, and the community is not an abstraction at all.  But this people, this Ireland, this community of ours is composed of a certain number of individuals, and when we talk about Ireland <Col N="276" /> or the nation, or the people, we are talking about the men and women, the boys and girls, the whole manhood and womanhood of Ireland, and therefore we have got to consider the chances of the decent livelihood and the decent and honourable living of the men and women in this State.  For that reason we have not been willing, and shall not be willing to agree that because people in Belfast or in England, or in France or in Germany, have had their wages and standard of living cut down and reduced, that therefore we here in Ireland must suffer the same reduction in our wages, standard of living, and so forth.  We are not willing that that should be so.  We would want the whole body of the Irish people, to use a Scotch phrase, rather &ldquo;to have a good conceit of ourselves.&rdquo; That is one of the things that is wrong.  Undoubtedly it is one part of the legacy of our years of slavery that the ordinary life in Ireland is not considered as highly as it ought to be considered.  Now, we are not asking in this particular thing for higher wages. We are asking for employment; that those who live in Ireland should have the right to as decent a living as anybody else, should get a fair opportunity to live in Ireland and work in Ireland. The Minister is quite in agreement that the mere giving out of doles is not going to get you very far, but that is better than nothing.  But there are people in Ireland who would give nothing, who would allow starvation, who say that in order that we may have profits a certain number of people must suffer.  We are dead up against that.  We on those benches may seem a bit remarkable to Deputy Dolan who was speaking for a class.  I have no hesitation in speaking for the whole citizenship of Ireland, and we see that unless remedies are got for those things, and got soon, that the whole citizenship of Ireland is going to suffer, because you cannot have any part of the body politic suffering or diseased without that suffering and disease affecting the whole of the body politic.  There was a certain untruth in the statement the Ministry put into the mouth of the Governor-General when he said that if it were not for civil war there would be much less unemployment in Ireland than in any other country.  That is not true. It is true that the civil war led to an <Col N="277" /> aggravation of unemployment, but there was unemployment, and growing unemployment, before the civil war at all, and this Dáil knows it, because some of us came up when the Second Dáil was wrangling over the Treaty, to warn the Second Dáil that the menace of unemployment was getting very serious indeed. Unemployment is not an Irish question alone, nor an English question alone.  It is a question affecting most countries, but we in Ireland, with our good conceit of ourselves developed too much on the one side, think that the Irish nation is so good, so national, that we cannot see that the things affecting us are the same things as affect other people.  In one respect our conceit is too great and too little in another.  I hope the Minister will be able to reply that even for this &ldquo;No Man's Land,&rdquo; this interval between the preparation of those big schemes and the necessary legislation, something is going to be done, even if it is only an increase, first of all in the amount of unemployment insurance, and secondly, an extension in the area over which the insurance may be paid.  Deputy Wilson in running away, because it was nothing else, from one suggestion made by Deputy Johnson yesterday said that Deputy Johnson wanted the Government to issue scrip, and if that were done the same consequences would follow in Ireland as followed in Russia and Germany.  They would not, because the state of Germany and Austria are not due to the things Deputy Wilson thinks or pretends to think they are due to; they are due to quite different causes altogether, and no Deputy supporting the Government has faced the proposition which Deputy Johnson made yesterday. Not a single one of them has attempted to understand what the proposal actually was.  I hope some of the Ministers will face it and answer it.  Deputies said yesterday that if you increase agriculture you would not get markets in this country.  I submit it is the duty of the rulers in this country to devise ways and means for finding markets for the products of the country.  While not in a good many things a protectionist at all I subscribe to Deputy Johnson's dictum that there should be certain measures taken to find markets in Ireland for certain Irish products which are going outside Ireland.  Deputy Milroy, Deputy <Col N="278" /> Cole, and other Deputies have been deprecating hasty and immature legislation. They were referring particularly to the reports of the Railway Commission.  I am not going to go into the delicate position of the Railways at all, but I am going to remind those and other Deputies that there has been no haste or immaturity about the work of that Commission.</P>

      <P>The Commission came into being early this year, it sat continuously for several months, it made its report some time early in August and there is a pretty good stretch of time between August and Christmas, and if you take in that time and the time that the Commission actually spent in investigating the question you will have at least eight or nine months.  Not only that, but this Commission was not the first Railway Commission to enquire into the Irish Railways or to come to almost the same conclusion.  It is a good many years since that was done. When I heard Deputy Cole say that once upon a time he believed in Railway nationalisation as a panacea for all the ills, I can recall Deputy Cole and nearly every other Deputy, except those who sit on these benches, and all the eloquent speeches that they have been making for ten or fifteen years and all the fine and well-reasoned arguments and articles there used to be in &ldquo;The United Irishman,&rdquo;&ldquo;Sinn Fein,&rdquo;&ldquo;Nationality,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Freedom,&rdquo; and the schemes and specifications of schemes of one kind or another under the old National Council of Sinn Fein and the pamphlet after pamphlet and the heaps and heaps of literature that used to go out to the country.  These Deputies said, &ldquo;As soon as we got independence we will be able to do all these things.&rdquo;  Then Deputy Dolan, Deputy Cole, and Deputy Milroy turn around now and say we must not do anything hastily and without mature deliberation. We must not have any legislation which is not grounded over a long period of investigation. I remember people whom these Deputies followed who went back to Grattan's Parliament to find schemes and plans suitable for adaptation when the first Irish Parliament would be sitting. The first Irish Parliament is sitting now, and we have the spectacle of <Col N="279" /> Deputy Cole and Deputy Milroy stripping off legislative measure after legislative measure until they produce nothing but legislative barrenness, and standing naked before us and throwing overboard everything by which they climbed to power.  They say they have experience of all these things, and that all their experience has driven them against such Government schemes as nationalisation. No, their experience has not done anything of the kind.  They never believed in these things at all; but they were in Opposition then.  They were out against the brutal British Government that was preventing all these things from being done&mdash;the only thing standing between Ireland and salvation.  They find, of course, that when they come into power they have other responsibilities, other duties; and so the Government produces, instead of ameliorative legislation or promises of ameliorative legislation, seven, eight, nine, or ten proposals that are not constructive proposals at all.  There has been talk here of immature legislation. Now, for instance, I am waiting to see how far the new Ministry of Fisheries is going to act with the report of the Fisheries Commission, because I know there is a principle in that report that many Deputies are not willing to admit, and it would bring the fisheries into the state they ought to be in and it would give considerable employment.  Although the Government says it is willing to do something for unemployment, it has not taken up that report, and it has not promised legislation on it.  How many more Commissions are we going to have and no promise of legislation?  We have had the Army, Land Purchase, Civic Guard, Judiciary, and everything else like that, but none of these other things.  Deputy Cole says that the more competition is adopted to trade and the more competition among Irish railways the better would be the development of Irish industries and Irish trade.  The truth is that cut-throat competition has compelled this Dáil to inquire into the whole system of the railways, and it will compel it to inquire into the prices of things and into a great many other things as well.  I do not exactly understand how Deputy Cole arrived at the conclusion that the more competition there was amongst the railways the better for industry and trade. <Col N="280" /> We want to see the competition among the railways.  We all know that the Great Western Railway runs through certain areas, the Great Southern and Western through others, and the Dublin and South Eastern through others, but I hold that these are not competitive railways, though they may be here and there. If you follow the Deputy's argument logically, you would give some employment, if only in the building of a railway. You would run another railway to Wexford some distance away from the Dublin and South Eastern, and let them compete one against the other.  That is a case of the more competition the better. He instanced the Post Office as a horrible example of nationalisation.  Now, Government control is not necessarily nationalisation at all, and there is no particular reason why people should grumble and grouse if the Post Office lost half a million or a million a year. The whole thing, as I said before, depends on this, whether the Post Office or any other service is giving value for the money spent on it.  You might as well turn round and say the public streets and the public roads should either give a profit or pay their way.  Of course they pay their way, but they do not bring in revenue to the Government.  A service that pays its way is not necessarily a service that brings revenue to the Government at all.  Not necessarily. There are certain services which are of vital national importance.  We maintain that these services should be helped by the State, if necessary should be controlled and managed by the State, and that there is no reason at all why we should chew the rag with the Postmaster-General, or the Head of any other Department, as long as his Department is giving full value for money, even though that Department does not bring in the revenue that some people would like it to bring in.  I hope the Ministry will be able to assure us that while this Commission that is spoken of is being set up that something here and now is going to be done for unemployment. There is a certain vicious circle and it is almost as impossible for some people to tell whether the egg or the chicken came first as it is to tell whether certain people engaged in operations against the Government produce a certain amount of unemployment, or <Col N="281" /> whether that unemployment produced these operations against the Government. I have met not a few people connected with the present jails and internment camps, and I will tell you what one told me, and I found his statement pretty well confirmed by a good many others, including some of those that the Government has since released from these camps or jails.  He said that the people in the jails and camps could be divided into three categories, and that one-third of these certainly were not likely to have been there, and would not have been likely to engage in the operation that brought them there, had it not been that they had nothing to do. They had no work to go to, and because they had no way of earning their living they developed into bandits pure and simple&mdash;perhaps bandits neither pure nor simple. They had developed into bandits and it was purely due to unemployment.  If something is not done to meet the unemployment, even though you jail all the Irregulars, gang after gang, company after company, of them, your present system will still be producing people, who have got to live by some means or other, and they are going to live by force, by stealing, by banditry, or some other way.  I hope the Minister will face the argument fair and square and try to meet Deputy Johnson's case, and be able to assure us that in the meantime the Government will take steps, so that as few as possible will die, in spite of the fact that we can produce all the textiles we want in three weeks and all the other things in a few months.</P>

      <P>I take the view that the speech we listened to the other day, defining the Government's policy was a sound and fair intention to develop and do its best for the country. There may have been a few items lacking, and there may have been a few aspects of the situation that were not dealt with, but taking the speech as a whole, as far as it went, I think it was a fine and statesmanlike forecast of the <Col N="282" /> policy they are going to pursue.  I listened yesterday to Deputy Johnson's amendment to the Address, and I was trying to find out from his speech what he meant and more particularly what he meant to do.  I could not find anything really constructive in his whole oration.  He certainly advises us that the first move should be on the land, but he was very wise in not telling us what that move should be, or what form it should take.  His party indulged in that sort of thing a few months ago, and I suppose they did not want to do it again.  One of the results of agricultural production at the moment is that one million barrels of barley are lying about and can be bought at 12/- a barrel.  I bought it myself at that price, and potatoes are selling wholesale for less than 5/- for 20 stones.  These are some of the things that the land produces. Do we want more of that?  Do we want more agriculture?  True, Mr. Johnson has not mentioned a policy.  He was very wise in that, I think.  Now, do we want the State to subsidise operations on the land, and to what end; or do we want the State to compel owners of the soil to take responsibility that should belong to the State?  I as the representative of the owners of the soil will see that we do not shoulder any responsibility except our own and so far as my efforts go nothing in the way of State responsibility will be shouldered by us. Anything in the nature of responsibility belonging to other sections of the community will not be shouldered by us. Now, we hear a good deal of cheap claptrap about what the State owes the citizens.  I have been on these benches for months and I have never heard a word inside this Dáil or outside of it of what citizens owe the State.  The power and wealth and prosperity of the nation cannot come from the top; they must come from the bottom, and they must be measured by the individual efforts of the members of the community.  If individual members of the community will not give of their best the State must be poor and nobody is to blame unless the people themselves.  Now, are we giving of our best in this country?  It is all very well for Deputy Cathal O'Shannon to say that no matter what the wages are in other districts and other countries &ldquo;We will not agree to that; we must have a higher wage if we can.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> He did not say it, but our output is less than in any other country; is less than any other country in the world; our individual effort is less than in any other country.  How then can we reasonably expect a higher standard of living than any other country?  Surely we must come down to bed-rock and admit we are living on this earth and not living in the clouds.  If we go to Rome we must do as Rome does.  If the people of other countries are satisfied to work for a lower standard and give a better output, surely, if we want to exist, we must do likewise or go to another and a better world.  Now, I have said that the standard of output here is lower than anywhere else.  So it is, and I challenge a contradiction on it. I know something about what houses are; I heard a discussion here about the Postal Commission, and in connection with it the rent of houses and why they are not cheap here as anywhere else and why the poor man cannot get a house at a reasonable price.  Nobody has the pluck to tell you, although everybody, in this Dáil and outside it, knows. Could you have cheap houses when the bricklayer is only allowed by his Trade Union to lay 240 bricks in the day?  The English output is between a thousand and twelve hundred, and the American output would be between 1,700 and 2,000, and here we are tied down to 240 bricks a day.  Surely nobody in his senses will stand up and say they were going to build up a great Ireland and a great Nation at the rate of 240 bricks a day.  It is because we are not honest with ourselves, because we are not inclined to put our finger on where the wound is and where the disease is that the ills of Ireland are as bad as they are at the moment.  Here are samples of suitings bought in Kilkenny&mdash;the price in Kilkenny would be £6 19s. 6d.  Yet the very same stuff, pay the railway carriage to Leeds, get it made there, and pay the carriage back, and one gets a difference of £2 1s. 0d. less.  In another case it is £3 less, and in another case it is £2 17s. 6d. less.  Surely to goodness, if we are going to get on, if we are going to be a successful people, we have got to realise facts. Perhaps I would be met by the argument that this is the result of sweated labour. I think it would be a very wholesome <Col N="284" /> thing for all of us if we did a little sweating.  I never felt as well as I did when I sweated at hard manual labour for twenty or twenty-five years. Now, what is another thing that will strike you?  You see a contract for a big building, and one of the clauses inserted in it is that Irish labour must be employed.  Why is that?  Because the threat is there that if that clause were not in we would have to go outside of Ireland for our common labouring men and artisans.  I think it is the greatest insult that could be offered to Irishmen. Would you see that in England?  Nothing of the sort.  Would you see it in America?  No, because the market is open for everybody; because the Englishman and the American is prepared to stand up in competition with anybody. Is an Irishman prepared to do that, according to the rules and regulations of his trade?  A house that will cost £1,000 or £1,050 in Dublin can be bought for £530 in England&mdash;the same class of house&mdash; and it can be bought for less in America. It can be let at less than half the rent. If we could get down to these hard facts, and have everybody try to do their best to remedy all these things, we would arrive at the solution of a number of our difficulties.  With regard to the Railway Commission, I heard it stated in this Dáil that it was representative of all interests concerned.  It was not.  It was not representative of our interest, and the agricultural interest of Ireland is a big interest, and it was not represented.  We asked to be represented, and we were not given representation, and we are not bound in any way by that report.</P>

      <P>Now, if the revenues of these railways are not able to meet the expenditure, what is the alternative? The State will be asked to step in to meet the losses to uphold a certain standard of wages and a certain standard of work and a certain standard of time&mdash;the eight hours' day.  Now, anybody who knows Ireland knows the application of the 8 hours' day is not suited to it.  I can understand the 8 hours' day in busy centres like Lancashire, or even about <Col N="285" /> Dublin, but the 8 hours' day in a rural district in Ireland, where perhaps there is only one train passes in the day, and the rest of the time the man is lying on his back with his toes cocked to the sun, and he must be relieved at that for fear he would lie there too long, is a scandal. I think it is a scandal to apply it to Ireland.  Now, what is the railway worker's standard of living?  His wage is a very substantial one.  His standard of comfort and his wage is 200 per cent. higher than the farm worker and that of the average citizen of the Irish Free State.  It is 200 per cent. higher, practically speaking, than that of all the inhabitants of Cavan or Monaghan, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo, Kerry, Galway, Roscommon. In several of those counties their standard is nothing like it, and there are Deputies here, representing Western districts, who know very well that the standard of the average railway worker at the present day is 200 per cent. higher than the standard in those districts. I am dealing with their standard of comfort, their standard of wage and luxury.  I will come now to the hours. What is the standard of work in the agricultural community in the counties I have named?  It is not an 8 hours day, but more like 14 or 15 hours, and his output, the return that he gives for the time he is employed&mdash;I will not talk about the wages&mdash;is 300 per cent. higher than 70 per cent. of the railway workers. Now, what would enable this country to carry on?  What has enabled any country to carry on?  There is one thing&mdash;and that is individual effort, and the moment you sap or tamper with individual effort, you sap the spring of the nation's life. Talk about nationalisation as much as you like, but once you destroy individual effort you sap the life of the nation.  What is everybody's business is nobody's business. Now, I suggest to different sections of this assembly, to be a little bit more candid, a little bit more honest, and to tell the truth, and if we have ills &mdash;and we have ills&mdash;cannot we be honest and call them by their proper names? Cannot we admit that we are lazy, that we are not doing our best, and cannot we try to remedy that?  There used to be an old phrase, it is a bit out-of-date now; I think it is what the Lord said to Adam in the Garden&mdash;&ldquo;Earn your bread by the sweat of your brow.&rdquo;  In practice these days it is, &ldquo;Get your <Col N="286" /> bread by the sweat of some other body's brow.&rdquo;  There is one paragraph in the speech dealing with Land Purchase, and that I welcomed.  One thing was omitted, and that was the question of ranches.</P>

There is no use in Labour demanding a wage and a standard of living except they are going to put their backs into the business and work in earnest.

      <P>I merely mention it as applying to some of the ills we are suffering from to-day.  I mention it in connection with self-reliance and the want of it.  Our people should be taught self-help. If they tried to help themselves they could do it very easily, but the vast majority do not help themselves; they are content with an existence, and that is a wrong attitude.  There are people at home all day doing nothing, who are not actually earning a wage.  With proper education and proper upbringing, and with the inculcation of a spirit of self-reliance all this could be greatly remedied. Now the man, or the body of men, who begin with the idea that the nation or the individual owes him or them something will very soon find out his mistake.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Johnson's amendment, and I hope the Dáil will bear with me for a few moments; I do not often waste their time.  When Deputy Gorey was speaking he made some remarks that were inclined to set one thinking, and he brought me back to some of the statements made by his colleague, Deputy Wilson, yesterday evening.  He said that the workers of Ireland, implying, I think, in particular, members of the Transport Workers' Union, were lazy, and that if the workers did more work they would be better off and the people of the country would be better off.  Now, that is rather a peculiar statement, to my mind.  We were told by Deputy Wilson yesterday evening that there was a surplus of agricultural crops in this country, as there was in Britain. There are a great number of men out of work at present, and assuming that there are ten thousand men employed, say, in agriculture, and if each man doubles his efforts he will get through the work that the farmer wants him to do in half the time.  Consequently you will double the amount of unemployment.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I do not want to be misinterpreted like that.  What I meant was that farmers at present do nothing only what is absolutely necessary.  There are any amount of other things that we would do if we could get a return for what we are paying.</P>

      <P>And that they never employed men, no matter how small the wages were, for work that they did not require to be done.  But, of course, if they are philanthropists, I am glad, although my experience is otherwise. Now, as to the question of individual effort, an individual has not the opportunity of putting forth any effort&mdash;an individual who swells the ranks of the unemployed year after year, for the very good <Col N="288" /> and sufficient reason that he has nothing to expend his energy on.  He will beg day after day the right to work, and he is refused it, and if he does get a job, the more effort he puts forth the quicker he is going to finish the job and be on the streets in the unemployed ranks again. It struck me as peculiar that Deputy Gorey, in discussing the railways, stated that on an average the agricultural worker does 300 per cent. more work than the average railwayman.  If that is true, no matter how lazy or incompetent the railwayman may be, the agricultural labourer should be in a highly flourishing condition.  If the agricultural labourer does 300 per cent. more work than the railway worker certainly it is not his fault that agriculture is in such a condition.  It must be the fault of the owners of the land&mdash;whether they are large or small landowners. Deputy Wilson yesterday evening stated &mdash;and I see he had some authority for it, though I doubted it at the time&mdash; that the textile workers in Great Britain, by working three weeks, could produce sufficient textiles to keep the country going for a year.  I saw, according to last night's paper, that Mr. Kennedy, at the Food Prices Commission yesterday, made a similar statement.  That may not be true in its entirety, but it is truer in my opinion than a good many Deputies in this room may believe.  It is true, not alone of the textile industry, but of every other industry in this country and in every other country, and that is one of the reasons of unemployment. Unemployment, in my opinion, is due to the fact that more goods are produced in this and in every other country than people can afford to buy.  Otherwise there are more goods than there is a market for.  There is what is technically known as &ldquo;under-consumption&rdquo; and there is consequently unemployment. That is true not only of Ireland, but of practically every other country in the world.  Deputy Wilson reminded me of the story of &ldquo;The Iron Heel,&rdquo; by Jack London.  The hero of the story, Ernest Everard, addressing a meeting of &ldquo;The Grangers,&rdquo; which was a political organisation representing farmers and small manufacturers, traced the development of capitalism and showed that ultimately every country in the world would have a surplus which naturally could not be <Col N="289" /> exported, and he said the only way to get rid of this surplus under the capitalist system would be to take it and dump it into the sea.  Deputy Wilson admitted that there is a surplus of farm produce in Ireland.  We do not want to ask that Ireland would do what Jack London thought would happen ultimately.  We do not want this surplus to be dumped into the sea, but we want them to consider that it is quite easy and possible, without giving the unemployed work to do, or giving them doles, to dump the surplus of the farm produce of this country&mdash;the textiles and the other things&mdash; at the feet of the men and women and the children who are at present very badly in need of them.  I was very interested in this debate for various reasons&mdash;apart altogether from the fact that we are members of an Assembly here. I got a lot of view points that were interesting to me.  I found out, in dealing with the questions, that the majority of the Deputies here took the very same attitude as members of the property owning classes.  Deputy Dolan, I think, stated that we all knew what was the cause of unemployment.  I thought we all should know what was the cause of unemployment.  But I learned, as he developed his argument, that he meant to imply that Irregularism was the cause of unemployment.  That is not the cause of unemployment in this country.  It is the cause of some unemployment, and perhaps a large cause of unemployment. I mentioned about a month ago&mdash;and the President objected very strongly to my mentioning it&mdash;that Irregularism was caused, in a measure, by the fact that there were young men who were unemployed during the past nine or ten months.  I want to say now that the ranks of the Regular Army are being recruited from the unemployed.  I know personally that very many young men joined the National Army during the past few days&mdash;while scores of others made attempts to join it&mdash;for the simple reason that they were out of jobs.  To get back to the cause of unemployment, we claim that the present private property-owning <Col N="290" /> system is the cause of it, and that as long as that lasts there will be more goods produced than people will have money to buy, and there will be periodic slumps, or under-consumption, and unemployment. I was reading a monthly magazine called <i>Business Organisation and Management</i>, in the November issue of which I saw an article by Sir Arthur Latta, Baronet, on &ldquo;Labour responsibility for unemployment.&rdquo;  This gentleman admitted that much of the present unemployment is unavoidable in the circumstances. That is an admission from a prominent business man in Great Britain&mdash;that in the present world's circumstances a great deal of unemployment is unavoidable.  So far as his outlook is concerned, it is simply impossible to conceive a time when there will be an opportunity for working and giving a decent living to all.  He goes on to say that not an inconsiderable amount of unemployment is due to labour policy, inefficient leadership, and the regrettable ignorance of many British workmen.  He goes on to point out about the tragedy of Russia. He states that the English workingmen do not understand the meaning of the tragedy of Russia, and because the workers of England are led by men who are Bolshevically inclined, or are inclined towards the establishment of Soviets, there is a great deal of unemployment. I think that there are some Deputies in this Dáil of that opinion also&mdash;Deputies who are as ignorant of the meaning of Russia as this gentleman accuses the British working classes.  One Deputy suggested that Russia and Germany were almost in a state of collapse.  Whether or not he implied that a lot of that was due to the situation in Russia brought about by the workers there, who tried to do something for themselves, it was outside the ordinary orbit of economic politics.</P>
