      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that members of the National Forces in Ballinasloe have gone round the town on two or three occasions and taken up all the bicycles they could find, without giving any receipt for same, or without stating the purpose of such seizure; that in consequence of the loss of their bicycles many workers are put to very great inconvenience, and that others are afraid to use their machines for the purpose of going to or coming from their work, lest they should be seized; and whether he will have full inquiries made into these complaints and have the bicycles returned as early as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware that bicycles have been commandeered by our troops in Ballinasloe.  They were taken and are being retained as a matter of military necessity to facilitate the rounding up of Irregulars, for which purpose they have been very successfully used.  Instructions have been issued to the responsible officer to provide receipts forthwith for all cycles taken.  The cycles will be returned to the owners at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that on the entry of the Free State Troops into Balla, Co. Mayo, on 11th August, the officer in charge <Col N="1448" /> placed the Station Master (Mr. R. Mellet) under arrest, without giving him time to close the office or lock up the cash on hands, amounting to over £400; whether Mr. Mellet was detained in a stable for five days and nights, without removing his clothes or without sleeping accommodation of any kind; whether on the following Sunday he was paraded through the streets to attend Mass covered with a revolver, with his clothes smeared with the dirt of the stable and without being permitted to wash or shave for five days; whether at the end of that period he was released, with a statement to the effect that he had been arrested on local information, which was found to be incorrect: Further to ask the Minister for Defence whether the officer referred to has since been removed in custody and charged with the murder of one of his own men; whether the Minister is prepared to recommend the Government to recompense Mr. Mellet for the loss in salary he sustained during the period of his detention.</P>

      <P>Mr. Mellet was arrested on the 11th August for persistently assisting the Irregulars in the Balla area.  He was allowed time to close his office, and lock up the cash, and he actually did lock up.  Half an hour after his arrest his nephew called for the keys, which Mr. Mellet handed over.  Mr. Mellet was placed in the Guard-room occupied by our troops, where he was afforded any convenience and comfort possible in the circumstances. He went to Mass on Sunday with the other prisoners.  His dress was not unpresentable, and there was no unnecessary display of firearms.  He was released on signing the usual form of undertaking, not to further assist the Irregulars.  Regarding the last, paragraph of the question: this case is <i>sub judice</i>, and in the circumstances a statement at the moment would be inadvisable.</P>

      <P>An amendment will be moved to Article 75, but as <Col N="1449" /> it is necessary to move it formally I will read that Article.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every existing Officer of the Provisional Government who has been transferred to that Government from the British Government, and every existing Officer of the British Government who, at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, is engaged or employed in the administration of public services which on that date become public services of the Irish Free State/ Saorstát Eireann (except those whose services have been lent by the British Government to the Provisional Government) shall on that date be transferred to and become an Officer of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann and shall hold office by a tenure corresponding to his previous tenure, and shall be entitled to the benefit of Article 10 of the Scheduled Treaty.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to move an amendment to Article 75.  It is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete Article 75, and substitute two new Articles, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Every existing Officer of the Provisional Government at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution (not being an officer whose services have been lent by the British Government to the Provisional Government) shall on that date be transferred to and become an Officer of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann, and shall hold office by a tenure corresponding to his previous tenure,&rsquo; and</P>
      <P>Article 75a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Every such existing Officer who was transferred from the British Government by virtue of any transfer of services to the Provisional Government shall be entitled to the benefit of Article 10 of the Scheduled Treaty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 10 is the one dealing with the compensation to be given to Officers who are either discharged by the Free State Government, or who retire by reason of the change of Government.  The object of the amendment is to remove any ambiguity that might arise in existing Article 75 by reason of the fact that certain services are carried on by the British Government as agency services for us.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask, for the purpose of elucidation, is an Officer who may have been transferred from England, and who is now given the option of retirement&mdash;an Officer who may have been in Ireland a year, or two years&mdash;should he come under this special provision?</P>

      <P>Every British Civil Servant that was a member of the British Civil Service here is entitled to the benefit of Article 10 of the Treaty if he wishes to resign on the change of Government.  On the other hand, if we wish not to avail of his services we can discharge him, and he becomes entitled to the benefits in Article 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is there is certain preferential treatment for that man who happens to be in the British Civil Service in Ireland&mdash;who happened to come over; the men who remained behind in England&mdash;his colleagues who did not come over&mdash;were not entitled to retire on these conditions.  I do not know whether this applies to many officers, but I have a sort of notion that quite a number of men were brought over to Ireland, and conceivably these could go back to their old jobs.  They were brought over at the request of the Irish Government, and brought over to facilitate the work of the British here, and these are now in a preferential position as compared with their colleagues who remained in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is, of course, I think the obvious answer, that there must be a clean-cut line drawn somewhere, because if we were to hold to the point of view that Deputy Johnson has put forward the reverse would apply&mdash;that is, that men who are a considerable time in England would have to be sent back here, and would think themselves entitled to the terms of the Treaty because they were Civil Servants. It is accepted that a clean-cut line must be drawn.  You cannot be looking back to how many men came here from England and how many were sent away to England.  The whole Civil Service was run for the convenience of the Government before the Treaty.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;As respects Departmental property, assets, rights and liabilities, the Government of the Irish Free State/ Saorstát Eireann shall be regarded as the successors of the Provisional Government, and, to the extent to which functions of any Department of the British Government become functions of the Government of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann, as successors of such Department of the British Government.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;After the date on which this Constitution comes into operation the House of the Parliament elected in pursuance of the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922 (being the Constituent Assembly for the settlement of this Constitution), may, for a period not exceeding one year from that date, but subject to compliance by the Members thereof with the provisions of Article 17 of this Constitution, exercise all the powers and authorities conferred on the Chamber/Dáil Eireann by this Constitution, and the first election for the Chamber/Dáil Eireann under Article 26 and 27 hereof shall take place as soon as possible after the expiration of such period.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Article provides that this Assembly, as at present constituted, may, for a period not exceeding one year after this Constitution comes into operation, become and function <Col N="1452" /> as the first Parliament of Saorstát Eireann, conditional on the members of this Parliament complying with Article 17 of this Constitution, which is the Article providing for the Oath to be taken by Members.  It will certainly be necessary that this Parliament will sit and continue to sit and function for a considerable time until the register on adult suffrage is prepared.  The period mentioned here is merely a time limit, so that the arrangement may not last more than a year.  It may not be necessary to sit for more than six or seven or eight months.  I move that the Article be added to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to raise any objection to this Article but perhaps deputies will agree it would be more becoming to define the present Parliament in some other way than by reference to an English Statute.  I do not think, it could be suggested that it is necessary that we should refer to the Free State Parliament Act,.  Why not use some other form of words?  Perhaps between this and the next meeting the Ministry might frame a form of words that would get away from that objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a note of Deputy Gavan Duffy's suggestion.  I now beg to move Article 78, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The first Senate/Seanad Eireann shall be constituted immediately after the coming into operation of this Constitution in the manner following, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  The first Senate/Seanad shall consist of two members elected by each of the Universities in the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann and fifty-six other members, of whom twenty-eight shall be elected and twenty-eight shall be nominated.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  The twenty-eight nominated members of the Senate/Seanad shall be nominated by the President of the Executive Council who shall, in making such nominations, have special regard to the providing of representation for groups or parties not then adequately represented in the Chamber/Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" />
      <i>(c)</i>  The twenty-eight elected members of the Senate/Seanad shall be elected by the Chamber/Dáil Eireann voting on principles of Proportional Representation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d)</i>  Of the University members one member elected by each University, to be selected by lot, shall hold office for six years, the remaining University members shall hold office for the full period of twelve years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(e)</i>  Of the twenty-eight nominated members, fourteen, to be selected by lot, shall hold office for the full period of twelve years, the remaining fourteen shall hold office for a period of six years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(f)</i>  Of the twenty-eight elected members the first fourteen elected shall hold office for the period of nine years, the remaining fourteen shall hold office for the period of three years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(g)</i>  At the termination of the period of office of any such members, members shall be elected in their place in manner provided by Article 31.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(h)</i>  Casual vacancies shall be filled in manner provided by Article 33.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(i)</i>  For the purpose of the election of members for any University under this Article, all persons whose names appear on the register for the University in force at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall, notwithstanding anything in Article 14, be entitled to vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last portion of that Article has the effect of not putting in an age limit to the University voters for Seanad.  The Electorate for Seanad/Eireann is limited to people upwards of 30 years of age. But in regard to University members it is decided that all people whose names are on the register of the University&mdash; that is to say, graduates&mdash;shall be entitled to vote.  I do not think there is anything in the Article that calls for very special explanation.  It simply provides that half of the Seanad shall be nominated by the President and the other half elected by the Dáil, the voting to be on Proportional Representation, and then that the half of the twenty-eight who shall be nominated shall hold office for twelve years, but <Col N="1454" /> that the other half shall hold office for six years, and these shall be selected by lot as to which shall hold office for twelve years and which for six years.  And the elected members retire in the same way, half holding office for nine years and the remaining half for three years; and that the first election of Seanad takes place as provided in Articles 29, 30, and 31, and so on.  I beg to move that the Article stand part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move now formally the amendment standing in my name&mdash;that is, &ldquo;If new Article 27 is adopted, to delete <i>(a)</i>&lsquo;two members&rsquo; to &lsquo;and,&rsquo; and the word &lsquo;other&rsquo; after the words &lsquo;fifty-six,&rsquo; and paragraphs <i>(d)</i> and <i>(i).</i>&rdquo;  The effect of this amendment will be to delete the provision for two members from each of the Universities being appointed by the Universities for the first Seanad.  I do that in fulfilment of the <Col N="1455" /> promise I made when I consented to the amendment in favour of University representation in the Dáil.  A bargain is a bargain, and as this Dáil conceded representation to the Universities of the nation&mdash;the right of representation in this Assembly of the nation&mdash;I now formally move that the representation in the Seanad be deleted accordingly.</P>

      <P>It is intended to write to the British Minister who summoned that meeting beyond where certain agreements were come to by the late President and by certain Southern Unionists, merely to acquaint him that in giving University representation in the Dáil we propose to depart from the letter of the agreement, as respects University representation of the Seanad.  If these amendments are not accepted we would not propose to make the total number of Seanad less than 60.  We would even be prepared to consider the question of not eliminating University representation in the Seanad, despite the acceptance by this Assembly of the principle of Proportional Representation, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We who are standing for the Bill do not set any particular store on that point, and we would be prepared to think it over.  Certainly we would not bring the total number of Seanad lower than the present number of 60.  I think in view of the emphatic endorsement in the leading Article of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of Deputy Fitzgibbon's attitude on this matter of University Representation, and the departure from the strict letter of the agreement, that there will probably be very little difficulty about this, and we would undertake then to bring up alternative proposals on the next Reading, certainly, leaving the number of Seanad at 60, and possibly not eliminating University Representation, unless there is a very definite feeling here in favour of eliminating it.</P>

      <P>I did not think that such an assurance was necessary. It is entirely a feeling of our own.  We were not asked to give away that part of the bargain at all.  No approaches whatever were made on the question.  As a fact the idea was it might provide a useful link between the Seanad and the Dáil to have that particular representation in both.  Without it there is very little link that one can see between the two Houses.</P>

I am perfectly ready to support the amendment in full.  If the Government should think it would be an improvement to take the lines we suggested, it is not for us to say it.  We have made what we regard as a bargain, and I am seconding Deputy Fitzgibbon, and am perfectly prepared to support him.  If the Government decide to carry out this amendment, perhaps they would consider the possibility of adding the Universities to the body that was to be consulted by the President when he came to nominate the Members for the first Seanad, in accordance with the promise that was made by the late President Griffith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is no logical objection to special representation in the Seanad, once you conceded it for the Chamber, but certain arguments were adduced in favour of the representation in the Chamber as distinguished from the Seanad, and the Dáil agreed, on the strength of these arguments, to change the representation from the Seanad to the Chamber.  Now it is proposed not only to consider the wisdom of giving the University graduates representation in the Chamber, but also to give them representation in this Seanad&mdash;a double privilege.  I think that if that had been made clear to the Dáil before the vote was taken, there <Col N="1457" /> would have been a difference in the result; and while, no doubt, it is very nice and kind of the Ministry to make these offers inviting pressure in that direction, it is not desirable, I think, that the courtesy should be extended beyond the limits that have been asked.  It is a privilege, and I think we should recognise it as such, The people who represent the Universities in the Chamber may go to the Seanad and act as a link.  If that is not possible, there is no link, and there is nothing in the Constitution whatever&mdash; there may be in electoral law&mdash;to prevent this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am wrong. Undoubtedly you are doubling the privilege that you are giving to the University Graduates.  Bear in mind this is not representation of Universities, although it is called such.  It is representation of men and women who went through Universities once and have cut all connection, possibly, with those Universities, and I for one would protest against any extension of this privilege.  I was not very emphatic, though I raised a protest against the matter, on the last occasion, but if it is intended to double the privilege I think there should be a very emphatic protest made against the proposal.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The passing and adoption of this Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and the British Parliament shall be announced as soon as may be, and not later than the sixth day of December, Nineteen hundred and twenty-two, by Proclamation of His Majesty, and this Constitution shall come into operation on the issue of such Proclamation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> This Article provides for the public announcement of finality as regards this Constitution, its passing and adoption here and its passing and adoption by the British Parliament.  Some people see bogies in the fact that the Proclamation has to be by His Majesty.  I do not think there is much to be said in favour of that view; it certainly points to a rather thin-skinned temperament. There is a good deal to be said in favour of that definite announcement of renunciation and withdrawal, and as someone called it surrender from that particular quarter.  We will have our own method of announcement to our own people.  We will have our own publication in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; eventually but it is highly desirable that there should be that definite Proclamation from the British side to this bargain also.  I formally move that Article as it stands.</P>
    <P>The following amendment to Article 79 stood in the name of Seoirse Ghabhain Ui Dhubhthaigh:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Between the words &lsquo;Constituent Assembly&rsquo; and the words &lsquo;the British Parliament&rsquo; to insert the words &lsquo;its registration by.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move an amendment providing that, instead of prescribing that the Constitution shall be passed and adopted by the British Parliament as well as the Irish Parliament, we should use the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; in the case of the British Parliament, and I ask the careful attention of the Ministry and the Dáil to this point, which is clearly an error in drafting.  If we pass those words as they stand, we are surrendering the whole National position by doing so, and quite unnecessarily.  In the course of this debate on the Constitution we have had to give away a good many things.  The Dáil has done many things that were not dignified from the National standpoint, because it felt it had to.  In this case there can be no question of such compulsion, because members will recollect that this is part of an international bargain&mdash;this is part of the implementing of the Treaty&mdash;and if you insert the words &ldquo;passing and adoption by the British Parliament&rdquo; in your Constitution, you are implying, if not stating expressly, that you recognise some right in the British Parliament to make changes in this Constitution.  I do <Col N="1459" /> not believe that the present Ministry would put forward the view that the British Parliament can change a line of this Constitution.  Ministers know and Members know that the practice is, when a Treaty has to be ratified, for any party who thinks that some modification is required to make representations as between Government and Government privately in order to secure the necessary adjustment, and that is what should be done here.  Let it be noted that this is not a question of Dominion usage.  We are not children of Mother England. When these various Dominions decided they wanted to become Dominions, they had to go to England for a British Act of Parliament, which was the very foundation of their new authority.  Are we taking the position that the foundation of our authority lies in a British Act of Parliament? Surely not.  I have not the slightest objection to seeing not merely the Treaty, but the Constitution, registered by the English Parliament.  On the contrary, to register it there is a good thing, because that registration will act at least as a kind of moral estoppal against the day when they decide they want to go back on their previous signatures. But I do object to go further&mdash;to give to that performance an air of something which is an ordinary English Act of Parliament.  Note that we are not made Dominions by this Treaty; we are put in a status&mdash;we are accorded, if you like, the same status&mdash;of Dominions, but we are not Dominions.  It is surrendering the National position to put down in black and white in our own Constitution, not that this document is to be registered in England&mdash;that would be quite right&mdash; but that it is to be passed and approved by the English.  If there is anything wrong with it, the British Government will make representation to the Irish Government and get whatever is wrong adjusted; but do not let us put down words which undoubtedly go much further than anything we are compelled by the Treaty to put down.</P>

      <P>The President says we have surrended 78 times in this Constitution, and that we ought to make a stand on the last Article. Reading that you will see &ldquo;the passing and adoption of this Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and the British Parliament&rdquo;&mdash;now the word &ldquo;passing&rdquo;<Col N="1460" /> there must be taken with Constituent Assembly.  Deputy Gavan Duffy has pointed out that it would not be in the power of the British Parliament to change this Constitution.  It would not be in the power of the British Parliament to change this Constitution.  It would be in the power of the British Parliament to refuse to adopt this Constitution if it were not, in their opinion, within the four corners of the Treaty signed last December. If it contained anything inconsistent with or repugnant to that Treaty it would certainly unquestionably be in the power of the British Parliament to refuse to adopt it.  The adoption of the Constitution, its embodiment in the British Acts marks the completion of the Treaty negotiations, of the Treaty bargain. There is little use here in inserting a word which is equivalent to a claim that utterly regardless of anything that this Constitution may or may not contain, the function of the British Parliament was simply to register that.  It is simply in a small way trailing your coat for trouble at a time when it is not advisable to have trouble, if trouble can be avoided.  It is quite a small way. Well, I am convinced that will not be passed beyond, and that conception of the position is not accepted there.  It is just as well that we should face that.  It is not accepted that any Constitution we might send over there should simply be registered in a mechanical or automatic way by the British Parliament.  It is claimed that they have power to examine it in detail, and if they hold it contains anything inconsistent with or repugnant to the Treaty they could refuse to adopt it.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, the words were meant entirely in a jocular sense.

      <P>My point is that it is perfectly true that in many cases the position has been surrendered, and, therefore, to make this stand on this Article is not very important.  As a matter of fact, the view that we have come to is that we are really simply accepting some instalment of the freedom that we have been striving for&mdash;an enlargement of self-government, an enlargement of liberty&mdash;but it is still subject to these limitations which the British Parliament imposes.  Now, that is a contradiction of the statement of the President yesterday, and, in my opinion, leaving in all this Article 79 as it stands is merely a recognition of that fact.  We are not allowed to make this Constitution in the way we would like to make it; and by saying that the British Parliament have to pass and adopt it we are formally recognising the fact that we have not made this Constitution in the way we would like.</P>

      <P>My attempts throughout this Constitution debate have been to save something from the wreck of the Constitution on the rocks of Downing Street.  Here we come to the last clause, where I see something, as it seems to me, that can be saved without any further difficulty with Downing Street.  The Minister for Home Affairs told us, &ldquo;after the passing and adoption of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and the British Parliament,&rdquo; was intended to mean this: (a) The passing by the Constituent Assembly, (b) the adoption by the British Parliament.  I do not consider the word &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; to be an appropriate one, but certainly it is much less objectionable than &ldquo;passing.&rdquo;  In view of what the Minister himself has told us, I suggest to him that he might meet me to this extent on the paragraph&mdash;&ldquo;the passing of this Constitution by the Constituent Assembly, and its adoption by the British Parliament.&rdquo;  That, he tells us, is what it means.  It does not go the whole way to meet my position, but, still, it will make a very considerable improvement in those two lines.</P>

      <P>I ask the Dáil to substitute for the prescription that this document is to be announced by Proclamation of His Majesty, as it says here &mdash; meaning His Britannic Majesty, I suppose, the words, &ldquo;by Proclamation in the Official Gazette/ Iris Oifigiúil.&rdquo;  The Minister for Home Affairs, in introducing this Article, spoke of the thin-skinned temperament that would object to His Britannic Majesty announcing to the world that our Constitution was through.  I suppose he used that expression in much the same way as he called his own Ministry a knock-kneed Government, the other day.  I can set one against the other with equanimity. He said that it was important to us to have a specific act of renunciation by His Britannic Majesty, and that Act of renunciation would be contained in this Proclamation.  Personally, I attach very little importance to acts of renunciation, because one knows that they remain in force just as long as it suits the party who made them to let them remain in force.  I admit they will have a moral estoppel, but you can get that estoppel in the fact that His Brittanic Majesty has to sign a British Act of Parliament registering this Treaty. However, that should hardly be a reason for requiring him to sign something else approving of the Treaty.  So far as the English parties to this Treaty are concerned, it is perfectly right that His Britannic Majesty should announce to them that the Treaty has gone through this Parliament, and that His Britannic Majesty's Government agrees that the Treaty is not infringed by the Constitution going through this Parliament, but, so far as we are concerned, it is not the fact that His Britannic Majesty puts his name to the Proclamation that gives force and effect to the Constitution here. It is a fact that after being passed by this Constituent Assembly of the Irish people, that &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; should announce to the Irish people, that this Constituent Parliament with its Ministry has passed such and such a Constitution. One facet of that message, one aspect of it, is this Provisional Government aspect, but fundamentally it is <Col N="1463" /> the Dáil Government, the Dáil Ministry, and what the Irish people will want to know is that the Ministry, and the Irish people to whom they are rsponsible, have passed that Constitution.  It would also interest them, no doubt, to know that His Britannic Majesty had no fault to find with the Irish Government, but that is not the issue.  That is another issue.  Let His Britannic Majesty announce these things to His loyal subjects in England.  Very properly. I do not quarrel with that, but I do object to our Constitution having a phrase which does suggest to ourselves and to those who come after us that the final act which gave effect to this Constitution was the signature of His Britannic Majesty.  That is not a fact. This thing is an international Treaty, and again we are surrendering the national position by bringing His Majesty in.  Now, I take it that this Draft Constitution was taken to London, that John Bull was in a very bad temper, and he decided he would pay out these gentlemen who brought over the Irish Constitution for having dared to bring such a thing to Downing Street, by forcing in the name of His Britannic Majesty wherever he could.  Consequently, you have his name in this Proclamation. I ask the Ministers and I ask the Dáil to observe that it has never yet been suggested that this Constitution was a gift from England, and I ask them to observe further, that there is no Dominion precedent for this proposal, none whatever.  I have looked through the Dominion Constitutions here, but there is no sign of any such thing in any of them.  I ask why should we go out of our way to drag in His Britannic Majesty in cases and in places where there is no compulsion on us to do so?</P>

      <P>When we went to Dublin Castle&mdash;eight of us&mdash;and were greeted there by Lord FitzAlan, in the presence of the heads of the Civil Service, as the Government of Ireland it was not as the Provisional Government. It was not that greeting that made us the Provisional Government. It was the facts arising from the Treaty, and it was certain facts that had been going on here for some years before, that gave rise to that Treaty.  But that formal handing over, or that formal greeting, if you will, was the necessary <Col N="1464" /> supplementary part of the transfer and the altered position in Ireland.  Now, there is nothing particularly to be gained by trying to run away from the facts, and trying to pretend that facts are otherwise than what they are.</P>

      <P>And the facts are that since 1800 this country has been governed, or misgoverned if you will, under certain forms, that we had representation in the British Parliament; that we sent Members over there to that Parliament, swearing a very full-blooded oath of allegiance to the English King, and that we were part and parcel of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  And then a generation came along that did not particularly like that and it set itself very strenously and very energetically to change it, and to a considerable extent it has succeeded in changing it.  But it has not succeeded in changing it as much as it desires, though probably it has succeeded in changing it as much as a good many reasonably hope, and an announcement of that change from the British and by the British is as necessary as that little scene and ceremony in the Castle when eight of us were greeted by the man who was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.  And this proclamation by the British King provides just that formal announcement of the change and just that formal renunciation of the previous position that is necessary.  To admit anything else is merely a pretence that we are a country that the British have nothing whatsoever to do with&mdash;that we are, in fact, constitutionally thousands of miles away from any connection whatever.  And why should this British King issue this proclamation? Now, we have just gone through the Committee stage of the Constitution, which does to a very limited extent, it is true, definitely recognise the existence of that person, and his existence in the future scheme of things under the Treaty and under the Constitution. And having recognised his existence, and realising that since 1800 he had a very definite place in our scheme of things, that an alteration in the position has taken place, and that while not being entirely eliminated&mdash;not so entirely as we would have wished&mdash;he is yet in our scheme of things in a very different <Col N="1465" /> way.  Some enunciation from him to that effect is surely a necessary part and parcel of the transition.  I have no sympathy with the amendment.

The draft at that time was a draft of the Constitution that had been circulated, and a preamble that was proposed and referred to in my resolution was the preamble that had then been printed, not as part of the Bill.  The proposition that I made does not refer to the deletion of any of these clauses of the Bill, but was intended to be inserted as a preamble to the Constitution.  On the earlier discussion I agreed to withdraw it because there was a certain suggestion that parts of it would be dealt with in the clauses, and that other clauses would be altered to such an extent as would meet the claims made in the proposition.  What I would like to know is, when will it be possible to discuss the insertion of the preamble to the Constitution as distinct from the two clauses of the Bill?</P>

      <P>Well, taking the first part of that preamble, &ldquo;Dáil Eireann, sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this Provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people, and in the confidence that we shall thus restore our National life and unity, hereby proclaims the establishment of Saorstát Eireann, and in the exercise of our undoubted right decrees and enacts as follows&rdquo;; it seems to me that that part of the preamble strikes just the proper note in introducing a Constitution of this kind.  There is not the absolute blast of triumph about it that there would be if we were introducing a Constitution that a great many here, and a great many through the country, would wish to introduce. But there is simply a note of quiet confidence that the thing which we are now doing is for the betterment and for the ultimate welfare of the people, and the hope that it is for the ultimate realisation of the people's aspirations. There are amendments on the Paper which it would be out of order to discuss until they are moved.  But we feel, having compared this thing that stands in the draft with these amendments, that we are not at all tempted to alter the preamble to the Bill.  I move this preamble as it stands, and the discussion can then turn on the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>So much has been said already on the last clause with regard to the interpretation of this Constitution, that I feel it is practically useless to try and insert this amendment in the preamble.  I feel that it will not be accepted by the Ministry on the usual ground on which they have resisted other amendments to certain Articles of the Constitution.  The idea which I wished to express in this amendment was the idea of the statement of position. It is not part of the Constitution.  It is part of the introduction of the Bill. Therefore, in my view&mdash;I do not know whether it is right or wrong&mdash;it is simply a matter for this Assembly.  Now, I do think that the statement of position would be essential in this matter.  We all admit that all Treaties and Constitutions are subject to change, sometimes violently, sometimes slowly, but still the acceptance of the Treaty, and the acceptance of the Constitution here, will give direction to Irish history in the future.  I think, and I think very strongly, that somewhere or other in the enactment of this Constitution, and, perhaps better in this preamble than anywhere else, a certain statement of the National position should be made.  Now, in the draft preamble, as submitted by the Ministry, and explained by the Minister for Home Affairs, there is a certain acknowledgment of the source of all lawful authority; there is a certain hope expressed, and then the proclamation and the decreeing of the Constitution. Now, my amendment is directed to state what is the claim that we of the Sinn Fein movement, at all events, have stood by during the recent period of Irish history, and what has been the claim of all Irish Nationalists, more particularly, since the Act of Union&mdash;that this is a Nation, and that it has all the rights of <Col N="1471" /> a Nation, the right of sovereignty, and the full and free exercise of that sovereignty.  Perhaps it is a peculiar view, but it is one of the views that has governed my action in voting against the Ministry and certain of the Articles of the Constitution.  What has been done by this Treaty and Constitution and by these different proclamations of His Majesty the King, and the act of the British Parliament in accepting the Treaty, is the renunciation of the Act of Union. Consequently if the Act of Union is being abrogated by the British Parliament, and Government, as we hold it is, Ireland reverts to the pre-union period, and that pre-union period, I hold, was not a period of a Dominion, or a Colony of England, but a period when Ireland was an independent Kingdom. Consequently many of the arguments I heard put forward here by Deputies with regard to accepting the British King, have had no influence on me on account of the view I take.  We are accepting the King in this Constitution, not because he is the British King, but because he is Head of the Irish State.  Some Deputy referred to the Dominions having secured the position of Ministerial Republics; to my mind, what they have secured is the position of separate Kingdoms. The same monarch is the head of all the various States, notwithstanding which they are separate Kingdoms, and the view I am taking is that Ireland is resuming the position it had in pre-union days.  Now, in that position it was recognised by the British Parliament and Government around 1782, the period that has been looked on as that of Grattan's Parliament, that Ireland was a separate and independent Kingdom, possessing the rights of sovereignty and free exercise of sovereignty.  I do not think that at the present time particularly, when we are enacting this instrument here, that it is essential and very desirable and that it is a practical question as governing the interpretation of this whole Constitution and every article in it that deals with our relations with the British, that we should have something which preserves that position and that interpretation. I do not see anything inimical to England in our putting this in, even if it could be held by the Ministry or by those negotiating on our behalf that the British Ministers may object to this.  An assertion of our rights to the full exercise of <Col N="1472" /> sovereignty is not necessarily a declaration of war, as in the case of individual personal rights.  Individual rights are very frequently to be held in abeyance or abrogated because they might clash with the rights of others.  The same thing applies here in accepting the Treaty, or even the Constitution.  The Irish Nation at the present time has in a sense, as I view it, left in abeyance certain rights which it had.  Now, I also wish to have it noted that the reason given for the acceptance by this Assembly of such a from of Constitution from the Ministerial benches, as well as from the general body of members and those who have opposed the Ministry&mdash;in many respects the statement has been made that we accepted this form of Constitution, not because most of us liked it, not because it is a form of Constitution that we would enact in other circumstances, but as an alternative to a declaration of war on England.  In that sense we accept it under duress&mdash;the duress of circumstances which we all here recognised. Now, the explanation in the enactment of that Constitution&mdash;an explanation as to why such a form of Constitution was accepted&mdash;was, at all events in my view, very necessary, not alone at the present time, but for some time in the future, when other people will be interpreting this Constitution and its various Articles. Consequently I suggest as part of the amendment, &ldquo;in discharge of our trust to the living Irish people.&rdquo;  The arguments of those opposed to the Treaty have frequently been addressed to what the dead would think or what unborn generations would think of those who accept this Constitution now.  We cannot say what the dead would think, and we cannot say what unborn generations would think, but we can say what the present living generation of Irishmen think.  It is because they sent us here to enact the Constitution and make a present peace with England, it is because we have that trust of the living Irish people, that we accept the Treaty.  And I think that the explanation in the preamble would be very desirable not alone for the people at the present time, but for all future people who may be interpreting this Constitution.  We cannot say what the future will do or think, but at all events, in enacting this Constitution we should, I think, make the declaration which I have suggested, so that those <Col N="1473" /> who are interpreting it in the future will say at least, &ldquo;We did not bind their hands in accepting the Treaty or Constitution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Ever since the Treaty debate started last December we came up against a class of people who think that nothing is true until you have written it with ink on paper.  And some of us know that that is not a fact, and that in fact the writing of a thing with ink on paper does not make it one degree truer than before it was so written.  There is, in the Constitution, this Article which says that: &ldquo;All authority, legislative, executive and judicial, is derived from the people of Ireland.&rdquo;  If that is not a complete acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the people of Ireland, I do not know what form such an acknowledgment could take.  England knows as well as we know, the world knows as well as England or we know, that this Treaty is not simply the hearts' desire of the Irish people; that it is a compromise arrived at by negotiations after four or five grim years of struggle, and in that respect it is pretty much like every Treaty that was ever made.  And the Treaty does not embody the <i>summum bonum</i> of the Irish people.  The Irish people agreed to it, after a certain amount of duress if you will, but we must remember that neither does it reflect the hearts' desire of British Ministers, and that they also agreed to it under a certain amount of duress.  That perhaps is getting away to some extent from the preamble.  But the case that Deputy de Roiste made for his amendment is, that it was urgent to have stated the national position with regard to this Treaty&mdash;well, there is in the Constitution as complete an acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Irish people as one could possibly hope for.  And, granting that the Irish people are sovereign, and granting that under stress of hard facts and grim circumstances they agreed to limitations or restrictions of that sovereignty, then we must assume at any time what the sovereign Irish people gave the sovereign Irish people can take away.  They will, I trust, in considering the matter weigh the pros and cons very carefully; they will, I trust, before taking any action consider whether they are both able and willing to take the consequences of such action.  But the <Col N="1474" /> fact of their sovereignty, the fact of their right to put that Constitution and that Treaty in the fire any day they so wish is undeniable, so undeniable that a leading Unionist paper, an English Unionist paper, referred to the statement which I made here some time ago to that effect as a truism.  But Deputy de Roiste is anxious to have it down in print lest we forget, or lest the British people forget, or lest the world forget.  We are open to reconsider that particular preamble that is here in the draft.  But we will not simply accept as it stands the amendment put up by Deputy De Roiste.  But we would like to point out that the fact of the sovereignty of the Irish people does not become any more a fact when we write it down with ink on paper.  But that is at times inexpedient and we are not afraid of the word to trail our coat, and that there is even as much virtue in the thing that is left unsaid and unwritten as in the thing that is said and written.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Home Affairs so rarely agrees with me that I cannot refrain from expressing the hearty satisfaction I feel in hearing him echoing almost verbatim the words that I used in a previous debate.  From the beginning of the discussion on this draft Constitution to the present hour I believe I can claim that I have steadfastly, even strenuously, upheld the virtues and advantages of the Treaty.  In fact a distinguished stranger who listened to our debates told me that in dwelling upon the multitudinous advantages it confers upon Ireland I had out-governmented the Government itself.  Now I was delighted to hear that the Ministry are willing to reconsider the Preamble.  I agree that the present amendment would not be an improvement upon it, but that is not to agree that it does not very much demand alterations and serious improvements. It is, of course, a truism to say that to write down in black and white a claim does not add any greater validity to the claim if it is already valid or confer any element of validity on it if it is invalid.  But there are occasions and circumstances in which it is well to write things down and have them put on record, and that is particularly so in Treaties and in documents like this Constitution which are to implement <Col N="1475" /> the Treaty, we are told.  The whole purpose of this Constitution is to provide the machinery for the carrying out of something already provided in general terms in the Treaty.  And the curious impression seems to prevail here that any attempt that we may make, as independent Members, to extract what, in mining language, I might call the last ounce out of the Treaty is in some way indicative of hostility not only to our Ministers, but to the British people.  But that is to forget the whole history of the recent development of the other members of the Union of Free Nations called the British Common wealth.  Year after year they have extended their demands and have had them conceded, and that without the slightest breach in the terms of good-feeling between them and their Mother Country.  Now, all that we seek to secure in the amendments to this preamble is that it shall not be hereafterwards imputed that something was let go by default; that there shall not be put such interpretation on this preamble as to make it appear we waived certain claims and rights that otherwise we might be entitled to make.  You will notice that the preamble says, &ldquo;and if any provision in this Constitution, or of any amendment thereof, or of any law made thereunder, is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the scheduled Treaty.&rdquo;  Now, is it not obvious that there is here contemplated at least the bare possibility of something being enacted either in this Constitution or afterwards as a piece of legislation which might be held to be repugnant to the Treaty and that will have to be decided before some tribunal.  We have already debated the question of what tribunal sufficiently, and I will not be guilty of disorder by repeating these arguments, but I draw attention to the fact that it must be discussed before some tribunal and adjudicated upon before some tribunal; whereupon the question still arises: What is in the Treaty proposal? Now, in the Treaty you have the words referred to by Deputy Johnson some days ago that the status of Ireland &ldquo;<i>shall be</i>&rdquo; so and so, and that in regard to the Crown and the Imperial Parliament the position of Ireland &ldquo;<i>shall be</i>&rdquo; so and so.  The ordinary reader interprets &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; as referring to the future, but the man accustomed to consideration <Col N="1476" /> of legal documents will see that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; will carry us no further than an emphatic declaration that the thing is here by made so, and will not cover the possible misinterpretation with regard to the status of Ireland as measured by the phrase &ldquo;according to the law, practice and Constitutional usage of Canada.&rdquo;  We had that also in a debate quite recently. Is it to be the standing of the various Dominions on December 6th, 1921, or is Ireland to enjoy whatever Constitutional growth may accrue to those Dominions hereafter?  If Ireland is to enjoy whatever of development is to come to the other States of the union of free nations, then when the tribunal I contemplate comes to consider certain impeachments of laws or portions of laws as going outside the Treaty it would be possible for those who represent Ireland before such tribunal to point out that, while indeed this piece of legislation may not be in accordance with the Treaty as scheduled, still in a liberal interpretation it is in accordance with later expansion in the nature of an unwritten Constitution.  Now, what I wish to have introduced into the Preamble are some words that will safeguard us from England in that respect. I want an explicit declaration by a proviso something after this fashion: &ldquo;provided always that in determining any question as to such repugnancy the Treaty shall be construed as conferring on Saorstát Eireann the right to possess and enjoy whatever advantage by way of status or Constitutional privilege any of the free nations comprising the British Commonwealth may hereafter acquire, whether by Treaty, law, practice, or usage. Now, as I conceive it, there is nothing in that inconsistent with the Treaty.  It is our Irish interpretation of these words in the Treaty, &ldquo;according to the law, practice, and Constitutional usage of Canada.&rdquo;  If that is extending unduly the concession as the British would view it made to Ireland in the Treaty it can be so stated by the British.  It is a thing that can be very easily decided for us without any great loss of time.  If, on the other hand, as I am quite confident, no objection would be made to it by the British Government, that it would be accepted as the explicit declaration of what is intended <Col N="1477" /> by the phrase I have quoted from the Treaty, then we have so much to the good.  Those who are anti-Treaty outside the Dáil, those who still view these things in a state of unstable equilibrium as to whether the Treaty is what we say it is, or that it is the infamous thing its opponents declare it to be, will have thus much to persuade them; the fact that while the Ministerial Republics keep on growing&mdash;as they will grow&mdash;that Ireland grows with them.  We white, and that record here in black and white is not a mere empty statement of words that are meaningless sounds.  It is really a declaration of right, and I am quite confident it is a declaration of right that will not be challenged on the other side of the Channel.</P>

      <P>This particular part of the Bill is the literary part, and I suppose an infinite number of amendments might be proposed, and amendments might possibly be proposed that might better the Preamble as it stands.  I take it that the first part, at any rate, of the Preamble will not be passed by the British and that the Dáil is free to consider the thing as portion of this Bill that will be passed only in this Dáil, but anything in the nature of the amendment proposed by Deputy De Roiste is to my mind altogether objectionable, as the amendment is carefully drawn to constitute an apology.  For my part I do not think that this is a Constitution which requires to be introduced with an apology. This Constitution, in my reading of it, is an interpretation of the Treaty, and, to my mind the Treaty is not a matter requiring apology.  I regard the securing of the Treaty as a victory.  We did not, under the Treaty, get the unconditional surrender of the British, but, to my mind, we got from them a surrender. Although the cracked-brained and the stupid have made a great &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; about the things we did not succeed in getting, what we did get constituted the gaining of a definite victory.  The Treaty requires no apology in my opinion.  The Constitution is a fair interpretation of the Treaty, and although we did not get in the Constitution any more than in the Treaty, everything we set out to get, the Constitution is an interpretation of a thing that was, in itself, a victory, <Col N="1478" /> and, to my mind, the Constitution should not be introduced with any type of apology.  Perhaps we could not go into the very high poetic language we might have gone into if we had got an absolute victory.  At any rate, if we are to make any sort of a change, we should not, at all, make a change along the lines indicated in this amendment proposed by Deputy De Roiste.  I was not able to follow too well the speech of Deputy Magennis. I do not see anywhere in type the amendment he suggested, but, as he read it out, I am not sure it would be accepted on the other side, and I am not sure, without some opportunity of seeing it in print, and studying it, whether it is an amendment that it would be desirable to accept, even if it would be accepted on the other side.  It would be necessary to have it before us. There have been various amendments proposed here for the purpose of not only approximating the position of Ireland to a Dominion status, but of absolutely and permanently identifying the status of Ireland with Dominion status.  Those are not the sort of amendments which, to my mind, serve any good national purpose.  If we had Deputy Magennis's suggestion in print, we could see it, but I belive myself it would not be acceptable.  If we specifically ask the British to commit themselves further than they are committed, they might rightly decline to be so committed.  If it does not&mdash;and I belive it would not commit them any further&mdash;there is no advantage in it.  But if they hold it commit them, they might rightly decline, while, from my point of view, I do not belive it would carry us any further.</P>

      <P>May I say, by way of apology, I quite accept what the Minister has just said as to his not having my amendment before him in writing. I regret he has not had it.  I merely evolved it a few moments ago, but I can submit it to him for the Third Reading.  The real reason, I have tried to explain, was to have what we understand by the Treaty set out explicitly. If the other parties to the Treaty declare it to be contrary to the Treaty, well, then, there is so much out of the way; just as at the present time there is a considerable advantage to us in discussing <Col N="1479" /> the draft Constitution when we know it has already undergone a revision and been accepted in its revised form by the other parties to the Treaty.  There is really nothing in what we have proposed that is novel.  There is certainly nothing in it that is hostile to anything the Ministry has put forward, for it will be in the recollection of this Dáil that when we were adopting Article 50 (a) the Minister for Home Affairs declared most positively and unmistakably that the meaning of the words, &ldquo;shall be the law, practice, and constitutional usage of Canada&rdquo; was a reference to growth and development, whereupon I asked him would he put that as a recital in the preamble. He said no.  Consequently, all the Irish people have as an assurance of their constitutional position is the <i>obiter dictum</i> of the Minister for Home Affairs. If the Minister applies his own dictum why not put it up to the British Government to accept or reject?  Why make this declaration for the Dáil that our interpretation of the position of the Treaty is so and so, but we must not say it?  It is either prudence carried to the verge of timidity, or something that might more commonly be described as utter inconsistency.</P>

Therefore, if such be the case, according to this preamble they will be <Col N="1480" /> null and void, and I think it is necessary that we should have some protection and some safeguard in the Constitution which will prevent the British Legislature making amendments which are violating the Treaty that has been entered into.  I think it is essential to have something that will safeguard us against trespass and encroachment of people in the British Legislature who are hostile to our national aspirations, and to ensure that not one iota of the Treaty shall be filched from us by their operations.</P>

      <P>If it is intended to redraft the Preamble I presume it will come forward again for discussion. As the proposer of the amendment, I do not accept the view of the Minister of Local Government that there is any apology being made in declaring that the Irish Nation has the right to sovereignty and has the right to the free exercise of that sovereignty.  I think that is not an apology.  The other portion of my amendment, that it is &ldquo;in discharge of our trust to the living Irish people we enact this Constitution&rdquo;&mdash;if it is looked upon as an apology the apology is made because this interpretation of the Treaty, which is in the Constitution we are debating, is not a free interpretation by this Assembly. That is admitted by the Ministry itself.  It is not a free interpretation. It is an interpretation which in many of the clauses is in the sense the duress of circumstances which we are accepting, and which I am prepared to accept also &mdash;as forced upon us by British Ministers. As to whether it is wise to make those remarks or not&mdash;I do not see any unwisdom at all in declaring the position quite honestly as we see it, and I do not think Ministers of any country would be so outrageously unreasonable as to make war on another country because we honestly state what our view or our interpretation of the Treaty entered into with them is.  I do not yet know the particular basis upon which the Ministry is resisting the insertion of these words in the preamble.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Milroy, I asked for information, I think, at the beginning: does this preamble go forward as a part of the Constitution or as a separate thing?  To my mind, it is quite separate, because surely nobody expects the British Parliament to pass a Constitution making a statement, like the statement <Col N="1481" /> in the preamble of the Bill, as drafted by the Ministry, and I, certainly do not anyway expect the statement which I propose in my amendment to go forward to the British Parliament.  I take it the preamble is a separate thing, and that the Constitution will go forward separately to the British.  The preamble is simply our own statement made here, and it has nothing to do with the Act, which will enact the Constitution from the British point of view.</P>

      <P>We need not discuss it then.  I think it is a pity that fifty odd men should be wasting their time discussing Deputy De Roiste's amendment. I was present, unfortunately, at all the debates in the Dáil last January, and I got tired listening to everyone getting up, saying what a magnificent Republican he was, and how it pained his heart to have to take the Treaty, and how he remained awake at night thinking about it, but that he would take it all the same.  It reminds me of children crying after sugarstick they lost.  We took this Treaty.  We know its limitations, and there is no occasion to be going about day after day, exposing our robes.  We took the Treaty.  We know now exactly what it is, and in the name of commonsense let us take that for granted, and let us not be always making a song about it.  What we put in the Preamble does not matter twopence.  The Treaty matters.  The rights we get under the Treaty matter.  These rights are in the Constitution, no more and no less, and if we could not put more in the Constitution it is the fault, so far as it is a fault, of the men, including Deputy Gavan Duffy, who signed the Treaty, and it is <Col N="1482" /> merely unworthy of the Nation or the people who represent the Nation, to be crying about what we lost and what we did not get.  Preambles, after all, are a matter of taste, and I think there is a French proverb that &ldquo;you cannot argue about taste.&rdquo;  I prefer our Preamble. I do not like the whinge that is in Deputy de Roiste's Preamble, and naturally as I prefer, from a literary sense, the pious aspirations that are in our own Preamble, I am going to vote for it and am going to ask the rest of you to vote for it.</P>

      <P>I suppose one ought not to raise any further question on this Preamble after the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, inasmuch as nothing in the Preamble matters twopence, though I suppose it cost more than twopence to put it into type. Nevertheless I think it is well to make any amendments that are possible, and I suggest this amendment in the literal sense to insert after the words &ldquo;which are hereby given the force of law&rdquo; the following words: &ldquo;And nothing in the Constitution shall be read as lessening in any way the rights, powers, and authority secured to Saorstát Eireann/Irish Free State by the terms of the scheduled Treaty.&rdquo;  Ministers have told us that the Constitution is a fair and full interpretation of the Treaty in their opinion. They have stressed that.  I do not think it is asking too much of them to suggest that their opinion might not be approved or confirmed by every other authority on these matters, and that there is a possibility of difference of opinion.  I think the term &ldquo;repugnance&rdquo; here is not sufficiently wide to include possible defections in the Constitution or the liberties granted in the Treaty.  It is possible that someone at some future date may say the Constitution is less valuable from the Irish standpoint, and gives less freedom. It limits the freedom that is granted in the Treaty, inasmuch as the Constitution as passed by the Dáil, after the Treaty had been signed, reduces the freedom granted by the Treaty.  Therefore it is the Constitution which shall prevail.  And to avoid the possibility of that&mdash;quite apart from the question of something being definitely in opposition <Col N="1483" /> to the Treaty, that is repugnant to the Treaty, or that there may be something that may have escaped our notice short of the liberties granted in the Treaty&mdash; we should provide ourselves against that interpretation being made.  I therefore suggest that not only are matters repugnant to the Treaty of no avail, but if anything at a later date is found in the Constitution to be less valuable than the Treaty, it is the Treaty shall prevail. That is conceded.  Now, that is conceding everything that the Ministers had argued for in regard to the value of the Treaty.  I am asking them to agree that the fullest possible value in the Treaty shall be secured, even though we have omitted something valuable in the interpretation of the Treaty in the Constitution. I beg to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment, to my mind, adds nothing in substance to what is in the original preamble, i.e., the second part of the preamble.  There is nothing objectionable in it practically except that it adds words without adding substance.  From the point of view of form there might be some slight danger in it.  This particular part of the preamble is an agreed clause, and, as you might say, it will be part of the British Act in its present form.  It is an agreed clause in its present form, and if we add to it words specifically stating that nothing in the Constitution shall be read &ldquo;as lessening in any way the rights, powers and authority secured to Saorstat Eireann by the terms of the Scheduled Treaty,&rdquo; the British might suggest that they shall add further: &ldquo;and nothing in the Constitution shall be read as increasing in any way the rights, powers and authority secured to Saorstat Eireann by the terms of the Scheduled Treaty.&rdquo;  I think it would be better to leave that part of the preamble as it stands.</P>

      <P>This question has been raised several times in the discussion on the Constitution.  I understood, from the Minister for Local Government a moment ago that this particular clause as it stands in the Bill is an agreed clause, and consequently cannot be amended.  It is much like the Articles in the Constitution that deal with our relations with England, and are an interpretation of the Treaty from the British point of view as far as I can gather.  The idea underlying this as it stands is that any amendment of the Constitution in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Schedule of the Treaty shall &lsquo;to the extent only of such repugnancy be absolutely void and inoperative, and the Parliament and the Executive Council of the Irish Free State shall respectively pass such further legislation, and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty.&rdquo;  The assumption there is that it is only an Irish Government, under an Irish Parliament presumably, and Irish Courts will do things that will be repugnant to the Treaty, and that it will not be incumbent upon the Government and Parliament of Great Britain to pass any legislation if they <Col N="1485" /> think it should do some things which shall be repugnant to the Treaty.  It is the British Ministers who will be able to say what is, or what is not, repugnant in the Treaty.  Now, my amendment, which I simply put forward here for the consideration of the Dáil Ministry, is that something should be put into that clause which would ensure that if the English Government on its side at any future time did something which is considered repugnant to the Treaty that we have entered into with them that it would also be incumbent on the Government of England to pass legislation that may be necessary to act in accordance with the Treaty.  Furthermore, I put for their consideration that some other body besides the British Ministers of the future should interpret as between the two countries.  The suggestion which I make here is that the body frequently referred to in the course of these debates &mdash;namely, some body of representatives of the various States of the Commonwealth. It is not because one might, or might not, like particularly to deal with such Tribunal, but it is surely essential that the interpretation of whether Ireland does anything repugnant to the Treaty or England for that matter does, it should not be left to British Ministers on the one side or, perhaps the British Ministers might say, to the Irish Ministers on the other side. There should be some other Tribunal.  I do submit the underlying idea of the clause, as it stands, is that it is only Ireland may do things repugnant to the Treaty, and that England may not do them, or shall not do them, and that the only persons who shall be competent to decide that clause, whether Ireland does anything repugnant to the Treaty would be the British Ministers who are in Downing Street.  I suggest it should be amended so that there should be a right to some other Court of Appeal, and that it should not be left to British Ministers to interpret that Ireland has or has not done something repugnant to the Treaty. That is the object of the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Róiste's amendment may be taken in two parts.  First where he wishes to enact that the British Parliament shall pass certain legislation.  Now, we cannot enact that the British Parliament shall pass legislation.  The British Parliament <Col N="1486" /> unfortunately is not within or subject to the jurisdiction of this Parliament.</P>

      <P>And consequently, in my opinion, that portion of the amendment falls through.  If the British Parliament does not enact such legislation as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty, then the British Parliament breaks the Scheduled Treaty, and Deputy de Róiste and the rest of us can take any action we deem expedient in the altered circumstances, but we cannot go through the farce here of enacting that the British Parliament shall pass certain legislation. Taking the other part of his amendment. It is a proposal to submit all questions of repugnancy to a Conference representative of the different States of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It is as well to examine the implications of that amendment.  It practically binds this country and this Parliament to submit to the arbitration of the Dominions any matter at issue with Britain arising out of the Treaty signed last December.  I do not know whether we are willing to take that step or not.  I do not know whether we ought to take it.  I have nothing to guide me to form an estimate of the timbre of the Dominion statesmen, whether they are likely to take our view rather than the British view on any matters that may arise, and I do not know that it is wise to set down in our Constitution that we are prepared to leave to a Conference of the statesmen of the Commonwealth all questions arising out of the Treaty.  The Treaty is an international document.  Some time ago there was a proposal that we should put in a kind of contingent application to the League of Nations for admission, but after careful consideration we did not accept the suggestion.  Our failure to accept that suggestion did not in any way forecast that in the future Ireland will not apply for admission to the League of Nations.  It was because we objected to the contingent nature of the application that we objected to putting ourselves in the position where we might quite easily, and, as we consider, probably, get a snub or a slight, that we did not accept the suggestion.  A Tribunal that would be competent to decide the questions of repugnancy arising out of the Treaty in the <Col N="1487" /> future would be the League of Nations, when Ireland applies for and secures admission to that body.  I do not think we should now in our Constitution state positively that we are prepared to leave all questions of repugnacy to the Dominion statesmen.</P>

      <P>Excuse me.  As regards implementing the Treaty and Constitution, the Constitution will have to go before the British Parliament, and I think what Deputy Milroy referred to a little while ago is very essential, and part of my amendment is directed towards that.  Suppose certain things are put in which we consider a breach of the Treaty.  What is going to be the effect? I know that it is a supposition, but it is as well for us in this portion of the Preamble, as all the interpretation is supposed to be on the side of the British Ministers, that something should be inserted from our side to safeguard our position as well.  With regard to what has been said about the League of Nations and representatives of the various British Dominions, I would have inserted the League of Nations, but the Ministry have already turned down an application for admission to the League of Nations.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs to something which seemingly at least he has overlooked?  There must be some Tribunal.  If ever, and we hope that &ldquo;ever&rdquo; will be &ldquo;never,&rdquo; a question arises as to whether a future piece of legislation, or any part of it, is repugnant to the Treaty, before what Tribunal is it bound to come in the ordinary order?  Before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  If Deputy de Roiste's amendment is adopted, it excludes the reference to the Privy Council.  It does not exclude, I think the reference of any high question of dispute to the League of Nations.  I think the Deputy who moves the amendment has misconceived the position taken up by Ministers with regard to application for admission to the League of Nations.  I understood that they have not turned it down.  They <Col N="1488" /> merely regarded the matter as premature; that the Free State is not yet in a position to make such an application as would be bound to meet with a satisfactory result.  There are certain conditions that have to be satisfied.  For example, to take one very essential one, that the authority of the Free State is exercised over such and such determinate territory.  Furthermore that the majority of the people over whom jurisdiction is claimed, habitually give it obedience at the present moment.  These two are not questions which could be satisfactorily answered, and I voted with the Ministry on that occasion in favour of postponing the application for admission.  It would be very much better when your Constitution is enacted, and your precise status is determined, to make application, but what I fear is that in the absence of something to the contrary we may leave the determination of matters in dispute to the Privy Council.  It is quite possible that by negotiation the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council might be made more suitable, I will not say amenable to pressure from Ireland, but more suitable for our purpose, and I daresay a pious hope will go up from the Ministerial Benches to that effect.</P>

      <P>There is no reason whatever for assuming that the question of the repugnancy of any law will go before the British Privy Council, or that the validity of any law will come before the Privy Council.

It was that sort of thing, rather than a question that could be amicably decided between two powers, that I had in view.  I say that by way of explanation and not by way of argument.</P>

      <P>The two Amendments in my name come next.  We <Col N="1489" /> have so many amendments proposed to this Preamble that I want quite briefly to indicate what I judge to be the salient parts of these two amendments of mine to the two Articles, respectively, and to put them before the attention of the Ministry.  Before doing so I wish to make reference to the statement of the Minister for Agriculture, that these questions are, after all, matters of personal preference and taste, and are merely questions of words.  The Minister for Local Government referred to them as poetic or non-poetic in the degree in which a contest has or has not been carried to the point of successful victory. Actually, however, it is the case, as was proved in other countries, that more legislation is conducted in respect of the meaning of Preambles than almost of any other part of a Constitution.  I think that too much attention cannot be given to getting the Preamble, both in the decorative and practicable parts, as good as possible.  It is with a view to that practical amendment and improvement &mdash;where I think improvement and amendment are required&mdash;I move these two amendments.  The first reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We, the people of Ireland, acknowledging that all power comes from God, and in our resolve to renew and re-establish our State and to found it upon principles of freedom and justice, in order that Ireland may take her place among the Nations of the Earth, do hereby declare Saorstát Eireann to be established, and we give it the following Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The second runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the Constitution which follows shall be construed with reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland thereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as the &lsquo;Scheduled Treaty&rsquo;) which are hereby given the force of law.  Any amendment of or any law made under the following Constitution repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative, and the Parliament and Executive Council of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann shall respectively pass such further legislation and do all other things necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty.  Provided <Col N="1490" /> always that the Scheduled Treaty shall be deemed to include any modification thereof, or extension thereto, by mutual agreement or acceptance since the making of the Treaty, and also any further development or extension of the constitutional status or usage and of the self-governing rights and privileges of the several nations of the Community of Nations mentioned in the first article of the Scheduled Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The parts of these that I suggest are really of practical importance are that instead of saying the Dáil does something, it should be placed upon the ultimate deep foundation, and the old words consecrated in these matters should be used, &ldquo;We the people.&rdquo;  It is not merely a question of decoration; it is not merely a gesture, although it is an exceedingly important gesture. Actually in the United States certain laws have been interpreted in the light of the introductory words of the Preamble, which are, &ldquo;We the people.&rdquo;  If the words had been &ldquo;We, Congress,&rdquo; the actual interpretation of certain laws&mdash; and I could give the Ministry references if they want them&mdash;would have been different.  I think it would be an improvement in the Preamble if a statement were to be made to the effect that Ireland does take her place among the Nations of the earth.  With regard to the second part of the Bill, the differences are these:&mdash;The second sentence runs: &ldquo;Any amendment of, or any law made under the following Constitution repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty,&rdquo; etc.  I have eliminated the words &ldquo;if any provision of this Constitution is in any respect repugnant&rdquo; for this reason, that I assume it should be our business on each side now to decide what is repugnant in the Constitution and what is not, and when we have come to that decision, to let that, at least, be removed from the sphere of future legislation.  The other part is the addition given in the words that I have at the end of my amendment. I will read them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided always that the Scheduled Treaty shall be deemed to include any modification thereof, or extension thereto by mutual agreement or acceptance, since the making of the , and also any further development <Col N="1491" /> or extension of the Constitutional Status or usage and of the self-governing rights and privileges of the several nations of the community of nations mentioned in the first Article of the Scheduled Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, these words, or words equivalent to them, are of the first importance, for this reason: The Schedule becomes part of the Constitution.  If it should happen, with more amicable relations in future, and with a certain amount of trust and confidence that I hope years will engender, that England were to decide to give over one of the four reserved parts of our territory to us, she would be unable to do it without compelling us to the necessity of a constitutional amendment, * because the Treaty has become part of the Constitution, and therefore an elaborate process of constitutional amendment is necessary before there can be any give and take in respect of what is not only at this moment a document of accommodation, but what will continue to be a document of accommodation for every year that passes hereafter.  And in order that, subsequently, we may not require constitutional amendments, I therefore suggest that some such words should be included, and to them should be added what I have embodied in the sentence, a sentence by which any further progress in status, or any further attainment of privilege in any part of the community of nations should be made applicable to Ireland, and should be made applicable by expressed statement at this moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ERNEST BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the first Clause of Deputy Figgis' amendment, I do not know that we can stand for it from the point of view of substance.  For instance, I do not know exactly what it means to say, that we resolve to renew and reestablish our State.  I do not know whether that refers to the Gaelic State or the Irish State of the time of Brian Borumha.  Then coming further down, where we talk about taking our place amongst the nations of the earth.  There is no doubt that we get near free nationhood through the Treaty and we have the means in it, I believe, of getting to free nationhood, but I think that the Clause as suggested by Deputy Figgis from the point of view of taste&mdash;and I think it really comes to that&mdash;is not so good as the first Clause of the Preamble, as <Col N="1492" /> found in the draft.  It really is very much a matter of preference of words, and one can hardly say more about it than that a certain form is preferable to another form.  With regard to the second part of the amendment any modification by agreement would certainly modify the Treaty.  It is not suggested either in the Constitution that the Treaty, as it stands, is a thing for all time, and I think that all of us take it for granted that modification of the Treaty is possible.  If the Treaty is modified by mutual agreement, I do not see that this Clause prevents us doing anything which would enable us to take advantage of the modification.  The word &ldquo;repugnant,&rdquo; which Deputy Johnson found to be a little weak, or which he thought might not cover absolutely every contingency, is perhaps a useful thing here.  If the Treaty is modified by agreement, then any legislation in accord with that modification cannot, I think, be held to be repugnant to the Treaty.  If the word was not as good a word as we would desire, it is very suitable from this point of view.  I think that the amendment is unnecessary; I think that it does not provide for any difficulty that is likely to arise or that, in fact, can arise.  The adoption of this second suggestion means the departure from an agreed form, and while changes and wording might possibly be got, by re-opening negotiations, to any agreed form, unless a very strong reason is put forward I think it is undesirable that the agreed form be altered.  Now, in the first part of No. 2 this does not in any way improve the agreed form, and in regard to the second, it does not make an alteration that can be regarded as a necessary alteration.  We do not want it to be taken that we regard the question of the Treaty as part of the Constitution being too rigid.  I think that this desire to add commas and full stops, and to make something that is designed to be everlasting, is not in accord with the point of view that a great number of us have.  The idea that we have in regard to &ldquo;the law, practice and Constitutional usage of Canada,&rdquo; is that the status of Canada is a growing status, an undefined status, and a status that cannot be definitely ascertained without reference to the future.  We think that there would be no amendment or no modification of the Scheduled Treaty, necessary to enable us to take <Col N="1493" /> advantage of future developments.  Then the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty which have reference to various Territorial provisions are not actually part of the Constitution.  They are undertakings which we make at the moment, but they have no reference to status of the Free State or to our Constitutional machinery. There is no need to put any proviso in the Preamble, having those particular undertakings in mind.</P>

      <P>I regret that it was only just a few moments before Deputy Figgis moved his amendment that I had the opportunity to read it.  When I did read it I found so much in the latter part of his amendment No. 2 that resembled what I had thrown out as a suggestion to the Minister for Home Affairs, that in consistency and fairness, I think I ought to support the amendment&mdash;at least to that extent.  It is rather a pity that the Minister for Agriculture's visits to this Dáil are so much like angels' visits&mdash;few and far between.  He delivers himself of his heavenly message, and withdraws before anyone has an opportunity to deal with it.  There is a great deal of the &ldquo;I am Sir Oracle&rdquo; about his pronouncements, and &ldquo;when I open my lips let no dog bark.&rdquo;  He told us that all this discussion which is occupying our time this evening was merely a matter of words.  What is any creed or article of faith but a matter of words.  How many men have gone to execution for words and official interpretations of words?  It is quite easy to say a thing in one form of expression which might be interpreted as the equivalent of another, and yet be wholly different.  While he was speaking I thought of a well-known story, which I ought to apologise to you for repeating.  Someone repeated to a lady, who was an aspirant for operatic honours, that A.B. had said of her that she had a heavenly voice, and the lady, flattered, asked: &ldquo;How sweet of him: did he really say that?&rdquo;  And the other, who had a delicate conscience, said: &ldquo;He did not quite say that your voice is heavenly; he said your voice was unearthly.&rdquo; Now, I would recommend the study of words to the Minister for Agriculture, especially when he intrudes himself into discussions of the high importance and consequence that we are engaged in now.  I rather <Col N="1494" /> like the &ldquo;poetry&rdquo; of Deputy Darrell Figgis' first amendment, which excites derison in some of our colleagues.  I like the poetry that declares all power comes from God.  I should like to see in the Preamble something like what we have in some new Constitution of the European States&mdash;some such words as: &ldquo;that whereas, under the blessing of Almighty God,&rdquo; and so on, a phrase that recognises that we are not altogether atheists in this Island of Saints.  Furthermore, I might read this statement that &ldquo;it is founded upon the principles of freedom and justice,&rdquo; as, indeed, the introduction of the element of the Gaelic State.  I was reproached by a member of the Drafting Committee that he saw very few amendments from me on the paper intended to create the Gaelic State. Well, here is one of them.  As regards the second part, &ldquo;that the Scheduled Treaty shall be deemed to include any modification thereof or extension thereto by mutual agreement or acceptance,&rdquo; I quite confess that we could not very well put that into the Constitution, because we could not declare a subsequent Treaty to be embraced in the scheme of the earlier Treaty, because the later Treaty may be of a kind to make that impossible.  But with the last part of the declaration I am in thorough agreement, because it is equivalent to that suggested by myself earlier in the evening, that is, &ldquo;any further development or extension of the constitutional status or usage and of the self-governing rights and privileges of the several nations of the Community of Nations mentioned in the first Article of the Scheduled Treaty,&rdquo; shall accrue to Ireland.  I still persist, unless that, perhaps, it is out of order to return to what is already being debated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is most essential to have the declarations of the Ministers embodied in this Constitution.  On a previous occasion I have already heard the Minister in charge of the Bill declare that his interpretation of the clause, &ldquo;the laws, practice and constitutional usage of Canada&rdquo; was the interpretation that gave us any benefit.  The Minister for Local Government, for whose pronouncements I have unaffectedly great respect, <Col N="1495" /> has said the same thing again.  What I fail to understand is that Ministers stand up and declare in this place that the meaning they put on these words is such and such, and yet when invited to put that meaning into the draft Constitution they shrink from it.  What is the reason?  We are told that there are certain things that it is inadvisable to mention.  Then why mention them?  Why have this esoteric doctrine?  Though they say England will be hampered, yet they declare in one breath that Ireland is entitled under the Treaty to whatever growth in Constitutional privileges that the Dominions shall develop, but we are not to go outside and say so.  One Minister says he is tired of hearing apologies for the Treaty.  And before he has done he apologises for the Treaty and talks about its limitations and the duress under which it was accepted. And a colleague of his gets up and repeats precisely the same thing. Now there should be no need of apology for the Treaty.  But some such words as those of Deputy Darrell Figgis's amendments should go into this Preamble because it will be said that Ireland's status was fixed and crystalised on December 6th, 1921, that the Constitution which was enacted by virtue of the Treaty is a written Constitution; that such and such were the terms of that Constitution.  The Constitution which was easy for Canada to develop is an unwritten Constitution because the population there was originally a colony which was an offshoot of the Mother Country; the men who made Canada were loyal British subjects. They were Scotchmen and in a smaller proportion Englishmen who developed the land in that colony, and they did in that colony precisely what in earlier years similar men who exiled themselves to America had done for the American Colonies.  They developed it from a colony into a State, and they have made, by their British sense of constitutional right, a Constitution similar to that of the Mother Country.  Now Canada, with a British population, always regarded as an offshoot of the Empire, and as a pillar of strength to the Empire, and so many thousand miles away from Downing Street, was able to develop an unwritten Constitution.  But we are within 2½ hours' steam of the great naval stations of Great Britain, and it would be very difficult to develop an unwritten <Col N="1496" /> Constitution under these conditions. Therefore, it is all the more incumbent upon us, who, but a while ago were regarded as rebels, who have just concluded a Treaty of peace with Great Britain, and who are being watched carefully, and whose pronouncements as to rights are being examined closely with microscopic eyes, and whose wordings of the Constitution have been submitted to the closest consideration of the expert criticism of the best brains Great Britain has in her service, to take express pains now to declare what our interpretation is of our rights under the Treaty.  I quote the words of the Minister for whose words I have so much respect, that in a case of certain disputes the thing can be settled amicably.  If there be any dispute here, then let it be settled amicably.  We are adjourning for a week.  In less time than a week this matter could have British opinion expressed upon it.  I shall be told, no doubt, that that is a slavish proposition. But it is not more slavish than to have had to bring this Draft Constitution over for the consideration and revision of the British Cabinet.  That had to be done.  I do not blame the Ministry for doing it.  I never blamed the Ministry for doing it.  I blame no one in this Dáil, and no member of the Ministry for that.  It was an unpleasant situation for them, and they were forced by the stern logic of necessity to do it.  But there is still room for negotiation on this point, and I do maintain, Sir, that if we let this go by default, we shall be accused hereafter of lacking in vigilance and lacking in spirit.</P>

      <P>That was not the matter that I was dealing with in this Amendment, which I will postpone, and ask the Ministry to consider it carefully; and I ask them to consider it carefully in respect of certain statements made by the Minister for Local Government.  He stated that the Treaty <Col N="1497" /> was not a thing for all time.  I agree.  If the Treaty had not been brought in and made equally a Constitution document; it could be revised&mdash;it could, in his words, it could be possible by mutual agreement to do that.  But when it is brought in, and brought in as part of the Constitution, you cannot modify it by a Constitution agreement.  Subsequent to that Agreement, you have to go on and get new agreement, and that is what I am trying to prevent.  He said the Treaty was not designed to be everlasting. I agree, and that is the reason I introduced this form of words in order that it should not be everlasting, but if you bring it in and make it a part of the Constitution, which is designed to be everlasting, as every Constitution is ever designed to be everlasting, it is bunreacht, it is fundamental, and it will be harder to change that, whereas by the very nature of the Treaty it should be easier to change it than ordinary law where it would be a matter of degree. I can give one practical instance.  Subsequent to this Constitution being adopted Ulster, &mdash;that is, the Six Counties,&mdash;will have an opportunity of deciding whether they will come in or go out.  A Boundary Commission will be appointed. It is stated in the Treaty that that Boundary Commission's findings will be obligatory.  They need not be obligatory in the Treaty if we and the people in the North agree to make certain alterations here and there in order that there may be accommodation on each side, but by that time the Treaty will be put into the Constitution, and therefore when they, the Boundary Commission, will be obligatory, it will have to be down to the last comma.  The Minister for Local Government says it is not easy.  I venture to suggest if he looks carefully into this he will find it is easy, and if he suggests it is not easy I suggest, with regard to this very important question, that he should make assurances doubly sure, by any form of words that will at least give some protection in the matter and give some protection where I claim there is no protection needed.  On another part of the question the Ministry says here, if any progress is made in respect of any of the co-equal members of the Community of Nations, that progress and that advantage made by them will naturally accrue to Ireland.  It is not <Col N="1498" /> stated so here, and will not be unless we say so now, and I believe if we say so now we will have behind us not only our own claim, but the entire claim of the entire Commonwealth that desire to see such a thing brought about; and I believe that this proviso will be acceptable to the people across the water, and, at any rate, it ought to be suggested. But with regard to the Scheduled Treaty and the change of the Scheduled Treaty, I feel perfectly convinced unless we allow every latitude for alteration and modification we will find accommodation and modification have been precluded by making the Treaty part of the Constitution document.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that the case made for this amendment is a case that ought to commend itself to the Dáil.  It appears to me that there is a peculiar sort of suspicion about our actual status, and that in order to bolster up something which is insecure this particular Preamble must be put in.  Now we have entered into this Treaty of agreement with England either in good faith or with certain reservations&mdash;that we have a certain suspicion about the goodwill of the English people in making this Treaty with us, and that we have in our minds a certain suspicion regarding the limitations that are in the Treaty or limitations which will be imposed, and that we have all the time at the back of the mentality that supports the amendment before the Dáil some sort of bulwark in the other Nations of the Commonwealth, and that upon them absolutely our whole security and our whole position rests.  If they support us, and if we can get whatever developments, as they are called, equally that other nations get, then we will be safe.  As far as my standard of position is concerned, it is that in the very first Article of the Constitution our stability is as a co-equal member of the Community of Nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations established. It is not that it was; it is not that it will be at some future indefinite date; but it is as a co-equal member, and upon that position of equality I am perfectly satisfied that nothing like suspicion regarding that fundamental principle that is given expression to there is justified unless you have in your mind some suspicion regarding that position; but <Col N="1499" /> there is no necessity for this, unless some agent of one or other of the Commonwealths desires that each one of them would get the position of development such as we will get, or such as any of them would desire to get in any future Conference that might be held.  I am perfectly satisfied that any future development that comes to Saorstat will come by reason of the push which is in the Irish Nation, and not by reason of any step-motherly affection or solicitude that will be given us from any other members of the Commonwealth, and that is the situation, and that is they stand without looking for support to somebody else. The first part of the Preamble suggested does not appear to me to be any great improvement upon what is down here. In the one case it states &ldquo;the people of Ireland.&rdquo;  Now, we represent the people of Ireland; this is their organisation and institution which they have set up.  It would be rather a difficult proposition to get the people of Ireland assembled all together in one plain and to listen to any one voice to represent the Nation, and the usual method in any country is to get an assembly together, and in this country the premier assembly is Dáil Eireann, and Dáil Eireann constituted as a constituent assembly acknowledges, if you like, on behalf of the Irish people, that all lawful authority comes from God.  The second part I do not like, for reasons I have stated, that there is a sort of suspicion lurking at the back of our minds that the position we have got under the Treaty is an unstable one.  I object to that.  I take it our stand is in the first Article of the Constitution.  I have implicit confidence in the Irish Nation and in the Representatives of the Irish Nation in the future working from that position to safeguard the national interest and to secure the integrity of the Nation.  If it should happen that the Six Counties will opt out, and that they subsequently should express a desire to come back, no insuperable obstacle is presented in this Constitution to prevent that happening.  There have been difficulties already in matters of that kind. The real difficulty of the present instance is solved by the Treaty.  A very difficult situation was solved by it, and this would not be by any means as difficult a situation.  We are living in times when, perhaps, respect for human life <Col N="1500" /> is not what it ought to be, and we are living in times when possible negotiations or suggestions or methods may come for modification of the Articles of the Treaty as they stand.  I am against any such modification.  If the Northeast should opt out, there is in the Treaty special machinery which will deal with the extension of the Saorstát. On that principle this Government is going to stand or fall, to get the last ounce out of the Treaty, in so far as that is concerned or as far as any other clause in the Treaty is concerned.  No interference will be permitted with that clause in the Treaty which deals with the setting up of a Boundary Commission, in accordance with the Article which sets forth what should be done in the event of the North opting out. No modification of that should be allowed, and it would be quite easy, I believe, if this Article were passed, that such a modification could occur in the event of certain members of this Dáil being removed or any other such event happening.  As I have said, I have perfect confidence in the Irish Nation working out its own destiny, with or without the help of any other Members of the Commonwealth, and I am satisfied that whatever real progress will be made will only be made by reason of the effort that will come from this country.  I think that putting in this clause here would give rise to doubt in our ability to work out our destiny and for that reason I cannot support it.</P>

The President referred to what would happen if the Six Counties&mdash;to use his own word&mdash;opted out.  I do not think it much matters whether they hop out or do not hop out.  What is more important is that the President seems to regard it as an unmodifiable document, whereas the Minister for Local Government speaks about modification.  I think it desirable that modification should be possible, by mutual agreement, but by making the Treaty a Constitutional document that cannot occur, and I think it should be made possible.</P>

      <P>The Motion moved by Deputy Darrell Figgis had a reference to a difference between the price of Irish-produced food in Ireland as compared with England; the difference between the price that the producer obtained for these commodities and the price which the consumer bought them at&mdash;and his proposal was, that having regard to these things, a Committee be appointed, to be known as &ldquo;The Cost of Living Committee,&rdquo; the terms of reference of which are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To set forth a list of articles or commodities necessary to livelihood; to enquire into the prices available for such articles or commodities to the producer; to enquire into the prices being paid for such articles or commodities by the consumer; and to report if there be any undue disproportion between these two scales of prices, and, if so, to recommend the best measures to be taken to end that disproportion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read that, it is a proposal to do two things that are really quite distinct, and both of which are very important indeed. The President made reference to certain proposals that were in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and hoped he would produce a motion to set up local Committees, but I submit local Committees in this matter are not sufficient.  As I said, the matter is divided into two parts, and I will deal with the profiteering side of it first. Deputy Figgis instanced the relative prices of beef, as obtained by the farmer and as paid by the consumer, and he adduced figures which, I think, will stand the test of enquiry, to show that there is a very great disproportion&mdash;an undue disproportion&mdash;to the ordinary common observer.  There is a similar disproportion&mdash;perhaps greater disproportion&mdash;when we deal with vegetable products.  I think there is an extravagant difference in nearly every commodity that is bought by the average man and woman&mdash;working class, middle class or upper class&mdash;in the city and in the country generally.  Deputy Figgis's <Col N="1505" /> proposal deals with articles necessary to livelihood.  Well, there may be a restriction in that, but I do not think it is desirable to make that very restricted reference.  Articles that are necessary may be defined by the Governor of a gaol, but there are articles which are commonly consumed, which ought to be considered in this matter, as well as articles that are considered necessary. There is an item, and while I can speak of it without prejudice&mdash;or perhaps that is too much to say&mdash;it is not without prejudice (I happen to be a teetotaller), but there is an item which enters into the common consumption of a great proportion of the people of this country, in which there is a very great disproportion, so great a disproportion between the cost of production and the cost to the consumer, that it is an outrage upon the public opinion of the country.  No doubt, the Finance Minister, as Finance Minister, is very intimately concerned with this particular problem; but after his desires are satisfied, as Finance Minister&mdash;and I emphasise that&mdash;we have the immense profits that are made by the manufacturers, and what are, I think, the immense profits made by the retailers. Stout is an item which enters into the common consumption of very many people in this country, and very many temperate people believe that it is practically a necessity of their lives, and there is no doubt whatever that there are tremendously exorbitant charges in respect of that particular item of common consumption.  I am forced to recognise this, that when we are dealing with profiteering, we are dealing with a very loose term.  People speak of profiteering as if there was some figure which was normal, beyond which it was a crime to make profits.  I do not know what the normal rate of profit might be, and I do not know what profiteering is, except that it is something beyond the normal, and the people that are emphasising the evils of profiteering ought to go a little further and examine what is meant by profiteering.  If they wish to interfere with profiteering, are they willing to interfere with the rights of the farmer, the tradesman, the manufacturer, to take the best advantage they can of the market before them?  Now, farmers complain of profiteering.  Quite rightly, but when you are interfering with profiteering, you are interfering with the <Col N="1506" /> right of the seller to take the best advantage he can of the markets. I think it is necessary to do that.  I want complainants of the evil of profiteering to recognise that that is one of the implications. I remember a few years ago coming across a Canadian trade paper, and there was a certain advocacy for capturing the British market with certain qualities of fancy soap.  It was very interesting to me to read of how the analysis of cost was made up in this trade paper.  The article was sold retail for 1/3, and the experts in this business summed it up something like this:&mdash;Retailer's profit so much, freight, duties, cartage, carriage, expenses so much, cost of package so much, right down the list, until the cost of the soap stood at 1½d.  The accumulation of all the other charges raised the price to the retailer to 1/3.  That was not put forward as an abnormal thing at all; it was the normal process of business.  I want to suggest that when you are dealing with profiteering you are going to deal with that particular kind of thing, and the accumulation of charges upon the first charge as between the producer and the consumer.  We learned during the Railway Commission, and that, perhaps, is quite a mild example, that the actual services cost about £62 and the remaining part of £100 paid for interest on Capital invested.  That is, out of every £100 the community paid for railway services, about £62 or £63&mdash;I am speaking of pre-war&mdash;went to the cost of running the services, and the remainder to paying interest on Capital.  I believe one of the explanations of profiteering, as it is called, lies in the fact that there are nearly three times too many people engaged merely in distribution.  There are about three times too many shops in the country, and each shop-keeper looks for the profit which will enable him on a small turnover to make a satisfactory living.  Now with this invitation to examine what is meant by profiteering, I still approve of the desire that a Committee should be set up to deal with the question on a national scale, that to be supplemented by local Committees to deal with the evil in its local application. I want that Committee to have some powers to interfere.  I believe that it is absolutely necessary before we can <Col N="1507" /> diagnose the evils that confront the country that there should be a probing, a close inquiry into these evils.  There is another aspect of this case, as indicated in Deputy Figgis's motion.  It is that the Committee shall set forth a list of the articles or commodities necessary to livelihood.  That again, I believe, is a very desirable thing to have done by an authoritative Committee.  The President told us inaccurately that the &ldquo;Cost of Living Report&rdquo; already gives a list of the things that are necessary to livelihood. That is an error; the Cost of Living Report does no such thing.  It is just as well we should understand that the Cost of Living Report does not purport to do any such thing.  It only shows the rate of increase in prices between the years 1914 and 1922 of certain groups of articles, but I believe it is desirable we should have some indication from an authoritative body of what is necessary for a reasonable standard of comfort for a family in this country.  Inquiries of that kind have been made by amateurs, by groups in different parts of the country, by individuals in Dublin and Cork, and by authoritative inquirers (of course not authoritative in the sense that they were officials), but very valuable private inquiries were made in England a few years ago.  It is desirable that an inquiry should be made in Ireland as to the cost of maintaining a reasonable standard of life by a workman according to some conceptions of civilised decency, and very much depends on the result of such an inquiry. Such an inquiry, in my view, should be conducted partly on the basis of medical expert knowledge of the physiological requirements, and by sociologists, who would be able to understand what are the requirements of decent existence.  I have no doubt that the Army, for instance, has by a rule of thumb, or by a more scientific method, fixed in its mind a standard of food requirements for its soldiers.  It would be interesting to know the retail cost of such a ration to-day.  The ration as I have found of the British Army would cost at retail prices to-day 18/5.  I do not know what the ration of the Irish Army at retail prices would cost to-day. I imagine from what I have heard that it is rather more liberal than that provided to the British soldier, yet I can <Col N="1508" /> imagine it is not too liberal, and, again, I imagine that the carter who is doing hard work is equally entitled to that quality of ration, and his family is entitled to something approximating to it, commensurate with the amount of physical labour they are engaged in.  We have something like a scientific ration, I suppose, established in the workhouses. I happen to have been able to obtain a ration scale that would be provided to an adult pauper inmate and four young children. These inmates do some little labour, I think they are known as pauper inmate attendants.  They are given a little more than the ordinary pauper inmate, who is not doing any work at all, and the particular ration for that family would cost at to-day's price £1 12s. Od., or just 1½d. less than that.</P>

They are doing no arduous work of course, and this ration does not include any luxuries, no butter, for instance, and a comparatively small amount of meat, quite a bare ration.  Now, these are not, perhaps, scientific, but they do indicate what in the minds of the people who fixed these rations was requisite for the particular class of citizen, a soldier, on the one hand, and the workhouse inmate on the other hand.  For an officer in the workhouse&mdash;I am speaking now of Belfast workhouse&mdash;the pre-war ration that was allowed to an officer, who would be considered, perhaps, fairly comparable with the workman outside, is valued at 15/9.  Now we have the right to assume, in basing anything in the way of wages upon prices, the family as a unit.  I ask if any member will dispute that proposition, that in considering wages you have to consider the family as a unit.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Gorey and his friends would be with me entirely in desiring that there should be some kind of authoritative exposition of what was a reasonable minimum standard of life for a man in this country.  If such were set forth, with something like official backing, it would enable farmers, traders, merchants, manufacturers and workers to have some solid basis from which to begin their bargaining.  I suggest also, that it would go a long way towards meeting some of the problems that are indicated in this particular resolution.  If all families in this country were provided with a ration which physiologists would reckon as requisite to their healthy sustenance and decent comfort, the market for farmers' produce in this country would be immensely increased, and we would get over much of the difficulty of finding a suitable market. I submit in support of the proposition to appoint such a Committee, that it should have terms of reference pretty wide to enquire into these two things.  Perhaps two Committees would be requisite, but at any rate, in view of the terms of the proposition, I say that a Committee to inquire into what is necessary to maintain a reasonable standard of life, apart from prices altogether, what is requisite in the way of commodities, and then an additional enquiry into the profiteering side of the proposal, to find out where the great difference comes in between the sum of money obtained by the producer and the price which the consumer has to pay.  I believe that if that is done, and is done carefully with official sanction, it would go a long way towards the solving of many problems that are likely to affect us within the next year or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the proposition of Deputy Figgis. Wherever we turn, we see that the price of raw materials as produced in Ireland, or anything produced in Ireland, whether foodstuffs or other necessities of life, are down below 1914 prices.  If we ask for the finished article, whether it be food, clothes, or anything else, we find that it is over 100 p.c. dearer to-day than it was in 1914.  Deputy Johnson has drawn a parallel between the price of barley and the price of drink.  He is quite right.  Barley to-day is something <Col N="1510" /> to set us thinking.  There are about 1,600,000 to 1,800,000 barrels of barley estimated as the crop in Ireland this year.  We can find a market in Ireland for not more than 600,000.  There will be anything between a million and 1,200,000 barrels of Irish barley for which a market cannot be found as a brewing article, and that will have to be used as a foodstuff or something else. We still see &ldquo;the trade,&rdquo; as we heard yesterday, I think it was, with balance sheets containing enormous profits that are made on a vastly decreased output. I understand&mdash;I do not know how true the figures are&mdash;that in the big brewery firm in this city, where they used to have 22 brews in the week, they can now do with five, and still their balance sheet is maintained.  We understand they have a supply in their stores and in the malt of enough grain for 17 months.  That is the position as regards to the growers of barley.  With regard to the price of drink, and I am in the same boat as Deputy Johnson, I never drink, and I do not know what the price is.</P>

      <P>Some things I am caught in, but very seldom.  Now, what of the wholesale price of potatoes.  I am quite confident that potatoes this year will be sold at anything from 7s. to 10s. per barrel of 20 stone, down the country. I do not know what price they are likely to fetch retail, in Dublin or elsewhere, but in the country we have had a good crop of potatoes, and I understand&mdash;and I do not think I will be wrong&mdash;that 10s. would be about the price wholesale, or 6d. per stone.  That is, that 6d. will be our price, but I do not think we shall reach it.  Wheat is at present 22s. 6d. per barrel for corn that is suitable for grinding, but a considerable proportion, a heavy proportion of the wheat will not be fit for bread.  That portion that is fit will fetch about 22/6 for 20 st.  The general public are better judges of the price of bread than I am.  I do not know what it is.  We never buy bread in our house; we always make our own, and eat it.  Vegetables and fruit&mdash;we know the prices they are fetching wholesale.  We know the price that a barrel of grapes or a barrel of apples fetches in the country.  If you <Col N="1511" /> go into a retailer here the price that will be asked will astonish you.  Go into a draper&mdash;and now I come to a question we ought to know about.  I am speaking from experience of the last two months.  I went into a friend of mine for a suit of clothes, and he named £7 15s. Od. as the price.  I said I could get them much cheaper in Dublin, or in England, if I happened to be there. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can send that to Leeds and get it made, and it would come back and only cost £4 15s. Od.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Now, it strikes us all, and the poor people more particularly, this system of curtailing output, of making one suit of clothes in the week and making no more.  I hope this inquiry will take in the whole aspect of the case.  There is blame all round, and I hope they will not be afraid to apportion the blame all round.  Everybody knows the price of wool, or ought to know it.  For two years we have been unable to sell wool and we could not get 2d. per pound on it, and could not sell it at any price. To-day, we are getting about 6d. per lb. and no more, for the majority of Irish wool.  That is the position of the country. Hides for making boots could scarcely find a market for the last two years.  Beef&mdash;and I regret to say that very little of our good beef raised in Ireland is ever eaten in Ireland, at least in the parts of the provinces that I know, a young beast is scarcely ever killed.  Nothing dies there in youth and innocence; they nearly all die of old age.  Still, the price that you are asked for this article will astonish you.  I have known contracts put in within the last three months&mdash;and they ought to be within the knowledge of the Commander-in Chief, because they come under his department&mdash;at 5¾d. and 6d. a pound. They are the contracts in the barracks. Yet you will be asked over the counter for 1s. 3d. and 1s. 4d., and perhaps in some places in Dublin 1s. 10d. a pound for the same article.  The same would apply to milk.  I want you sensible people in the Dáil to take a look round. Wherever you see wasps and flies, you may always be sure there is honey about, and where you see a big element <Col N="1512" /> of the community taking up a particular line for the purpose of making a living. you will always find that big profits are to be made there.  For instance, look at the number of people who have taken up the publichouse business, and the greengrocers' business.  There must be money there.  Milk vending is getting very fashionable in Dublin at present.  If ever there was an inquiry needed, it is an inquiry over this matter.  I hope it will lead to something; it ought to lead to something.  I do not wonder at the poor people rising up in rebellion, or at the farming community rising up.  I have given you a list of the wholesale prices at which they are selling the product of tillage.  We were faced with the silly proposition, a few weeks ago, of compulsory tillage.  I do not wonder at the farmers of Ireland rising up in rebellion, or the poor people rising up in rebellion.  Something is radically wrong, and I hope this Committee will remedy it.</P>

      <P>I am at a disadvantage, because I was not present at the opening of the discussion.  I had intended to speak to the motion, and to support Deputy Figgis' resolution, because I think anything that the Government are able to do should be done to bring down the cost of living.  I see great difficulties, however, before them. If it were possible to arrange in two parallel lines the actual cost to the producer and the actual cost to the consumer, it would be fairly easy to fix a fair and equitable percentage that the retailer or distributor should seek or should gain.  Deputy Figgis' resolution frightened me when I read it first, because I did not know what he meant to cover by the words, &ldquo;commodities necessary to livelihood.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson has already alluded, to some extent, to that. One man is not content, or would not think he could live, unless he had his bottle of stout; another man cannot digest his dinner unless he gets a glass of whiskey; other people say they cannot live unless they are clothed; others cannot live through the winter without a fire.  All these things have to be considered.  On one occasion I attended a little girl in hospital and I produced for her consumption all the most elegant articles of food I could command, but she was not content <Col N="1513" /> and expressed a desire to get home.  I asked her why she wanted to go home and why she would not eat the grand things I had provided for her, and she replied she wanted pig's cheek and cabbage. As Deputy Johnson has pointed out to us the thing for the Government to determine upon is, what are the articles most commonly in use.  I am going to take the question of bread, and I am going to show the difficulty there would be in determining whether the producer would receive a proper profit, and whether the retailer or distributor also received his profit.  We all admit that bread is probably the most important of the ordinary articles of food. Bread was brought down about a fortnight ago to 5¼d. for the two-pound loaf; in Belfast the two-pound loaf is 5d. That means that on each sack of flour. of 280 lbs., the master baker in Dublin is making a profit of 3s. 9d. over what the master bakers in Belfast are making. Why should this be so?  I do not know; I am told it is because the cost of labour is greater in Dublin than in Belfast.  If that be so, I take it that is a fair answer to the question.  I go a little closer to the subject and tell you the actual amount paid by the consumer of the loaves baked from each sack of flour of 280 lbs.  The actual amount paid is £3 18s. 9d.  I do not know what the master baker pays for his flour; it may be possibly around £2 per sack.  If it be that, then the question is, is the £1 18s. 9d. too much profit for the master baker to ask in respect of his premises, his machinery, his labour, and in respect of the men who distribute the bread throughout the city.  These are points upon which this Committee would be freely entitled to make enquiry. I admire, and have admired at all meetings of the Dáil, the great dignity and restraint with which Deputy Johnson has dealt with matters upon which he felt very deeply.  When I come to the question of milk, I think I will find it extremely hard to keep myself from saying things that had better perhaps not be said.  After bread, milk is the most important article of food.  It is the most important article of food as far as children are concerned.  What is the position of affairs in Dublin to-day?  A dairyman with a most excellent stable of cows, everything clean and everything done so that it could be inspected by anyone, <Col N="1514" /> has a contract with one of the largest hospitals in Dublin.  The contract price is 1s. 6d. per gallon, or 4½d. per quart. In the summer time if he is able to give the milk at less he reduces the price, or else gives extra quantity.  That man is not selling his milk through the city. He is content, and is well off, with the profit on 1s. 6d. per gallon.  But what is the state of affairs?  I am paying 8d. per quart for milk, or 2s. 8d. per gallon. A great number of these men&mdash;I think Deputy Gorey has alluded to the matter &mdash;are getting milk from the country farmers.  What are they paying?  1s. 2d. a gallon, I take it.  They have the effrontery to charge the poor people in the city, myself included, 2s. 8d. a gallon, or 8d. a quart.  That is preposterous&mdash;quite preposterous.  In addition to that, they are not satisfied.  They add Vartry water, or sometimes dirty water.  In some cases it is not even Vartry water, and they charge 8d. a quart for the Vartry water or the dirty water that they get out of their taps.  I think the question of milk is one of the most important things the Government should enquire into.  I now come to the question of potatoes.  I have no objection, in the wide world, to the man who distributes the potatoes getting a fair and decent profit for the work he puts in, in the distributing of them, and where potatoes are bought from a farmer at sixpence per stone and sold at nine-pence per stone, I do not object to that. It is too much certainly, but it is not an extravagant profit, but we find that the farmer has only received fourpence for the potatoes for which we are asked to pay tenpence.  I was recently paying one shilling per stone for any potatoes that were brought into my house.  For these, the producer is not getting more than sixpence at the outside.  I now come to deal with articles of a perishable nature, such as fruit, fish, etc., and I shall say a word about cabbage in a moment.  With regard to fruit here is an illustration of exorbitant prices: Forty pounds of raspberries were, this summer, sent to my house from a farm near Drogheda; no price was fixed; it was left to the farmer, who was not asked to make any reduction.  The price in the shops at that time was 2s. 6d. per pound. When the bill came to my house, 10½d. was the charge made by the lady who had the option of fixing her own price and the cost of carriage on those raspberries <Col N="1515" /> amounted only to something like 3/4d. per pound, so that we had the raspberries at 11¼d. per pound, whereas we would have had to pay 2/6 in the shop for them.  Of course I grant a margin for perishable articles of that kind, but I am going to make a charge, a serious charge, here, that certain dealers would prefer to let their fruit or fish rot, rather than sell them at cheap rates, which might bring down the price of those articles.  Some time ago I was amazed to see, in the Castleknock district, a six-acre field of cabbage with sheep turned in on it.  I made it my business to go to the man who owned these six acres of cabbage, and I said to him, &ldquo;What, in the name of goodness, are your sheep in this field for?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;They are there because it would not pay me to send in my horses and men to bring the cabbage to the Dublin Markets.  I would not get enough for the cabbage to pay for the wages of my men and the feeding of my horses.&rdquo;  And, accordingly, his sheep were turned into this field of beautiful cabbage.  I want to say, in passing, that cabbage and green vegetables are most essential articles of food.  Now, to come to another matter, for twenty years I lectured in foodstuffs to the Jubilee Nurses, and it was my object, in these lectures, to point out to the Nurses how they could provide or get the cheapest and most nourishing articles of food to represent the least cost.  That is, they were to pay as little as possible for the articles that would be of nourishment to their patients.  Again, I want to make it quite clear, that nobody objects to a reasonable profit coming to a distributor or retailer, but in many cases there is no question about it that the amount of profit claimed is far too great.  The manager of a respectable grocery firm, here told me that his general turnover was twelve per cent., and that occasionally it might amount to fifteen per cent. I do not think anybody here would object to a turnover of twelve or fifteen per cent. on a grocery business.  I trust the Ministers will see their way to accept this resolution and appoint a Committee, because I think nothing but good can come out of it.  I would have alluded to certain other things, but as Deputy Johnson has referred to those points himself, I thought it was unnecessary for me again to refer to them.</P>

      <P>If the statements, or the evidence, rather, of profiteering that have been put forward by Deputies who have already spoken, particularly Deputies Gorey and Sir James Craig, were to be taken as evidence by this Committee which I trust will be set up, then I think that the Committee, if appointed, this evening, could come to a conclusion before midnight.  They would easily be able to place the responsibility for this scandalous profiteering upon the proper shoulders. I think the Deputies will agree that the average worker and middle class person of the cities and towns of this country, and particularly of Dublin, have had a considerable amount of patience in putting up with profiteering in this country for the last four or five years.  If ever a revolution were justified against any section of the people I think it would be justified against those who are carrying on profiteering in the country at the present time.  The President here this evening stated&mdash;and I agree with him, though I think it is unfortunate to have to do so&mdash;that human life in this country is very cheap.  Personally, I would far rather see a human being shot than to see him die of starvation.  It is a horrible thing to contemplate the condition of persons in the slums of Ireland, and particularly in those of Dublin, with its high rents, when they have to face the fact of having to find a sufficiency of the necessaries of life to keep body and soul together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as in your own area, I dare say.  Deputy Gorey, I am sure, is more interested in the price of barley than perhaps any of us that are on those benches, but I think it is only quite right to draw his attention, and the attention of the Members of the Dáil, to the fact that the price of barley three years ago was fifty shillings per barrel.  To-day, as soon as it may be fixed, the price perhaps will be 20s. per barrel.  I suppose it will be fixed.  Notwithstanding the fact that there has been such a reduction from fifty to an average of twenty shillings, still the cost of working that particular commodity is the same as it was three <Col N="1517" /> years ago.  I can quite see it does not affect Deputy Gorey personally, as he, apparently, is the representative of &ldquo;Pussyfoot&rdquo; Johnson in this Dáil. I know myself in the country at the present time the small farmer or poor person who has eggs or butter or such other produce to sell in a local town can only get in the case of eggs 1s. 6d. per dozen; but come up to Dublin and you find that the consumer in Dublin at present is paying both for himself and his family, in the case of eggs, I understand, 3s. per dozen, or in or about that figure.  I know very well the experience I have had going about different towns in England, and I quite agree with Deputy Figgis that it is possible and in all cases you will find that produce such as eggs and butter and such as that produced in this country can be bought cheaper by the Irishman in England than they can be bought by the Irishman in Dublin or Cork or any of those towns.  I think the Dáil will agree that if this is the case, the time has arrived when some Government must put a stop to it. I know myself it may be said that the cause is preferential through rates.  I know cases in the railways where in the case of eggs and butter and things of that kind the railway companies give preferential through rates so that the Irish products can be exported to England and thus enable Irish people to feed the hungry English people at the expense of the Irishman.  Now a lot has been said in the Dáil this evening with regard to the high cost of living to-day, being due largely to the high cost of labour.  If Members of the Dáil will carry their minds back to the beginning of the War in 1914, and to the years 1915 and 1916, they will find that before the workers got any rise in wages, prices had soared up at that time so that in that particular period the high cost of commodities had no relation to the high cost of labour, at that particular time at any rate.  Now I have seen the Mountjoy Menu Card posted up in the city, I suppose at the expense of the Government. But if the Mountjoy Menu Card is a correct interpretation of what prisoners are getting in Mountjoy, I say that at least the worker in this country should have the same consideration, assuming he is prepared to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  But if I can reason out that Menu Card <Col N="1518" /> rightly, I say that the average worker in the towns at the present time cannot get the equivalent in his own house of what the Mountjoy Menu Card gives the prisoners.  I believe that if this Committee is set up, and if it gives a decision upon evidence such as we have heard here in the Dáil this evening, its findings will go a long way to solve the industrial troubles that we have been suffering from in this country for the past two or three years.  Deputy Sir James Craig referred to the question of milk, and in dealing with the case of milk at the present time, he dealt particularly with the cost from the point of view of the dairyman who has a certain number of cows.  Now, we all know that in the city of Dublin there are a certain number of dairymen who have no cows at all.  In cases of that kind they get milk up from the country at the rate of 1s. 2d. per gallon, to which is to be added 1d. per gallon to cover railway charges.  And this milk, as we see, is sold to the consumer at 8d. per quart. I think there is some mistake in that particular figure, as far as the charge to the consumer is concerned.  Deputy Gorey has referred you to the fact, I hope it is not true, but I am told that something on the lines that have been said, is about to happen&mdash;that there is a surplus supply of barley in this country at present.  Notwithstanding that, we find that Guinness is importing a lot of foreign barley and Indian corn.  Now, I don't know whether the Irish people are prepared to allow foreign barley to come into this country and be manufactured into other products, while at the same time Guinness refuses to buy Irish corn.</P>

      <P>Shilim go bhfuil a lán de'n gceart ins san abhar rún so, os comhár na Dála.  It seems to me that the Resolution put before the Dáil by Deputy Figgis is one that should commend itself to the Government. I do not think there is anything that is more urgent than this question. We have on the one side the case made on the part of the producer of commodities that he is unable to obtain a price that will enable him to produce, and on the part of the consumer that he is not able to afford the price he has to pay.  Between these two agencies&mdash;the producer on the one side and the consumer on the other&mdash;we have the middle-men.  All these grievances of which we have heard are to my mind attributable to the middle-men.  I think both these parties have grievances, and I think they are about equal on each side.  The real party to blame is the intermediary or middle-man and undoubtedly the circumstances that prevail and that prevailed during the recent big war have enabled the middle-men to take advantage both of the consumer and of the producer.  That is largely the cause of the trouble we have at the present time.  Now I think the <Col N="1520" /> argument is worthy of being advanced that there are too many middle-men. The number of people operating between the consumer and producer is far too large in proportion to the need we have here in this country.  And I think that when the terms of reference of this Committee are fixed there should be an Article put in to consider whether something cannot be done to mitigate the harm done by the middle-men and reduce as far as possible the number of middle-men; or at least make it impossible for the same number to operate so that it would not be possible for so large an amount of money to be lost between the producer and the consumer.  The terms of reference set out here by the proposer are, first to set forth a list of commodities necessary to livelihood, second, to enquire into the prices available for such articles or commodities to the producer, third, to enquire into the prices paid for such articles by the consumer, fourth to report if there be any undue disproportion between these two scales of prices, and fifth, if so, to recommend measures to be taken to end that disproportion.  Now that is the proposal he wishes to put before this Committee as far as I can see.  Deputies here denounced certain commodities that are creating an extraordinary amount of unrest and an extraordinary amount of friction.  These are not necessary to livelihood, I suppose, although with the working population they are almost indispensable.  One cannot wonder at that, because the working classes have not many varieties of recreation to fall back upon, and if they fall back upon these, we must admit that they are entitled to some little amusement in a life which is largely made up of hardship and exertion.  Anyone could admit this without admitting or approving for a moment of these things being used to excess.  I am strongly against the abuse of any of these privileges, and I think at the present time they are fairly taxed for the use of such privileges.  I do not think there is any reason why they should be so taxed, because I do not think that the cost of the production of these commodities could account for the charges made for them.  Of course, this Government, as well as the British Government, naturally step in and take <Col N="1521" /> as much as they can, and of course it is the only material commodity on which they can get a huge revenue.  But if the people understand that they are paying revenue, they are at least entitled to get the advantage of reasonable prices.  They are the people who are doing the work of the nation, and they are entitled to see that a Committee, or somebody else who understands these things, should consider them.  The people who have to pay taxes in this country are too heavily taxed, and some method should be found of giving them reasonable relief.  This is not an immediate demand; it is a motion to inquire into the price paid for these commodities; and the Committee, if appointed, must take these things in hand and try to find for this country some sort of reasonable standard by which they can measure whether the intermediary is complying with the needs of the nation or not, or whether he is accepting only what he can collect and whether he is charging too much for the commodities which he sells.  Deputy Johnson gave us figures with regard to other standards of life.  He gave us the Army standard as 18/5 and the workers' standard 32/- per week, and the officers' rations at 15/9 per day.  All these were based upon some accounts or estimates, and of course it depends upon the particular commodities that these particular individuals are regarded as entitled to indulge in.  If these were standardised there would be nothing unusual in such figures.  They would give us the idea of what could be done.  Now, Deputy Gorey talks about the prices in pre-war days, in 1914, for raw material as being 100 per cent. higher to-day compared with that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It comes practically to this, that in every important material the prices are considerably up, and particularly in regard to foodstuffs. <Col N="1522" /> The price of barley cannot be so easily controlled and regulated.  Barley must be grown upon speculation; the growing of barley is merely a gamble against the possibility of barley being required, and it is not required as a general article of consumption.  Deputy Gorey talks about reduced output and about Guinness brews being reduced from 20 to 5 brews per week, while the profits are the same, and we hear that potatoes produced at from 7/- to 10/- per barrel fetched twice that price in the city.  Sir James Craig spoke of the price of bread and milk, and that the people who sold them were sweeping in excessive profits.  I take it that their turnover must be very small if they have to charge such prices or otherwise perhaps enable them to get very heavy profits, but this is because there are far too many of these middle-men in the business. The remedy is to eliminate, by making the game unprofitable, as many as possible out of the business, and also that a standard of profit must be fixed if we are to get through this difficulty at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. WILSON Mr. R. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to this discussion with much interest, and I would like to remove what I consider to be a false impression about profiteering in connection with milk supplies.  I am a milk supplier, and I know that milk is not being retailed at 2/8 per gallon. Milk so retailed is the milk that comes from the country.  If you go into the poorer districts you will get milk at 4d. per quart.  At the present time it is 8d. per quart, or 2/8 per gallon, because prices have gone up.  The supplier has 8d. on the gallon of milk.  That is not an excessive profit because a man has to live and pay his men, and he has to pay his labour.  As regards the milk Sir James Craig speaks of, that is milk delivered in suburban districts, where a man has to employ a horse and cart, and people cannot expect milk delivered in that way for less than 7d. or 8d. per quart.  With regard to bread prices in the country they are based upon the prices in the city, and I have always contended that the prices in the city are due to the excessive prices paid to the bakers for making the bread. I wish to point out that in London and South Wales that the two-pound loaf is sold for a considerable period past for 4d. <Col N="1523" /> and if you inquire, you will find the reason is that the men in England are satisfied to work a 54-hour week for 70/-, while in Dublin the bakers must get 90/- for a 42-hour week.  Bread costs a penny per loaf more to make in Dublin than in England, and the fact is you cannot have it both ways.  You cannot have cheap bread and high wages.  Then with regard to dear house rent, I have in my time got a considerable number of bricks laid, and I find now that you will have to pay 14/- to 16/- for the laying of 280 bricks, which is nearly ½d. per brick.  You cannot have cheap houses if you have to pay at that rate for the laying of bricks.  These things will be inside the scope of the Commission that you may appoint.  It was made plain by a trades union, which is the bug-bear of the farmers, that the wages paid to the Dublin dockers exceeded the wages paid in any other part of this country.  How can you have cheap living which is to be based upon such a standard of wages, and these are the men who when we thought to get proper prices for our bacon and our pigs refused to give us an opportunity to get proper prices for the bacon at a time when they were getting 16/- per day themselves. As regards the middle men, you cannot interfere with trade competition.  Competition is the life of trade, and you must leave the middlemen as they are when very likely they will eliminate one another, but do not interfere with their trade.  I am against forcing the farmers to till, and I am against forcing people to go to business.  Any such course is the limitation of the liberty of the subject, and it could not be tolerated. With these remarks I may say I am quite satisfied to wait for any result that will come out of the appointment or institution of a Committee of this kind.  I hope the Ministry will give their assent to its appointment, and I support the motion that this Committee should be set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this motion, while being one dealing with a very vital question, is not sufficiently comprehensive.  It merely deals with the cost of living.  There are other things of very great importance besides the cost of living.  For instance, the cost of dying is really a very expensive item, to the poor people who have to go to the undertaker, and I take it that it is a matter <Col N="1524" /> that deserves consideration.  The average case probably among the poor people is when a death occurs the relatives have to make a collection to defray the cost of the funeral. In that respect I feel the title ought to be amended so as to read the &ldquo;Cost of Living and Dying Committee.&rdquo;  It is not a matter for jest at all. It is a very, very serious matter for the poor people who have to defray the heavy cost of the undertaker's charges. There is another matter that I have not heard any reference made to, though I have been here for the whole of the discussion; it is the cost of living in hotels, a very important matter for homeless people, like a good many members of this Assembly, when they come to Dublin.  They have to resort to places like hotels, and they have to meet the cost of hotels.  There is also the cost of dining in restaurants.  I believe it is suggested that there has been a reduction in the cost of living in the past few years, but I have not found any reduction whatever in the charges of either hotels or restaurants for a very considerable time.  In fact, I think they are rather on the increase than otherwise. These are things that a Committee of this Dáil ought to consider, because I am sure there is hardly a member of this Assembly but has had experience of what appears to be the exorbitant charges in both those establishment. There are, of course, many things that ought to be taken into consideration.  I am sure there are many members of this Dáil who occasionally experience&mdash;I do not know whether they enjoy it&mdash;a ride in a taxi.  That is a very expensive mode of locomotion, but sometimes a very necessary one.  They ought to consider this matter, because it enters into-the cost of living, as any expenses that a man incurs certainly enter into what is the standard of living, as the standard of his life is not so much measured by what he receives as what his expenses are.  There is another illustration, though I am sure it causes no anxiety to the mover of the resolution; that is the cost of shaving and hair-cutting.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he is not interested in that, inasmuch as I understand he occasionally gets a free shave. <Col N="1525" /> I am saying this merely to indicate that the cost of living, and the investigation of it, is not merely the investigation into what are essential articles for maintaining existence, but what is the average outlay or expenditure for the average man or woman in a general way of life.  If this Committee does investigate this, if it is going to arrive at a standard which is not what may be called a pauper standard, but the standard of real existence, it ought to take into consideration not merely the commodities that are essential to livelihood, but the various expenses that are common to the life of the average man or woman in the community.</P>

      <P>As I explained on the last day, this matter was under the consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Before coming to that part I would like to deal with a couple of statements of some of the figures that have been mentioned.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking that there was one item mentioned by Deputy Davin which I have a very particular interest in, that is housing.  I think it is right to say the Government will not be in a position to subsidise <Col N="1526" /> housing to anything like the extent to which it is subsidising it this year next year.  The Revenue will not permit it, and when you take into consideration the sum allowed&mdash;£750&mdash;for a house, as against £200 pre-war, I think it will be realised there is some profiteering at any rate in that particular line of business. If a house which cost £200 pre-war now costs £750 I think it is fair to assume the rent might reasonably be expected to be 3½ times the amount.  I think it is not that.  This motion of Deputy Figgis does not, in the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, meet the situation.  It deals with a comparison between food stuffs being produced in Ireland and saleable at a cheaper rate in England, and it then goes on to say having regard to the general fall, that that fall in prices to the producer has not been accompanied by a similar fall to the consumer.  It then deals with the disproportions as being the cause of much discontent, and it moves that a Cost of Living Committee be appointed. It then sets out terms of reference. I do not think the terms of reference set out there can possibly meet the views that have been expressed here in the debate on this cost of living.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have discussed this matter, and it appears to him that this particular resolution was not sufficiently exhaustive to deal with the situation.  I read a very long report from the Minister last week.  Unfortunately, he is not well this week, and will not be in for a few days.  I think he has not yet completed the terms of the motion he intends to bring before the Dáil, and, of course, if this particular motion be passed, there will be no necessity for it, as you will be cutting across the line.  This is what he suggests:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whereas in certain places and districts the retail prices of the commodities specified in the Official Report on the Cost of Living are substantially in excess of the average retail prices of the same commodities as determined in the said Official Report;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And whereas in certain places and districts the increase in the retail prices of the said commodities as compared with the retail prices in July, 1914, is substantially in excess of the average increase for the same commodities as determined in the said Official Report;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" />&ldquo;And whereas it is desirable, in the opinion of this Dáil, that the causes of such excess should be investigated;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas in certain places and districts the increase in the retail prices of beer, porter, stout, spirits, and other beverages, as compared with the retail prices of the same commodities in July, 1914, should, in the opinion of this Dáil, also be investigated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, this Dáil doth approve and determine that the Minister of Industry and Commerce may, in any place or district, appoint a Commission, to be known as a Commission on Prices, to enquire into and report as to the matters aforesaid, and in any case in which, in the opinion of a Commission, the current retail prices are unreasonable, to make such recommendations as the Commission may think fit.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And this Dáil doth hereby order that all persons having any knowledge of the subject matter of any such inquiry shall, if so required by a Commission on Prices, furnish to the Commission such particulars as the Commission may determine to be relevant to the inquiry.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any reports made to the Minister of Industry and Commerce by a Commission on Prices shall be laid as soon as may be before this Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is as far as he has got.  I am not proposing that; it is a suggested motion he intended to bring before the Dáil.  It may not perhaps exhaust the subject in the light of the debate, but at any rate I think it is clear that it does get more closely to what members have in their minds than the resolution, and that it perhaps deals with some instances that were mentioned.  If my recollection is correct, Deputy Figgis on the last day explained that in some districts very much larger prices were paid in one street than in a corresponding street in the same area, and so on.  As I explained, these terms of reference are not yet fully approved of by the Minister. The suggested Committee, I presume, would be a Committee of the Dáil, but it does not say so.  It would be a Committee either of Civil Servants or half Civil Servants and half of the House, and so mixed up.  At any rate, the machinery for dealing with this is at present in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  It is obviously the place from which such inquiries should be <Col N="1528" /> made.  I do not think the real purpose intended, then, by Deputy Figgis would be achieved if this particular resolution was passed, and if the Committee was restricted to the terms of reference here. If I recollect, Deputy Johnson went outside the terms of reference.  I do not know whether he meant in going outside the terms of reference that he meant what he said to be included in the terms of reference.  Certainly it has not been included, and it would not meet the object he has in mind. I would like Deputy McGoldrick to know that, as far as the revenue on the particular articles to which he referred is concerned, I have to warn him to keep his hands off.  If he takes away that revenue from the Government there will be very little to fall back on, and we will not be able to carry on the ordinary administration.  I would ask the Dáil to allow the motion to be withdrawn until the Minister for Commerce brings up his particular report or suspend it until then, and if his recommendation does not meet with approval, the motion of Mr. Darrell Figgis could be taken as an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like just briefly, without delaying the Dáil, to touch on one or two matters that had not come before the Dáil on the practical suggestion that has been made by the President.  There has been, I think, practically for the first time since we met here more unanimity than usual, and it is very satisfactory to have contributed towards creating it. I want to touch upon the actual wording which was rather carefully thought out, and was thought out in reference not merely to inquiries at the present moment but inquiries that have preceded in which Deputy Johnson and myself were associated.  I think it very necessary <Col N="1529" /> whatever is done in the future regarding the appointment of any committee that there should be a statement made as to what are the commodities necessary to livelihood.  It is because I had not noticed that in the terms stated by the President that I do not think his motion in that respect would quite meet the case.  I think there are certain other articles that are not absolutely necessary to livelihood that might be attached to the general list.  These are small matters of detail, however.  It is a very serious state of affairs that you have in Ireland at the present moment, a number of people sending to Manchester, Liverpool and London for Irish articles.  With regard to the suggestion made by the President I urge him to consider this, and I will be very glad to give any assistance I can to the Minister of Trade on this matter.  I do not think that local committees will meet the case.  I agree they are necessary <Col N="1530" /> in addition to the central committee, but they will not meet the case because we have had in the past eighteen months or two years local profiteering committees that have been contributed to by the very people to whom a great deal of the trouble is very largely due.  I do not say that they are actually profiteering, but I do say that if there is profiteering they are the persons against whom the offences are alleged and therefore you cannot have them on your jury as they are the people who might be ultimately found in the dock.</P>
