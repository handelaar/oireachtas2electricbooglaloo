      <P>I desire to make a few remarks on the report. Looking for a little bit of information I would like to ask if the Local Government Department would inform us whether any progress has been made with the allocation of the £25,000 which has been placed at the disposal of the Director of White Cross for relief of distress in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>With reference to the amalgamation Scheme which is mentioned on page three, I have received a certain amount of complaints from different parts of the country to the effect that the Amalgamation Scheme inflicts a good deal of hardship upon the very poor.  I cannot quite recollect whether the Commission which was appointed to review the whole question of Local Government in the autumn of 1920 recommended that amalgamation be carried to the extent to which it has been carried.  As well as I recollect, the Amalgamation Scheme then proposed did create certain economies, and as a result of the Amalgamation Scheme which has been carried out a great number of workhouses have been abolished; not merely that but district hospitals have been closed up, with the result that people have to travel very long distances in the event of illness, in order to be attended to, and recollecting that telephonic and telegraphic communications are very poor in the country, and that it is not always possible to get a motor car, it is a hardship upon some people.  I am not mentioning this in any critical spirit but I would like that the Minister and his advisors would look seriously into this and see if nothing could be done to have district hospitals continued in various parts of rural places, so that poor people would have to suffer as little as possible from the closing of workhouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the non-payment of rates by different local bodies and the audits, I would like if the Minister could inform us whether the reports, generally speaking, that the auditors made upon the working of the public bodies were <Col N="373" /> good or bad, or did any report show that any of the officials or Councils, in spite of the tremendous difficulties in which public bodies had worked for the past couple of years, really failed in their duty to the people who elected them?</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised at the attitude that the Minister for Local Government takes up towards the Mayo County Council, in view of his statement in the very first paragraph of his report which reads: &ldquo;The attention of Dáil Éireann has been directed in earlier reports of the Local Government Department.&rdquo;  I regret the attitude which he and his Inspectors had to take against the Mayo County Council.  I will not say that the Mayo County Council were blameless in the matter, but the action that he has taken in preventing the Mayo County Council from having a certain amount of money at their disposal is really not hitting the Mayo County Council at all, but the people of Mayo. I would like, if some understanding could be come to between the Minister for Local Government and the Mayo County Council by which the Mayo County Council could be punished and not the people of the County Mayo.</P>

      <P>I just wish to raise a point on the report; it is in connection with the question of the appointment of rate-collectors by the Dublin County Council.  I raise it in the hope that the Local Government Department will refuse to sanction the appointments made.  When the old rate-collectors refused to work during the war, a number of men with good national records were appointed who took the risk.  One man collected over 98 per. cent of the rates, and another man collected over 95 per cent. of his warrants.  A short while ago an advertisement was inserted for new rate-collectors and the men who gave their services during the war were turned out and new men appointed.  I do not think that is fair.  I do hope that the Local Government Department will refuse to sanction the appointment of these new men.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this report is the fact that in reading it one would think that there was no such thing as the Counties of Down, Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh, and Derry, in Ireland. There are numbers of public local bodies there which at the request of this assembly pledged their allegiance to the Irish Republic and for a considerable period of time, under great difficulties, recognised the Local Government Department of this Dáil as the proper supervisory body.  Recently some of those public bodies have been dissolved.  Some are threatened with dissolution, and in many cases members of them have been compelled to take refuge elsewhere in Ireland than in the six county area, and all this, of course, has the effect of raising the partitionist measure.  One would have thought from the report of the Minister for Local Government that whether the Republicans in the north wished it or not he had decided that Partition was going to be recognised, because those bodies now are labouring under much greater difficulties than even the public bodies in the rest of Ireland laboured under in the recent war in the country.  There is absolutely no mention made in the report of the position of those bodies and no measures are foreshadowed by which they should be assisted.  Now, that was not done inadvertently.  It was not due to the fact that the Minister did not know that the position in the north was not as grave as it is represented, because a very short time ago he received a deputation from the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen and other representatives of these bodies, in which they placed their position before him.  At that meeting, I understand, they asked him for advice and guidance and he refused to give either, and they asked him if upon his own responsibility he would refuse to bring this matter before the Dáil and the Cabinet.  I understand from the memorandum sent by the members of that Deputation that the Minister for Local Government did not think this matter serious enough to bring before the Cabinet of Dáil Éireann, and did not think it of sufficient gravity to mention it here.  Further, I took it upon myself to mention the matter here and ask what assistance he is going to give them and enable them to pledge their obedience to this Dáil and what steps he proposed to take in order to protect them in doing so.</P>

      <P>This question of the dismissal of rate-collectors will affect more Councils than the Dublin County Council.  It should not happen <Col N="374" /> in Dublin and elsewhere.  I would like to know if the rate-collectors who came in and collected the rates during the war, at the risk of life and liberty, are to be dismissed all over Ireland.  I do not think this should be.</P>
      <P>There has been reference made by Deputy Art O'Connor to the Amalgamation Scheme so far as it affects hospitals.  It has not been proved satisfactory.  We should have a guarantee that ambulances in which people are taken to the County Hospital should be utilised to fetch back the dead bodies.  There is the difficulty of getting the relatives of patients long distances to the County Hospital to see the sick.  However that question I believe might be settled.</P>
      <P>The whole question of public health should be fully gone into and a uniform scheme for all Ireland should be provided. It is not satisfactory at present. I feel myself that we should have a Commission of our best medical men to go into the whole matter.  We all want to abolish the workhouses.  But we do not want to do it by having a large &ldquo;compound&rdquo; and having them all in one large workhouse.  That is not my idea of abolishing the pauper system, and I think we should have a Commission to go into this thing and have a thoroughly uniform scheme, if that thing is pressed.</P>
      <P>The dismissal of rate-collectors will create some trouble.  I think the County Councils or rating bodies should be given discretionary powers to deal with their rate collectors in their special area.  I wish to be clear about this.  I do not know who is responsible for it, whether it is the Minister for Local Government or some other Minister, but shortly after the Treaty was signed we were told that we would get £20,000 for the improvement of the roads in County Wexford. We started a direct labour scheme and put it into operation.  Shortly after we were told that that £20,000 was reduced to £10,000 and I learned, with some concern, that though we had expended £10,000 and paid workmen out of the rates no part of the money was forthcoming, though we had been at first told that we were to get £20,000 and then £10,000.  I do not know whether the Minister will give us any guarantee that we will get that £10,000.</P>

      <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister for Local Government when the money for the Housing Scheme will be available. I should also like to associate myself with the appeal with regard to the question of rate-collectors.  The propriety of raising the matter on this report is, I take it, open to question, but as it has been raised, I should like to support Deputy McCarthy on the assumption that the facts are as stated, in which case, no doubt, a hardship and an injustice are proposed to be done to those men.  One thing that struck me favourably with regard to the Minister for Local Government was a statement recently in this House that the Local Government Department knows no Party and that this is not a matter of Party politics or necessities.  It occurred to me, on listening to that very worthy and wise expression of opinion from him, that it was rather regrettable that the same wisdom had not obtained amongst certain of his colleagues in this House who have recently been hurling in public untrue charges against certain members of public bodies who have been working in the public interest, and&mdash;I think the Minister will bear me out&mdash; working satisfactorily with the Department of Local Government.  These colleagues of his have in these charges made incitements to violence on the part of constituents towards their members.</P>

      <P>I would like to emphasise the questions asked by the Deputy for Monaghan.  I received also a copy of the memorandum from some gentlemen representing the different Councils, Urban and Rural District, in the northern area.  And in reference to this I would like to ask whether the Minister can inform us whether there is any definite policy decided upon by the Executive of Dáil Éireann with regard to the position of these local bodies in Ulster who have pledged their allegiance to Dáil Éireann.  I would like to ask him if he can conveniently give the information now to tell us what bodies in that area did pledge allegiance to Dáil Éireann; how many of these bodies have been within the last month or two suppressed and obliged to cease their functions, as a result of the interference of the Northern Government, and what steps, if any, the Department have taken to come to the rescue of these local bodies and give them advice as to how they should act.  This Department <Col N="375" /> does not give any information here on this point.  It would be an advantage to the House to know if the Government have a policy, and what that policy is, and how they propose to come to the rescue of these bodies who have backed up Dáil Éireann in this fight.  Are they now going to be left in the lurch by Dáil Éireann?  Before the House is asked to intervene we would like to hear if the Cabinet has discussed this matter, and if so, what decision they have arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. W.T. COSGRAVE (MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT):</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question is by Deputy O'Connor in connection with the £25,000 from the White Cross for the Western sea-board.  I have been promised a report on that, but I have not received it yet.  There is at least a fortnight's work in arrears in my office, and I could not promise to get any information about it just now.  I have approached the Cabinet of Dáil Éireann with a request for £100,000 as a grant for the relief of distress and unemployment in various parts of the country.  Until I am aware of the exact sum to be given, I shall not be in a position to elaborate a scheme to deal with that distress and unemployment. But even that sum is insufficient to deal with the many applications and cases that are put up to us for Government assistance.  Government assistance is not a thing that I recommend.  But this Assembly has got responsibility for the situation that is at present existing in the country and the tightening of the purse strings of commerce and business, and everything else and having brought about that state of affairs, it is my opinion that this Assembly should come to the rescue, to some extent, anyhow, so far as it has the ability to do so.</P>
      <P>As for the amalgamation of Unions, we have received very considerable opposition from some members of this House in carrying out these Schemes.  They were recommended by the Commission set up in 1920 by a united Dáil.  It was on their recommendation that directions were given to the Local Government Department to carry out those schemes.  Not having reached the pinnacle of perfection which Mr. Etchingham would like, we have not been able to satisfy everybody.  But if we got the same support as we had been then getting and if we had got the same assistance, we might have done better. All I would say is that if we had only got the same assistance from others as we have got from Mr. Etchingham, the whole country would still be groaning under the old, bad system of poor law, and nobody appreciates that fact better than Mr. Etchingham himself.</P>
      <P>As regards the punitive measures that we adopted against the Mayo County Council, I will say that Mr. O'Connor could have learned the policy that was adopted by the late Cabinet under Mr. de Valera, with regard to using public monies for any purpose, apart from that for which they were levied.  And he would have known that a public body is not entitled to levy money for any other purposes than those that are laid down in the law adopted by this assembly.  The Mayo County Council can settle their business now, because I believe the principal aggression and opposition has emanated from the members of this Chamber. I can settle it now if they will allow me, and there will be no delay.  It is not a question on which I can say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  I am held up by the law with regard to the administration of the business of Local Government as much as any elergyman in his capacity as a clergyman is held by his laws, or any other Minister in his capacity as Minister, or any other person who has any knowledge whatever of the lines that should guide him in connection with public morality.  As far as the punishment of the people of Mayo is concerned it is not we who are punishing them; it is the County Council of Mayo.  We are prepared to settle that here and now.  Withdraw any illegal imposts on the people; do not place upon their shoulders anything they are not liable to bear, and we can settle it.  Will you settle it?</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. COSGRAVE:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all; you will not settle it.  If you knew anything about it you would not introduce the question here.  And all your discussions are raised not for anything constructive, but for some Party advantage.  As regards the rate-collectors, we have not sanctioned and cannot sanction the appointment of new rate-collectors having regard to the circumstances of the ease.  We cannot issue warrants to them and we cannot sanction their appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the north, I have got no assistance in dealing with the north from <Col N="376" /> Mr. McEntee.  I did not even get the benefit of reading that memorandum. It was not submitted to me and I know nothing about it.  It is usual to quote the whole of a memorandum.  I do not know who was behind this, or who put it up, or whether the Deputy for Monaghan was behind it.  I have not heard of it.  The policy adopted by the late Cabinet had a certain motive in it. It was not worked out.  If I had a policy I would not put it up here.  We did not disclose the policy to the public in the Dáil when we were fighting in the twenty-six counties.  To disclose such a policy may commend itself to Mr. McEntee, but it does not commend itself to me.  I am anxious to deal with the north in a constructive manner.  They came to me and I said I knew nothing about it, and they asked me for assistance, and they said I should lay down a policy&mdash;lay down a policy without knowing the facts of the situation. The ex-President will admit that when he interviewed deputations from the north he heard from one member of the deputation a positive, and from the other member in the same area a negative policy.  We are not going to settle this question on Party lines.  And it is not by talking here, and by publishing our policy that we can settle it.  I regret very much having been drawn into a speech.  I was present at that meeting. I called it myself, and I called it to see what could be done.  The matter is under consideration of a new board that I have set up, called the Board of Directors of Local Government.  But I do not know whether they will be able to solve this, because we got it in a pretty mixed-up fashion.</P>
    <P>Mr. Etchingham wanted to know something about the rate-collectors and something about sacking them.  He is Chairman of a Country Council.  Has he sacked any rate-collectors, or has he not?  I have not sacked your rate-collectors, and I do not know anything about anybody else trying to sack them. It is only fair that we should understand what his position is.  If I can only get an intelligent question put to me about rate-collectors, either in Wexford or in any other part of Ireland, I will do my best to answer that question.  But I am at a loss to answer Deputy Etchingham. There has been no intention to dismiss rate-collectors.  There may be a scheme in contemplation to see how best we could collect the rates more economically than by rate-collectors.  But, then, if that system is availed of there must be a scheme to provide compensation to any rate-collector who may lose his position.  If that is what he means that is my answer.  If he means that rate-collectors have been dismissed that is another question.  I expect that he would object if we sanctioned pensions to men who refused to obey the County Councils during the war.</P>
    <P>With regard to large &ldquo;compounds&rdquo; for the poor I do not know of any scheme of amalgamation which contemplates large &ldquo;compounds.&rdquo;  County Homes were set up and I believe they were a success.  Some may not have been as successful as others.  Each county was given a free hand in regard to these schemes, subject to certain conditions. The idea we had in mind was to set up an up-to-date hospital in each county.  The Deputy for Monaghan may not be aware or he may be aware of what he complains of. I was informed by the Doctor there that out of 30 persons in hospital there was not one case of acute disorder.  I am giving you [Deputy McEntee] some information about your constituency. As far as I know, up to the Truce the number of Northern Councils who had pledged their allegiance to Dáil Éireann was very small, possibly three bodies. Up to about September that was the case. They came in last November or December.  It is a credit to them that they did come in at that time.  But I want the House to exactly visualise what the position is.  At that time negotiations were going on with regard to the northern and southern boundary, and it was a great political advantage to know that we had a number of Republican bodies in the northern area.  But they were not in the previous fight with us.  I think the ex-President recollects that.  I want to make that clear.  During the time that the south was engaged in a life and death struggle it was confined to the twenty-six counties.  I have described that in my report.  I say that the fight was confined to the twenty-six counties, except in the case of three bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MR. COSGRAVE MR. COSGRAVE">
      <NameTxt>MR. COSGRAVE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the fight, as far as Local Government is concerned, was confined, except in the case of about three bodies, to the 26 counties.  The <Col N="377" /> statement is made very lightly here that that is not true.  If it be not true give some testimony of its untruthfulness. [Replying to an interruption by Mr. McEntee].  You have made a statement, and it is there, and if you want to make political capital out of it get on the platform.  It will not carry you much further, or be of much advantage to you.</P>
      <P>Now, Deputy Etchingham is Chairman of a County Council, and he can regulate that matter about the ambulance bringing back dead bodies.  He can regulate that, and there is no necessity to bring the matter up here.  Officials of the Local Government Department are of advantage to the country.  I think you will admit that.  And they took risks during the war.  Now as to this transport money, a number of the Councils have formulated some schemes and when they will be sanctioned this matter can be dealt with.  If no technicality has been neglected in connection with his county, I am satisfied there will be no objection to giving this money.  If you have spent this money on a sound scheme, or in good faith, even a technicality, or anything of that sort, will not be allowed to stand in your way.</P>
      <P>Deputy the Lord Mayor of Cork asked a question as to when the money for Housing would be available.  That money will be available directly the Local Authority is in a position to acquire the land or commit themselves to a scheme for housing.  The Provisional Government will provide its quota of all that expenditure.  If, for example, the acquisition of the site and the laying of the foundations were to come to an estimated cost of £3,000 directly we have information of that we will send the local body a cheque for £2,000.  If a tender is accepted for £72,000 we divide that by twelve, and conclude that the work will go on fairly evenly for 12 months. The expenditure in that case would be £6,000 a month, and our quota would be two-thirds of that&mdash;£4,000 a month. Before you are committed to your first expenditure, we will make arrangements that you will get £4,000 when you sign the contract.  I believe the Finance Department will sanction that.  It will be on the impress system.  I am most anxious and willing to get the cooperation of all members of the Dáil to deal with the northern question.  I am not satisfied that any indication of the policy with regard to the north should be disclosed here in the Dáil, and I do not think it would be good business to do so. I am waiting and I have been waiting for a long time to get a constructive suggestion from them.  At the last meeting they decided that they would stick to what they had done, and I suppose the House is in possession of the exact state of affairs up there.  You can imagine the position of an Inspector from the Local Government Department here if called to the north, and he called upon the Commissioner in charge of one of those bodies asking to know how the rates were being collected, and how the Commissioner was acting, and how the local services were being carried out, and whether there was proper expendition and economy.  I would impress upon the House the question of considering this £100,000.  It is a miserably small amount for the work that is required to be done.  I see that one member has put down £5,000 for one district.  That does not appeal to me as the best way of dealing with it.  I think we should have a scheme from all the public bodies.  The Department would be most willing to co-operate with each local authority, dealing first with those places where there was much more necessity for employment than others.  A case in point is Wexford.  There are 1,750 men idle there.  It has been hard hit by the war.  The foundries there are stopped and there is a mill after being closed. There is a sound scheme which would relieve employment to a very considerable extent there in the waterworks. But unless the money is forthcoming I do not know what chance there is of relieving unemployment.  You have got to do it one way or another.  The effort to relieve it by Poor Rate is debasing. It is expensive and it leads nowhere.  If the House would appoint a Committee to consider this matter I would be pleased.  And I think it must be evident to anybody who is in touch with the business of the country that something must be done to stabilise matters and restore normal conditions.</P>

      <P>What I meant about the rate-collectors was that I did not think that Public Bodies would consent to the dismissal of men who came in and worked during the war.  They had to dismiss the old rate-collectors who adhered to the English Local Government Board and the idea was that some people got into their heads that these <Col N="378" /> people would be reinstated.  I gather that this is not the case, and that there will be no dismissal of the men who worked during the war.  I would agree with that.  I would agree, in connection with any new scheme for collecting the rates, even if it is by suction, that the old rate-collectors should be compensated. I do not object to the ambulance bringing back the dead, but I suggested that as a means towards amalgamation in Wexford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. MICHAEL COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, I will now answer the question that has been put by Deputy Joseph MacDonagh&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether in view of the fact that the Irish Republic was established by Dáil Éireann on 21st January, 1919, and as a result the British Government ceased to have any right, moral or otherwise, to levy taxes on the Irish people, the Irish people are liable to pay income tax levied on them in the first instance by the British Government for periods subsequent to 21st January 1919, i.e., in respect of the financial years ended 5th April, 1919, 5th April, 1920, and 5th April 1921.</P>
      <P>The answer to that question is: the situation which arises out of the Treaty renders it unnecessary to discuss for what particular year, or years, the Irish people are liable to pay Income Tax.  All Income Tax now outstanding, regardless of what year it belongs to, belongs to the Irish Government, and is paid to agents of the Irish Government for the present, pending the formation of the new Irish Parliament.  Income Tax, for obvious reasons, is collected under the direction of the British Board of Inland Revenue, as agents for the Irish Government.  All taxes actually collected, including all arrears on and from the 1st April 1922 are payable into the Irish Exchequer and nowhere else.  That is since the first of April, 1922.</P>

Dá dtabhairfeadh sé freagra béil dom do bheadh cead agam cheist eile chuir chuige.  Ar a shon sin ba cheart go mbeadh cead agam ceist eile chuir chuige anois.  I wish now to repeat in English what I have said.  I presume that the Minister for Finance will answer a supplementary question.  I put a question to the Minister for Finance a couple of weeks ago and he said he could not very well answer me that day but that he would send me an answer.  If he gave me an answer on that day I would have put a supplementary question.  On that account I have a right to put him another question now.  It is with regard to the item in the account &ldquo;money refunded.&rdquo;  Last October I noticed there was an item like £4,000 in the Finance Account charged up against the Department of Defence account.  I knew it was incorrect and consequently I questioned it.  And the answer given was that there was some mistake made and that the money would be refunded. In the accounts recently submitted, I saw that there was over £4,000 refunded.  I put a question asking was this connected with the money which was paid in London about which some mistake had been made.  I now have got the answer, and in fact it says not. Consequently, I assume that money has not yet been refunded.  It is something like £4,000 of Dáil money.  Here is what he says.  &ldquo;There is £3,050 to be refunded.&rdquo;  I want to know now first, upon whose authority this money was paid at all?  Then, who exactly is going to refund it?  He also tells me with regard to the other £1,000. &ldquo;This will be settled with the auditor in London.&rdquo;  I would like to know if the official auditor has made inquiries with regard to the other £1,000 and what will be the result?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We desire to report that the Committee set up under the terms of Dr. Hayes' motion in the Session of An Dáil on Wednesday, May 3rd, has held eleven sessions in all.</P>
      <P>At the first Session we arranged to meet the Army Officers on both sides with a view to an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the subsequent Truce.

      <P>In reference to that subject, we wish to make this statement. The pro-Treaty side on that Committee have had a statement prepared for submission to the Dáil this evening.  That statement deals with the Conference. The Anti-Treaty side consider that it would be unfair to them if that report was submitted until they have one ready to submit at the same time.  Now, as I say, we have agreed subject to this that because of the fact that we read our report on the conference to the Anti-Treaty side of the Conference that they will give us before they put in their report here, an opportunity of hearing their report also.  Subject to what I mentioned first and to the pleasure of the House we as a Committee are prepared to assent to that course.</P>

      <P>Is it understood that the Truce continues in the meantime? I think, a Chinn Comhairle, it is most important that whether this Conference has broken down or not that the Truce should not break down, if it is possible to maintain it.  And I would like to know if there is anyone in the House competent to speak with authority as to whether or not the breaking of the Conference means also the termination of the Truce?</P>

      <P>On that point, it seems to me&mdash;I do not know whether I am expressing the opinion peculiar to myself or not&mdash;that speaking of the Truce in such terms is rather a dangerous and undesirable thing, because it would seem to imply that there was a recognised position of the opposite to the Truce before the appointment of this Committee.  I think the state of the case was this that what we call the Truce was the bringing together of people who are in disagreement for the purpose of considering am agreement.  It would be very undersirable if this Dáil was to make any pronouncement or take any action which would imply that there was in its mind a state of war before these arrangements began because then if it were stated that in what is called a truce had come to am <Col N="380" /> end it would mean reverting to what was admitted to be a state of war.  I only put the thing in that form, to ask the members not to speak loosely.  Of course it is quite right to speak of it as a Truce, but it is dangerous to my mind. It might seize the public mind, or part of the public mind, in the form of the termination of a Truce in the ordinary sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. MCDONAGH:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say to this report, because it gives very little information.  But I would like to ask the Minister for Trade when was Mr. Bewley appointed; what business experience has he, and what exactly has he been doing in the way of facilitating trade between Germany and Ireland in Berlin?  I understand also, as regards the sale of iron goods, etc., that are coming into this country from the Netherlands, that the Irish builder has to pay whatever price the British Steam Trust chooses to put on these articles. I would like to know what steps the Minister for Trade has taken to facilitate trade between Belgium, in particular, and Ireland, and so avoid the British Steam Trust ring and thereby reduce the price to the Irish builders.</P>
      <P>With regard to the prohibition of British goods, the Minister for Local Government, when he was winding up the discussion on Local Government, stated that the foundries in Wexford were packed with agricultural instruments. These were the very first instruments that were prohibited when the British Boycott was first imposed and I think that a great deal of the number of agricultural implements in Wexford for which there is now no market is due to the fact that permits have been given wholesale to introduce British agricultural implements into this country.  The Boycott is about to be raised.  I see according to this report you have another article that was prohibited, that is, margarine.  You have factories&mdash; Dowdall's in Cork and McDonnell's in Waterford&mdash;idle, and men working on short time.  The Minister for Trade proposes to allow the dumping of Danish margarine into the country at the same time that he lifts what was the protection of Irish industries.  He says here almost all Irish industries are feeling very keenly the pressure of foreign competition and he is going to increase that by raising the British Boycott.  I think instead of loosening the Boycott, that it should be strengthened and where articles are manufactured in Ireland, or are in the first stages of manufacture, I think it should be the first duty of this House and of the Minister for Trade to see that to a very large extent, at least, foreign competition should be excluded, provided the prices of articles in Ireland are fixed.  I think it is futile to say that Irish industries are at present feeling the pinch and at the same time to say that we are going to let in English stuff freely in the future.  I would suggest to the Minister for Trade and Commerce that instead of raising the prohibition that he should enlarge his list of prohibitions. You have practically every industry in Ireland at the present suffering for want of work and at the same time you have millions and millions of stock coming in from England of manufactured in Ireland.  It is now for Dáil Éireann and the Minister for Trade to say how such Irish goods shall be consumed by the Irish people.  You can do that by prohibiting any foreign articles coming in which will hit Irish industries.  I think that was the policy of the old Dáil&mdash;to give employment to the Irish people&mdash;and prior to the Treaty I understood that the lists were about to be increased.  But now the policy is to allow English goods in here without prohibition.  I do not know whether it is above them or not. The last thing that he seems to think of is that the people are being disemployed as a result of that prohibition being raised.  I hope that the part of the report in reference to the prohibition of English goods will not be adopted.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="381" /> would like to learn from the Minister what steps, if any, have been taken to remove the penalisation of the export of Irish cattle to the continent.  The trade and general export of cattle from Ireland has been penalised for quite a considerable time, simply owing to Ireland being included in the legislation in the British Empire, and not owing to any defect in the Irish cattle themselves. Circumstances make the moment very propitious for that particular trade and the only thing that prohibits it is the question of prohibition in certain countries.  I take it that he has already taken some action and I would like to know what.</P>
      <P>For years the consular service has been in the hands of certain elements which I might describe as the snobocracy. Recently, as the result of the national movement, efforts were made to secure this consular representation for Irishmen.  In that connection assistance was sought with a view to having such appointments made independent of the pro-British influences in this country.  But the best advice that this gentleman was able to give was that absolutely a <i>sine qua non</i> for such an appointment in this country was a recommendation from a Lord, or at least from a Baronet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPColivet" hpid="MR. COLIVET MR. COLIVET">
      <NameTxt>MR. COLIVET:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which has been raised three or four times at previous meetings of the Dáil. That is the question of standardising supplies for the Public Bodies.  I suppose this arises more out of the report of the Local Government Minister, but it is half and half.  I do not know whether any progress has been made with that scheme.  It is quite possible that the whole problem of industrial reorganisation in Ireland is such a big one and so complicated, and especially viewing it in the present state of affairs, that Ministers concerned decided to do nothing.  Time drives on and nothing is done.  I am not standing up now to throw any destructive criticism on the report, from the point of view of obstruction, or party politics.  There are some things, at least, that can be tackled at the moment.  We are at present in a state of unemployment, such as we have not witnessed in the country for a long time.  There are some lines on which the problem would be hard to deal with.  There are others in which it would be comparatively easy, and I think if the Minister were to tackle the problem he could do something on constructive lines.  One would come partly under the heading of trade and that is the standardising of supplies for public boards and institutions of all kinds.  It has particular reference to one matter raised here and that is the state of unemployment in the foundry industries in Wexford.  There are three or four foundries in Wexford, two in Limerick, and six in Dublin.  You have a fairly small number of men to deal with if you want to get anything done.  On the other hand, the bodies who use cast iron goods in large quantities are also very few.  It looks to me that the problem is one that could be dealt with now without waiting too long for more settled conditions.  In the schools, for example, there are such things as school desks, and there are also gratings and mains, electrical and gas supplies and so on.  These are only a few; there are many others.  There are probably other supplies of a similar nature either in the way of clothing or of food.  But I wish to draw your attention to this particular line, cast-iron goods.  That might be tackled by the Minister directly.  Iron foundries have formed an association and you would in that way be able to find out how far they would co-operate at the moment.  Engineers of public bodies have an association of their own.  There is also an association for public bodies themselves, and I think the municipal bodies have an association also.  I know that Corporations, Urban Councils and Borough Councils, have such an association, and through their Engineers and Chairmen it ought to be possible to devise some scheme by which immediately cast-iron requirements for the country could be made in the country. I would also like if the Minister for Trade and Commerce could give us at a future meeting anything in the nature of a tabulated report under different headings, or the amount of cast-iron goods that are being imported, with particular reference to those that are being made in Ireland.  There are some that cannot be made in Ireland at the present moment; there are others that can, and it would enable the House to go more closely into it if such a report were before it, and report the actual amount involved.  In some lines the amount is so little possibly as to have very little effect on employment.  There <Col N="382" /> is a big quantity of goods being imported into the country at the present moment which in the course of one month could be stopped and could be made here in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister for Trade and Commerce would have withdrawn this report, because his job is a sinecure now.  Those of us in business are wondering where trade is.  There is no trade in Ireland at the present time, and I would like to ask the Deputy for North Tipperary when he is talking about British influence in different sections of Irish imports what he himself and his friends have done to help us to get Irish manufacturers working and to keep their hands employed.  I will give a free invitation to the members of this House to come to my office to-morrow morning and find out in my own particular business how many men are idle, and I will ask any business man what is the cause of the lack of trade.  It is not the want of support for Irish manufactured goods; it is the obstruction to the work of the people who want to carry on.  Anybody in business in Ireland will tell you that there is no business.  The lack of business is due to the obstruction to the Government of the country, and the feeling of insecurity that exists.  People will not build a house, start a factory, or buy a motor car, because they do not know when some brigands will come in and take their goods away.</P>

He wants to have free, fair competition for foreigners, when the public money of the country is being spent for the clothing and the shoes of the army of this country.  I find that Deputy McGarry said that those who were opposed to the Treaty were the cause of it.  I would like to know was he so much interested when he saw waggon loads of goods going donn to Beggar's Bush that could be produced in Cork.  I say the Minister for Trade is not giving any help to this country, but he is hampering it.  You see there the foreign stuff dumped down.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. COSGRAVE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy for Limerick has not read the report.  We have started two new industries by reason of this collective buying.  It is not at present what we would like it to be but there is room for a good deal of extension.  Considerable opposition has been offered locally as the Inspector mentions in this report. We have been successful in persuading cement factories to re-open in Wexford and generally there is a real live effort being made as far as Local Government is concerned and to a very large extent the Department is indebted to the Minister for Trade, because he is the Minister who has charge of that Department. And he has done remarkably well.  Three hundred and forty-six items have been taken up by him out of a possible eleven hundred.  Now we are only about three or four months at this work and we intend to standarise samples and it will mean the co-operation and assistance of the Deputies with the Local Authorities in their areas to ensure anything like success in this new departure.  These bodies sometimes get an idea that we want to boss them from the centre; now there is no truth in that; we never attempted to do that, but we say they have no right to pay bigger prices locally for any goods that they require when a competitor from a distance is in a position to land goods of a similar quality at smaller prices.  Members may have read a letter in the Press the other day complaining about the &ldquo;bungledom&rdquo; of the Custom House being introduced into the Local Government Department.  The facts are that a local contractor tendered at 1s. 7d. per gallon for a certain article.  We pointed out that the price was too high, and that we were in a position to supply them with the same article at 1s. 4d.  As <Col N="383" /> a result of the activities of the Department a local contractor has been found to supply at 1s. 5d. per gallon; in Galway a contractor would not take less than 2s. for what we could put on rail here at 1s. 4d.  On that being pointed out the Galway contractor came down to 1s. 7½d.  That is the sort of thing we have all over the country.  It is much more pronounced in certain places, and one Deputy informs me that certain towns are absolutely living out of the institutions in their midst.  In one case an inspector found that they were paying higher than the retail prices for most things. Local influence is strong in those places, in the same way as it was strong in the amalgamation of unions.  Everyone wanted amalgamation so long as his own town was left alone.  Unless co-operation is given by members in the various districts I do not think we will make a success of this.  I am satisfied that nothing will be left undone to make it a success.  But in the long run it depends upon the Local Councils if they will support us.</P>

      <P>I was surprised when I heard Deputy McGarry inform us about the want of employment and what he thinks is the cause of it.  I am perfectly satisfied that Mr. McGarry has done his part for Irish industries.  I am in agreement with what the Minister for Local Government stated, because uniformally local influences have permeated public affairs, not alone in this but in every country.  We are not discussing the Department of the Minister for Local Government, but the Department of the Minister for Trade and Commerce, and he is not very encouraging. His report is not even on a par with the various previous reports which he put up to this House.  In previous reports he pointed out commercial development, but we are all aware that with certain obstacles in his way he is not able to develop things.  There is no reason whatever why he should not concentrate the peoples' minds on the duty they owe to themselves and to this country to support Irish Industry, and he should assist by propagandist methods the industries of our country.  No business man can agree with his report and no pioneer in development would agree that propagandist appeals would give no return.  It would be a pleasure to me if he attempted any propagandist work. From what I know of propagandist work the results exceeded our expectation. If the Executive of the Republican Government had done some work in this connection it would be engaged in the sound national work of creating employment which is wanted by the people of Ireland.  Every other day public men appeal for support of Irish Industry, and every other day we read in the Press that President Griffith and other leading members of this House appeal that industries should be supported. It is our first duty to support the products of our country and to the credit of the Minister for Trade and Commerce he reports &ldquo;Most of the industries are at present feeling the pressure of foreign competition.&rdquo;  What has his Department being doing for the last two months to prevent that? Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  He is possibly doing his part to give the foreign manufacturers every opportunity to destroy it.</P>
      <P>The Postmaster General can give some information as to the result to Irish Industries when the Belfast Boycott was lifted.  People are under the idea that the Irish people will not invest money. This is not true.  Some business men will invest money in various industries all over the country and they will do fairly well.  It is the duty of Ministers to protect our industries for the nation. In every country where it is necessary to protect the home producer against the foreigner a tariff is set up and no man could desire a better tariff than the decree of Dáil Éireann.  I just mention one instance now.  Paper was being sold in England at £14 per ton.  That was wrapping paper.  The same paper was being sold in Dublin at £11 a ton. The result was that one of the Irish Paper Mills was closed down and two are working at half time.</P>

Now, <Col N="384" /> subject to the correction of the Minister, I understand that a meeting for an exchange of opinion was held between him and the Minister of the Cabinet. He pressed for the Decree to be lifted. However, an important member of the Executive stated that it would not be wise to raise the Decree, but that you could meet it by issuing private permits to various people in the country.  Private permits were issued for goods that were produced in Ireland equal to any produced abroad.  I, for one, would not protest if any article not competitive were imported, but goods that were imported put people in Dublin and Cork and Limerick out of employment, and that permit was issued to one factory in the biscuit trade and I know something about biscuits.</P>

      <P>No, but they were of the Scotch variety.  The names of the men to whom the permits were given were men who were opposed to the national idea for years, while in trade. Whether the Minister was looking to get some return or not I am not aware. But this I know that other men would not get a permit.  That permit was issued to that man.  The Minister had no right to issue a permit without the authority of this House, and we should protest in every way in our power if he did not do his duty to protect the interests of the country, and we should have him removed from office.  I wanted to have this matter settled and I am proud to say I have tried to have the matter settled outside the Cabinet. I looked up Deputy Staines who told me he would do his best and that I could settle it without bringing it before the House.  The idea of issuing permits to men in the jam trade is scandalous.  I am sure the Minister must have imagined when he was importing English blacking that he would see in the shine the shadow of what he believed was true, but he is destroying the substance of our industrial life and I move that the Minister's report be not accepted.</P>

Some time ago a strike over a very small matter occurred at Clondalkin Mills, which employs a very large number.  At any rate there are up to 100 families supported by it.  A good deal of negotiations went on and eventually an agreement was arrived at, but I am sorry to say the men turned down the agreement against the wishes of their leaders.  Shortly after, the management received a letter, supposed to come from a member of the Executive forces, ordering him to open the premises as there were a number of men who were idle as a result of the strike joining up, as he alleged, the forces at Beggar's Bush.</P>

      <P>They had not joined up, as a matter of fact.  The management pointed out that the factory was there if they cared to work it, and pointed out further that the material removed a week before was not returned.  I got the men after a good deal of trouble to agree to resume on the original terms agreed to.  I got into touch with the management of the firm and they replied while they pointed out that it took a great deal more to manufacture the same class of paper here, in spite of that they might get over the labour difficulties and the other difficulties in the way, but that owing to the state of the country, and the way they had been treated, they definitely decided to leave the factory closed.  I thought it well to mention that in view of what Mr. O'Mahony has said as to the causes of the unemployment.  There was a good deal of unemployment before the Treaty, but I know very well that for three or four weeks after it was signed that there was less.  But it must not be forgotten by the people talking about unemployment that here in Dublin a few weeks ago there were 450 people knocked out of work, and it is quite possible that next week those 450 people will be on the streets again. There are 40 employees in the <i>Clonmel Nationalist</i> turned out of work.  I had a letter from them and they have pointed out that they are absolutely helpless.  Probably we will have to do the same thing for them as in the case of the <i>Freeman.</i>  There are 25 unemployed in the <i>Sligo Champion.</i>  Apart from this and all the other interests, <Col N="385" /> paper, ink, and such interests are suffering as a result.</P>

      <P>We will take the points more or less as they occur, or were made in the various speeches.  With regard to the exact time that Mr. Bewley was appointed we will find that out.  It was sometime towards the end of November.  Deputy McDonagh suggested that unemployment in Wexford was due, in some measure, to the wholesale issue of permits for the introduction of agricultural implements.  That is entirely wrong. There have been no permits issued for the import of agricultural implements except for some to be shown at the Dublin Show, but no permits have been issued for machines which could in any way have interfered with the sale of machinery made at Wexford.  But the reason of the slump there is not the issuing of permits; it is owing to the fact that land has gone out of tillage as a result of the European war and also in a large measure as a result of the conditions which obtain here.  Because of land going out of cultivation agricultural implements are not being purchased. Last spring we issued an order forbidding the importation of agricultural implements into the country. That order had practically no effect, because last year people had almost ceased to buy agricultural implements. Those who wanted them were able to get them second-hand in many cases, because people who had land in tillage were letting it go out of tillage, and had implements for sale.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of margarine, what is hitting margarine at the present moment is entirely Dutch competition. British margarine people are losing money just as the Irish margarine people are, and we have no power.  The prohibition never extended to any margarine, except British margarine, so that it is not the issuing of permits that is causing the unemployment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question about the export of cattle, Ireland is included as far as France is concerned.  Irish cattle are not allowed to land because an Order was issued about a year ago, when the outbreak of foot and mouth disease occurred in England, prohibiting the importation of cattle from Great Britain and Ireland.  Our consul has been at work trying to get the Order varied and he has pointed out that there is no reason at all why Irish cattle should be excluded and that there is no foot and mouth disease in Ireland.  So far he has not succeeded in inducing the French authority to alter the Order.  In Belgium our consul has been successful in getting the Belgian authorities to withdraw the ban on Irish cattle, and I hope the same results will occur in France.</P>
      <P>In regard to the statement by the Lord Mayor of Cork about a Lord or Baronet, I do not know anything about that.</P>
      <P>The matter of standarising the samples of goods required by public bodies has been dealt with by the Minister for Local Government.  A certain amount of work was done by my Department, but owing to the state of the country none of the plans could be put into operation.  The official who had charge of that matter has gone to the Local Government Board and has been doing it.  In regard to Beggars Bush and the articles for that place that is a matter about which the Minister for Defence can answer and will answer.  However, I am informed that no money has been spent on any foreign goods where Irish goods could be obtained.  Every Irish cloth manufacturer who could make material for uniforms has been asked to do it.  Woollen goods for underwear are not turned out in sufficient quantities in Ireland and the men could not be expected to go without a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to cutlery the same state of things obtained.  In regard to the legality of issuing permits the Decree that was passed by Dáil Éireann authorised me to issue orders prohibiting the importation and sale of certain goods of British manufacture. It was simply an empowering order. As I said I believe that that rigid prohibition of British goods is not a thing that is economically sound.  Industries started under those conditions would not possibly survive in normal times.  I know of various industries which were started and which were simply hopeless, and are we now to continue mulcting the Irish people?  Assistance must be given by some graduated scheme, but it is not sound or advisable to give an absolute monopoly to the people in this country. Prohibition orders do not effect the giving of protection to Irish manufacture; they stop the British goods from coming in.  British margarine was coming in; that was stopped.  The stopping of it did not help Irish manufacture, but in so far as it hit the British manufacturer <Col N="386" /> these things were a proper and justifiable weapon; but when the war is not going on it would be different, and I am quite prepared to stand on the soundness of that principle.  The matter of issuing permits was suggeted to you by myself, because there was a certain objection to take off a prohibition because of the fact that we did not know what might occur in the country and whether circumstances might not occur which would render it advisable.  We could not assume absolutely that the British would carry out their undertaking to evacuate the country.  When there was no further excuse for the thing that was definitely a war measure the issuing of permits seemed to be an easy way of introducing the change.  It seemed to me that even if we postponed it for some time, if we withdrew the prohibition orders at once that there might be quite a rush for the importation of British goods and that it would be a better way and would do less injury if the change were introduced gradually. Permits were issued then generally for very little quantities so that if anything occurred which made it proper to rigidly enforce the order again nobody could have the excuse of saying he had large quantities on hands.</P>
    <P>With regard to the various things that Mr. O'Mahony said, he permitted himself to make a scandalous insinuation by innuendo.  Until he withdraws that insinuation I take no further notice of him; I have nothing further to say to the gentleman.  The House heard the innuendo which he thought proper to make.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I know nothing about the particular permit that Mr. O'Mahony refers to.  He did not give me the name of the person. I took no action with regard to the permit.  It was issued in the usual course and not as a result of anything he said.  I do not know to what permit he refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to the general situation nobody who looks at the matter, I think, except through very jaundiced spectacles, can doubt that the situation in the country is absolutely fatal to trade and to the development of industry. People may think that the action which does destroy trade, which holds up trade, and destroys industry, is justifiable on some higher ground than merely the economic ground.  But I think that nobody at all can deny that these actions which are going on and the state to which they have brought the country make any sort of economic stability utterly impossible.  It is all very well to suggest a number of small things that might be done to remedy unemployment. But those things would be like trying to keep out the sea with a broom. They cannot have any more effect in staying the trend of things economically than would the keeping out of the sea with a broom.  And, with regard to this Department, the members of Dáil Éireann ought to realise, whatever you might say about keeping economic affairs from politics, that politics rule economics, and they have everything to do with the Government and with taxation, and the power of the purse, which enables industry to be assisted. Nothing was possible under the old conditions for the Department of Trade and Commerce except to gather information and give certain advice.  Those things are of small importance in the matter of industry, except in the matter appertaining to trade.  Very few people are experts in that matter, and in regard to that particular matter it has been possible to give substantial help.  But in regard to every other Department, everybody who comes to you about industry either wants money or protection. Money it was not possible to give them by grants or loans or subsidies because it was not there.  Money can only be given by a Government in matters of that kind.  Protection was given, but it was only a make-shift affair and one which if continued long enough would be very hard on many sections of the community, because it would have given rise to very serious profiteering. If we were to apply this principle to English margarine, if we were to extend that Order we should immediately have the margarine manufacturers putting up prices from 6d. to 7d. Perhaps 7d. might be justified or it might go up to 8d., and if you have a general policy of rigid prohibition there is no doubt but the most scandalous profiteering may go on.  So it is impossible to give any sort of adequate protection to any industry in the way we have heard.  There is a great deal of propaganda done.  It was done by the <Col N="387" /> manifesto of the Labour Party and by the manufacturers and by my Department in the shape of leaflets and it was done on behalf of Irish cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to cigarettes, when feeling was high before the Truce there was a great increase in the consumption of Irish cigarettes, but immediately the Truce came on when we had not actual war conditions the result was that the consumption fell off and that the manufacturers who had installed six machines for the manufacture of cigarettes have not enough work now for two machines.  In that case it was clearly shown that propaganda only gives very limited results and that, as a matter of fact, when you continue harping at the people to do a thing and using the same reasons people became casehardened to it.  The first appeal had the best results.  Only very small results can be gained and even if they could be gained in the conditions that exist in the country they would amount to practically nothing.  The only way that is worth talking about of assisting trade and industry at the present time is to produce stabilised conditions in the country and put an end to this disorder that is in the country.  That is what will give confidence to the people to undertake new enterprises that will keep the people here, and nothing else will be of any value whatever.</P>

      <P>I had hoped the Minister would be in a position to elaborate his Report somewhat in order that when he is replying to this discussion he may be able to give us more information.  I am glad to find that the work of the land settlement is proceding very well both for the operations of the Land Settlement Commission and the Land Bank; and that a good deal of land has ben divided, and that the people have been planted upon it during the past few months.</P>
      <P>While on this matter, I would like to correct a statement which appeared after the meeting of the Dáil in March.</P>
      <P>I was not present while the Dáil was in progress, or otherwise I might have been able to correct this statement at the time. The Minister is reported as having said that there were sixty thousand acres of land in the hands of the Dáil Department and that that sixty thousand acres was lying practically idle for three years. I fancy that is a typographical error, because I am sure the Minister could never have said that.  Last March three years there was no Land Department in existence.  And there never was 60,000 acres of land lying idle in the hands of the Dáil Department.  There never was, as a matter of fact, 6,000 acres of land lying idle.</P>
      <P>With reference to the general report upon agriculture, I am in complete agreement with the sentence which says &ldquo;The condition of agriculture generally is most unsatisfactory.&rdquo;  But I do object to the propaganda that is being made, openly and covertly that we are responsible for the present unsatisfactory state of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. O'CONNOR:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a misstatement. The bad state of agriculture in Ireland is chiefly due to the fact that we do not live in water-tight compartments, that we are subject to world conditions.  The good conditions in Irish agriculture began to collapse last June, with the result that they have gone from bad to worse.  Long before the Treaty was signed and long before the two parties took shape in this assembly and long before any difficulties began to occur in the country, Irish agriculture had got such a frightful knock that even if we had perfect peace here in Ireland Irish agriculture would be struggling and struggling very badly now.  Some people speak so lightly upon this subject that they would seem to think that farming is a kind of amusement undertaken by some good-natured people for the purpose of supplying us with food, Farming is a business, and farmers will not continue to engage in tillage, or cattle farming, unless they pay.  The bulk of the cattle business of this country is the store cattle trade and the prices of store cattle have tumbled to nothing.  Cattle were bought early in the spring of 1921, and farmers this year, thought themselves very happy when they were able to sell at a loss of £10 or £15 per head, plus the loss of the rent <Col N="388" /> as well.  Agricultural produce that had to be sold last autumn had to be sold at prices which hardly gave the farmer an opportunity of having anything in return for his labour or outlay.</P>
      <P>The constituency that I represent is a great barley-producing country.  During the period of the European war, barley went from 45/- to 50/- per barrel.  Last year, in October or November, farmers were lucky to get 15/- to 20/- per barrel.  Farming produce has tumbled in price, but the cost of production, owing to the high cost of living, has not tumbled, and I believe that the key to the present difficulty is to be found in the supercharging. Profiteering is going on to such a large extent that both sections of Dáil Éireann should do something to check those overcharges.  You can buy farm produce, meat and other articles of food, in the market wholesale for little or nothing.  But let any of your wives go into the shop to buy those things and you will see what you will pay for them. It has become a scandal.  In Ireland, while the wholesale price of agricultural produce is probably the lowest of any in the world, the cost of living is probably higher than in any other part where travellers visit.  It is much higher in Ireland than in England, Scotland or France.</P>
      <P>I would like that we could consider agriculture as a thing above politics, the very same as the Local Government Department.  We probably have some very good farmers and agricultural workers anti-Treaty, and some very good farmers and agricultural workers pro-Treaty, and we should get those people together along with the Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for Trade, and try to devise some ways and means of helping agriculture to carry on.  In my humble opinion the bad state of trade, generally, is due to the depression in agriculture.  Practically all the money in this country that circulates comes straight out of the land, and if the farmer has not money to spend nobody else will have it to spend either.  Because anyone who has lived through the prosperous years here, when cattle were selling well, could see the farmers and their daughters, and the workers upon the land going into the towns buying extravagant dresses and motor cars.  But now that they have no money there is no stir in trade.  I am afraid that while the European war was in being we got into bad habits; everyone of us got into an exaggerated style of living which present prices do not allow us to continue in, and to one and all the first necessities will be that everyone of us will have to tighten in our belts and go back a little bit towards the slave state from which agriculture was removed during the European war.  It is no good saying you must have peace. If every one of us was shaking hands with each other and smiling and if there was no trouble in the country, this would not alter world conditions.</P>
      <P>While the war was in progress on the Continent farming was occurring right up to the battle lines.  And unless we can do something to make it worth while for farming to continue&mdash;in other words, whether it is a small farmer or a large farmer, make it worth while for him to till the land and carry on the various subsidiary industries connected with farming, like pig feeding, butter industries, dairying&mdash;the whole economic fabric of this country will collapse, and it will be no good for the other side to say it is our fault.  It will not be our fault.  It will be the fault of general world conditions, which have caused the further depression in prices, and it will be the fault of this Dáil, which should look after the interests of the people generally and the fault of the various organisations of farmers and workers outside, if they do not come together with the Ministers of this Assembly, and devise some ways and means of getting over this terrible depression which is worse than anything that has been in the world for the past 50 or 60 years years.</P>

      <P>It is no use for any members of this House, no use for any Minister, especially the Minister for Agriculture, to point out to us that because some members of this House are opposing the Treaty, it must be the means of causing depression in agriculture. Everyone knows that for the past twelve months agriculture is in a deplorable condition.  I am personally aware that there is no farmer in any part of Ireland who was able to make ends meet last year.  Not alone that but everyone had a serious loss.  Now for the proof that those who opposed the Treaty are not the cause of that, I will only point out to the Minister for Agriculture, and the members here present, that if they take up the daily papers and read the <Col N="389" /> names of those attending Farmers' Unions and Landlords' Unions, they will find the names of hundreds who employ only a man and a dog.  These are the men who support the Treaty because they are the men who never did any service to their country.  They want to live in luxury at the people's expense, and all through the west of Ireland there are big ranches that would not be allowed in any country in the world outside the prairies.  In Munster especially such a state of affairs is very rare.  In my constituency which is more or less the biggest agricultural district in Ireland, the majority of the farmers are not large landholders.  They all give a good deal of employment.  Last year the prices for their produce did not enable them to make ends meet.  I do not see that the Minister for Agriculture is taking any steps at all to remedy that state of affairs.  Another thing, as he has taken over the Department of Agriculture, he is not giving it the attention that he said he would.  He is functioning not as Minister of this Dáil, but as Minister of another Government.  And to give you an instance of how he is doing it, he has one office belonging to this Dáil and he is never there at all.  If you want to find him you never find him in that office at all.  He is doing the work of this Dáil, not in that office, but in the office of the Provisional Government.  When he wanted to collect the Land Annuities in the South of Ireland, and when he wanted to get decrees, did he hand the collection of those annuities to the Republican solicitors who would bring them before Republican Courts?  He handed them over to the Crown prosecutors who are the persecutors of the people.  He tried to bring them into an English Court, and he stands up here and says &ldquo;I am the Minister for Agriculture in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  He is nothing of the kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. LORCAN ROBBINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief remarks upon this report.  One of the questions with which we have to deal is the question of transport, the organising of agriculture. There is no organisation of agriculture in this country and no efficient transport. This is a matter that cannot be dealt with except by a native Government. The fall in prices has hit farmers very hard and there is a great need of organization, a great need of the creation of industries and the development of industries associated with the land.  We want to improve and develop the bad roads and we cannot do that until there is a stable and settled form of Government in the country.</P>
      <P>There is another question.  In the country there is a large population of young men who would have gone to foreign parts if we had not compulsorily prevented them.  They have no employment, and the employment will have to be provided for them.  A division of the land, a division of the large ranches, will have to take place and if it is not done soon we will have a landwar, because those young people will not be kept out of a way of living, and the sooner this Dáil realises that until we have a settled Government, to divide up that land by compulsory sale, and to settle the landless men on it, you will have a great deal of dissatisfaction and grumbling.  I know from my own part of the country we are straight up against serious trouble in this matter, trouble that no Government will be able to control, and sooner or later a very sound and definite policy will have to be devised by the Government.  This is one of the things that this Dáil ought bear in mind.  The members of this House know perfectly well that there is now authority to get these things done, and that they can be done by native Government, and the people will tolerate no more delays.  I would say to the Dáil to admit that.  I have had experience myself in my own Comhairle Ceanntair of the difficulty of holding back young men from compulsorily breaking in and taking possession of these lands.  If present conditions go on for three or four months more I have only to say that I do not think the people will tolerate the delay much longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. ETCHINGHAM:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish fisheries are in a bad way.  I will not attribute that to the signing of the Treaty, but the causes he has outlined have, I must say, contributed to the position.  Unless they are to be wiped out altogether something must be done to cope with the situation.  The returns <Col N="390" /> for the month of January last show that both the quantity and the value of fish landed in Ireland were just about one-half of what they were in January 1921, the figures being 15,053 cwt. and £14,888 as against 31,086 cwt. and £30,766, or a reduction of 16,033 cwt. and £15,878.</P>
      <P>In the same period Scotland had a decrease of £487,507 for January 1922 compared with January 1921.</P>
      <P>Our chief foreign &ldquo;Freshing&rdquo; or fresh fish market, is England, and here there is an over supply due to the visits of boats from the Scandinavian countries, and from Germany.  There is an extraordinary effort made in Germany to improve the fishing industry and fishing companies there having an aggregate capital of 13,594,000 marks in 1913, had increased that amount to 74,000,000 marks at the end of last year. Five new companies have been formed. One paid 5 per cent., two 8 per cent., five 10 per cent., two 15 per cent., one 16 per cent., one eighteen per cent., five 20 per cent., and three 25 per cent. interest on capital last year.  The Ger-Steam Fishing fleet had increased to about 350 vessels at the end of last year.  Ireland sends consignments of fresh herring and mackerel to England but the delays in transit by rail and boat often result in the fish arriving in an unfit condition and the merchant receives a wire &ldquo;consignment unsaleable&rdquo; or some such communication.  The Irish fish trader with England has no one to look after his interests there, and is at the mercy of the ring.  The salmon fish trade in London is practically in the hands of a few who control the prices; Irish salmon is always graded as inferior to English or Scotch.  The last returns I have seen quote the top price for Irish salmon as 2s. 9d. per lb., the English and Scotch as 3s. 1d.</P>
      <P>The cured fish market for Irish mackerel is chiefly America.  Here Irish mackerel, chiefly owing to inferior grading and packing, is noted as second class.  The price obtained for the best Irish fish there in March was 30&mdash;32 dollars per 250&mdash;300 count.  The tariff to be imposed under the Fordney Tariff Bill will practically ruin this trade.  The proposal is for 1 per cent. per lb. including the weight of the &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; container and the brine pickle and salt. The last advice from New York states &ldquo;Action duly expected soon, probably 2 dollars per barrel.&rdquo;  It was proposed that the impost be 5 dollars per barrel. Mr. Fawsitt when in New York worked hard to prevent the imposition of this tariff, and here in Dublin we sought to get the Irish curers to form an association for which he could speak but they would not agree.  Mr. Hugo Flynn stated that as he handled 10,000 barrels annually he could not be associated with a curer handling 100 barrels.  I hope Mr. Fawsitt's successor in New York is carrying on the same activity.  There is an opening there for cured herring. Scotch-cured herring realised 30 dollars per half barrel in New York in March last.  The Russian pickled herring trade is apparently lost to Ireland.  I note that the Norwegian Government have entered into an agreement with the Russian Government for the supply of 400,000 barrels of spring herring and about 394,000 cwts of salted herring. The agreement involves a sum, at normal exchange of £1,000,000.  Norway shows the best example to Ireland.  During the past months the Norwegians placed Cod Fish on the market at San Francisco, sent via the Panama Canal, and sold it at 2 cents per lb. cheaper than the Americans could sell their cargoes from Alaska.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering the foreign situation it is more and more necessary that we should develop the home market.  Ireland certainly is, as has been described, &ldquo;the worst fish-eating country in the world.&rdquo; We must institute a strong campaign to establish a fish market at home, and such an effort must receive the financial support of the Government.  At the Economic Council we agreed to protection for Irish fish, inasmuch as the free importation of fresh fish from England was to be prohibited.  We know that large quantities of fresh fish come to Ireland from the English markets.  The fish comes in small parcels direct to the wealthy consumers and to public institutions. If the Dublin Fish Market was assured of a regular supply and the importation of fish from England was prohibited we could do much to cope with this trade.  Dublin merchants would be willing to engage in it.  There are many causes preventing development of our home markets.  One is the delay and the cost of transit by rail. Even with the material to hand at his fishing centre the Irish fisherman cannot get his catch to market.  In this connection I note that the fish merchants of Aberdeen have, owing to railway <Col N="391" /> charges, installed a system of road transport to Glasgow.  They find the cost of transport per ton works out at £1 8s. 0d. while the cost per rail by passenger train is £3 14s. 0d. per ton and per goods train £2 16s. 0d.  It has occured to me that we might institute a system of road transport from say Galway to Dublin.  The distance is about 126 miles.  A motor lorry say carrying a couple of tons could do the journey in 10 or 12 hours to Dublin and could supply such centres as Athlone 53 miles, and Moate 10 miles further on.  Road transport has the advantage over rail that the fish can be delivered at the distributing depot thus saving cost of carrying to and from the railway stations.  I think it possible for the Minister to obtain a couple of lorries for this work.  I have noticed a few passing through the city of late.  I would suggest to him to start with Galway as a fish supplying centre, and it could be arranged that Arran and Gorumna would come to the Galway Port with their catches.  If the fisherman were told they must gut and clean the fish, it would save them much in the way of perserving the freshness of the fish. There were instructions issued as to method.  It is essential that the fish be bled immediately they are taken from the trawl.  Given a fair trail it would be found to be successful.  Other centres could be aided.  Such an attempt would in my opinion, do much to establish home markets and would also give assistance and encouragement to the fishermen.</P>
    <P>The fastest of the motor boats now idle could be employed to police the waters of the three mile limit.  Such a proposal is before the Scottish Drift Net Fishermen's Association.  The Inland Fisheries cannot be developed to their proper extent until much of the existing obstacles are removed.  The rights, so called, granted by a confiscating English King are in the way of the common people, who fish for a livelihood.  They are almost all in favour of the pleasure seeker.  All this will need legislation.</P>
    <P>Every country having a sea coast line gives governmental aid to develop the fishing industry.  The Danish Government recently recommended a sum of 700,000 kroner, about £35,000 to be lent at 4 per cent. to Danish fishermen, to enable them to provide boats and gear for those lost in recent storms.  The Swedish Government within the past few months advanced 1,137,400 kroner, roughly £56,000, as a loan to provide new boats and gear.  Motors are to be provided.  The repayment of loans extends from 5 to 8 years.  I noticed that Mr. Mortensen, the Danish Director of Fisheries, in explaining the indirect subsidy for a steamer carrying fish to the English &ldquo;Freshing&rdquo; market stated that all countries give financial support to their fishermen.  The policy of the English controlled Boards will not, I am certain be followed by the present Minister.  When possible I hope he will proceed with the organisation of the Irish fisheries on the lines of Co-operating Fishing Societies with a Federation. This will alone ensure control of the industry and the establishment of a national brand, a guarantee of quality and quantity.  It has been described as a quasi-socialistic policy but this will not make us afraid to follow it.  It is the one way of ensuring the fisherman the fullest profit possible for his labours, and it will, I hope, receive the sanction and assistance of the Irish Government.  I think the Minister agrees with me that such organisation is necessary and I hope that the new Government that is appointed here, under whatever conditions you appoint it, will follow upon those lines.  The Fishing Industry was altogether neglected in Ireland.  You had some derelict harbours that should be some great fishing centres but the purpose of the Government was to force the men into the English navy.  We want our men at home to man the future Mercantile Marine.</P>
    <P>I would try to urge upon the Ministry and I will ask the assistance of the whole House, apart from politics, to try and establish home markets.  You could not, I believe, devote money to better purposes, because, the fishermen are in a very bad way, around the whole coast of Ireland.  I think that something could be done in that direction.  And now that there is freedom of action&mdash; (&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; and laughter).  Yes, there is freedom of action.  Don't try and bring politics into this.  I don't think, so far as I have learned, the thing has extended outside the coast as yet. I have never heard of fishermen ambushing each other in the boats. We would want to get rid of that, and I would urge that we devote some money to the development of the home markets.  I think it can be done by motor transport, and with the assistance <Col N="392" /> of the members of this House, irrespective of whether they are pro-Treaty or anti-Treaty, and with the public Press outside it can be done.</P>

      <P>I would like to supplement what Mr. Etchingham has said with regard to Irish fisheries.  He has dealt fully with sea-fisheries, but the thing wants a little more extension with regard to inland fisheries.  I would like to enquire what steps are being taken by the Department of Fisheries to prohibit the destruction of spawning salmon and trout while in fresh waters.  It is a matter of common knowledge that this destruction has been going on in an aggravated form for the past few years and is bound in a very short time to have a serious effect on the earning of numbers of men who are engaged in the fishing industry at the estuaries of the larger rivers around our sea-board. From recent personal observations of some of the southern rivers which are the hatching beds of the spawn of salmon and trout I was amazed at the almost depleted conditions they presented.  The fry of the salmon and sea trout leave the rivers when about 14 months old, leave the fresh water for the sea.  These fry return if they escape destruction in the sea waters.  They return at some time or other to the fresh waters, and mostly to that part of the coast from which they came, and often times to the same river in which they were spawned.  It naturally follows if there is a wholesale destruction of the parent spawning fish a general depletion will follow, and with a scarcity of salmon in the river the result would be loss of employment to those engaged in the fishing industry in tidal waters, and loss of good food for the community.</P>
      <P>With regard to the protection of spawning salmon, unless some steps are taken there will be no fish returned to the rivers.  There will be no necessity to undertake any expense whatever.  The first essential in the matter is, I think, the protection of the parent-spawning fish. I would suggest that this ought not be made a party question, and with a view to having something done at this Session of the Dáil, I would suggest that a Committee be formed to deal with the matter, and that they would meet and report to the House and that something definite should be done with regard to the protection of spawning fish.  The Minister for Finance may try to shelve this because of the expense, but this thing could be managed by an efficient police force that would not entail much expense.  Some Committee should be set up to deal with the matter now.</P>

      <P>Níl puinn agam le radh.  I want to put a brief question to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  There was an expenditure for the development in respect of the fisheries in Tirconnail and Lough Swilly. For many years continued pressure was kept up for the purpose of providing reasonable accommodation for the large fisheries on the coast of Donegal.  It is a very congested area and the people largely lived from the profits they derived from this fishing industry.  After extended labours the people there succeeded in securing a grant from the Development Commissioners of £35,000 on condition that £10,000 was given by the County Council.  The County Council agreed to this, and the plans were issued for tenders and I think that the tenders had been received when the war broke out.  The matter then stopped at once, and the thing lay in abeyance until the end of the war. Immediately after steps were taken up <i>de novo</i> and the Development Commissioners stated that the original plans would now cost £75,000 and that they would increase their amount from £35,000 to £75,000, and the County Council agreed to increase their grant also.  I want to know what has happened to that grant, or how does the matter exactly stand, with regard to these harbour developments on the coast of Donegal?</P>

      <P>I would like to urge that the action outlined should be taken soon.  It is satisfactory that the Minister recognises that the work must be done but he gave no indication of when he proposed making a start.  There is no work of more immediate urgency than this, because until this work is done claims and payments for special grants which have been submitted to the House by the Department for Local Government will be coming along, as unfortunately in almost every district or in the vast majority of districts acute distress prevails, and not merely casual distress but in those districts distress is continuous.  And it will continue until the Fishing Industry has been simply recast and revised from the <Col N="393" /> beginning and end, not merely in the matter of treating the fish but right from the start, and in the matter of equipment of the fisheries themselves.  There is one particular reason which makes it very urgent just now.  In some of those districts where the population has been accustomed to migrate yearly that migration has been held up and it is quite possible at the moment that in a comparatively small district in Cork one would find at present as many as 1,000 people more than were ever there before. They are there, because the migration was prevented.  At present permits for emigration are being issued.  Other attempts are made to relieve that state of affairs but they can only be unsatisfactory and temporary efforts, because owing to the nature of the district and the circumstances of the people there the one hope for permanent or satisfactory relief lies in the helping of the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ceannt made the usual charge against me that my particular Department was not acting up to its pre-Truce level, and that charge has been made against practically every Minister who read his report here. But not a single fact or figure or attempt has been made to substantiate this.  As far as land settlement is concerned, I am quite willing to be judged by results.  And the report says as far as land settlement is concerned twice the area of land has been dealt with.  In addition to that, about 60,000 acres of Land Bank land&mdash; that was what Mr. Art O'Connor was referring to&mdash;which was practically idle, to my own knowledge, for three years. was divided and 230 families have just been placed on that land.  Now I could very easily enter into airy schemes about afforestation, water-power and that sort of thing, and let it at that.  They would look well in a report, but I consider there is real solid work being done, when you take large tracts of land that had been idle and undivided for a great number of years, and put 230 families on that land &mdash;230 families that would otherwise have to go to America.  I agree with Deputy Art O'Connor in a lot of what he has said.  I believe that farming is an industry, and I agree with him in saying it is an industry that should be faced like any other industry.  And to have increased tillage and ideal conditions farming must be made to pay.  If you cannot show the farmer that the work you ask him to do will bring him a fair remuneration, like everybody else gets, he will not do it.  I agree also that we are suffering from re-action from the prosperity of the war days.  But that is all the more reason why the developments and reconstruction are necessary just now.  And under present conditions developments and reconstruction are quite impossible.  I am not complaining about our not shaking hands with each other, or smiling at each other, or anything like that.  There is no necessity to do that either.  What I am referring to is what you read every day&mdash;reports of bank robberies, and post offices, interference with road transports, burning of houses and so on.  It is not politics or propaganda to say that all these activities are having a deleterious effect on agriculture, and agricultural industries as well as any other industry that is affected.  That is a fact, whether it is politics or not.  I will give you a concrete example.  Land purchase is a very serious and important thing in agriculture. Now that finances of the old Acts have practically broken down for a number of reasons Stock is at 62 per cent. and it is very hard to make a bargain or to do equity between two parties when stock at 62 per cent. has to be accepted.  Consequently the Acts are broken down.  We realise that the first duty of any Government is the completion of land purchase.  We are ready to complete land purchase.  Our schemes are ready but we do want legislation. That is a matter of a week or a fortnight, but it is quite impossible under present conditions to adequately deal with land purchase, for this reason, that the financial credit of the country is not able to bear it.  Everyone knows that the money that is advanced to the tenant for land purchase is borrowed by the State.  It would take something like three or four millions a year to keep land purchase going at the rate that it should be going. I am not speaking of giving extravagant prices to the landowners.  It does not matter much what price could be arranged.  With an efficient Land Commission you can do justice to the landlord and the tenant; you can finance land purchase practically without cost if you have the credit of the country, and if you are able to issue stock on such terms that the interest will not be too high, and that the stock itself will suit the landlord.  You would not get a million pounds on the Irish market <Col N="394" /> if you issue a loan under the present conditions.  While you have two armies in the country&mdash;three, and shortly four or five&mdash;you will not get anything like what would be adequate to keep land purchase going at anything like a normal rate.</P>
      <P>I would like any Deputy in the House to solve that problem.  I would like to get anyone's help.  I want to get one constructive suggestion to get out of that difficulty.  You will not get money for land purchase until things are normal. We have our schemes ready and are held up because the credit of the country under present circumstances is not able to finance land purchase on any scale that would be adequate to the problem to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ceannt complained that the Land Commission went into the British Court to recover their annuities.  There are no such things as British Courts in this country, and I make no excuse for going into our Courts to collect any debt that is due to the State.  But the point I want to come to is this.  At the present moment there are about £150,000 of arrears of Land Commission annuities since September.  That annuity used to be paid with extraordinary regularity, and that was a very important factor in keeping land purchase going as it should go.  The Irish farmer was showing that he was a good investment. At present, as you see, there are very large arrears.  Now it is not because of upholding the Republic that these are withheld.  It is not to help any side that they are withheld.  They are withheld in a great many cases by people who are always ready to see the chance of putting money in their pockets at the expense of the State and at the expense of their neighbours.  Every penny of that money is money lost to Ireland.  That is direct loss.  And the indirect loss is much greater.  As I said, national financial credit is almost as delicate of adjustment as individual credit, and the withholding of these annuities will have a very bad effect upon the country.  When the Government goes on with land purchase again this will be a serious handicap. The business man and the capitalist are not thinking about the recognition of the king; they are thinking of getting a safe investment for their money.  You must remember that once you touch national credit it takes a long time to revive.  The capitalist will remember that land commission annuities were held up this year and he will conclude that the next time there is a chance they will be held up again, and you will find it exceedingly difficult to get money on really reasonable terms.  This fact has made the completion of land purchase very difficult and the farmer who at the present moment has his annuity in his pocket is standing between his less fortunate neighbour who has not purchased and the purchase of his holding by that neighbour. He is putting money in his own pocket, and helping to keep his less fortunate neighbour from purchasing his holding.  I would like that to be known.  Now let us come to industrial agriculture.  In that connection, I would mention first the Drogheda Dead Meat Scheme.  If there is one industry in this country that should be developed, both as a paying proposition and as an insurance against possible developments in the country it is the Dead Meat Industry.  Probably the best equipped Dead Meat factory in these islands is in Drogheda.  At the present moment that factory is there idle after having cost £600,000 for building the factory and putting up the plant and everything necessary to carry on a fine trade.  That factory could be had for £200,000 this minute.  But no one would buy it.  I have been using every effort with business men to get them to re-open that factory.  I have met all sorts and conditions of people. They wont put their money in it.  Do you really expect business men to put money&mdash;to put their capital&mdash;into factories when they see houses burned, shops commandeered, goods seized, railway lines broken up and the banking system ruined?  That is called propaganda politics but really I must say that I admire the assurance of the business men that could get up and contradict me on that point.  No man who knows anything about business will agree that you can get business men to invest their money under such conditions. That is now an example of the industrial side of agriculture.  You can't get industry going under present conditions.  I can understand the man who will get up and say&mdash;who will admit the present conditions&mdash;but who will say that there are such great issues involved that these others pale into insignificance.  I can understand that. But when I hear well-meaning people get up and admit the conditions but say they don't matter that is a thing I <Col N="395" /> can't understand.  These are the facts in regard to the two large aspects of this matter.  Now I spoke about land purchase and I asked for a suggestion as to how it should be carried out and financed.  There is an attempt being made to deal with the land problem by way of confiscation and I was expecting that some men on the opposition would get up and denounce that.  It was up to any man who had the interest of the country at heart to denounce that.  I expected that every man no matter on which side of the House he was would denounce that sort of thing.  It was bad enough when this thing was dictated by mere greed.  But when notices like this are served on Protestants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to talk about this problem of confiscation.  That seems to be the alternative to land purchase.  But I think certainly it ought to be of interest to every man to denounce it.  I would like to know if it is the policy of any one here on one side or on the other side to permit that sort of the thing to go on.  This is one example of the things which I wanted to give which make it exceedingly difficult for the Land Commission, or the Congested Districts Board, to deal with the really difficult problem&mdash;the problem of the western seaboard.  The Congested Districts Board are at present operating in parts of Galway.  They have built houses and they have mapped out holdings with the idea of bringing migrants from congested areas where there is no chance of land.  Local landless men have gone in and seized these holdings. Now you have only one way of dealing with this problem and that is by migration.  And the confiscation that is going on at present is making it impossible to deal with it.  The really important aspect of it is this&mdash;whether you are for or against the Treaty you must all admit that English interference with agriculture has ceased absolutely. Illegal action of that sort while the English were here was necessary, absolutely necessary.  It was, I might say, virtuous.  But, with the English going, the illegal action of that sort is a crime. Now, you cannot shift it over on the English on this occasion.  You may say that the people are dissatisfied with the Government.  If they are they can change it, and the sooner that is realised the better.  Illegal actions in this matter, taken against Irish services, run by Irishmen at the present time, are quite different from action taken against a foreign Government.  We ought not be deluded by making a parallel with the conditions that existed when there was an English Government here.  Illegal action should be denounced by every man who realises that distinction.</P>
      <P>Now with regard to fisheries I do not think I would say very much about fisheries, because Deputy Etchingham, who is an authority, has told you himself all of what I intended to say.  I agree that immediate action is necessary. I am asked by Deputy Donal O'Callaghan why it is not taken.  I pointed out that there has been no adequate assistance given to Irish fisheries for the last thirty or forty years.  The scheme that had been started had been inadequate and had been allowed to fall through, and the industry has got into such a condition at present that if you want to start now it must be altered radically.  Very big schemes must be put into operation. It would take a long time to gather the necessary information.  In the meantime, we can only deal with matters like giving relief to men who in the good times have been lent money by State Departments for the purchase of boats.  If you plunge into this question it is a very big question.  Deputy Dee mentioned that spawning beds were being interfered with and ruined all over the country. I quite agree, because I know where a man put in a million salmon and I know what happened.  Here is a letter I had from a fishery owner in the west.  I will read an extract from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Since 1905 I have turned into the waters running into the Killory over one million fry, the increase of salmon in the river has been more marked.  Formerly two boats earned a precarious living at the fishery and now 15 boats earn a living.  However, I am sorry to say that all my waters have been <Col N="396" /> systematically poached by men who say there is no law now, and the fisheries are free to everyone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a specimen of what is happening. Mr. Dee suggests a conference. That is the usual way when you want a thing shelved.  Has the man who makes such a suggestion any perspective?  Set up a Commission to prevent spawning beds being poached, while the whole banking system of the country is threatened by bank robberies.  There is no perspective in a man of that mind, who wants protection for spawning beds, at the same time that there is no protection for the whole banking industry of the country.</P>
    <P>In regard to Mr. McGoldrick's question, the Development Commissioners do not admit that they agreed to provide a sum of money.  They did agree before the war to provide a certain sum of money.  The sum was increased afterwards, and though they say they gave a sort of provisional acceptance they do not agree that they entered into an absolute agreement.  At the present time we are in negotiations with the Development Commissioners, and we are trying to get them to acknowledge liability for very large sums of money in which that sum was included.  I am not in a position to say what the ultimate result would be but we are hoping that we would get some of it.  This industry is in our hands now, virtually.  It is a most serious thing and if we fail at it then we have nobody but ourselves to blame.</P>

      <P>I crave the indulgence of the House to assure the Minister and the members generally of the other side that as far as I am personally concerned, and I am sure there are many members of the Party here that would agree with me, that on these matters of land and notices of confiscation I have no sympathy with the tactics indulged in by certain people. While the British were in occupation of this country and fighting against us very bitterly, a proposition was put up to me many times that we should retort by not paying land annuities.  I declined to agree to that policy on the plea that it was killing the credit of the nation, that even though the English were our enemies, the Irish people had contracted to borrow a certain sum of money on certain terms and that they should fulfil the terms of that contract.</P>
      <P>With reference to confiscation I do not sympathise with that at all.  If people think they are entitled to certain land, and if they have a reasonable claim they should proceed to the ordinary Dáil Éireann Land Courts which are there available.  And so much so did I believe in that that I have always acted on it up to the present.  Two days ago I gave that self-same advice to a party in this House who received a request from a party who wanted to go into land and take it up forcibly.  I do not approve of the confiscation of the lands of any individual. The only parties in this country who have any power to order lands to be dealt with in any particular way for the benefit of any individuals, or of the community in general, are the Government of the Republic and that is Dáil Éireann.</P>
