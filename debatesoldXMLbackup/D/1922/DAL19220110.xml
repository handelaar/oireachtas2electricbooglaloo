    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> THE SPEAKER (DR. EOIN MAC-NEILL) took the Chair at 11.30 a.m., and said: </P>
    <P>A telegram has been received from Cardinal Gasparri, Papal Secretary of State to the Vatican.  My knowledge of Italian does not enable me to read it. The English translation of the telegram is:</P>
    <P>“The Holy Father rejoices with the Irish people because of the understanding or agreement, and prays that the Lord will send His blessing on the noble chosen people which has passed through such a long sorrow, ever faithful to the Catholic Church.—Cardinal Gasparri.”</P>
    <P>The telegram is addressed to the President, Dail Eireann, Mansion House, Dublin. I suppose when the Dáil makes its arrangements for carrying on, a reply will be sent in due course. I have received the following communication:</P>
    <P>“To Professor Mac Neill,<br />
Speaker, Dáil Eireann.<br />
Monday, January 9th, 1922.<br /><br />
I am directed by the National Executive of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, the national exponents of the will of the organised workers of Ireland now in session, to request that the assembly will receive and hear a deputation on matters of extreme urgency and gravity affecting the lives of the people whom they represent. The desire of the delegation is to impress on An Dáil the political and economic situation in the country; the great problems of unemployment; reversion to grass of hundreds of thousands of acres of land in the present year; the imminence of a vast industrial upheaval due to attempts to degrade the standard of life of the people; and to call attention to the necessity for the functioning of a stable authority which will exercise power and authority in these urgent matters.<br /><br />
I am, faithfully yours,<br />
Thomas Johnson, Secretary.</P>
    <P>I understand the delegation is waiting to be received. A delegation can only be received here if it be the will of the Dáil, and that would require a motion duly moved and seconded. It is also understood that when a delegation is received here there is no discussion in the presence of the delegation. Its statement is simply received.</P>

      <P> It will be agreed by everybody here that in every critical stage of our history a great and potent weapon which was always at our disposal, was to be found in the body to whom we are giving permission to address this House to-day. It is well, from many points of view, that the country should know the views of Labour from the economic standpoint, and it is also well that we should learn whatever there is to be learned from the difficulties and drawbacks under which Labour is suffering at the moment.</P>

      <P>Item number three on the Agenda is a motion by Mr. Michael Collins &ldquo;that Mr. Arthur Griffith be appointed President of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  I take it that the first thing that it is necessary for us to do is to make arrangements for the administration of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. M. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that I do this is that the Irish nation at the present moment is a ship without a captain, and a ship, we all know, cannot get on without a captain.  I want to move this motion so that we may have some captain for the ship.  I saw a thing happening down at home years ago that I can illustrate my remarks with, I think, in an apt way.  I remember one day passing along the road and I saw two horses standing in a field with a plough behind them, and there was no ploughman.  I watched that thing for about two hours, and the ploughman was still absent.  The horses that were able to plough were idle&mdash;there was no ploughman between the handles.  There was no work done.  Now, a bad ploughman is better than no ploughman, and the Irish nation is watching us at the present moment; in the same way as I watched that scene they are watching us. They see the horses idle, the plough idle; they see that we are doing nothing at all; they see that we are not taking action to put any sort of ploughman between the handles.  I knew where the ploughman was.  He was in some place wasting his time.  We are very much before the Irish nation at the present moment in the position of that ploughman. Some people know where he was all right.  We must form some kind of a staple Government to stop the position of anarchy that we are allowing the country to drift into.  Here is a thing that is typical of what is happening. Everybody knows&mdash;no one better than the men from the South of Ireland&mdash;that I hold no brief for the <i>Cork Examiner</i>; but I have received this letter and it is typical of what will happen in the country if we allow the present state of affairs to continue.  The writer of the letter &mdash;George Crosbie&mdash;is no friend of mine (Deputies: &ldquo;Nor ours&rdquo;).  The letter is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Knowing as I do the intense strain you must be under for some time past, I am loth to trouble you, but I feel it is incumbent on us to explain how we are situated.  At two o'clock this morning the copy of a proclamation which appears in to-day's paper was brought into us, and we were ordered to insert it.  You will understand that things may appear in the <i>Examiner</i> published by us under duress.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, if the <i>Examiner</i> had any pluck it would not publish anything under duress.  At the same time I call those methods Black-and-Tan methods, and, I am against Black-and-Tan methods, no matter where they appear.  If this motion is accepted I can only suggest that the position would then be in our hands to make the best we can of it, and to report to some future meeting of the Dáil.  The position of drift is the worst of all positions, and we have said a good deal about our being here, talking.  I feel that members know I adopted that attitude at meetings often before.  They know I never believed it was at meetings work was done, because while you are at meetings you cannot do any work.  We are here talking day after day, and we are getting no results of any kind.  Any kind of action is better than no action. Supposing, for instance, that Mr. Griffith is beaten for this&mdash;what position are we in then?  We are in the position of not being on one side or the other.  It will simply be a position that will make us more and more laughable.  In my estimation we have given the NorthEast of Ireland every excuse for not coming in.  They would say: &ldquo;Who would go into a body like that, with the methods they employ, and the uselessness of their discussions?&rdquo; We are also giving the English an opportunity for remaining here.  I can only see it in this way.  I will use the word &ldquo;obstruction.&rdquo;  The tactics are obstructionist tactics.  It is all very well to say <Col N="393" />&ldquo;We will not interfere with you.&rdquo;  I have heard a thing this morning that shows that the interference has already started. Why should not the departments of Dáil Eireann function?  Why should not the Labour Department, for instance, go on with arbitrations?  Why should there be an attempt by anyone to stop its officials from going on with arbitrations which would help the country and prevent it from getting into a chaotic state? It does not matter who is at the head of that department, so long as it is officiating for the Irish nation.  The opposition side want to retain all the machinery.  They want to say to England: &ldquo;We are still unfriendly,&rdquo; and then they want to turn round to us at a later stage and say: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  Without the co-operation of the departments&mdash;whatever the co-operation of individuals may do&mdash;this thing cannot be a success; and on the people who will prevent this being made a success lies the responsibility, and not on us.  That is what I want to say before Ireland.  It is on the people who will prevent it, and on the people who are employing these tactics, the responsibility rests and the cost of failure rests&mdash; if there is failure.  That is what I want to say here publicly now.  The only way to get rid of it is to accept things in the spirit of good-will.  Does anybody think if England does not fulfil her promises I will be less against her than ever I was?  Does anybody really believe that if England does not fulfil her promises any one of us will be less against her?  I mentioned yesterday the case of the signed cheque.  The answer was that maybe the funds were not there to meet it.  You can test whether the funds are there or not by the signed cheque, but you cannot test it by an unsigned cheque.</P>

      <P>You can test whether the funds are there by the signed cheque but not by the unsigned cheque. It is only by passing this motion we will show that we are capable of doing something constructive, and that we will show that we are capable of running the affairs of the nation.  It is only by passing this motion we have any sort of constitutional authority here.  This is a body of the representatives of Ireland. I regard this body as being the Sovereign Assembly of the Irish nation, and we are responsible to the people who sent us here.  The fact that the sovereign capacity of this Assembly should be questioned by anybody shows that we ourselves do not regard ourselves as being what we are.  I always regarded the Dáil as being the Sovereign Assembly of Ireland.  I regard it as being the Sovereign Assembly of Ireland still, and it does not make it less sovereign because Lloyd George says it is not.  It is not what Lloyd George says.  It is what the Irish people say.  It is not what the English Parliament says.  It is what we say.  The English papers called us a murder gang.  The Irish people did not believe we were a murder gang.  If the English Parliament called this Assembly illegal I did not regard it as being illegal. I do not regard it now as being illegal. I do not take my opinions from the English side.  I take them from the Irish side.  It is in that spirit that we can make this Treaty a success, and that we can make the Irish nation a success.  It is only in that spirit.  It is not by words and formulas; it is by heart and soul. We must see by now that we have talked long enough, without doing anything constructive; and this motion will enable us to do something constructive. The difficulties we may be faced with cannot be overstated.  Any young government&mdash;I can see the difficulties that come before it.  I can see the frightful difficulties.  Every new government has these difficulties to go through.  Some of the governments that have been started in Europe found their difficulties enormous.  You have only to point to any one of these new governments that have been formed to see that up to the present moment it is an unstaple government. My belief about the thing is this: that whether we like it or whether we do not, the world is entering on a different era.  My belief during the war was: that the plain people of France and the plain people of Germany knew some better way of adjusting their difficulties than by killing each other. That is my belief still.  And about the people of England, my belief is, that unless we show that we do not mean to be hostile, the people of England are a great deal more kingly than the King.  I know very well that the people of England had very little regard for the people of Ire-ernment&mdash;<Col N="394" /> land, and that when you lived among them you had to be defending yourself constantly from insults.  Every Irishman here who has lived amongst them knows very well that the plain people of England are much more objectionable towards us than the upper classes. Every man who has lived amongst them knows that they are always making jokes about Paddy and the pig, and that sort of thing.  Every man who has lived amongst them appreciates that it is harder to get on with them than with those of the English people who understand us better.  If we show that we are going to operate from the outset in a spirit of hostility, that will give the English their excuse for remaining here.  If we show, as we have been showing as best we can that we are unable to carry on, England will say, and say with a certain amount of truth: &ldquo;I am afraid we will have to remain in Ireland to preserve law and order.&rdquo;  That is what the Americans say when they go to preserve law and order in Mexico.  I do not know whether there is not a certain amount of reason for the Americans going to Mexico to preserve law and order (&ldquo;question&rdquo;). I suggest that we should get some kind of agreement on the majority side; anyway we should get some kind of agreement that we would be allowed to go on with the work without prevention, and that this motion can be passed, if not unanimously, at least without dissent.  I do not want to commit the other side to approval of this motion.  I appeal to them for the sake of Ireland to let this motion go through, and give Ireland a chance (applause).</P>

      <P>I rise to second the motion moved by Mr. Collins.  I have only one or two words to say.  In the first place, I feel very much that our President thought it well to place his resignation in our hands. Now that the Dáil has approved of the Treaty it is but right that the majority should choose their captain, and we have chosen Mr. Griffith.  It is not necessary, at all, for me to emphasise the claims that Mr. Griffith has in the presence of this Assembly.  The members of this House know him as well as I do.  All I want to do is to say with Mr. Collins: now that the Treaty is approved of we should get on with the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. CEANNT:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite evident now to every member of this Dáil, and to people outside, that the one ambition of those who are supporting the Treaty was to get rid of the President of the Republic, and to substitute another Minister for him.  The Minister of Finance has referred to a letter from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> stating certain things had to be printed in the <i>Examiner</i> last night or this morning.  That shows how the feeling in the South of Ireland is, because of the <i>Examiner</i> misrepresenting the views of the people.  It is now we are beginning to hear the voice of the people. These are the people who saw their city devastated by the Black-and-Tans, who saw the tragedy of Kerry Pike, who saw the whole County of Cork left in ruins. They are beginning to have their voice heard now.  I remind the Minister of Finance that he was not so scrupulous going into an office here not many years ago, when we had a hostile Press; and I would remind him also that not long ago the <i>Examiner</i> and the Crosbies were recruiting sergeants for the British Empire.  They see now that they cannot run against the wishes of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="MR. MACENTEE MR. MACENTEE">
      <NameTxt>MR. MACENTEE:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I rise simply to state that I, for one, cannot support the election of Mr. Griffith as President of the Dáil.  In doing that I want to make it clear that we on this side do not question the right of the majority of this House to select their leader, but we do question, very, very strongly, the wisdom of selecting as their leader the man <Col N="395" /> who was bound by his signature to bring down the Irish Republic.  No one would question the urgency of selecting or electing a Chief Executive Officer now, but the urgency of the matter is no valid reason why such a step should be taken without very great and very grave consideration. We all know the ship wants a captain&mdash;we all know the horses want a ploughman&mdash;but we should take care not to select as captain of the ship the man who is bound by his signature to wreck it.  We should take care that the ploughman we are going to choose is not the one who is bound to root up the Irish Republic.  I say we all know, whatever else we may do, we ought not to do that, because it is unnecessary that we should do it.  It is not essential, in order that the English may honour the agreement which they have signed, the agreement which they have entered into with the delegation, that the Government of the Dáil should be the Provisional Government of the Free State. It is not.  I go further; I say it is not expedient in the interests of those who stand for the Treaty that any man who signed the Articles of Agreement should be President of the Dáil.  I say that in taking the step they are taking to-day, the other side are going further than their signatures warrant.  When this is being done I can only hark back to 1914.  I can only recollect what happened then to the Irish Volunteers.  We all know, how, when it seemed likely that Mr. Asquith, another English Liberal, was going to trick another Irish Constitutional Nationalist, the people of this country sprang to arms in his defence, but Mr. Redmond, anxious to prove himself a man who was better than his word, acting at the behest of Asquith, set himself to capture the machinery of the Volunteer organisation in exactly the same way as those who support this Treaty are attempting now to capture the machinery of the Republic.  That, Sir, we all admitted, was the gravest tactical mistake which Mr. Redmond made.  If he had gone forward and said: &ldquo;I fulfilled the letter of my bond when I kept you here in office for these years, I will go not one whit further, I have no authority over these people, I cannot compel them to dissolve.  I will not attempt to capture them,&rdquo; instead of this country being faced with the betrayal of 1914, the Irish Volunteers would have been there to uphold and support Mr. Redmond, and would have been there to do a great deal more. When the European war broke out they would have been there to set up the Republic and they would have been there to uphold it as the majority of the people of this country.  Now, I say that those who are asking us to hand over to them the machinery of the Republic of Ireland are doing it gratuitously, and that is what, to me, is the bitterest thing about it.  It is not necessary it should be done at all, but it is being done, as I said before, in order to prove once more to Englishmen that Irishmen were better than their words.  They are doing gratuitously what Mr. Redmond was compelled to do under coercion in 1914. I say not only is it unnecessary, but it is inexpedient.  I say, furthermore, that it is very dangerous for the future of the country that it should be done. Those who stand on the other side, and I know that they stand there in good faith, because they believe they are doing the best for their country in this crisis, should look back over the many years of history.  They never saw one Treaty signed by England with Ireland that England did not dishonour.  Have they any assurance that this Treaty will be honoured either?  They have nothing except the seven signatories who are members of the English Government which can change from day to day.  Those who stand on the other side may be, themselves, very quickly floundering in the sea of English treachery.  For goodness sake, let them leave the Irish people some rock firm enough to cling to, some rock whereby they may scramble back to the dry land of the Republic.  It may be, in suggesting this course, I am not taking the attitude which will appeal to a man who has had twenty years of experience in public life, and who, if he will permit me to say so, has brought nothing into this Dáil as part of that experience, except the pettiest tricks in public debate I have ever listened to.  That gentleman never rose in debate, since this grave and vital question came to be dealt with, to consider it upon principles, but upon personalities.  His avowed function in this House was not to convince but to amuse.  I do not want to follow his bad example, but in his discussion on this question he made personal references to my stature.  If I am little it is not my <Col N="396" /> fault.  But, Sir, if I were to consider a grave question introduced by the little Emperor, by the little Wizard of Wales, and the little Pope of Rome, and ask no man to give it grave consideration upon that account, I should have thought my words had little sense and little weight. Now, Sir, I say this may not appear to be strictly in accordance with all the practices of the Dublin Corporation and the South Dublin Union.  But a nation in a grave emergency like this must look, if you like, for some unusual expedient to get out of it, to tide it through, at any rate; and therefore, while it may not seem to be strictly in accordance with precedents, it is in accordance with principle that now, while we are in a transition state, some transitional or neutral Executive should be formed for this House.  Since that cannot be done&mdash;they on the other side will not permit it to be done&mdash;all I can say is, that I am compelled to vote against the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="MR. DE VALERA MR. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, what troubles me most in this matter is the whole question of the position we are placed in.  I would like to ask the Chairman of the Delegation, Mr. Griffith, whether, if he is elected, he intends to act and function as the Executive of the Republic, because this is the Government of the Irish Republic and nothing else.  When we meet here we do not meet as a political party; we do not meet here as the Parliament of Southern Ireland or anything of that sort.  We meet here definitely as the Government of the established Republic of Ireland, and any act whatsoever of ours which is not in accordance with that is unconstitutional.  Now, Mr. Griffith can have no fault to find with me for bringing this forward, for this reason: when he was in London I wrote to him definitely and pointed out that if any arrangement was come to, very great care would have to be exercised as to the manner of procedure by which any transitional Government should be set up.  This is the first example of the difference between Document No. 2 and the Treaty, and it will stand up in judgment against you more times than now.  There was an arrangement here&mdash; a transitional arrangement.  I will read the paragraph.  It will show, at any rate, that it is not tactics on my part:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That by way of transitional arrangement for the administration of Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the setting up of a Parliament and Government of Ireland in accordance herewith, the members elected for constituencies in Ireland since the passing of the British Government of Ireland Act in 1920, shall, at a meeting summoned for the purpose, elect a transitional government to which the British Government and Dáil Eireann shall transfer the authority, powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties, provided that every member of such transitional government shall have signified in writing his or her acceptance of this instrument.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is obvious that if a Treaty had come here which it would be constitutional for us to ratify as the Government of the Republic that a Provisional Government would have to be set up, and that it would have to derive its powers&mdash;seeing it is contested &mdash;we hold this would have to be signed by both parties, and therefore it would have to be a neutral document.  The powers of that Provisional Government should be derived, from our point of view, which is the only point of view Irishmen will stand for, solely from this body.  It will have no authority from the Irish nation unless it gets it definitely from this body which is the Government of the Irish Republic.  As far as the British point of view is concerned, any claim that authority comes here from the King and Parliament and the rest of it&mdash;we deny that, and we will die denying it.  I am sure nobody here will say for a moment that the authority of Ireland comes from any outside body.  We are now in the position of Grattan and Flood.  Flood said it was not the same thing to assert a thing yourself as to get acceptance of that assertion by other persons.  You have simply the assertion now.  That is no use.  If somebody tries to press a claim on to you, and he admits that claim is not founded, or accepts some agreement which implies it is not founded, then there is no dispute.  The assertion on our part is always in danger of being contested by someone else.  Therefore I say peace is not established by that Treaty, because the contest will go on.  Britain will assert <Col N="397" /> that it is from it we derive authority. We assert it is from Ireland.</P>

      <P>This Assembly has no right to disestablish itself, or vote away the independence of Ireland. You have no power whatever unless it comes from the Government of the Republic which is established.  Hence I say, if Mr. Griffith takes this Chief Executive, it is from this assembly. He can only do it undertaking it is going to function as the Executive of this assembly; that is, the Executive of the Government of the Republic of Ireland.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, in October, 1917, after three nights discussion, Mr. Griffith finally agreed to the inclusion of this clause in the Constitution of the Sinn Féin Organisation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sinn Féin aims at securing international recognition of Ireland as an independent Irish Republic.  Having achieved that status the Irish people may by referendum freely choose their own form of government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If Mr. Arthur Griffith had not agreed to that he would not have got the support of the people who are prepared to make any sacrifice for Ireland.  He agreed to this.  He got their support.  He has broken that undertaking.  Before he and the four delegates went away to start these negotiations, Mr. Griffith agreed that they would not come to any decision until they had at first submitted it to the Cabinet at home, and awaited the reply from the Cabinet. He also agreed that they would not sign any Treaty until it had first been submitted to the Cabinet here.  On the Saturday before this Treaty was signed Mr. Griffith undertook to tell Mr. Lloyd George that, though he was not prepared to break, nevertheless he would sign nothing, and would come back to us having signed nothing.  Mr. Griffith has broken that, and consequently, no matter what undertaking he gives now, I object to his being elected as President of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The questions, I think, which the Deputies refer to were sent across by Mr. Stack.  They are:</P>
      <P>(1)  Whether he had any communication, direct or indirect, from the British Government, in connection with the Treaty?</P>
      <P>The only communication I had was this produced here, except one where he stated it was not a Treaty, and I got the official title: &ldquo;Articles of Agreement between Ireland and Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(2)  Whether he had been informed what kind of legislation they proposed to pass in the British Parliament in order to carry into effect the Articles of Agreement?</P>
      <P>The legislation they will pass must be a Free State Act.  Of course, they must pass an Act of Ratification.</P>
      <P>(3)  Who would summon the members of the Southern Parliament, and when?</P>
      <P>I will have them summoned.</P>
      <P>(4)  Whether the proposed Provisional Government would be elected by and from these members?</P>
      <P>They would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> (5)  Whether the Provisional Government would act in conjunction with the Lord Licutenant, and would it function under the statutory powers conferred by the Partition Act?</P>
    <P>If it is necessary to use the Lord Lieutenant as it is necessary to use liaison officers we will use him.</P>
    <P>(6)  What were the powers referred to in Clause 17 of the Treaty which would be transferred by the British Government to the Provisional Government?</P>
    <P>The general powers for maintaining law and order, police, and the evacuation of the country by British troops.  These are the answers to these questions.  As to Mr. Boland's question and President de Valera's question: if I am elected I shall use my position to give effect to the constitutional vote of this assembly in approving of the Treaty.  I shall use the resources at our disposal for the keeping of public order and security until such time as we can have an election for the Free State Parliament, and at that Free State Election I will let the will of the people decide whether we have a right to accept the Free State, or whether they wish something else.</P>

      <P>We want to know definitely.  If you want them as a volunteer army, all right, but if you are going to order them as the Army of the Republic orders will have to come from the person who is elected as the Chief Executive Officer of the Irish Republic. I want to know definitely if Mr. Griffith is going to be President of this assembly as the Chief Executive of the Irish Republic, as the President hitherto functioned?  The reason I want to know is this: if he is not going to do that, I hold that this assembly is no longer the Sovereign Assembly of the Irish nation, acting as the Government of the Irish Republic which it is officially called.  This is, in the army and elsewhere, spoken of as Dáil Eireann, the Government of the Irish Republic. Therefore, if the Chief Executive Officer is elected, to have legal force his orders must come from him as such, and I want to know before I vote for him&mdash; and I am asking that, not merely for myself, but for every member on our side&mdash;we want to know definitely where he stands in that matter.  Any vote taken, inconsistent with the position of the Republic as established, we hold is unconstitutional and illegal.  The Treaty was approved, but, in a sense, this delegation did not act in accordance with the letter of the Treaty.  You do not approve of anything you please. You approve of a definite written Treaty.  If you fulfil that you will have to do this&mdash;you will have to carry out Article 17 to the letter:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By way of provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the Constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State in accordance therewith, steps shall be taken forthwith for summoning a meeting of members of Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and for constituting a provisional Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>does the British Government not question Dáil Eirean doing it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;And the British Government shall take the steps necessary to transfer to such provisional Government the powers and machinery <Col N="399" /> requisite for the discharge of its duties, et cetera.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under that it is the British Government that has to transfer to you the powers.  If you look at Document No. 2, Dáil Eireann gives you the powers. Otherwise you would be acting unconstitutionally. We hold this Government has not the authority of the Irish people until the Irish people have voted on it. Take your powers from the British Government and set it up.  What does the vote in this assembly mean?  It means that we will not, as the Government of the Republic, interfere with you; that you have, so to speak, a license to carry on.  If it were not for that we would have to take action to prevent you from doing anything counter to it, as we would against Dublin Castle; but you can now go ahead by reason of the vote of the majority of this assembly to carry out that Treaty to the letter. That is what it is, and nothing else.  I hold, therefore, if you want as the majority of this assembly to elect a President of this assembly, he will have to act as the Chief Executive of this of the Government of the Republic of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="MR. DE VALERA MR. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair answer.  I feel that I can sit down in this assembly while such an election is going on, because it is quite constitutional that Mr. Griffith, if elected, is going to be in the same position which I held, which is President of Dáil Eireann; that is, President of the Government of the Republic of Ireland. Now, the next question.  As President and Chief Officer your duty will be to uphold and maintain the Republic of Ireland.  That is your oath.  You will, as President of that be in duty bound to uphold the Republic, and that was why Document No. 2 was so necessary. That is why I, as President, would not be keeping my oath if I did anything to subvert the established Government. Mr. Griffith will similarly be bound by that oath as I was, and he will have to give an express undertaking that he will not use his powers for anything except to maintain the established Government during the period until the other government is set up.  In other words, whatever you do, that you will not use your office when acting as President of the Republic of Ireland in any way to subvert that Republic; that you will do nothing which will make that Republic less a fact in the minds of the Irish people than it is to-day.  I hold you will be breaking your oath of office if you do anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="MR. DE VALERA MR. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I kept it to the letter.  That is the difference <Col N="400" /> between Document No. 2 and the Treaty.  You will see that I preserved in every line of it the established Republic.  There is not a line of it inconsistent with the Republic, but there was what any Government might do, what France might do, what America was going to do, what some of them have done&mdash;go into the League of Nations and accept, if they wished to, any member of the pre-constituted group as President or head.  I, therefore, say in reply to the question asked as to how I interpreted my oath, that I interpreted it in that fashion.  I kept it, not merely for the interests of Ireland, but I kept it in the negotiations to the letter.  Otherwise I felt I would be using personal views or something else to subvert my sworn oath as head of the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="MR. GRIFFITH MR. GRIFFITH">
      <NameTxt>MR. GRIFFITH:</NameTxt>
      <P>President de Valera has asked me will I use my office to subvert the Irish Republic.  I think I have already answered the question, but I will answer it again.  I said if I am elected to this position I will keep the Republic in being until such time as the establishment of the Free State is put to the people, to decide for or against.  But if it means am I not going to carry into effect, the will of this Sovereign Assembly about the Treaty, I am going to carry it into effect.  This body has approved of the Treaty, this body wants the Treaty put through and then sent to the Irish people.  That I am going to do, of course.  Now, as to Mr. Mellowes' question: &ldquo;If he is elected President and Prime Minister of the Dáil in accordance with the Constitution, will he give an undertaking that he will not use the Executive authority of Dáil Eireann to summon and work the Provisional Government appointed according to Articles 17 and 18 of the Treaty?&rdquo;  I do not quite understand that question, but I expect he means this: we must set up a Provisional Government under Articles 17 and 18.  We are not setting up the Free State Government now.  Of course, I am going to use all the machinery I can to put it into operation.  Let nobody have the slightest misunderstanding about where I stand.  I am in favour of this Treaty.  I want this Treaty put into operation.  I want the Provisional Government set up.  I want the Republic to remain in being until the time when the people can have a Free State Election, and give their vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMacSwiney" hpid="MISS MACSWINEY MISS MACSWINEY">
      <NameTxt>MISS MACSWINEY:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I think this is a very serious matter. The President has asked certain definite questions.  Mr. Griffith has answered that he will undertake to uphold, or rather that he will keep the Republic in being until a Free State Constitution is worked out.  Now, I begin by quoting a leading article from the <i>Times</i> this morning.  I think it will keep us quite clear:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann, acting for the people, has endorsed the Treaty; that is, it has by a majority approved of <Col N="401" /> the Treaty.  To-day we hope that it will authorise Mr. Griffith to summon the Parliament of Southern Ireland for some day in the present week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what Mr. Griffith is looking for authority to do from this Republican Government of Ireland.  We must be quite clear, and I think Mr. Griffith's answer has made us quite clear that Mr. Griffith means to use his authority as Chief Executive to get Dáil Eireann endorsed by Mr. Lloyd George as the Provisional Government of Ireland. That includes the four members of Trinity College and the exclusion of Seán O'Mahony.  Mr. Michael Collins, in his speech proposing the motion before you, talked in his usual bluff, good-humoured fashion, of any kind of action being better than no action. Now, I maintain that is absolutely wrong on the face of it.  Is it better for me to sit quietly and do nothing or to go out and murder somebody?  Surely no action in that case would be infinitely better than any kind of action.  Mr. Collins suggests that he and Mr. Griffith should be calmly allowed to murder the Irish Republic.  He said many things, and I am going to deal with the chief points in his speech.  But one thing he said which is important: &ldquo;that Dáil Eireann is not going to be more solemn&rdquo;&mdash;he had said it was the Parliament of the Irish nation.  He said it was not going to be more solemn because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MR. COLLINS MR. COLLINS">
      <NameTxt>MR. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>More &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMacSwiney" hpid="MISS MACSWINEY MISS MACSWINEY">
      <NameTxt>MISS MACSWINEY:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is still more important.  It is not going to be more sovereign because Lloyd George says it is.  There is the cat out of the bag. The English morning papers are full of the difficulties with which the English Government is faced in legalising an assembly which will be the Provisional Government of Ireland; and Mr. Lloyd George played up to the sentiment of the Irish people by letting them think Dáil Eireann is going to do this thing. Not only that, but two members of the delegation have been carefully playing up to the sentiment of the younger members of this House throughout the whole of the negotiations.  Mr. Michael Collins' speech this morning was absolutely along those lines.  Dáil Eireann is the sovereign Parliament of the Irish nation but it is expressly, under its Constitution, the Government of the Republic of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Mr. Griffith is looking for the Chief Executive power of this Parliament to-day; and he has been asked if, before accepting it or asking us to vote on it, he will give us an undertaking to uphold the Republic in virtue and in accordance with that oath.  He has also been asked if he will give an undertaking that he will not use the powers vested in him to summon or work the Provisional Government according to Articles 17 and 18 of the Treaty.  He has stated, in answer to another question that he is to summon the Provisional Government, or rather, a meeting of members elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland. Now, Mr. Arthur Griffith therefore has to act in two capacities.  He has to act, if he is elected by this House this morning, as Chief Executive of the Irish Republic.  He has also declared he has to&mdash;he has been deputed by Mr. Lloyd George&mdash;to summon this meeting of the members who are to appoint a Provisional Government.  All we ask from Mr. Griffith is a solemn undertaking here <Col N="402" /> publicly in this House, and before the country, that he will not confuse or merge the two offices, that he will keep distinctly here in Dáil Eireann his Executive power as Chief Executive of the Irish Republic, and that, as plain Mr. Arthur Griffith without any authority from Dáil Eireann, he will go out and summon the Provisional Government apart from this Assembly altogether or summon the meeting of members elected to sit for constituencies in Southern Ireland.  Now, we want Mr. Griffith to-day to give a solemn declaration in this House, and before the country, that he will not merge those two offices into one, that he will go as Mr. Griffith, Chairman of the Delegation, and summon the meeting that is to set up the Provisional Government; that he will act as Prime Minister of this Assembly; and that the two Mr. Griffiths will have no connection whatever, as far as their offices go.  That is what we are asking &mdash;Mr. Griffith's solemn undertaking before this House and before the Irish nation.  Surely that is clear.  And I appeal to the members of this House who have voted for the Treaty, and who, in voting for the Treaty, have declared again and again that they are not voting against the Republic&mdash;and I believe them&mdash;I believe they were perfectly honest in declaring that in voting for the Treaty they are not voting against the Republic.  They voted against the re-election of President de Valera yesterday because they were told it had to be a party vote; they were told that if they voted for President de Valera they would be voting for the rejection of the Treaty.  I appeal to them now with all the force that is in me to realise the great importance to the Irish nation of keeping Mr. Griffith's two offices absolutely and entirely distinct.  Do not allow Lloyd George to endorse Dáil Eireann&mdash;it is what he wants to do&mdash;as the Provisional Government, and to invite the four Trinity College members into it and exclude Mr. Seán O'Mahony. Mr. Seán O'Mahony cannot be excluded from Dáil Eireann, Mr. Arthur Griffith.</P>

      <P>Every representative in Ireland&mdash;even in the North-East Corner&mdash;is a member of Dáil Eireann, and if he only comes in and sits here we will welcome him if he takes the Oath of Allegiance.  Moreover, every member in Ireland cannot sit in Mr. Griffith's parliament, or at the meeting of members summoned for constituencies of Southern Ireland.  Before Mr. Griffith can use this Assembly in order to set up his Provisional Government he has to exclude Mr. Seán O'Mahony, and Mr. Seán O'Mahony is the test in this case, because he is the only member who sits for a constituency in what is called Northern Ireland, and has no seat in Southern Ireland, so-called. Further, and I ask you young men of this assembly who mean the Republic but who are voting for its subversion, to think carefully over this&mdash;if you elect Mr. Griffith without first getting a declaration from him, given to us solemnly here and to the Irish nation, that he will not combine the Executive power of Dáil Eireann with his office as Chairman of the Delegation to summon the meeting for Southern Ireland&mdash;I ask you to do that&mdash;that Mr. Griffith if he dares to use this Assembly, or the sixty-four members of it that support him, because he cannot use us, will first exclude Mr. Seán O'Mahony.  Nothing would please Mr. Lloyd George better than that you, by your vote here to-day, should elect Mr. Griffith as Executive of this Assembly and then let Mr. Griffith, as Executive of this Assembly, summon this meeting to set up a Provisional Government, because then he would be able to say that Dáil Eireann sanctioned the setting up of the Provisional Government.  Dáil Eireann has not done that.  Now, Mr. Collins asked us do we believe that he will be less against England if she breaks her word than he has been in the past.  No, I do not, in heart.  I believe he would be as much against her, but he is taking away from himself the power to be against her.  It is not the will he is taking from himself; it is the power, and well England knows it.  In my hotel this morning I sat at breakfast and heard two Englishmen discussing this matter. One said to the other: &ldquo;They will have to disestablish that Dáil Eireann before they can set up the Provisional Government.&rdquo; Now, that is what Mr. Griffith is asking you to do&mdash;to disestablish Dáil <Col N="403" /> Eireann as the Sovereign Assembly of the Irish Republic, and set up an emasculated thing which will be the Provisional Government and, having done that, then this emasculated Assembly with the best gone from it, will appoint the Provisional Government and set up the Free State.  That Assembly will not be Dáil Eireann, because, unless Mr. Griffith definitely gives that solemn promise to-day&mdash;that he will not combine the two offices, or, failing to give it, unless he is beaten in this Assembly to-day he and everyone who votes with him is automatically declaring himself guilty of treason, and voting himself out of Dáil Eireann.  You do not kill Dáil Eireann, but you kill your own right to use the name.  Mr. Collins has also said that he does not mind calling it Dáil Eireann.  This meeting does object to this evil thing&mdash;&ldquo;Call it Dáil Eireann, or get some other Irish name.&rdquo;  You cannot call it Dáil Eireann because Dáil Eireann has been declared by the people to be the Government of the Irish Republic, and has been given that mandate and nothing else.  Mr. Collins has also said that the North-East will say so and so; that they cannot come in while we talk and not make up our minds.  We have made up our minds definitely.  We have not changed them. They have.  He also says that England will say they will have to remain in the country to preserve law and order.  Let her say it; she has been saying it for a very long time, but never before drew from a Republican a desire, in order to win Mr. Lloyd George's good opinion, to subvert the authority of the Irish Republic.  That is what it is&mdash;subverting the authority of the Irish Republic. We will maintain law and order all right. He says we will give the English an excuse for remaining in the country. Very well.  The Irish Republic, when Mr. Collins has come back to his senses and to the Irish Republic, will be able to teach Mr. Lloyd George that it is the best of his policy to get out of our country.  If this subversion of the Irish Republic should be forced on the country by a majority here, the Irish Republic cannot and it has no desire, I understand from President de Valera, to actively oppose the Provisional Government, but that Provisional Government is not, and will not be, Dáil Eireann.  Dáil Eireann remains the Government of the Republic of Ireland. Mr. Michael Collins was also very emphatic about what the attitude of the English would be.  There he contradicted a statement of his own a few moments before, that we were entering on a different era, and that the French people and the German people, if they had been consulted in the matter of the war, would have a different solution of the war from the one their Governments had.  We all agree with him, I am sure.  Were we to get the opinion of the English people on the President's alternative&mdash;there are things in it unpalatable to most of us, but there was no subversion of the Irish Republic.  Now, that is what matters.  Mr. Griffith will remember that before ever this Session of Dáil Eireann met that I remonstrated with him about the signing of that document and said to him: &ldquo;take out the Dominion status, the Governor-General and the oath and even now we will stand together for the rest of it.&rdquo;  That shows that I, even though I would not like to give England a penny, or let a soldier of hers in our ports, am quite willing to realise that on account of our propinquity to England we will have to give up a little of the inessentials. When I say inessentials I do not mean money is not an essential, but I do mean it is not a principle.  I would give England money, as I said before, in exactly the same spirit in which I would give a robber a reward for giving me back my purse.  As to the attitude of the English people over there about Paddy and the pig, my own impression was that we had outlived that by about fifty years.</P>

      <P>We are discussing what Mr. Collins said&mdash;that the attitude of the English people was very insulting towards us, and that he had often heard insulting remarks about Paddy and the pig.  I quite agree with Deputy O'Maille that it is tee-totally and entirely out of order, but it was Mr. Collins brought it in, not I.  It was brought as a red-herring across the trail to show the English people are not friendly.  Perhaps!  But they are friendly to themselves, and the English people will not go to war on the difference between what Mr. Michael Collins is willing to give and what we are willing to give; and if they have any sense at all the English people will know from the debate here that we are in a position to deliver the goods, and that the delegation are not.  There is my point. They must know that this Republican minority of ours is as anti-English as ever it was, and that this Treaty of theirs will not mean peace.  They must know perfectly well that we will go on subverting their influence and their interests in every part of the world where England's interests lie.  Therefore, when we say we are willing to make peace on certain terms, we are not only willing to do it, but we are able to do it.  The Chairman of the Delegation and the whole delegation with him&mdash;bar one member of it, who has stood out supremely honourable though, I must confess, weak&mdash;who wants us to take this thing now, is not playing for peace with the English people.  They cannot, between the whole lot of them, deliver the goods because, I hold, the Irish nation gave them and gave us their mandate; and we are true to our mandate, while the majority of this House who supported the Treaty were false to it.  I ask this House in voting on this question to get from Mr. Arthur Griffith the undertaking that we want him to give us and to the Irish nation publicly to-day&mdash;that he will not, as Chief Executive of this House, summon that meeting; that he will only do it as Mr. Arthur Griffith, Chairman of the Delegation, not as President of An Dáil; that he will not use Dáil Eireann note-paper to summon that meeting, that he will not use any single official title given him by Dáil Eireann, or any official paper, or anything else of Dáil Eireann.  If he gives us this solemn declaration then we can, as long as he is Executive of this House, forget he is Mr. Arthur Griffith, Chairman of the Delegation, and summoner of the meeting for the Provisional Government, and we can stay with him here still; but if he does not give that undertaking solemnly and publicly here without any evasion, then we can no longer have any hand, act, or part in this thing; and I ask the younger members of this assembly to realise what they are doing and support us in asking Mr. Griffith for that undertaking.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose the motion that Mr. Arthur Griffith be Premier of this House.  Mr. Griffith, in his answer to one of the questions to-day, admitted that he was palpably tricked by Mr. Lloyd George.  Mr. Griffith, when he got this document, found it was labelled &ldquo;Articles of Agreement.&rdquo;  He sent it back to Downing Street, and some clerk there blotted out the words &ldquo;Articles of Agreement&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;Treaty,&rdquo; and when he had that done he thought he had got a Treaty.  In an answer to a question put by him to Mr. Lloyd George within the last few days he found he had no Treaty at all.  Now, as regards the Presidency: it is necessary, I understand, that the head of every State when assuming office shall, by solemn oath, give an undertaking to maintain the Constitution of that State.  That is a precaution that all States have found <Col N="405" /> necessary for their own existence.  Now, I want to ask Mr. Griffith is he prepared, if elected, to give that undertaking by solemn oath, that he will preserve the Constitution of this State, which is the Irish Republic?</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to the motion now.  I asked some questions before.  I just want to say this: that I think the other side know me sufficiently well to know I am not doing this through tacties, or trickery, or anythink of that kind.  I am doing it because I know the condition of the country, and I know perfectly well that if the Chief Executive of this House does not send orders as the Chief Executive of the Republic of Ireland, he will not be obeyed, because the men will be automatically dispensed from their oath of allegiance.  I want to see that the thing is done in a proper constitutional way, so that there will be no way out of it. I was opposed for election last night on the ground&mdash;a very good ground it was &mdash;that, as I was opposed to the Treaty, it was presumed I would work for the Republic as against the establishment of the Free State.  The position I would occupy would be a very difficult one, in which I would be, by the terms of my oath, faithfully bound to take active steps to maintain the Republic, which would be made difficult by the vote of this Assembly.  Now, take Mr. Griffith's position: it is doubly difficult because he is supposed with the right hand to maintain the Republic and, with the left, to knock it down.  I say it is a mistake for any individual giving this support to become a Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in the matter.  He cannot do it.  No matter what Mr. Griffith says or undertakes to do, every Republican in the country will be suspicious of every act he is taking in the name of the Republic.  It does not conduce, I hold, to the maintenance of order, or it is not to the interests of the country at the present time, that Mr. Griffith should hold that office.  He will understand that, as far as I am concerned, my sentiments are practically the same with respect to him.  I am not opposing him in any personal way, but for the good of the country.  I say when I took the oath I adhered to it to the letter.  I was so sensitive on that point and about the obligations of my oath as Chief Executive Officer, that I said they would have to remember, if they did elect me, that I would interpret it in a certain fashion.  I felt then, even with that explanation that, nevertheless, it was my duty to obey that oath and carry it out to the letter in so far as I was able. If there was a settlement that would make it consistent I would be on the other side, if I was in a minority of one. I am on this side definitely, because the arrangement is not in accordance with the oath and the position I occupied; and because I believe that I could get an arrangement that was; and I felt that as long as that arrangement was possible, I would not be doing my duty to the Republic or acting in the best interests of Ireland.  Mr. Griffith cannot take that oath; he cannot act as Chief Executive Officer of this Republic, bound with his right hand to uphold it, and bound to another undertaking which means that with his left he is undermining it.  I say it is an impossible position.  I only ask for the good of the country that Mr. Griffith would not take that office; that he would allow some arrangement to be made by which somebody who could act as Chief Executive Officer of this assembly&mdash;who will act and be bound to act on behalf of the Republic&mdash;would do so; and that Mr. Griffith would go on and carry out what this House has approved of, namely, the terms of that Treaty.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I have often heard candidates for office being invited to give pledges in consideration of support which would be extended to them if the answers were found satisfactory, but this is the first time I have heard a candidate being asked to give pledges, being listened to giving these pledges, and then being told that, having satisfactorily answered the questions he would be opposed more strongly than ever.  That strikes me as a totally novel departure. The key-note of this debate really lies <Col N="406" /> in the statement made by President de Valera yesterday: &ldquo;Addressing a silent and solemn Assembly,&rdquo; as the newspapers say, he said: &ldquo;I suggest that the first business should be to make arrangements for the continuance and government of the State.&rdquo;  That is what we are up against.  That is what has to be done.  Let us face facts.  I made my own position pretty clear on the Treaty. I do not like it; I never did like it. There are many others who think with me about it, that it is a bitter thing to have to accept, but that we had to accept it because we saw no real alternative. A point was made against the other side, and fairly made, during the debate, that they were a coalition; some of them, for instance, taking one view about the oath, others taking a vow for life to the Republic, and so on.  I say in perfect fairness that we are a coalition, too; because it is obvious that, just as the degree of opposition to the Treaty on the other side varies with different people, so does the degree in which persons on this side like the Treaty, although they all agreed to support it as a matter of necessity; and the degree with which they like it varies, too.  Necessarily, under circumstances of this kind, you will have to deal with a coalition, because a sudden and unexpected turn of events has taken place; and people have had to make up their minds upon developments which they had not looked forward to before.  But this much is clear: up to now the English have looked upon this country with contempt&mdash;up to the recent fight&mdash;and the reason why we have got to the present position of having terms offered us by the English is because that contempt has given way to healthy fear, and it is our duty to see that healthy fear remains, and that we do not give them any reason to resume their former attitude by adopting an unreal attitude in this assembly.  I should like to remind the Deputies of the other side that the first article of the Constitution says: &ldquo;That all legislative powers shall be vested in Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  And therefore it was for Dáil Eireann to approve of that Treaty, and no other body whatever had authority from the Irish people to approve it and make that approval binding.  Dáil Eireann has approved of the Treaty and it follows, as night the day, that it is the duty of Dáil Eireann to take the steps necessary to give effect to that approval. The Minister of Finance spoke yesterday on the question of funds, and, I take it, he gave very adequate evidence of the fact that he intended to deal absolutely fairly with those who disagreed with him in that important matter; and I think that those who are against the Treaty, knowing the persons they have to deal with on this side, may fairly rest assured on that at all events. But those who are for the Treaty are entitled to ask for fairness from them. Anyhow the Republic goes on, and must go on until it is superseded by the Free State.  That is unanimously agreed. The Republic goes on, and the Republic must have a Government.  A proposal was made yesterday on behalf of those against the Treaty that President de Valera should be re-elected.  They put forward for re-election their best man, and Dáil Eireann declined to re-elect him, many of us voting much against our own will.  We felt it was the only thing to do because, in view of your vote on Saturday, you would have been making yourselves ridiculous in the eyes of the country and in the eyes of the world if you did otherwise.  It is admitted you must have a government. Surely that government must be a government representative of the majority of this House.  What alternative is suggested to us?  I have heard none.</P>

You must set up your Provisional Government&mdash; get the English out and take over the powers that lay in their hands.  But I yet have to hear any suggestion from the other side as to what is to be done for carrying on the Government if you do not elect a representative of the majority to carry it on.

      <P>He gave plain straight answers to the questions put to him, and the result of that apparently is, that having answered those questions, and recognising that the Republic would continue, and recognising every item he was asked to recognise, he is now told, having done his best to satisfy these men, that they are going to vote against him.  What answers did they want to get other than the answers he gave?  I fail to see for what purpose these questions were put, unless that they mean&mdash; in this way&mdash;&ldquo;answer these questions in the way we think they ought to be answered and we will vote for you.&rdquo;  I have not heard on what principle those answers are considered unsatisfactory, and if he gave a straight answer, then I say that the people who put these questions ought to support him and to recognise that they themselves are in a minority and that you cannot govern this country by a Government that represents the minority and not the majority.  There is one thing more I would like to say.  It is this: it seems to me this question of the Republican Government and the Provisional Government is really a much simpler one than it looks.  So far as the Irish people are concerned, the Government elected by Dáil Eireann will be the Government of the Irish people.  In the transition period, when you have agreed to take over from the usurping English Government the powers they have got in this country, when you have agreed that the machinery for so doing will be called the Provisional Government, which is working but which will not take over those powers, you will have, at the same time, the Government of the Republic, which must exist as long as the Republic exists, to keep the form of the Republic in being.  You will also have what I may call the machinery of government, which may or may not consist of the same Government machinery; the Government recognised by the English as Dáil Eireann would not be recognised for the purpose of carrying out the necessary arrangements to give Ireland the powers to which she is entitled.  I do not think any logical objection can be taken to that.  I will congratulate the other side. I do think, on the whole, they have shown a much more reasonable attitude to-day than they did yesterday.  If they are beginning to be more reasonable, I ask them to go a little further and recognise the logical outcome&mdash;the logical corollary&mdash;to the attitude they have taken of putting questions to the candidate for Premiership and getting the answers they expected and wanted to get, which is, that they should acquiesee in the Government of this country, instead of putting up a fictitious opposition.</P>

      <P>Yesterday that vote could have been taken before lunch.  An adjournment was moved by the majority and we know the reason why.  I just want to say a few words on this.  I am in opposition to the election of Arthur Griffith.  I am sorry for that, for old times' sake.  I say the answers we got to what we want to know were given us yesterday when the majority&mdash;we were in a minority of two&mdash;refused to elect Eamonn de Valera as President of the Irish Republic.  We got the answer then, and a writer in an English Sunday paper who was present here at the debate, in writing of Eamonn de Valera, said: &ldquo;There was one thing he might do; he might lead his country to disaster, but he would never lead it to dishonour.&rdquo;  It is because I am firmly convinced that the election of Arthur Griffith will lead Ireland to both disaster and dishonour that I oppose it. I have not an accommodating mind. Deputy Duffy says we have come here in a different frame of mind to-day. The only difference in my mind yesterday and to-day is this: that I am more sorrowful than ever.  I have never been pessimistic about the future of my country, but I was when President de Valera was turned down.  He talks of the healthy fear the English have or that they would not have negotiations. He talks of the unreal attitude of this Assembly.  Will that healthy fear be continued now when you elect Arthur Griffith instead of Eamonn de Valera? No!  certainly not.  I only wish to goodness that we could give to the Irish <Col N="408" /> people the private documents we had here at the Private Session of An Dáil. Every private document that could be brought up from the Cabinet of Dáil Eireann in Dublin was exposed to ridicule by party politicians on the other side.  I was very sorry for that.  The members of the delegation in London pledged their word of honour to Lloyd George and his men that they would not give to the Irish people nor to any one else these documents until Lloyd George would give them liberty to do so.  But if the Irish people had read some of these documents the Irish people would know that Lloyd George would look upon Arthur Griffith as a most accommodating man, as a man who would not let Lloyd George down, and he would know on the other hand, that Eamonn de Valera would not let the Irish people down, or the Irish Republic down, and he would have a healthy fear of Ireland as a consequence.  That is the situation. That is why I oppose Arthur Griffith, because he will have an accommodating mind, and he will not let Lloyd George down&mdash;and that is on record.  Now, if Arthur Griffith was the man he was when he ploughed the soil to make Ireland what Ireland is to-day, or what Ireland was last year, I would vote for him.  Over and over again he told us he was a Separatist.  He is not that to-day.  What is the consequence? We have it here with us. Now, in the <i>United Irishman</i> of February 22nd, 1902, he said, in ridiculing Sir Horace Punkett, that: &ldquo;possibly Sir Horace Plunkett may come to believe with us that the permanent remedy for Ireland's disease is separation, but his conversion is not likely.&rdquo;  That was written by Arthur Griffith in the <i>United Irishman</i> on February 22nd, 1902. What is the result to-day?  I saw a caricature of Horace Plunkett as a big fat bullock and Arthur Griffith as a little bottle of oxo (laughter).  Horace Plunkett, addressing Arthur Griffith, says: &ldquo;Alas!  my poor brother&rdquo; (laughter).  What a tragedy!  I say I will not make use of that in a public assembly&mdash;the picture, I mean (laughter). I am giving you a word picture of it with sorrow.  The Minister of Finance gave us a pretty picture.  I have often seen a team of horses under a plough. He wanted something to move the plough.  What has he got?  I have seen a team of horses galloping away from a gadfly.  And who is moving the plough. Put Arthur Griffith at the handles, but Lloyd George is the gadfly that stung the horses.  Lloyd George is the gadfly, and the team of horses is the Irish people. God knows, this terrible warble, if it is not squeezed out, what amount of worms it will leave in the Irish people. Now, the Deputy for Dublin spoke of maintaining the Irish Republic and Parliament. I was amused.  On Saturday afternoon, with agony, I listened to the statement that we never had a Republic. I was wondering what feelings Mr. Robins and others had about it.  We have a great number of Girondists in this assembly.</P>

Now we are going to maintain the Republic until we get the Free State into existence!  I am not a bit deceived.  I expected these answers.  I would not ask my old friend, Arthur Griffith, a question about it, because I know he is to put up the Free State and not maintain the Republic. I protest against degrading this Assembly so far as to make it the machinery for putting up the Free State. You cannot legally do so and, in God's name, summon this Southern Parliament and set it up, but do not degrade the name of Dáil Eireann with it.  God knows we have compromised enough, and it may be the last occasion on which I will address this assembly.  It comes to that.  It came to it yesterday when you turned down the only man that could make peace in this country&mdash;and you know it; the man all Ireland looks to and has trust in, that man you turned down.  And you knew perfectly well if you had elected him President of the Republic he would not have interfered with you so long as you were working for Ireland's good.  He has been ousted. Arthur Griffith cannot deny that he pledged his word to the President of the Republic and the Minister of Defence in the Mansion House, Dublin, on December 3rd, that he would not sign any document until he returned; and he did <Col N="409" /> sign and pledge his word to Lloyd George that none of these documents should be made public.

The first line of attack on us was that we had exceeded our powers.  President de Valera admitted that we had not.  On that Saturday after I came back I was at the Cabinet meeting, and I told them I would not break on the Crown.  I asked President de Valera himself to go to London if he wished.  When I was going away the President asked me to try and get the thing back to Dáil Eireann.  I tried, and I tried all I could, to get the matter kept back for a week. I could not succeed.  I was faced with the responsibility of signing or not signing. The responsibility was placed on me and I signed.  I protest against the misrepresentation that I was a man who pledged his word to something.  The Deputy for Wexford also charged me with something&mdash;he intended to convey to the Irish people that I, in some way, connived with Lloyd George.  That is a damnable lie and he knows it.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of the Delegation has stated in very plain language that a charge of mine, as he put it, is a damnable lie.  I was only repeating in connection with the Mansion House what has been repeated here, and what has been read in the newspaper.  He ought to be grateful to me for giving him an opportunity of making the explanation he did.  Another thing he charged me with was that I had spoken&mdash;and I did with sorrow&mdash;of an interview that he gave to the Press Association in London, immediately after the signing of the Treaty.  You can say what you like of that.  I have over and over again repeated it here.  I never heard a word of denial of it, nor I do not now.  What I complained of was that Arthur Griffith said seven-and-a-half centuries of fight was over&mdash;Irish liberty was won&mdash;and our people took it as such.  I was here on Saturday evening, and I am thankful to say he retreated from that and said anything may happen in ten years.  The Minister of Finance said like a man that this is not a final settlement.  I do not believe anyone in Ireland believes it is.  I made the statement because it is on record that Mr. Griffith said that Irish liberty was won.  Whether he thinks it or not I really am sorry for opposing him, for old times' sake, because he is the man who ploughed the soil, and a number in Ireland sowed the seed.  He does not seem the same man to-day that he was when he was in the plough before.  The plough he used then was the Sinn Féin plough&mdash;an Irish plough.  The plough he is using now&mdash;and he is coming to us under that plough&mdash;is a London-manufactured <Col N="410" /> plough, a Downing Street plough.  That is the tragedy of it; and no matter what he states he may do in the future, he has avowed that he will put up the Free State, which means the destruction of the Irish Republic.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I repeat now what I said before when asked the question.  As Premier I suppose I may say the Dáil and the Republic exist until such time as the Free State Government is set up.  When that Free State Government is set up I intend that the Irish people shall have the fullest power of expression at that election.  When the Dáil&mdash;the sovereign body in Ireland&mdash;passed that vote of approval of the Treaty, it was our business, and our duty to the Dáil, to see it carried through, and I regret, myself, that President de Valera resigned. When he resigned and automatically brought all his Ministers with him, Ireland was left without any Government.  Therefore, someone had to be proposed to take his place in accordance with the Constitution. Now, in accordance with the Constitution, the Premier proposes his Ministers and the Dáil ratifies them.  Now, I propose the six Cabinet Ministers for the Dáil: Finance Minister: Mr. Michael Collins.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>MR. THOMAS JOHNSON: Mr. Speaker, and Deputies of the Dáil, my first duty is to thank you for the privilege of allowing us to address you on these matters which were referred to in my letter.  We realise it is a privilege for us to come to address you; but we feel that we are, perhaps, in a somewhat exceptional position, inasmuch as we might have had the right to address the assembly had we considered, at the last election and the previous election, it was in the interests of Ireland that we should have gone forward as a Labour Party to seek representation in this Dáil (hear, hear).  The Executive of the Labour <Col N="412" /> Party was in session yesterday and reported from various parts of the country as to the situation as affecting working people in these various parts of the country.  We had been following the discussions here.  We knew the situation as well as the newspapers would tell us the situation, and we decided that, in the circumstances, it was desirable that we should seek an interview&mdash;to seek to meet you, at least, as a delegation officially representing three hundred thousand organised workers in this country. Our delegation represents all the various towns: Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Dublin and other towns, as well as some of the agricultural districts of the country.  I said we had refrained from contesting elections in the interests, as we thought &mdash;as we know&mdash;of national solidarity in the face of the enemy; in the face of the enemy of Ireland and the enemy of the working class&mdash; the capitalist imperialism in operation in this country.  We had reason to know&mdash;we had documentary evidence to prove&mdash;that in the minds of certain very high officials of the British Government there were hopes and beliefs, and their conduct was founded on those hopes and beliefs, that we would sometime in the struggle split off from the national movement.  That was one of the factors&mdash;a very important factor which determined our action at the elections.  As I have said, we had followed the debates intently, and we could not but feel that with the stress of the war, the critical periods, and the difficulties of administration, both the Government and the Deputies seem to have forgotten&mdash;in the stress of political issues&mdash;to some extent, that there was a social problem at home. There are at this time probably one hundred and thirty thousand men and women walking the streets, unemployed.  Tens, and twenties, and thirties of thousands of these have been only intermittently employed for the last year, or one-and-a-half years.  In every country in Europe all such people have been forced to agitate more or less violently against the powers that be.  But the feelings of solidarity with the nation which permeate the working class in Ireland have tended to restrain any action which they would naturally take.  We were in the position that we could not agitate with the British Government on such matters as social conditions.  We dared not agitate because of the critical nature of the situation&mdash;we dared not agitate against the Irish Government. The times have developed; circumstances have developed. Those times have passed and we are in the situation to-day that a very large proportion of the population is at its wits' end to know how things are going to move.  Thousands of children are hungry and naked, huddled together like swine in their so-called houses.  In all parts of the country we hear cries of desperation, cries of: &ldquo;What is going to be done for us?&rdquo;  These murmurs presage, in our minds, something like the tremors of an earthquake, and unless something is done rapidly&mdash;something effective &mdash;there will be a grave situation developing in this country that will be a problem for even an old-established government, let alone a new one.  The working classes in Ireland have taken a full share in this national struggle (hear, hear).  Individually and collectively the workers have borne their part (hear, hear).  They are prepared to do it again when the need comes. But I would like to say that, in so far as they are conscious of their purpose&mdash;and that applies to the greater part of the men who went into this fight for freedom and for Ireland's nationality&mdash;they went into the fight for freedom for the men and women of Ireland individually (hear, hear).  Freedom from bondage to wage slavery, freedom from bondage to the machine, freedom from bondage to capitalists and financiers in Ireland or in other parts of the world.  We feel, and they feel, that there must be something done immediately to lessen this burden that they are suffering. I say there are one hundred and thirty thousand unemployed up and down the country.  Farmers have their complaints, their grievances, their terrible trials at the moment. Merchants have their complaints <Col N="413" /> and grievances about bad trade, et cetera.  They can speak for themselves. They have the means to keep body and soul together.  The workers, for whom we speak, have not the means unless someone sees fit to give them employment. Twenty thousand of these men&mdash; more than twenty thousand of these men&mdash;are agricultural labourers; men who ought, at this moment, be preparing for next year's harvest. The problem that faces you and that faces the country is: that probably one million acres of land have gone out of cultivation during the last couple of years.  A million acres of land gone out of cutivation!  We have held, and rightly held, suspicions of the perfidy of England. We are aware of the risk, the danger there is that, when the time comes, when the opportunity serves, anything that has been promised will be withdrawn.  I want to suggest to you, Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen, that the best safeguard&mdash;the only real safeguard&mdash;in this country, is an ample, home-grown food supply (applause).  What you are allowing to be done is that that food supply is not going to exist.  You are going to be dependent on overseas food, and a blockade of the ports will bring Ireland to her knees.  It is imperative, in our view, that the land of Ireland must be tilled for the purpose of national defence.  Incidentally, it will mean the employment of the men capable of working the land (hear, hear). During recent years Labour in Ireland has developed a new consciousness of its position in social economy.  The workers have seen, and do see, that the land of Ireland, the resources of Ireland, are capable of keeping the people of Ireland in reasonable comfort.  It is for those who have power to organise those resources, the natural resources and the human resources, to provide these people with the means of living a decent life.  The workers are not prepared to go back to or continue the low standard of life which they have lived in the past.  I want you to bear that in mind very carefully. The workers are not going to be content to go back to the standard of life they lived prior to 1914.  Where attempts are being made, as they are day by day in all kinds of industries and occupations, to degrade that standard of life, it means that the workers are going to resist by whatever means they may think best.  The patience of the workers, of the people, of the poor unemployed, and the wives of the unemployed, is becoming exhausted. We want to impress on you this: there is an insistent and immediate need for these problems to be tackled&mdash;the problems of unemployment, tillage, housing&mdash;and they will not brook delay.  It will not do to allow them to wait on political exigencies.  These are social problems that must be dealt with at once.  We realise fully all the difficulties of the situation.  We are fully aware of them, and are prepared to make every allowance for those difficulties.  But we want to impress on you members of the Dáil&mdash;the Government of Ireland&mdash; that this is a problem which is your responsibility.  You are responsible to see that this problem is dealt with and tackled effectually.  If it is not so done the people will rise and sweep you away, as they would sweep any government away that failed to do its duty to the common people (applause).</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="MR. DE VALERA MR. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I regret more than I can express the fact that I cannot consistently and sincerely congratulate the President on his election.  I regret it, as I say, more than I can express.  The difficulties which he has in his office are undoubtedly very, very great.  One who has had the burden of those duties on his shoulders understands what they are likely to be now, perhaps, better than anybody else; and I think I will be expressing the views of everyone here, not merely those on the majority side, but we here who stand definitely for the Republic, when I say that, appreciating to the full his difficulties in acting as President of the Republic of Ireland, as head of the established State, we shall not only not stand in his way in carrying out the duties of that office, but we shall do everything that is possible for us to secure to the full for the Irish people enjoyment of the liberty which is their right as citizens of the Irish Republic (hear, hear).  That must not, of course, be interpreted in any way as meaning that we are not to continue our own policy&mdash;that we are not to criticise and attack his policy in any respect in which it may appear to us to be contrary to the interests of the Irish people and the established government, which is the Republic.  Whenever he functions, or will function in his other capacity as head of another government, we cannot recognise that government at all.  We will have to insist and continue insisting on our attitude that that government is not the legitimate government of this country until the Irish people have disestablished the Republic, and we shall do everything in our power to see they do not disestablish it.  I have also said whenever there is a question between the President of the Republic as head of this State, and any outside power that he can count on us to the full; that he can count on our support as definitely as if there had never been a division between us.  I would also feel contemptible in my own eyes if I did not say this: I have found fault, as I felt it my duty, with the actions of the President when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs; but there is not one in this whole Assembly, not even those on his side, who realise how terrible was the task imposed upon him.  And I want to tell him this: that if in any way it were consistent with Irish national principles to support the action he was taking, I would be supporting him; and that I am in opposition now simply because I felt that the action that is proposed is neither good for the Irish people, nor is it consistent with Irish national aspirations. I know he will believe me when I tell him I will, as a single Irish citizen, give to him in his office all the respect which I would expect to receive when in that office, from any citizens, and which I received from the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself.  It is a good thing there should be these changes, so that we who have been in power may recognise, individually, that it is power which does not come from ourselves, but is given to us; and when we are in office we are not acting as individual autocrats, but as functionaries for the people.  I have said changes are good things, and I am glad to be able, as a private individual, to act my part as a private Irish citizen; and the President of the Republic will receive from me, personally, and I hope from every Irish citizen, while he is acting in that capacity, the full respect which his office entitles him to.  It will be my duty to do everything in my power to see this established Republic is not disestablished. On this side of the House, even amongst those who most bitterly oppose his policy, there is a sympathetic feeling, and the magnitude of the task imposed upon him is realised.  I regret it is not possible for me consistently to be able to congratulate him on the office which he is taking up in the present circumstances.  Now, I would like if he would give us some outline of the policy he intends to pursue in maintaining the existing Republic.</P>

      <P>I desire to thank President de Valera for his words.  I call him President still; because if he had not resigned yesterday I would never have asked him to resign. He has spoken of laying down a burden. If there was anything in my life I would like, it would be to lay down the burden and get back into private life.  It is no feeling of ambition, or anything like that, <Col N="415" /> that is going to make me act as I am. I know the responsibilities I am taking on.  I feel those responsibilities, and if I did not feel it a duty to my country &mdash;an absolute duty owing to the part I took&mdash;I would certainly wish to get away into some kind of private or domestic life.  I am doing what I am doing because I believe it is my absolute duty to my country.  Men may differ from me here; men may hold other views.  I can only follow my own conscience and my own judgment, and I am doing that. As to the policy I am going to pursue, I have stated it already here to-day.  If President de Valera had not resigned yesterday I would never have suggested he should resign.  I would have suggested he would have remained on.  But once he resigned and carried us with him, there was nothing else for us to do but adopt one course.  We were not prepared to abandon the Treaty.  Now, as regards President de Valera, he is an individual whom I esteem and love, although, in the interests of the nation, I had to oppose him.  As I said from the very beginning, the Dáil is going to remain in existence&mdash; the Republic of Ireland is going to remain in existence &mdash;until the Free State is prepared to have an election.  I do not want any obstruction. At all events that is all I ask. We are going to have the heaviest task that was ever laid on the shoulders of Irishmen, thrown on our shoulders.  All we ask is that we will not be obstructed until we can go to the Irish people and give them the Free State, and let them decide.  That is the only policy I have. If the Irish people turn down the Free State for the Republic, I will follow in the ranks.  I will back the Free State. All I ask of Ireland and of my colleagues against me is not to throw obstacles in our way.  Within the next three months we are going to have the heaviest task ever thrown on the shoulders of Irishmen. So at least give us a fair trial. That is the policy (applause).</P>

      <P>I am told I made some remark that might have another bearing to what I intended to say.  It was to the effect that if the Irish people turned down the Free State, I would back the Free State.  What I meant to say was that if the Irish people at a free election, without any force used on either side, say: &ldquo;No!  we want to have the Republic,&rdquo; I will follow in the ranks of the Irish people.  I want that to be quite clear.  I am going to back the Free State, to propose it and to advocate it; but I agree with President de Valera, nobody can disestablish the Dáil except the Irish people at an election.  At that election I will stand for the Free State.  If the Irish people are against me I will follow behind them as a private in the ranks.  If I said anything to the contrary, I wish to correct it.</P>

      <P>The President has made a very general statement of policy.  All I wish to do is to ask him to be more explicit in a few particulars which are of great importance. I do not raise the points in the least obstructive sense, or with any obstructive motives.  It is simply in order that we may know more exactly where we stand.  Mr. Griffith as President has taken over an important office, to my view in a double capacity&mdash;one as Chief Executive Officer of Dáil Eireann, and the other, which he will soon presumably hold, is Chief of the Provisional Government.  It is simply a few points arising out of that curious and ambiguous situation which I wish to raise.  I would have raised them on the previous motion but the closure was moved and I was unable to speak.  My friend, Mr. Gavan Duffy, said all the questions put to Mr. Griffith had been satisfactorily answered, and that we can just go ahead under Mr. Griffith in his dual capacity. I do not think that is so, and further explanation is needed.  One of the questions asked him he certainly did not answer at all.  That question was: &ldquo;Will the Provisional Government function under the statutory powers conferred <Col N="416" /> by the Partition Act?&rdquo;  I think I am right in saying he made no answer to that question at all.

It will stand, and the criticisms that have been levelled at it will be proved to be unjust.  It is the natural sequel to the correspondence we had with the British Prime Minister.  It is the natural conclusion to that correspondence. If we did not have that to show that we had a definite objective, it might appear that we had no definite objective in view at all, and that we were simply pursuing the negotiations for some other purpose except for the definite purpose of trying to effect reconciliation and peace; and, in truth, to try to get a solution, or find some means by which association with the community of nations known as the British Commonwealth might best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations. As to the motion for the approval of the Treaty, I still want to insist it is not an act as such, but simply a resolution of this Assembly.  It would be <i>ultra vires</i> to ratify the Treaty.  It is simply an approval of the report brought over by the Delegation.  That motion has been carried, and as we have established such definite party lines here, there would be no good purpose served by moving and explaining the document here.</P>

      <NameTxt>PROFESSOR EOIN MACNEILL:</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion I have to move, Sir, is: &ldquo;That Dáil Eireann affirms that Ireland is a Sovereign Nation, deriving its sovereignty in all respects from the will of the people of Ireland; that all the international relations of Ireland are governed on the part of Ireland by this sovereign status; and that all facilities and accommodations accorded by Ireland to another state or country are subject to the right of the Irish Government to take care that the liberty and well-being of the people of Ireland are not endangered.&rdquo;<Col N="418" /> Now, one Deputy asked me when this notice appeared first, what was the meaning of it.  I gathered from the question, or perhaps, from the conversation which followed it, that what was intended in asking me that question was: what tactical purpose I had in bringing it forward.  Now, I have no tactical purpose in bringing it forward; that is to say, no tactical purpose as between any number of members of this Dáil and any other number of members of this Dáil&mdash;no tactical purpose whatsoever. There is not a single member of this assembly who can say that any single thing that I have done since I became a member of it partook of the nature of tactics, in order to gain an advantage over any number of persons in the Dáil, or for any object pursued by any number of persons in this Dáil over the other number.  There are old friends of mine associated with me in public movements for years back, and not one of them can point to an occasion upon which I ever endeavoured to gain a tactical advantage over any other person with whom I was engaged in Irish public work.  Therefore, I put this motion in the hope that it will express the unanimous view of the members of this assembly.  I do not put it from any controversial point of view, and if I understood that it were to be made the basis of a controversy here now, I should rather never have brought it forward, and I would ask that, sooner than that a controversy should arise upon it, I shall be asked to withdraw it.  The terms in which it is stated, are stated with all the clarity that it was possible for me to put into it.  There is no reserve; there is nothing concealed in any term; I wish them to be as plain as I could make them in the English language. And the reason for that, I think, is obvious.  Now, it is evident that a great deal of confusion of thought &mdash;not so much confusion of thought as the confusion of the habitual way of expressing thoughts&mdash;about these things, exists.  It is natural enough.  The political traditions of the past have to account for it.  I say the same as Mr. de Valera said to you a few days ago. What I think about these things&mdash;I know perfectly well; I have no doubt about it&mdash;it is what the people of Ireland think in their hearts about it.  They may be confused with regard to how to express their thoughts, they may be confused in the face of this or that political proposal or political formula, but what they think is the same, fundamentally the same.  They think what I say here; that there is no rightful sovereignty, and can be no rightful sovereignty, except the sovereignty derived from the will of the Irish people (hear, hear). That is what I ask the Dáil to re-affirm now as a basic principle, and the object of doing that&mdash;one object of doing it&mdash; is clear enough.  There is a danger in making agreements, especially in making agreements with a government like the English Government.  There is a saying attributed to General Smuts &ldquo;that the statesmen of England cannot think of Ireland; when they think of Ireland their minds relapse into the seventeenth century.&rdquo;  Well, consequently, there is a danger that people in Ireland, and people in England, may interpret this or that in the terms of the seventeenth century.  I wish it to be made clear that it is in the terms of the present century that these things ought to be interpreted.  The second thing I state in this is: that the international relations of Ireland are governed on the part of Ireland by this sovereign status. Now, these international relations&mdash;the international relations involved in the Treaty&mdash;concern, as well as Ireland, Great Britain, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand&mdash;every single one of these countries.  Those in them who represent them as political thinkers hold precisely the same doctrines as are stated here; that is to say that each of these countries is sovereign in its own domain, and derives its sovereignty from the will of its people.  In the second place, each one of them in its relation with the other, exercises that sovereign status, so that the relations to each other is one of equality.  In a recent communication reported in the Press, written by Mr. Lloyd George from the South of France, he is reported as having stated that this equality of status was what is now recognised on his part.  At all events, I wish it to be put beyond all doubt that it is what is now recognised on our part&mdash;that we recognise no inequality of status&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That we recognise no subordinate status, and <Col N="419" /> that we recognise no suzeranity or claim to suzeranity in any shape or form (hear, hear).  People will say, perhaps &mdash;well no, take the &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; out of it (laughter)&mdash;that in the actual terms of the Treaty there are words and phrases that cannot clearly be reconciled with those principles.  I do not deny it. There are words and phrases which cannot clearly be reconciled with those principles.  I do not read much of these discussions, but I happened to hit on one item in a discussion that took place in the British Parliament on this Treaty. It was Lord Birkenhead who was speaking, and he was speaking about his friend, Lord Carson, and he said Lord Carson's ideas on the subject were mediaeval.  I wish Lord Birkenhead's own ideas were less mediaeval when he was engaged in his share of drafting that Treaty, because there is a great deal of pure mediaevalism in the phrasing of it. My object is plain.  It is to get away from the mediaevalism and interpret all these things in the light of the twentieth century&mdash;to interpret status in the light in which South Africa, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand interpret it; that is to say, sovereignty for each of those in their own domain, and equality in their relations with each other.  Not, indeed, that their form of interpretation of it need concern us; for if they had never placed any interpretation on it, it would be our right and duty and business to declare the fact that Ireland is a sovereign nation, deriving its sovereignty in all respects from the will of the people of Ireland, and that all the international relations of Ireland are governed on the part of Ireland by this sovereign status.  That means complete equality in these relations.  Now, we come to the third part which deals with facilities and accommodations accorded by Ireland to another state or country. We know the claim that has been put forward, and that is that certain things are necessary to the security of Great Britain on account of its peculiar position. It is not necessary at all to deal with that part of my resolution in any controversial form, because I think it is recognised on all hands&mdash;not that we take the view Great Britain takes with regard to these things&mdash;but that, for one reason or another, we cannot escape from making certain concessions in those respects.  Well, having made those concessions, we are entitled to insist that those concessions shall only be used for the purposes for which they are claimed. It is quite possible they might be used for another purpose.  It has arisen at many points during our long discussions here that we cannot invest ourselves with security here against the naval power of Britain, if Britain is hostile to us; and, in fact, the statement has been made that the only safeguard we have against the naval aggression of Great Britain is international morality. I, personally, think international morality has a very long way to go yet before it becomes worthy of the term morality at all.  But if these concessions are made, or exist, it is the right of the Irish Government to take care that they are used for no other purpose than the purpose for which they are claimed.  Now, those are the reasons for which I have brought forward those resolutions.  It is in order that things which some people say exist by implication, and other people deny, but&mdash; whether they exist by implication or do not exist by implication&mdash;ought to exist, and about which we are all unanimous that they ought to exist&mdash;it is in order that these things may be clearly stated, so that it will not be possible for any person in future to say, if we insist on these fundamental rights of the Irish people, we are breaking faith with anybody. These are fundamental rights; they existed before the Treaty, they existed during the Treaty, they existed after the Treaty.  We claim these rights, at all events, and I believe the Irish people, so far as they can think these things out, are unanimous in claiming them.  I would not even exclude the Unionists. There is no political right but the right based on the will of the Irish people. Consequently I put these proposals forward. I hope I have said nothing controversial as between different sections here.  If I have, it has been unintentional. I put these forward for your consideration.  These are things that have all been agreed to publicly in many statements made on behalf of Great Britain, and on behalf of the communities mentioned as in the British Commonwealth. They are undenied, and put forward without being challenged. I ask you to put them forward.  I have avoided, so far as I consciously could, putting up any controversial aspect on the resolution itself, and in my attempt to explain it, and I would ask my fellow-members <Col N="420" /> here to adopt unanimously those resolutions in order to show that, on certain fundamental things, we, as representing the people of Ireland, are unanimous (applause).</P>

      <P>I regret this resolution has been brought forward. As Deputy MacNeill said he would withdraw it if it was controversial, I think, from one point of view, it should be withdrawn.  But the main idea can be served, perhaps, very much better by an amendment.  Our attitude is this: this resolution of the approval of the Treaty was simply a license to the Executive&mdash;the new Executive&mdash;that they might promote the setting up of a Provisional Government in accordance with the terms; in other words, that we would not be actively hostile to the setting up of the Government, though we do not, and cannot, admit its right as the Government of this country until the Irish people have spoken.  Anything that would seem to make it appear that that Treaty was completed by the resolution of approval here, we are against; and this mere declaration is, to our minds, of very little value when it is not in accordance, as far as we can see, with the text of the actual Treaty.  I will propose an amendment to this&mdash;and I think we can be unanimous about this, because any action we have taken here, we have taken it as the Parliament of the Republic of Ireland&mdash;and the amendment that would cover the object for which Deputy MacNeill's motion was put before you, being the assertion of the independence of Ireland, can be put this way.  Leave out all the words after Dáil Eireann and insert: &ldquo;The Government of Dáil Eireann re-affirms in the name of the Irish people the Declaration of Independence made on January 21st, 1919.&rdquo;  I propose that we here now solemnly re-affirm that Declaration of Independence.  It is, as you know, as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas the Irish people is by right a free people: and whereas for seven hundred years the Irish people has never ceased to repudiate, and has repeatedly protested in arms against foreign usurpation; and whereas English Rule in this country is, and always has been, based upon force and fraud and maintained by military occupation against the declared will of the people; and whereas the Irish Republic was proclaimed in Dublin on Easter Monday, 1916, by the Irish Republican Army acting on behalf of the Irish people; and whereas the Irish people is resolved to secure and maintain its complete independence in order to promote the common weal, to re-establish justice, to provide for future defence, to insure peace at home and good will with all nations, and to constitute a national polity based upon the people's will, with equal right and equal opportunity for every citizen; and whereas, at the threshold of a new era in history, the Irish electorate has, in the General Election of December, 1918, seized the first occasion to declare by an overwhelming majority its firm allegiance to the Irish Republic: now, therefore, we, the elected representatives of the ancient Irish people in national Parliament assembled, do, in the name of the Irish nation ratify the establishment of the Irish Republic, and pledge ourselves and our people to make this declaration effective by every means at our command: we ordain that the elected representatives of the Irish people alone have power to make laws binding on the people of Ireland, and that the Irish Parliament is the only Parliament to which that people will give its allegiance: we solemnly declare foreign Government in Ireland to be an invasion of our national right which we will never tolerate, and we demand the evacuation of our country by the English Garrison: we claim for our national independence the recognition and support of every free nation in the world, and we proclaim that independence to be a condition precedent to international peace hereafter: in the name of the Irish people we humbly commit our destiny to Almighty God who gave our fathers the courage and determination to persevere through long centuries of a ruthless tyranny, and strong in the justice of the cause which they have handed down to us, we ask His Divine Blessing on this, <Col N="421" /> the last stage of the struggle we have pledged ourselves to carry through to freedom&rdquo; (applause).</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I rise to make a motion for the adjournment.  But before I do so I may mention that into my hands have been put, within the last few minutes, questions addressed by Madame Markievicz. It was the first time I saw them, and there might be an insinuation that I avoided them.  The first question is: &ldquo;What is the scheme that Mr. Griffith refers to when he says, alluding to the Southern Unionists, &lsquo;I agreed that a scheme should be devised to give them their full share of representation in the first Chamber of the Irish Parliament.&rsquo; Is it a scheme for party legislation, class legislation, or what?&rdquo;  The second question is: &ldquo;On what basis is this Upper House that he mentions further on in the letter to be constituted?&rdquo; My answer to that is this: I met some of the Southern Unionists in London. I refused to meet them at a Conference. I said they had no <i>locus standi</i> at a Conference; but I would meet them as an Irishman might meet Irishmen.  I discussed matters with them, and I said: &ldquo;We want you all in Ireland.&rdquo; They asked about representation, and I said: &ldquo;I will agree a scheme shall be devised to give you full representation.&rdquo; Madame Markievicz asks me what that scheme is.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>That scheme will have to be considered when we are drawing up the Constitution.  I was not able to work out the scheme at the moment.  These questions are trap questions.  I wrote overnight from London, and a courier came across to Dublin. I informed the Cabinet I was going to see these gentlemen, and I informed them afterwards; so they knew all about it.  As to the second question, that is a question when the Constitution is being drawn up.  What I have pledged is that they will get a fair representation in both Houses, and I will see to it. Now I move the adjournment of the House until such time as we call it together again.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the President would be really wise in doing that straight off.  There are a number of things he might enlighten us on by having another session.  There are questions of policy to be disposed of, Republican stafis, foreign representatives, and a number of Executive matters which the House would like to have some information about.  The taking over of the various offices is another matter.  Ex-Ministers will, naturally, hand over their departments to the present Ministers, and I suppose the present Ministers will make <Col N="422" /> arrangements for taking them over.  I would suggest that to-morrow an opportunity would be given to those who want to ask questions to meet again.  An opportunity will then be given to those who want information as to when the next meeting of the Dáil will be.  Let us have a definite idea of what is going to be done.</P>

      <P>Would it not be better if the other side made a practical suggestion for once?  I mentioned a matter the other day, and there was no response.  Obviously a Committee, or some kind of contact between the two sides, would meet the case.  It is also obvious, if we are not to be hindered, that certain details are necessary to be arranged, and those details will take a great deal of working out.  It is not fair that we should be kept here and prevented from doing our work.  Questions are being asked.  I say these cannot be answered, because we have not the necessary time to send anybody to the English side to ask for transfers and arrange other matters.  If we are not to be hindered, I think the adjournment of the House over a certain period ought to be supported.  I do not care whether the period is named or not.  At any rate, tacties should be dropped, and we should get a bit of fair play.</P>

      <P>The Minister of Finance put us into a difficulty yesterday which he has, apparently, forgotten. He informed us that every penny we were spending now was spent illegally. How can any expenditure be made until the House has sanctioned it for the next six months?  Expenditure cannot be carried on until it is sanctioned by this House, as we did last July or August. That is one matter.  There are several other questions, as the President suggested, that have to come up.</P>

The only expenditure that is being made is the simple routine expenditure in all the departments.  I am not spending the money.  All the departments have been carried on, as everybody knows, just as they had been prior to any division.  And surely to goodness it would not be suggested that they should not be paid.  I do not know to what extent the other side would go in any suggestion now.  I do not know if any person could find fault with any expenditure on ordinary staffs.</P>

Instead of adjourning the House <i>sine die</i>, if a certain date were fixed, it would be accepted more definitely&mdash;if there was a definite date fixed at which the Dáil was to re-assemble, everything could be prepared by the new Cabinet, and they would be in a position to put the estimates before the House, when they could be fully examined.

    <Title>APPENDIX 7 MEMORANDUM BY THE IRISH REPRESENTATIVES</Title>
    <P Just="Right">November 22nd, 1921.</P>
    <P>NOTE.&mdash;The following proposals are put forward upon the assumption that the essential unity of Ireland is maintained.</P>
    <P>1.  Legislative and Executive authority in Ireland shall be derived exclusively from the Elected Representatives of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>2.  Ireland agrees to be associated with the British Commonwealth for purposes of common concern and, in respect of those purposes, to recognise the Crown as the symbol and accepted head of the Association.</P>
    <P>3.  In matters of common concern, which are declared to include Peace and War and Defence, the rights and status of Ireland shall be in no respect less than those enjoyed by any of the component States of the British Commonwealth represented in the League of Nations.  There shall be between Ireland and these States such concerted action, founded on consultation, as the several Governments may determine.</P>
    <P>4.  As an Associated State, Ireland recognises the obligation of providing, as far as her resources permit, for her own defence by sea, land, and air, and of repelling by force any attempt to violate the integrity of her shores and territorial waters, and in the common interest of Ireland and the British Commonwealth undertakes that she will not by treaty or compact with any foreign nation impair her independence nor authorise nor permit any foreign nation to obtain any naval or military powers over her territory which may be inimical to the security of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>5.  Varying proposals have been put forward by the British Government on the subject of Naval Defence.  The Irish Delegation now ask that the facilities required by the British Government should be precisely defined.</P>
    <P>Any such proposals should provide for the assumption by Ireland of responsibility for her own coastal defence at the end of a period not exceeding five years.</P>
    <P>6.  We are agreed, in order to facilitate the general world movement towards the limitation of armaments, that the Defence Force to be maintained by the Irish Government shall bear the same proportion to the military establishments maintained in Great Britain as the population of Ireland bears to the population of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>7.  An Arbitration Tribunal consisting of one or more persons shall be set up to effect a final financial adjustment between Great Britain and Ireland.  It shall be the duty of the Tribunal to determine Ireland's liability, if any, for a proportion of the Public Debt and War Pensions of these islands as at the date of the signing of this Treaty, and to determine the total sum of this liability, if any, and to determine what total sum, if any, is due by Great Britain to Ireland in respect of all such pecuniary claims, whether liquidated or unliquidated, as shall be submitted to the Tribunal on behalf of Ireland.  The Tribunal shall set off the respective total sums so determined one against the other, strike a final balance between them and issue their award accordingly.  That award shall be final and binding upon both nations.</P>
    <P>8.  It is pointed out that the Memorandum submitted by the Irish Delegation on the 29th October contained the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are prepared to execute a Trade Convention which, while recognising the advantage to both countries of the fullest freedom of trade, transport and commerce, will not derogate from Ireland's complete fiscal autonomy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Memorandum handed to us on the 16th November do not, in our opinion, constitute a reply to this proposition, but, on the contrary, do imply a derogation from Ireland's complete fiscal autonomy, and do in their implication mean that Ireland must inevitably fall into a position of economic subservience which cannot be accepted by Ireland.  It is therefore requested that our previous statement should be met and it is suggested that:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  An Agreement be reached as to the commodities that shall be dealt with on the basis of free trade, and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  An understanding be reached that each Government is free to deal with all other commodities as seems suitable to its own requirements.</P>
    <P>9.  We are prepared to recommend that the Irish Government shall:</P>
    <P>(1)  Conclude suitable trade conventions with the other states of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>(2)  Arrange all necessary facilities for Commercial air Communications.</P>
    <P>(3)  Make mutual agreements in regard to all such matters of common concern as domicile, income tax, death duties, and stamp duties, posts, cables and wireless telegraphy, currency and coinage, trademarks, copyright and patents, immigration and emigration, merchant shipping, sea fisheries and quarantine.</P>
    <P>10.  In the event of the existing legislature of the North East of Ireland accepting its position under the National Parliament, Ireland will confirm the legislature in its existing powers and will undertake to provide the safeguards designed to secure any special interests of the area over which it functions.</P>
    <P>Having stated our willingness to provide such safeguards as will allay the fears of any section of the population of N.E. Ulster, we now suggest that it is necessary at this stage to indicate precisely to us what safeguards are required so that every eventuality may be met and any conceivable misunderstanding avoided.</P>

    <Title>APPENDIX 8 MEMORANDUM BY THE IRISH DELEGATES ON THEIR PROPOSAL FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND WITH THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH.</Title>
    <P Just="Right">November 28th, 1921</P>
    <P>1.  The legislative, executive and judicial authority of Ireland shall be derived exclusively from the Elected Representatives of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>2.  Ireland will agree to be associated with the British Commonwealth for all purposes of common concern, including defence, peace and war, and political treaties, and to recognise the British Crown as Head of the Association.</P>
    <P>3.  As a token of that recognition, the Irish legislature will vote an annual contribution to the King's personal revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NOTE</P>
    <P>The proposal is that Ireland, while preserving her national independence, shall for all purposes of common concern associate herself with the British Commonwealth of Nations and recognise the British Crown as Head of the Association.</P>
    <P>By a method such as this permanent peace can be established.  It is fallacious to assert that Ireland is now offered the substantial freedom of Canada and the other British Dominions.  Canada and the other Dominions lie thousands of miles away from the shores of Great Britain.  Great Britain, therefore, has neither desire nor temptation to interfere in their home affairs.  The Crown to them is a symbol of the external unity of equal states, not of the internal repression of subordinate states.  Ireland, on the contrary lies beside the shores of Great Britain, which has been accustomed for generations to interfere, in the name of the Crown, in every detail of Ireland's life.  The desire and temptation to continue interference will remain if the Crown remains, as it cannot be the symbolic Crown that the Dominions know, but will continue to possess the real power of repression and veto which Ireland knows.  In moving the first reading of the Home Rule Bill in 1913 the Prime Minister of this country pointed out that the Crown meant the British Government and that the British Government would retain unimpaired its supremacy and power of veto over the proposed Irish Parliament.  Such a supremacy and such a veto are incompatible with the independence and dignity of our country, incompatible with real peace between the two nations, incompatible with free association with the community of nations, known as the British Commonwealth, and, therefore, cannot be accepted.  We acknowledge a reasonableness in the desire of the British Government for certain Naval facilities in Ireland differing from those which they receive from Canada or the other Dominions.  The propinquity of the two islands is a fact that must be recognised in arranging a just and permanent settlement and we have recognised it in this matter.  Equally it must be recognised on the other side that the same propinquity imposes on us a necessity for safeguarding our independence which does not arise in the case of the Dominions.  The Crown, thousand of miles away, will never menace the Dominions with its powers.  The Crown, close at hand to Ireland, would form a constant menace of the kind, and the object for which both sides have striven&mdash;the satisfactory ending of the long conflict between the two nations&mdash;would not have been achieved.</P>
    <P>We put forward a plan that is practicable and honourable, that will ensure Great Britain against every apprehension that her publicists have expressed, that will associate Ireland with her and the Dominions under the Crown, and that at the same time will secure the independence of Ireland from question or intrigue.  It must be recognised that for Ireland freely to accept the Crown in any capacity is a momentous step on her part in view of history and the existing facts, but the desire of the people of Ireland for a friendly and lasting settlement is unquestionable and the Irish Delegation are ready to advise their countrymen to meet British sentiment in the manner here proposed.</P>

    <Title>APPENDIX 9 CONFERENCE ON IRELAND</Title>
    <P>S.F.C. 29-A.</P>
    <P>Copy of a letter from the Prime Minister to Mr. Arthur Griffith covering the Proposed Articles of Agreement.</P>
    <P Just="Right">10 Downing Street, S.W.</P>
    <P Just="Right">December 1st, 1921</P>
    <P>Sir,<br />I enclose a draft of the Treaty which we are prepared to submit for the approval of Parliament.  As we understand that you have agreed with representatives of the Southern Unionists to provide safeguards for the representation of minorities, especially in the Second Chamber not less effective than those afforded by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as well as to make provision for the completion of Land Purchase, these matters have not been dealt with in the draft.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Sgd.) D. Lloyd George.</P>
    <P>A. Griffith, Esq.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROPOSED ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT</P>
    <P>1.  Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace order and good government of Ireland and an Executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>2.  Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>3.  The representative of the Crown in Ireland shall be a Governor-General appointed in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada and in accordance with the practice observed in the making of such appointments.</P>
    <P>4.  The oath to be taken by members of the Parliament of the Irish Free State shall be in the following form:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I..............................................solemnly swear to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State; to the Community of Nations known as the British Empire: and to the King as the Head of the State and of the Empire.</P>
    <P>5.  The Irish Free State shall contribute towards the service of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment of war pensions as existing at that date such sums as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set off or counter claim, the amount of such sums being determined in default of agreement by the arbitration of one or more independent persons being citizens of the British Empire.</P>
    <P>6.  Until an arrangement has been made between the British and Irish Governments whereby the Irish Free State undertakes her own coastal defence, the defence by sea of the British Islands, including Ireland, shall be undertaken exclusively by His Majesty's Imperial Forces.</P>
    <P>The foregoing provisions of this article shall be reviewed at a Conference of Representatives of the British and Irish Governments to be held at the expiration of ten years from the date hereof.</P>
    <P>7.  The Government of the Irish Free State shall afferd to His Majesty's Imperiall Forces:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  In time of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the Annex A. hereto, or such other facilities as may from time to time be agreed between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State; and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  In time of war or of strained relations with a Foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purposes of such defence as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>8.  With a view of securing the observance of the principle of international limitation of armaments, if the Government of the Irish Free State establishes and maintans a local military defence force, the establishments thereof shall not exceed in size sucin proportion of the military establishments maintained in Great Britain as that which the population of Ireland bears to the population of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>9.  No protective customs duties shall be imposed in Great Britain on Irish goods nor in Ireland on British goods but this provision shall not be construed as preventing the imposition of customs duties designed to prevent dumping or other unfair competition.</P>
    <P>10.  Neither Great Britain nor the Irish Free State shall impose restrictions for protective purposes upon the flow of transport, trade and commerce between Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>11.  The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of Police Forces and other Public Servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance hereof.</P>
    <P>Provided that this agreement shall not apply to members of the Auxiliary Police Force or to persons recruited in Great Britain for the Royal Irish Constabulary during the two years next preceding the date hereof.  The British Government will assume responsibility for such compensation or pensions as may be payable to any of these excepted persons.</P>
    <P>12.  During the period of transition, that is to say a period of 12 months after the date hereof, or such shorter period as His Majesty in Council in pursuance of a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland may by Order fix, the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland, and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall, so far as they relate to Northern Ireland remain of full force and effect, and no elections shall be held for the return of members to serve in the Parliament of the Irish Free State for constituencies in Northern Ireland, unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in favour of the holding of such elections before the end of the period of transition</P>
    <P>13.  If after the expiration of six months and before the expiration of twelve months from the date hereof an address is presented to His Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that effect, the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, continue to be of full force and effect, and this instrument shall have effect subject to the necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>Provided that if such an address is so presented a Commission consisting of three persons, one to be appointed by the Government of the Irish Free State, one to be appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland and one who shall be Chairman to be appointed by the British Government shall determine in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions the boundaries between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland, and for the purposes of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and of this instrument, the boundary of Northern Ireland shall be such as may be determined by such Commission.</P>
    <P>14.  For the purpose of the last two foregoing articles the powers of the Parliament of Southern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to elect members of the Council of Ireland shall after the Parliament of the Irish Free State is constituted be exercised by that Parliament.</P>
    <P>15.  After the expiration of the period of transition, if no such address as is mentioned in Article 13 hereof is presented, the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland shall continue to exercise as respects Northern Ireland the powers conferred on them by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, but the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall in Northern Ireland have in relation to matters in respect of which the Parliament of Northern Ireland has not power to make laws under that Act (including matters which under the said Act are within the jurisdiction of the Council of Ireland) the same powers as in the rest of Ireland, subject however to the following provisions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The Government of Northern Ireland shall exercise the powers of patronage with respect to offices in the public services administered by the Government of the Irish Free State (including judicial offices) the functions of which are discharged either wholly or mainly in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Government of Northern Ireland shall be charged with the duty of collecting all taxes leviable in Northern Ireland, and the proceeds shall be dealt with as in Annex B.</P>
    <P>(c)  No taxation shall be imposed by the Government of the Irish Free State which discriminates against Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(d)  No export duties shall without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland be imposed on any manufactures of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(e)  No import duties shall without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland be imposed on goods used as raw material for manufactures in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(f)  It shall be lawful for the Government of Northern Ireland to raise and maintain in addition to and for the purpose of the support of any police forces raised by them a local militia, so however that the establishments thereof shall not exceed in size such proportion of the establishments of any local military defence force maintained by the Government of the Irish Free State as that which the population of Northern Ireland bears to the population of the rest of Ireland, and no part of any local military defence force raised by the Government of the Irish Free State shall be stationed in Northern Ireland without the consent of the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>16.  Neither the Parliament of the Irish Free State nor the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall make any law so as either directly or indirectly to endow any religion, or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status, or affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at a school or make any discrimination as respects state aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations, or divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution any of its property except for public utility purposes and on payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>17.  By way of provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State in accordance therewith, steps shall be taken forthwith for summoning a meeting of members of Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and for constituting a provisional Government, and the British Government shall take the steps necessary to transfer to such provisional Government the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties, provided that every member of such provisional Government shall have signified in writing the acceptance of this instrument.  But this arrangement shall not continue in force beyond the expiration of twelve months from the date hereof.</P>
    <P>18.  This instrument shall be submitted forthwith by His Majesty's Government for the approval of Parliament and by the Irish signatories to a meeting summoned for the purpose of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, and if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.</P>

    <P>The Government of Northern Ireland shall be charged with the duty of collecting those taxes which under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 are reserved, that is to say Customs, Excise duties on articles manufactured and produced, Income Tax, Super-tax, and any other tax on profits.  They shall retain definitively 3 per cent of the amount collected, and meet therefrom the cost of collection.  The amount thereafter to be paid over to the Irish Free State shall be arrived at as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The total proceeds of the reserved taxes in the whole of Ireland, less 3 per cent., shall be ascertained and from this sum shall be deducted an amount equal to the Irish debt charge, if any, for the year as ascertained under Article 5, and any sum which the Irish Free State shall have to disburse in Northern Ireland in respect of any service administered by the Irish Free State in that area.  The free balance then remaining shall be allocated as between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in proportion to the population of the two areas.</P>
    <P>Out of the proceeds of the reserved taxes collected in Northern Ireland, the Government of Northern Ireland shall retain, besides the first 3 per cent, a sum equal to the share of Northern Ireland in the free balance ascertained as above, and shall hand over the remainder to the Government of the Irish Free State.</P>

    <P>2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.</P>
    <P>2nd December, 1921</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROPOSED ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT</P>
    <P>1.  Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace order and good Government of Ireland and an Executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>2.  Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>3.  The representative of the Crown in Ireland shall be a Governor-General appointed in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada and in accordance with the practice observed in the making of such appointments.</P>
    <P>4.  The Oath to be taken by members of the Parliament of the Irish Free State shall be in the following form:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I........................solemnly swear to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State; to the Community of Nations known as the British Empire; and to the King as the Head of the State and of the Empire.</P>
    <P>5.  The Irish Free State shall contribute towards the service of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment of war pensions as existing at that date such sums as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set off or counter claim, the amount of such suns being determined in default of agreement by the arbitration of one or more independent persons being citizens of the British Empire.</P>
    <P>6.  Until an arrangement has been made between the British and Irish Governments whereby the Irish Free State undertakes her own coastal defence, the defence by sea of the British Islands, including Ireland, shall be undertaken exclusively by His Majesty's Imperial Forces.</P>
    <P>The foregoing provisions of this article shall be reviewed at a Conference of Representatives of the British and Irish Governments to be held at the expiration of ten years from the date hereof.</P>
    <P>7.  The Government of the Irish Free State shall afford to His Majesty's Imperial Forces:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  In time of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the Annex hereto, or such other facilities as may from time to time be agreed between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State; and</P>
    <P>(b)  In time of war or of strained relations with a Foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purposes of such defence as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>8.  With a view to securing the observance of the principle of international limitation of armaments, if the Government of the Irish Free State establishes and maintains a local military defence force, the establishments thereof shall not exceed in size such proportion of the military establishments maintained in Great Britain as that which the population of Ireland bears to the population of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>9.  No protective customs duties shall be imposed in Great Britain on Irish goods nor in Ireland on British Goods, but this provision shall not be construed as preventing the imposition of customs duties designed to prevent dumping or other unfair competition.</P>
    <P>10.  Neither Great Britain nor the Irish Free State shall impose restrictions for protective purposes upon the flow of transport, trade and commerce between Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>11.  The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of Police Forces and other Public Servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance hereof.</P>
    <P>Provided that this agreement shall not apply to Members of the Auxiliary Police Force or to persons recruited in Great Britain for the Royal Irish Constabulary during the two years next preceding the date hereof.  The British Government will assume responsibility for such compensation or pensions as may be payable to any of these excepted persons.</P>
    <P>12.  During the period of transition, that is to say a period of 12 months after the date hereof or such shorter period as His Majesty in Council in pursuance of a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland may by order fix, the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland, and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall, so far as they relate to Northern Ireland remain of full force and effect, and no elections shall be held for the return of members to serve in the Parliament of the Irish Free State for constituencies in Northern Ireland, unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in favour of the holding of such elections before the end of the period of transition.</P>
    <P>13.  If after the expiration of six months and before the expiration of twelve months from the date hereof an address is presented to His Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that effect, the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, continue to be of full force and effect, and this instrument shall have effect subject to the necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>Provided that if such an address is so presented a Commission consisting of three persons, one to be appointed by the Government of the Irish Free State, one to be appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland and one who shall be Chairman to be appointed by the British Government shall determine in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions the boundaries between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland, and for the purposes of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and of this instrument, the boundary of Northern Ireland shall be such as may be determined by such Commission.</P>
    <P>14.  For the purpose of the last two foregoing articles the powers of the Parliament of Southern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to elect members of the Council of Ireland shall after the Parliament of the Irish Free State is constituted be exercised by that Parliament.</P>
    <P>15.  After the expiration of the period of transition, if no such address as is mentioned in Article 13 hereof is presented, the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland shall continue to exercise as respects Northern Ireland the powers conferred on them by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, but the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall in Northern Ireland have in relation to matters in respect of which the Parliament of Northern Ireland has not power to make laws under that Act (including matters which under the said Act are within the jurisdiction of the Council of Ireland) the same powers as in the rest of Ireland, subject however to the following provisions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The Government of Northern Ireland shall exercise the powers of patronage with respect to offices in the public services administered by the Government of the Irish Free State (including judicial offices) the functions of which are discharged either wholly or mainly in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Government of Northern Ireland shall be charged with the duty of collecting all taxes leviable in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(A further clause dealing with the allocation between Northern and Southern Ireland of amounts collected and with discriminatory taxation will be circulated later.)</P>
    <P>(c)  No export duties shall without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland be imposed on any manufactures of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(d)  No import duties shall without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland be imposed on goods used as raw material for manufactures in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(e)  It shall be lawful for the Government of Northern Ireland to raise and maintain in addition to and for the purpose of the support of any police forces raised by them a local militia, so however that the establishments thereof shall not exceed in size such proportion of the establishments of any local military defence force maintained by the Government of the Irish Free State as that which the population of Northern Ireland bears to the population of the rest of Ireland, and no part of any local military defence force raised by the Government of the Irish Free State shall be stationed in Northern Ireland without the consent of the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>16.  Neither the Parliament of the Irish Free State nor the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall make any laws so as either directly or indirectly to endow any religion, or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status, or affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at a school or make any discrimination as respects state aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations, or divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution any of its property except for public utility purposes and on payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>17.  By way of provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State in accordance therewith, steps shall be taken forthwith for summoning a meeting of members of Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and for constituting a provisional Government, and the British Government shall take the steps necessary to transfer to such provisional Government the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties, provided that every member of such provisional Government shall have signified in writing the acceptance of this instrument.  But this arrangement shall not continue in force beyond the expiration of twelve months from the date hereof.</P>
    <P>18.  This instrument shall be submitted forthwith by his Majesty's Government for the approval of Parliament and by the Irish signatories to a meeting summoned for the purpose of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, and if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.</P>

    <P Just="Center">MEETING OF CABINET, 25TH NOVEMBER, 1921</P>
    <P>(a)  The following formula was unanimously approved:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Ireland shall recognise the British Crown for the purposes of the Association as symbol and accepted head of the combination of Associated States&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(b)  Vote of annual voluntary sum to Civil List unanimously approved.</P>
    <P>MEETING OF CABINET AND DELEGATION, 3rd DECEMBER, 1921</P>
    <P>VIEWS OF DELEGATES</P>
    <P>(a)  Mr. Griffith in favour of Treaty.  Refused to break on question of Crown and thereby hand to Ulster the position from which she had been driven.</P>
    <P>(b)  Mr. Barton of opinion that England's last word had not been reached and that she could not declare war on question of Allegiance.  The Treaty would not give Dominion Status nor any guarantee re Ulster.  Would vote against acceptance.</P>
    <P>(c)  Mr. Gavan Duffy agreed with Mr. Barton that England was bluffing and that the Irish proposals, with small reservations on Defence etc., could be obtained.  Would like the Treaty to be rejected by An Dáil and sent back amended.  Said &ldquo;No&rdquo; definitely to Treaty.</P>
    <P>(d)  Mr. Duggan agreed with Mr. Griffith.  Believed Treaty to be England's last word and would not take responsibility of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(e)  Mr. Collins was in substantial agreement with Messrs.  Griffith and Duggan.  The non-acceptance of Treaty would be a gamble as England could arrange a war in Ireland within a week.  Sacrifices to N.E. Ulster made for sake of essential unity and justified. With pressure further concessions could be obtained on Trade and Defence.  Oath [of] Allegiance would not come into force for 12 months&mdash;question was, therefore, would it be worth while taking that 12 months and seeing how it would work.  Would recommend that Dáil go to country on Treaty, but would recommend non-acceptance of Oath.</P>
    <P>(f)  Mr. Childers of opinion that Par. 6 of Treaty would give Ireland no national status. Sec. 7(b) was important also as it meant that when England went to war she would bring Ireland with her.</P>
    <P>(g)  In reply to a question by Minister of Defence as to who was responsible for the splitting of the Delegation so that two Members (Messrs. Griffith and Collins) did most of the work and that the other members were not in possession of full information it was stated that the British Government was responsible for the arrangement but it had the approval of the whole Delegation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Defence here remarked that the British Government selected its men. On the motion of Mr. Griffith this remark was withdrawn.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MEETING OF CABINET, 3rd DECEMBER, 1921</P>
    <P>(a)  In the course of a lengthy discussion of the Treaty the President gave it as his opinion that it could not be accepted in its then form.  He personally could not subscribe to the Oath of Allegiance nor could he sign any document which would give N.E. Ulster power to vote itself out of the Irish State.  With modifications, however, it might be accepted honourably, and he would like to see the plenipotentiaries go back and secure peace if possible.  He believed the Delegates had done their utmost and that in now remained to them to show that if document not amended that they were prepared to face the consequences&mdash;war or no war.  He would deal with present document exactly as with that of 20th July&mdash;say it cannot be accepted and put up counter proposals.</P>
    <P>(b)  Mr. Griffith did not like the document but did not think it dishonourable.  It would practically recognise the Republic and the first allegiance would be to Ireland.  If it were rejected the people would be entitled to know what the alternative is.  The country would not fight on the question of allegiance and there would be a split.  He would not recommend the Government to accept but would say that the Plenipotentiaries should sign and leave it to President and Dáil to reject.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Minister for Defence was in perfect agreement with President, the only matter upon which he could disagree would be the question of recognising the King of England as Head of the Associated States.</P>
    <P>(d)  Document does not guarantee essential unity of Ireland.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MEETING OF CABINET AND DELEGATION, 3rd DECEMBER, 1921 (<i>resumed</i>)</P>
    <P>(a)  Mr. Griffith would not take the responsibility of breaking on the Crown.  When as many concessions as possible conceded, and when accepted by Craig, he would go before the Dáil.  The Dáil was the body to decide for or against war.</P>
    <P>(b)  The President took his stand upon last Irish proposals which meant external connection with the Crown.  He suggested the following amendment to the Oath of Allegiance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I........................do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the Irish Free State, to the Treaty of Association and to recognise the King of Great Britain as Head of the Associated States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(c)  Delegates to carry out their original instructions with same powers.</P>
    <P>(d)  Delegation to return and say that Cabinet won't accept Oath of Allegiance if not amended and to face the consequences, assuming that England will declare war.</P>
    <P>(e)  Decided unanimously that present Oath of Allegiance could not be subscribed to.</P>
    <P>(f)  Mr. Griffith to inform Mr. Lloyd George that the document could not be signed, to state that it is now a matter for the Dáil, and to try and put the blame on Ulster.</P>
    <P>(g)  On a majority vote it was decided that the Delegation be empowered to meet Sir James Craig if they should think necessary.  The following voted for and against:&mdash;</P>
    <P>FOR: President, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Economics and Local Government.</P>
    <P>AGAINST: Defence and Home Affairs.</P>
    <P>(h)  It was decided that the President would not join the Delegation in London at this stage of the Negotiations.</P>

    <P>4.  In matters of common concern, the rights and status of Ireland shall be in no respect less than those enjoyed by any of the component States of the British Commonwealth represented in the League of Nations.

    <P>5.  The Oath to be taken by members of the Irish Parliament shall be in the following form:&mdash;</P>

    <P>9.  No protective customs duties shall be imposed in Great Britain on Irish goods nor in Ireland on British goods, but this provision shall not be construed as preventing the imposition of customs duties designed against dumping or other unfair competition, nor as preventing the Irish Government from taking measures for the encouragement of infant industries and for the economic development of Ireland.</P>
    <P>10.  A Convention shall be made between the British and Irish Governments for the regulation of civil communication by air.</P>

    <Title>APPENDIX 13 MR. MICHAEL COLLINS' MINUTE OF HIS INTERVIEW WITH MR. LLOYD GEORGE AT 10, DOWNING STREET AT 9.30 A.M. MONDAY, DECEMBER 5TH, 1921.</Title>
    <P>Arising out of Mr. Jones' conversation with Mr. Griffith, the latter indicated to me last night that Mr. Lloyd George desired to see me.  This conversation took place subsequent to the official conference held at 10, Downing Street on Sunday evening at 5 p.m.  I did not attend this conference for the reason that I had, in my own estimation, argued fully all points.  This morning Mr. Griffith came to me again and suggested in his official capacity as Chairman of the Delegation that I should have the meeting with Mr. Lloyd George as so much depended on the Delegation at this vital time.  Mr. Jones had suggested the interview for 9.15, but as I had not made up my mind until after speaking to Mr. Griffith this morning I did not see Mr. Lloyd George until 9.30 as stated above.</P>
    <P>Acting on the general résumé of points of difference as sketched by me at the Cabinet Meeting on Saturday, 3rd instant, I had my points set out as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The essential unity of Ireland.  Suggestion that we should press for a letter from Craig indicating either:</P>
    <P>(a)  Acceptance of Conditions, and naming those Conditions.</P>
    <P>(b)  Rejection.</P>
    <P>(2)  Oath of Allegiance.  Clause 4 of British Document.</P>
    <P>(3)  Defence.  Clause 6 and Annex A. of British Document (29a)&mdash;date 1st December.¹</P>
    <P>¹ pendix 9.</P>
    <P>(4)  Trade.  Clauses 9 and 10 of ditto.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lloyd George opened the conversation indicating that he was having a meeting of his Cabinet at 12 o'clock and was putting it to them that the Conference had broken as a result of the interview last night.  I said I understood that.  He went on to say that the break was therefore definitely on the question of &ldquo;within or without&rdquo; the Empire (at this stage he did not refer to allegiance except to say that he would be willing to consider any form of Oath in order to meet, or attempt to meet, our wishes).  I said I wished to express what my view was on their document.  I said that I was perfectly dissatisfied with the position as regards the North East, and I put it to him definitely under headings (a) and (b) of paragraph I above.  He remarked that I myself pointed out on a previous occasion that the North would be forced economically to come in.  I assented but I said the position was so serious owing to certain recent actions that for my part I was anxious to secure a definite reply from Craig and his Colleagues, and that I was as agreeable to a reply rejecting as accepting.  In view of the former we would save Tyrone and Fermanagh, parts of Derry, Armagh and Down by the boundary Commission and thus avoid such things as the raid on the Tyrone County Council and the ejection of the staff.  Another such incident would, in my view, inevitably lead to a conflict, and this conflict, in the nature of things (assuming for instance that some of the Anglo-Northern police were killed or wounded) would inevitably rapidly spread throughout Ireland.  Mr. Lloyd George expressed a view that this might be put to Craig, and if so the safeguards would be a matter for working out between ourselves and Craig afterwards.</P>
    <P>The question of the Oath was then referred to again, Mr. Lloyd George insisting that paragraphs 1 and 2 of their document were the substance, that a definite understanding had to be arrived at on those, then we could discuss the form of Oath.</P>
    <P>I then passed on to Defence.  I objected to Clause 6 on the ground that the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; implied that we were not to take measures for raising coastal Defence forces.  Mr. Lloyd George said that if I had the idea of building submarines they could not allow that.  I said that my objection was on the principle that we could build nothing.  If I were met on this part of the clause I thought we could find agreement and as to the second part of the clause I thought we could find agreement on the basis of an understanding that the Review Conference at the end of ten years definitely meant the transfer to the Government of the Irish Free State of the responsibility for coastal defence.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter I asked for a definition of the term &ldquo;Admiralty property and Rights&rdquo; mentioned in paragraph I, sub-heading (a) also that Mr. Churchill should define what he meant by &ldquo;care and maintenance parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I passed on to paragraphs 9 and 10 and pointed out that it was the fetters I objected to in these clauses.  Mr. Lloyd George suggested that if there were complete freedom on one side, there should also be complete freedom on the other.  This I said would meet my view, as also would paragraph 8 on page 2 of our document of the 22nd November (Copy of paragraph 8 attached).  Mr. Lloyd George made notes of all my objections as expressed above and suggested that if we thought fit he would meet us at 2 o'clock to-day.  I left the appointment stand tentatively.</P>
    <P>Finally the conversation developed into a statement by Mr. Lloyd George to the effect that were Clauses 1 and 2 accepted he would be in a position to hold up any action until we had, if we desired to do so, submitted the matter to DÁIL ÉIREANN and the country. I left it at that saying that unless I sent word to the contrary some members of the Delegation would meet him at 2 o'clock.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXTRACT FROM DOCUMENT DATED 22ND NOVEMBER SUBMITTED BY THE IRISH REPRESENTATIVES</P>
    <P>(TRADE CLAUSE, paragraph 8.)</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.  It is pointed out that the Memorandum submitted by the Irish Delegation on the 29th October contained the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;We are prepared to execute a Trade Convention which, while recognising the advantage to both countries of the fullest freedom of trade, transport and commerce, will not derogate from Ireland's complete fiscal autonomy.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Memorandum handed to us on the 16th November do not, in our opinion, constitute a reply to this proposition, but, on the contrary, do imply a derogation from Ireland's complete fiscal autonomy, and do in their implication mean that Ireland must inevitably fall into a position of economic subservience which cannot be accepted by Ireland.  It is therefore requested that our previous statement should be met and it is suggested that:</P>
    <P>(a)  An Agreement be reached as to the commodities that shall be dealt with on the basis of free trade, and</P>
    <P>(b)  An understanding be reached that each Government is free to deal with all other commodities as seems suitable to its own requirements.&rdquo;</P>

    <P Just="Center">SUB-CONFERENCE No. I&mdash;3 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Conference opened by LLOYD GEORGE saying that he must know once and for all exactly where we stood as regards the Ulster proposals.  He said that the Ulster proposals in the document now before us were exactly those to which Arthur Griffith had agreed and on which he had undertaken not to let him (Lloyd George) down.</P>
    <P>ARTHUR GRIFFITH replied that he had not let him down and did not intend to do so but that before he gave a decision on the earlier articles in the document he must have a reply from Craig either accepting or refusing the unity of Ireland.</P>
    <P>CHAMBERLAIN and LLOYD GEORGE argued that such a proposition was inadmissible, unreasonable and contrary to the undertaking not to let Lloyd George down.</P>
    <P>MR. CHAMBERLAIN stated that it was due to the confidence they had in our undertaking that they would not be let down by us that his colleagues and he had adopted the attitude they did at the Liverpool meeting and staked thereon their political future.</P>
    <P>MICHAEL COLLINS said that for us to agree to any conditions defining the future relations of Great Britain and Ireland prior to Craig's giving his assent to the unity of Ireland was impossible, that to do so would be to surrender our whole fighting position. That every document we ever sent them had stated that any proposals for the association of Ireland with the British Commonwealth of Nations was conditional upon the unity of Ireland.  That, unless Craig accepted inclusion under the All-Ireland Parliament, the unity of Ireland was not assured and that if he refused inclusion we should be left in the position of having surrendered our position without having even secured the essential unity of Ireland.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE got excited.  He shook his papers in the air, declared that we were trying deliberately to bring about a break on Ulster because our people in Ireland had refused to come within the Empire and that Arthur Griffith was letting him down where he had promised not to do so.  He produced a paper from an envelope, stated that he had shewn it to Arthur Griffith at ............'s house and that Arthur Griffith had agreed to its contents.  Lloyd George referred to this document as a letter and thereby mystified me and appeared to mystify Michael Collins.  I could not recollect the existence of any letter on this subject other than the one Arthur Griffith wrote to Lloyd George on November 2nd after consultation with the other members of the Delegation.  The paper was then passed across the table.  It proved to be a memorandum, not a letter, and read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Ulster did not see her way to accept immediately the principle of a Parliament of All-Ireland&mdash;coupled with the retention by the Parliament of Northern Ireland of the powers conferred upon it by the Act of 1920 and such other safeguards as have already been suggested in my letter of 10th November&mdash;we should then propose to create such Parliament for All-Ireland but to allow Ulster the right within a specified time on an address to the Throne carried in both Houses of the Ulster Parliament to elect to remain subject to the Imperial Parliament for all the reserved services.  In this case she would continue to exercise through her own Parliament all her present rights; she would continue to be represented in the British Parliament and she would continue subject to British taxation except in so far as already modified by the Act of 1920.  In this case, however, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland.  This might be done by a Boundary Commission which would be directed to adjust the line both by inclusion and exclusion so as to make the Boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the population.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>ARTHUR GRIFFITH declared his adhesion to his undertaking but argued that it was not unreasonable for us to require that Craig should reply before we refused or accepted the proposals now before us.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE declared that to make receipt of such a reply conditional before accepting or refusing was letting him down on his proposals because the only alternative to Craig's acceptance of the unity of Ireland was the Boundary Commission and that his Government would carry the Boundary Commission proposal they would have to withdraw to discuss the matter amongst themselves but first he would hear what objections or alterations we had to the proposals.</P>
    <P>ARTHUR GRIFFITH replied that he understood from Michael Collins' interview with Lloyd George that certain alterations might possibly be made in the proposals.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE asked what were the alterations we suggested but that we must understand that the first three Clauses were absolutely essential.  There could be no discussion about these.</P>
    <P>ARTHUR GRIFFITH replied that some alteration might be made in the Oath.</P>
    <P>BIRKENHEAD said that Mr. Collins had handed in to him that morning a form of oath on which he (Mr. Collins) had been working and then produced it with his (Birkenhead's) alterations.  We objected to the final words being &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; and suggested &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE asked for any further objections.</P>
    <P>WE objected to &ldquo;shall contribute&rdquo; in Clause 5 and desired insertion of &ldquo;if any&rdquo; after &ldquo;such sums&rdquo; and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>CHAMBERLAIN said that these alterations were matters of wording only.  On Clause 6 we argued at great length that the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; precluded us from commencing to build vessels or make any preparations for taking over our own coastal defence at any time, and that the &ldquo;Conference for Review&rdquo; referred to in the second paragraph might never be held if the British did not wish to reconsider the subject.  There was a long argument over this in which Churchill, Michael Collins and myself went over all the arguments again.</P>
    <P>CHURCHILL stated that if Ireland were permitted any navy it would be impossible to get the Treaty through Parliament.  That the English people would believe that we were going to build ships which in war might be used against them.  That the possibility of our building submarines or mine-laying vessels to attack their food ships would be argued from every angle.  The discussion lasted a long time.  We demanded the removal of the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;; this was grudgingly accorded.  We then sought to get it explicitly stated that Ireland should be required to build one or more ships for her coastal protection; this was absolutely refused, except as regards revenue and fishery protection ships, and CHURCHILL stated that he would definitely oppose any provision that Ireland should have a navy of her own and would even oppose it five years hence if he had the opportunity.</P>
    <P>MICHAEL COLLINS then took up the Trade Clause and said that Lloyd George had intimated that freedom on both sides might be accorded.  He also dealt with the suggestion that the safeguards for Ulster should be a matter for discussion between ourselves and the Ulster representatives.</P>
    <P>THE BRITISH then withdrew and we consulted amongst ourselves and decided that if they came back to break on our refusal to accept or refuse pending Craig's answer that Arthur Griffith's last card was to demand reference to the Colonial Premiers.</P>
    <P>BIRKENHEAD then returned alone and took note again of the particular points we required changed.</P>
    <P>On their return we again took up the points in dispute.  First in Clause 6, to which CHURCHILL agreed to add &ldquo;with a view to the undertaking by Ireland of a share of her own coastal defence,&rdquo; and to a date five years hence being fixed for the Conference to review the clause, but refused every proposition to make this apply to apply to (b) facilities in time of war.  He refused to take &ldquo;Queenstown&rdquo; out of the Annex, and explained that care and maintenance parties meant gunners and trained men to take charge drawn from the R.G.A. and R.E., numbering 1,060 men and 69 officers or thereabouts.  He also stated that &ldquo;Admiralty property and rights&rdquo; at Berehaven did not mean that they would demand compensation if at any time the docks etc. passed to us.  BIRKENHEAD said that if they were handed over to the Crown representative in Ireland the Crown could not demand payment from the Crown.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE said that on Trade he was prepared to agree provisionally that there should be freedom on both sides to impose any tariffs either liked subject to the Articles of Agreement being accepted by us.  That he himself had been the strongest on their side on the compulsory Free Trade Clauses, but that he would withdraw his opposition on the conditions stated.</P>
    <P>WE then went back to Ulster.</P>
    <P>ARTHUR GRIFFITH agreed that he personally would sign the Treaty whether Craig accepted or not, but that his colleagues were in a different position from himself in that they were not party to the promise not to let Lloyd George down, and that it was not fair to demand acceptance or refusal from them before Craig replied.</P>
    <P>Considerable discussion took place here on the justice and injustice of our being asked to agree or disagree before Craig replied and ARTHUR GRIFFITH made repeated efforts to avoid the question being put to Michael Collins and myself.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE stated that he had always taken it that Arthur Griffith spoke fo the Delegation, that we were all plenipotentiaries and that it was now a matter of peace or war and we must each of us make up our minds.  He required that every Delegate should sign the document and recommend it, or there was no agreement.  He said that they as a body had hazarded their political future and we must do like wise and take the same risks. At one time he particularly addressed himself to me and said very solemnly that those who were not for peace must take the full responsibility for the war that would immediately follow refusal by any Delegate to sign the Articles of Agreement.</P>
    <P>He then produced two letters one of which he said he must that night send to Craig. One was a covering letter to H.M. Government's proposals for the future relations of Ireland and Great Britain and stated that the Irish Delegation had agreed to recommend them for acceptance by Dail Eireann.  The other stated that the Irish Delegation had failed to come to an agreement with H.M. Government and therefore he had no proposals to send to Craig.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE stated that he would have to have our agreement or refusal to the proposals by 10 p.m. that evening.  That a special train and destroyer were ready to carry either one letter or the other to Belfast and that he would give us until ten o'clock to decide.</P>
    <P>We then argued that the twelve months transition period was of the greatest danger to our people.  Craig could say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; at any time; he could say &ldquo;No&rdquo; finally before six months but he need not say &ldquo;No&rdquo; for twelve months, so that for twelve months we might not know whether there was to be unity or not.  Meantime life might be made intolerable for our people in Ulster.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE argued that that contingency had been apparent from the first, but if it were a serious stumbling block we could shorten the transition period at any time we chose.</P>
    <P>MICHAEL COLLINS said that the recent occurrences in Tyrone-the seizure of the County Council books, etc., and the support of the Ulster Government with English troops had shaken our confidence in their fidelity.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE answered that they had no jurisdiction on this matter in Ulster. It was a matter over which the Northern Government had complete control under the 1920 Act.  He then suggested that they should withdraw in order that we might discuss the duration of the transition period amongst ourselves. They did so.</P>
    <P>WE decided to reduce the period to one month.  Bang for them to return and stated our decision.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE said he considered the decision ill advised as a month did not give the Ulster people sufficient time to reflect.  He affirmed that Craig was going to refuse the terms and that he (Lloyd George) knew this for certain.  However, as we preferred one month, he was prepared to accept the alteration and redraft the Clauses.  A month was the least possible that could be given Craig to make a final decission.  He then proposed that we dismiss and reassemble again at 10 to give him our final decision.</P>
    <P>There was a discussion amongst ourselves lasting from 9 to 11.15 at 22 Hans Place at which a decision was eventually reached to recommend the Treaty to the Dáil.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SUB-CONFERENCE NO. II</P>
    <P Just="Center">11.15 p.m.&mdash;2.20 a.m.</P>
    <P>At 11.30 we returned to Downing Street and attacked the document again.  We endeavoured to get Clause 3 removed, but failed.  We however succeeded in getting the word &ldquo;Governor-General&rdquo; out, it being left to us to decide upon a term.  The title &ldquo;President&rdquo;, Chamberlain stated, was inadmissible.</P>
    <P>MICHAEL COLLINS demanded and secured the removal of the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; as a prefix to the Irish Free State's military defence force.</P>
    <P>They agreed to the verbal changes in financial clause 5.  CHAMBERLAIN took exception to the "if anys" going in, as he said it was too late to quibble over such small points. We pointed out that Clause 9 was still left intact and that it should have been removed under the agreement on 8. LLOYD GEORGE said that it referred to transport only.  It meant ships entering harbours and that there must be provision to prevent boycotting of English shipping.  BIRKENHEAD said that the wording of the clause was ambiguous now that the compulsory Free Trade clause was gone and suggested redrafting it.  This was done immediately.</P>
    <P>MICHAEL COLLINS required the removal of Clause 14(e) (the Ulster Army) and that its substance be got into the safeguards for Ulster clause.  This was agreed to.</P>
    <P>MICHAEL COLLINS queried the reference to summoning of the Southern-Ireland Parliament in Clauses 15 &amp; 17, and BIRKENHEAD immediately drafted an explanatory memorandum as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is intended by Clauses 15 and 17 to make it plain that the functions therein referred to shall be discharged by the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland and that for that purpose a transfer shall be made by them of the necessary powers under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as soon as the mutual ratifications have been exchanged.  The Provisional Government will it is contemplated upon such ratification undertake the Govt. of S. Ireland immediately until the necessary Acts in both Parliaments confer upon it the statutory authority contemplated in this instrument.</P>
    <P>LLOYD GEORGE then asked whether we as a Delegation were prepared to accept these Articles of Agreement and to stand by them in our Parliament as they as a Delegation would stand by them in theirs.</P>
    <P>ARTHUR GRIFFITH replied, &ldquo;We do&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>WE then discussed the release of the prisoners and procedure for ratification and other matters whilst awaiting the final draft.</P>
    <P>The final draft was read over, agreed to and signed; also the Annex.</P>
    <P>THE BRITISH DELEGATION lined up to shake hands and say goodbye, and the Conference ended at 2.20 a.m. on December 6th.</P>

Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>3. The representative of the Crown in Ireland shall be appointed in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada and in accordance with the practice observed in the making of such appointments.</P>
    <P>4. The oath to be taken by Members of the Parliament of the Irish Free State shall be in the following form:—</P>
    <P>I................do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State as by law established, and that I will be faithful to H.M. King George V., his heirs and successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>5. The Irish Free State shall assume liability for the service of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment of war pensions as existing at that date in such proportion as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set off or counter-claim, the amount of such sums being determined in default of agreement by the arbitration of one or more independent persons being citizens of the British Empire.</P>
    <P>6. Until an arrangement has been made between the British and Irish Governments whereby the Irish Free State undertakes her own coastal defence, the defence by sea of Great Britain and Ireland shall be undertaken by His Majesty's Imperial Forces, but this shall not prevent the construction or maintenance by the Government of the Irish Free State of such vessels as are necessary for the protection of the Revenue or the Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The foregoing provisions of this article shall be reviewed at a conference of Representatives of the British and Irish Governments to be held at the expiration of five years from the date hereof with a view to the undertaking by Ireland of a share in her own coastal defence.</P>
    <P>7. The Government of the Irish Free State shall afford to His Majesty's Imperial Forces:—</P>
    <P>(a) In time of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the Annex hereto, or such other facilities as may from time to time be agreed between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State; and</P>
    <P>(b) In time of war or of strained relations with a Foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purposes of such defence as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>8. With a view to securing the observance of the principle of international limitation of armaments, if the Government of the Irish Free State establishes and maintains a military defence force, the establishments thereof shall not exceed in size such proportion of the military establishments maintained in Great Britain as that which the population of Ireland bears to the population of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>9. The ports of Great Britain and the Irish Free State shall be freely open to the ships of the other country on payment of the customary port and other dues.</P>
    <P>10. The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of Police Forces and other Public Servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance hereof.</P>
    <P>Provided that this agreement shall not apply to members of the Auxiliary Police Force or to persons recruited in Great Britain for the Royal Irish Constabulary during the two years next preceding the date hereof. The British Government will assume responsibility for such compensation or pensions as may be payable to any of these excepted persons.</P>
    <P>11. Until the expiration of one month from the passing of the Act of Parliament for the ratification of this instrument, the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free State shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland, and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, shall, so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, remain in full force and effect, and no election shall-be held for the return of members to serve in the Parliament of the Irish Free State for constituencies in Northern Ireland, unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in favour of the holding of such elections before the end of the said month.</P>
    <P>12. If before the expiration of the said month, an address is presented to His Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that effect, the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland, and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, continue to be of full force and effect, and this instrument shall have effect subject to the necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>Provided that if such an address is so presented a Commission consisting of three persons, one to be appointed by the Government of the Irish Free State, one to be appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland, and one who shall be Chairman to be appointed by the British Government shall determine in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions, the boundaries between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland, and for the purposes of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and of this instrument, the boundary of Northern Ireland shall be such as may be determined by such Commission.</P>
    <P>13. For the purpose of the last foregoing article, the powers of the Parliament of Southern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to elect members of the Council of Ireland shall after the Parliament of the Irish Free State is constituted be exercised by that Parliament.</P>
    <P>14. After the expiration of the said month, if no such address as is mentioned in Article 12 hereof is presented, the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland shall continue to exercise as respects Northern Ireland the powers conferred on them by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, but the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall in Northern Ireland have in relation to matters in respect of which the Parliament of Northern Ireland has not power to make laws under that Act (including matters which under the said Act are within the jurisdiction of the Council of Ireland) the same powers as in the rest of Ireland, subject to such other provisions as may be agreed in manner hereinafter appearing.</P>
    <P>15. At any time after the date hereof the Government of Northern Ireland and the provisional Government of Southern Ireland hereinafter constituted may meet for the purpose of discussing the provisions subject to which the last foregoing Article is to operate in the event of no such address as is herein mentioned being presented and those provisions may include:—</P>
    <P>(a) Safeguards with regard to patronage in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(b) Safegurds with regard to the collection of revenue in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(c) Safeguards with regard to import and export duties affecting the trade or industry of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(d) Safeguards for minorities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(e) The settlement of the financial relations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>(f) The establishment and powers of a local militia in Northern Ireland and the relation of the Defence Forces of the Irish Free State and of Northern Ireland respectively,</P>
    <P>and if at any such meeting provisions are agreed to, the same shall have effect as if they were included amongst the provisions subject to which the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free State are to be exercisable in Northern Ireland under Article 14 hereof.</P>
    <P>16. Neither the Parliament of the Irish Free State nor the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall make any law so as either directly or indirectly to endow any religion or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status or affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at the school or make any discrimination as respects State aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations or divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution any of its property except for public utility purposes and on payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>17. By way of provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State in accordance therewith, steps shall be taken forthwith for summoning a meeting of members of Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and for constituting a provisional Government, and the British Government shall take the steps necessary to transfer to such provisional Government the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties, provided that every member of such provisional Government shall have signified in writing his or her acceptance of this instrument. But this arrangement shall not continue in force beyond the expiration of twelve months from the date hereof.</P>
    <P>18. This instrument shall be submitted forthwith by His Majesty's Government for the approval of Parliament and by the Irish signatories to a meeting summoned for the purpose of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.</P>

    <Title>APPENDIX 16 [LETTER FROM D. LLOYD GEORGE TO A. GRIFFITH]</Title>
    <P Just="Right">10, Downing Street, S.W.I.</P>
    <P Just="Right">13th December, 1921.</P>
    <P>Sir,</P>
    <P>As doubts may be expressed regarding certain points not specifically mentioned in the Treaty terms I think it is important that their meaning should be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>The first question relates to the method of appointment of the Representatives of the Crown in Ireland.  Article III of the Agreement lays down that he is to be appointed &ldquo;in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada and in accordance with the practice observed in the making of such appointment.&rdquo;  This means that the Government of the Irish Free State will be consulted so as to ensure a selection acceptable to the Irish Government before any recommendation is made to His Majesty.</P>
    <P>The second question is as to the scope of the Arbitration contemplated in Article V regarding Ireland's liability for a share of War Pensions and the Public Debt.  The procedure contemplated by the conference was that the British Government should submit its claim, and that the Government of the Irish Free State should submit any counterclaim to which it thought Ireland entitled.  Upon the case so submitted the Arbitrators would decide after making such further enquiries as they might think necessary; their decision would then be final and binding on both parties.  It is of course understood that the arbitrator or arbitrators to whom the case is referred shall be men as to whose impartiality both the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State are satisfied.</P>
    <P>The third question relates to the status of the Irish Free State.  The special arrangements agreed between us in Articles VI, VII, VIII and IX, which are not in the Canadian constitution in no way affect status.  They are necessitated by the proximity and interdependence of the two islands&mdash;by conditions, that is, which do not exist in the case of Canada.  They in no way affect the position of the Irish Free State in the Commonwealth or its title to representation, like Canada, in the Assembly of the League of Nations.  They were agreed between us for our mutual benefit, and have no bearing of any kind upon the question of status.  It is our desire that Ireland shall rank as co-equal with the other nations of the Commonwealth, and we are ready to support her claim to a similar place in the League of Nations as soon as her new constitution comes into effect.</P>
    <P>The framing of that constitution will be in the hands of the Irish Government, subject of course to the terms of the Agreement, and to the pledges given in respect of the minority by the head of the Irish Delegation.  The establishment and composition of the Second Chamber is therefore in the discretion of the Irish people.  There is nothing in the Articles of Agreement to suggest that Ireland is in this respect bound to the Canadian model.</P>
    <P>I may add that we propose to begin withdrawing the military and Auxiliary forces of the Crown in Southern Ireland when the Articles of Agreement are ratified.</P>
    <P>I am, Sir,</P>
    <P>Your Obedient Servant,</P>

    <Title>APPENDIX 17 PROPOSED TREATY OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN IRELAND AND THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT DE VALERA TO THE SECRET SESSION OF AN DÁIL</Title>
    <P>In order to bring to an end the long and ruinous conflict between Great Britain and Ireland by a sure and lasting peace honourable to both nations, it is agreed</P>
    <P>1.  That the legislative, executive, and judicial authority of Ireland shall be derived solely from the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>2.  That, for purposes of common concern, Ireland shall be associated with the States of the British Commonwealth, viz: the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa.</P>
    <P>3.  That when acting as an associate the rights, status, and privileges of Ireland shall be in no respect less than those enjoyed by any of the component states of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>4.  That the matters of &ldquo;common concern&rdquo; shall include Defence, Peace and War, Political Treaties, and all matters now treated as of common concern amongst the States of the British Commonwealth, and that in these matters there shall be between Ireland and the States of the British commonwealth &ldquo;such concerted action founded on consultation as the several Governments may determine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>5.  That in virtue of this association of Ireland with the States of the British Commonwealth citizens of Ireland in any of these States shall not be subject to any disabilities which a citizen of one of the component States of the British Commonwealth would not be subject to, and reciprocally for citizens of these States in Ireland.</P>
    <P>6.  That, for purposes of the Association, Ireland shall recognise His Britannic Majesty as head of the Association.</P>
    <P>7.  That, so far as her resources permit, Ireland shall provide for her own defence by sea, land and air, and shall repel by force any attempt by a foreign power to violate the integrity of her soil and territorial waters, or to use them for any purpose hostile to Great Britain and the other associated States.</P>
    <P>8.  That for five years, pending the establishment of Irish coastal defence forces, or for such other period as the Governments of the two countries may later agree upon, facilities for the coastal defence of Ireland shall be given to the British Government as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  In time of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the Annex hereto, or such other facilities as may from time to time be agreed upon between the British Government and the Government of Ireland.</P>
    <P>(b)  In time of war such harbour and other Naval facilities as the British Government may reasonably require for the purposes of such defence as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>9.  That within five years from the date of exchange of ratifications of this treaty a conference between the British and Irish Governments shall be held in order to arrange for the handing over of the coastal defence of Ireland to the Irish Government unless some other arrangement for naval defence be agreed by both Governments to be desirable in the common interest of Ireland, Great Britain, and the other associated States.</P>
    <P>10.  That, in order to co-operate in furthering the principle of international limitation of armaments, the Government of Ireland shall not</P>
    <P>(a)  Build submarines unless by agreement with Great Britain and the other States of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>(b)  Maintain a military defence force, the establishments whereof exceed in size such proportion of the military establishments maintained in Great Britain as that which the population of Ireland bears to the population of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>11.  That the Governments of Great Britain and of Ireland shall make a convention for the regulation of civil communication by air.</P>
    <P>12.  That the ports of Great Britain and of Ireland shall be freely open to the ships of each country on payment of the customary port and other dues.</P>
    <P>13.  That Ireland shall assume liability for such share of the present public debt of Great Britain and Ireland and of the payment of war pensions as existing at this date as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set off or counter claim, the amount of such sums being determined, in default of agreement, by the arbitration of one or more independent persons being citizens of Ireland or of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>14.  That the Government of Ireland agrees to pay compensation on terms not less favourable than those proposed by the British Government of Ireland Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of Police Forces and other Public Servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of government effected in pursuance hereof.</P>
    <P>Provided that this agreement shall not apply to members of the Auxiliary Police Force or to persons recruited in Great Britain for the Royal Irish Constabulary during the two years next preceding the date hereof.  The British Government will assume responsibility for such compensation or pensions as may be payable to any of these excepted persons.</P>
    <P>15.  That neither the Parliament of Ireland nor the Parliament of that part of the province of Ulster which is defined as Northern Ireland in the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, shall make any law so as either directly or indirectly to endow any religion or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status or affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at the school or make any discrimination as respects State aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations or divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution any of its property except for public utility purposes and on payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>16.  That by way of transitional arrangement for the Administration of Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the setting up of a Parliament and Government of Ireland in accordance herewith, the members elected for constituencies in Ireland since the passing of the British Government of Ireland Act in 1920 shall at a meeting summoned for the purpose elect a transitional government to which the British Government and Dáil Éireann shall transfer the authority, powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties, provided that every member of such transitional government shall have signified in writing his or her acceptance of this instrument.  But this arrangement shall not continue in force beyond the expiration of twelve months from the date hereof.</P>
    <P>17.  That without recognising the right of any part of Ireland to be excluded from the supreme authority of the national Parliament and Government; nevertheless, in sincere regard for internal peace, and in the desire to bring no force or coercion to bear upon any substantial part of the province of Ulster whose inhabitants may now be opposed to the acceptance of the National Authority, the following provisions shall have effect in the case of that portion of Ulster which is defined as &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; in the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>18.  Until the expiration of one month from the passing of the Act of Parliament for the ratification of this instrument, the powers of the Parliament and the Government of Ireland shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland, and the provisions of the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, shall, so far as they relate to Northern Ireland have full force and effect, and no election shall be held for the return of members to serve in the Parliament of Ireland for constituencies in Northern Ireland, unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in favour of the holding of such elections before the end of the said month.</P>
    <P>19.  If before the expiration of the said month, an address is presented to His Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that effect, the powers of the Parliament and the Government of Ireland shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland, and the provisions of the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, continue to be of full force and effect, and this instrument shall have effect subject to the necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>Provided that if such an address is so presented a Commission consisting of three persons, one to be appointed by the Government of Ireland, one to be appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland, and one who shall be Chairman to be appointed by the British Government shall determine in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions the boundaries between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland, and for the purposes of the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and of this instrument, the boundary of Northern Ireland shall be such as may be determined by such Commission.</P>
    <P>20.  For the purpose of the last foregoing article, the powers of the Parliament, defined as the Parliament of southern Ireland under the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to elect members of the Council of Ireland shall be exercised by the Parliament of Ireland.</P>
    <P>21.  After the expiration of the said month, if no such address as is mentioned in Article 19 hereof is presented, the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland shall continue to exercise as respects Northern Ireland the powers conferred on them by the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, but the Parliament and Government of Ireland shall in Northern Ireland have in relation to matters in respect of which the Parliament of Northern Ireland has not power to make laws under that Act (including matters which under the said Act are within the jurisdiction of the Council of Ireland) the same powers as in the rest of Ireland, subject to such other provisions as may be agreed in manner hereinafter appearing.</P>
    <P>22.  At any time after the date hereof the Government of Northern Ireland and the transitional Government of Ireland provided for in Article 16 may meet for the purpose of discussing the provisions subject to which the last foregoing Article is to operate in the event of no such address as is therein mentioned being presented and those provisions may include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Safeguards with regard to patronage in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(b)  Safeguards with regard to the collection of revenue in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(c)  Safeguards with regard to import and export duties affecting the trade or industry of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(d)  Safeguards for minorities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(e)  The settlement of the financial relations between Northern Ireland and Ireland.</P>
    <P>(f)  The establishment and powers of a local militia in Northern Ireland and the relation of the Defence Forces of Ireland and of Northern Ireland respectively,</P>
    <P>and if at any such meeting provisions are agreed to the same shall have effect as if they were included amongst the provisions subject to which the powers of the Parliament and the government of Ireland are to be exercisable in Northern Ireland under Article 21 hereof.</P>
    <P>23.  That this instrument shall be submitted forthwith by His Britiannic Majesty's Government for the approval of the Parliament at Westminster, and by the Cabinet of Dáil Éireann to a meeting of the members elected for the constituencies in Ireland set forth in the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.</P>

    <Title>APPENDIX 18 THE PRESIDENT'S ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS</Title>
    <P>The following Motion will be proposed by the President at the present Session of Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That inasmuch as the &lsquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland&rsquo;, signed in London on December 6th, 1921, do not reconcile Irish National aspirations and the Association of Ireland with the Community of Nations known as the British Commonwealth, and can not be the basis of an enduring peace between the Irish and the British peoples, DÁIL ÉIREANN, in the name of the Sovereign Irish Nation, makes to the Government of Great Britain, to the Governments of the other States of the British Commonwealth, and to the peoples of Great Britain and of these several States, the following Proposal for a Treaty of Amity and Association which DÁIL ÉIREANN is convinced could be entered into by the Irish people with the sincerity of goodwill&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>

    <P>4.  That the matters of &ldquo;common concern&rdquo; shall include Defence, Peace and War, Political Treaties, and all matters now treated as of common concern amongst the States of the British Commonwealth, and that in these matters there shall be between Ireland and the States of the British Commonwealth &ldquo;such concerted action founded on consultation as the several Governments may determine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>5.  That in virtue of this association of Ireland with the States of the British Commonwealth citizens of Ireland in any of these States shall not be subject to any disabilities which a citizen of one of the component States of the British Commonwealth would not be subject to, and reciprocally for citizens of these States in Ireland.</P>

    <P>8.  That for five years, pending the establishment of Irish coastal defence forces, or for such other period as the Governments of the two countries may later agree upon, facilities for the coastal defence of Ireland shall be given to the British Government as follows:</P>

    <P>9.  That within five years from the date of exchange of ratifications of this treaty a conference between the British and Irish Governments shall be held in order to hand over the coastal defence of Ireland to the Irish Government, unless some other arrangement for naval defence be agreed by both Governments to be desirable in the common interest of Ireland, Great Britain, and the other associated States.</P>
    <P>10.  That, in order to co-operate in furthering the principle of international limitation of armaments, the Government of Ireland shall not</P>
    <P>(a)  Build submarines unless by agreement with Great Britain and the other States of the Commonwealth.</P>

    <P>14.  That the Government of Ireland agrees to pay compensation on terms not less favourable than those proposed by the British Government of Ireland Act of 1920 to that Government's judges, officials, members of Police Forces and other Public Servants who are discharged by the Government of Ireland or who retire in consequence of the change of government effected in pursuance hereof.</P>
    <P>Provided that this agreement shall not apply to members of the Auxiliary Police Force or to persons recruited in Great Britain for the Royal Irish Constabulary during the two years next preceding the date hereof.  The British Government will assume responsibility for such compensation or pensions as may be payable to any of these excepted persons.</P>

    <P>That whilst refusing to admit the right of any part of Ireland to be excluded from the supreme authority of the Parliament of Ireland, or that the relations between the Parliament of Ireland and any subordinate legislature in Ireland can be a matter for treaty with a Government outside Ireland, nevertheless, in sincere regard for internal peace, and in order to make manifest our desire not to bring force or coercion to bear upon any substantial part of the province of Ulster, whose inhabitants may now be unwilling to accept the national authority, we are prepared to grant to that portion of Ulster which is defined as Northern Ireland in the British Government of Ireland Act of 1920, privileges and safeguards not less substantial than those provided for in the &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo; between Great Britain and Ireland signed in London on December 6th, 1921.</P>
