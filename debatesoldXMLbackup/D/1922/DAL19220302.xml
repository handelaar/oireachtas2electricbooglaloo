      <P>Last night I proposed that we should take up the appointment of a Deputy Speaker and the President suggested it should be this morning.  He has proposed as Deputy Speaker a member of the House who is not definitely opposed to the Treaty.  It is usual, I think, in these cases&mdash;at least, if there are two parties in the House&mdash;if the Speaker is on one side that the Deputy Speaker be chosen by courtesy from the other side, it being understood that both should be non-partisan. Hence, if the appointment had been reached last night, I would have proposed Mr. Seán T.O Ceallaigh.  He was to be appointed at the first Session of the Dáil&mdash;as a matter of fact, it was intended by a number of members to propose him as he had been the first Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil&mdash;but his activities and duties in Paris prevented him from being present.  I asked him to withdraw his nomination, which he did, at my request.  I feel that as he is now back and as the understanding with me then was that if he was able to come back that would not prevent his occupying the Chair again if he was nominated, I think it is only fair that his name should be put forward and I propose him.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I am going to vote against your election as Deputy Speaker on the grounds of your unfairness and partisanship in this Chair.  On the first day's meeting, upon the debate on the Estimates, I rose to speak to an amendment, as I was perfectly entitled to do, in accordance with the Standing Orders. You, sir, ruled me out.  Then I challenged your ruling and asked you upon what grounds you gave it.  You said you did it &ldquo;in this special case.&rdquo;  Now, Sir, I had spoken previously upon the motion.  I had only spoken once upon that motion and I was perfectly entitled to speak upon that motion once.  I was again perfectly entitled to speak upon the amendment once.  Your ruling, Sir, could not be sustained by a previous precedent created in this House.  You had, in order to justify what was manifestly unfair, to manufacture an excuse which could not be sustained by you or by any other tribunal.  Therefore, upon those grounds, and, further, upon the action which you took last night when you allowed a motion that to-day's meeting be held in the Mansion House to be disposed of by a mere trick, I oppose your election.  You yourself suggested that you would first take the hour for the adjournment and when that was done you would discuss the place in which we were next to meet.  When we, <Col N="177" /> accepting your ruling, and thinking that you yourself would see it carried out in fairness, agreed to that procedure you allowed the House immediately afterwards to be adjourned without the place for the resumption of the Session being fixed.  I hold that you did both of those things simply with the desire to benefit and for the advantage of that side which you are so closely and intimately associated with.  Therefore, I say you are incompetent to sit as Chairman in this House.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I have received a letter from Mr. MacNeill which I should like to communicate to the House.  He writes to me about other matters and in the course of the letter he says: &ldquo;Will you kindly explain to the President and any Deputy who is concerned that continuous insomnia renders me unable to stand the strain of presiding at the Dáil meetings at present.&rdquo;  I do not know whether it means that he intends to resign.  At all events it means that for some time we shall not have our Ceann Comhairle. Under these circumstances, it might be that the question will arise not merely of appointing a Deputy Chairman but a Chairman also, and I think it would be well that the whole question should be adjourned until we ascertain Mr. MacNeill's intention.  I think the other side would agree, if there is to be a resignation from the Chair, that these two matters would be dealt with at the same time.</P>

      <P>In view of the statement I made yesterday, in reference to Mr. MacNeill's failure to give any explanation of his absence here, I desire now to express my regret that I should have suggested that the censure of the House should be voted on him.  The telegram which was sent the first morning seemed to me to treat this Assembly with levity, and having got no explanation for that day, or the following day, I must say, I felt more or less that it was his intention to disregard these preceedings.  That is why I said what I said.  I regret as much as anybody that Mr. MacNeill should suffer from insomnia, or any other disability, which would not give us the advantage of his presence here.</P>

Is there any seconder for that motion?</P>

      <P>I would like to second that.  In connection with it, I would like to know if the official report of these proceedings is to be published. The reason I am in favour of the Mansion House now and in favour of the publication of the official reports is that the reports in the newspapers are quite inaccurate.  I have noticed several inaccuracies already.  I do not think it worth while to refer to them.  One inaccuracy has been pointed out here this morning.  It is in leaded type in the <i>Independent</i> newspaper in regard to a statement of mine.  I am reported as having said, in answer to a question by Deputy Hogan, which probably was a rhetorical question on his part&mdash;&ldquo;Did they believe it was a sovereign assembly?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I would be the first to sweep you and men like you out of a sovereign Assembly.&rdquo;  What I did say, and what I have been trying to say, is if we want to have order in the country and ordered Government, we must recognise that this is the supreme and sovereign Parliament of the nation during the interval that must elapse before the elections.  Unless you stand on that principle, I see no principle on which we can stand, and when the <Col N="178" /> Provisional Government was put up, or various members of it, as being superior to the authority of this Dáil, which is the Government of the Republic, I questioned it every time and tried to make it clear that we, anyhow, regard the permission of the actions of the Provisional Government as coming from the majority of this Dáil.  I said that were it not for that majority they would not be allowed to function.  Neither would they.  And what I said yesterday was that if they were not protected by the right which the majority here gave them that I for one&mdash;whilst I have been doing everything that one person can do, and any influence I have I have exercised it to see that any authority that is derived from this House is respected&mdash;would be the first to say that any definitely usurping authority should be swept out of existence.  I did not of course say what is put down here.</P>
      <P>The necessity, therefore, for full reports is very clear, and the only way in which we can be protected&mdash;and we do need protection at the present time&mdash;is to meet in presence of the public.  At the Ard Fheis an attempt was made to misrepresent me, but the Ard Fheis was a large body and they could deal with it. The public could deal with it and they did deal with it.  Here we have a very small body, and it is necessary, at least when we have no newspapers that would give impartial reports, that we should have the public present.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask what is the object of this migration from here to the Mansion House.  Have we not facilities here to complete our business?  What is the necessity of giving the officials of this House all the trouble and inconvenience of transferring their requirements from here to the Mansion House?  I can see no reason whatever for such a change.  Certainly no reason has been given yet by either the proposer or the seconder which warrants this proposal getting the support of any section of this House.  I can not see, even from their own party point of view, what they expect to gain from that.  If a motion that upsets the arrangements of this House is put forward, unless it is supported by some serious reason for such a change&mdash;and certainly neither the proposer nor the seconder has offered one single reason why we should transfer our business from here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to know how you are going to avoid misrepresentation in the Mansion House.  To save the Republic, I am informed.  I did not think that saving the Republic was a laughing matter for the Deputy from Cork or the Deputy from Waterford.  I think it is not a matter for levity.  We are told this is the sovereign assembly of the Irish nation, and at a time when we were all hoping that this useless and exasperating exchange of personalities was beginning to cease, a very important member of this assembly rises and moves that the business be adjourned from here to the Mansion House&mdash;to avoid gross misrepresentation Mr. De Valera says&mdash;to save the Republic the seconder of the motion says.</P>

      <P>And how are you going to have the public in the Mansion House, any more than here? How are you going to make arrangements between now and the afternoon for the proper admission of the public? I take it that we have some regard for the dignity of this Assembly, and that we do not want to have in the Mansion House partisan crowds that will disturb the procedure of the assembly.  I am concerned with the proper procedure and with getting the actual work before this Dáil through in order that those who have the very serious work of getting stability into the affairs of the Irish nation might be relieved from the distractions which they are subjected to here and that they might get on with the nation's work.  I say this attempt to transfer the business is simply an attempt to interfere with that serious work, and those concerned have a serious responsibility if they persist in it.</P>

      <P>I was the Deputy that was speaking when the interruption which Deputy de Valera referred to occurred.  I have no idea now what was said, and I could not have any idea and the Press could not have a proper idea of what was said, because there was a constant stream of interruptions going on the whole time.  It is perfectly clear that that is the reason for the inaccurate Press reports.  It is quite impossible, I think, to have accurate reports, if irrelevant observations and interruptions are being made from all parts of the House, and it is equally clear that going to the Mansion House is not going to improve that in the slightest extent.  I suggest to the House that if they want accurate Press reports they should listen to the speakers and allow the Press to take a fair note of what is said.</P>

      <P>I wish to press the motion that we adjourn to the Mansion House.  I do so for many reasons.  One is the gross inaccuracies that the Press are printing about the minority.  We were charged here yesterday.  One of the charges made was that a motion I brought on was a dishonest motion.  The newspapers got hold of that, but not one word of what I said in explanation was presented.  I say we want to get publicity in everything we do.  We want to let the people see that we are acting honestly by them.  We want the people to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  I support the motion, that we adjourn to the Mansion House.</P>

      <P>I support the motion that we go to the Mansion House as I have always been in favour of open meetings&mdash;meetings not being held in secret&mdash;unless there is some vital necessity for it.  I support it because I think the Irish people have a right to hear what their Deputies are saying. They have as much right to hear as the foreign Press.  I myself am not afraid of being accurately heard by the people of Ireland.  I am not afraid of anything I may say being repeated through the length and breadth of this island.  I cannot conceive why the opposition are so afraid of the public at this moment. I am rather sorry to see Irishmen putting up such a nervous front at this moment.  I believe myself that it is in the interests of not only peace but truth that the public should be allowed into this meeting.  I have no fear of the House being packed, because, personally, I would not take advantage of <Col N="180" /> any such thing myself.  I find it hard to imagine that even the Treaty people would go around packing the House with people to make a row there.  Personally I would willingly give a guarantee that anyone I gave a ticket to or asked permission for would not make any disturbance.  The Sinn Féin proceedings were very orderly, and it was almost an open meeting.  There were so many people there&mdash;3,000 of them&mdash;that it was almost a public meeting.  Here we have a very small number and we have a malicious Press who are misrepresenting every statement we make and using it for party purposes.  Therefore, I say in the interests of truth and for the interests of Ireland, which must always be the interests of truth as long as we are true to the old traditions of the Fianna of Ireland and of every great Irishman in the past, the public ought to be allowed to be present at our meetings and know the lies their newspapers are circulating.  I would like to point out how absurd it is to talk of the paraphenalia to be carried across.  What are three ink bottles and a few pieces of paper?  I think Deputy Milroy could carry over the lot himself.</P>

      <P>Personally, I have no objection whatsoever to going anywhere where the public would hear us, but I cannot understand why, on what should be the last day of this Session, we should be asked to go to the Mansion House and throw it open to the public, without any arrangements having been made for admission, by ticket or otherwise.  It is very important that the public should know some of the things.  For instance, I would like to have the public and the workers of Dublin&mdash; one particular section of them&mdash;present to hear Count Plunkett talking of his anxiety for labour representation.  I would like them to hear many other things said in that way.  I am perfectly serious on this point.  This is the last day and I am at a loss to know why a motion such as this should come up.  It is not serious, with all due respects to the mover and seconder.  I wish to repeat what Deputy Hogan said.  If the members on both sides would simply refrain from interrupting the speakers the Press would have an opportunity of reporting the proceedings correctly.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if anybody here has been in communication with the Lord Mayor regarding the use of the Mansion House. The usual procedure with regard to the letting of the Mansion House is that a record is kept of lettings, or engagements or anything of that sort.  Nobody, that I know of, has made any enquiry of me&mdash;and I am acting as Deputy for the Lord Mayor&mdash;as to whether or not the Mansion House is available.  You had from last evening and I spoke of it last evening.</P>
      <P>Another thing I have got to say is if people are anxious for publicity I think they ought to get it.  Document No. 2 will give it.  This is all nonsense, this talk of publicity.  You are afraid of the public.  We told you that before and you know it, and the public will give you very shortly what their impression is about it.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Dublin public will be complimented by the slur that was cast on them by the gentleman who has dared to insinuate that the Dublin public would interfere with the proceedings of the Dáil.  When they know what he has said they will likely know him better than they do at present.  It is quite evident that the acoustic properties here in these two rooms are such that what is said cannot be heard.  I was speaking myself to several members of the Press after the last Session and they told me they could not hear what was being said. Therefore, I am quite satisfied, so far as the reporters are concerned, that it was not their fault that misrepresentation has been carried on in the Dublin Press. But on the other hand, it is quite clear that some of it has been done.  I will just prove it to you.  I put several questions to the Minister for Defence yesterday.  When he answered, I put a supplementary question and I purposely prefaced my remarks, in putting that supplementary question, by saying that, personally, I paid no attention whatever to what was said by British politicians in the British House of Commons, but that my attention had been drawn to certain statements made by a British Minister a day or two previously&mdash; statements which appeared in the Dublin daily papers.  I purposely prefaced my remarks by saying that I myself paid no attention to what these people said, but that, unfortunately, a section of the Irish public did.  Consequently, I asked the Minister for Defence to say what truth, if any, was in certain statements made by Mr. Churchill.  Now, the remarks I made at first are not included at all in the report and the answer given by the Minister for Defence to me would seem to be a contemptuous one.  In justice to him, I must say he did not answer contemptuously at all.  I was perfectly satisfied with the answer he gave.  That is one of the reasons why I suggest that we should go to the Mansion House.  The acoustic properties of the place are much better than here. Everybody could hear what was said and when there is misrepresentation in the Press the public who would be present will understand the game that is being played.  Moreover, the atmosphere of this place is such that upon my word &mdash;I do not know whether it seems so to everyone&mdash;in this room, at times, it seems stifling.  Others have complained of the same thing.  I suppose the place is not intended for such a large number of people.</P>
      <P>Another thing.  It was the custom always to have the meetings of the Dáil in the Mansion House.  Owing to the time of tension that prevailed when the Treaty was to be discussed by the Dáil, it was agreed, on both sides, that we should come here and that the public should not be admitted.  That time is now over and there is no reason, therefore, why we should not revert to the former practice.  This matter of going to the Mansion House was referred to by one of the Deputies from Roscommon at the first meeting here, the day before yesterday.  Consequently, there was plenty of time to make preparations. Even at the present time, in the ordinary way, we would not come to the second Session until 4 o'clock and it is only 12 o'clock now.  We have four hours to arrange it.  If there is not another assembly of some other body to take place in the Mansion House.  I do not really see why the thing is not practicable.</P>

      <P>(c)  Is it not a fact that, since the removal of the Boycott upon Belfast and its associated districts, there has been a very considerable increase in the number of outrages committed upon the Nationalist and Catholic population under Sir James Craig's Government? Do these outrages number now over 30 murders and over 200 attempts at murder?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in view of this grave and scandalous state of affairs in Belfast will he re-impose and strictly enforce the Belfast Boycott?</P>
      <P>(d)  Has the President received a telegraphic communication from Mr. Desmond Crean, Chairman of the Joseph Plunkett Sinn Féin Club, Belfast, giving him details of the outrages to which the Catholic population of Belfast are now being subjected under the Government of Sir James Craig?</P>
      <P>If the President has not received the telegram to which I refer, has he not nevertheless received authentic accounts of the outrages from other reliable and unquestionable sources?</P>
      <P>In any case, since the occurrence of these outrages is common knowledge, what measures do the President and his associates propose to take for the protection of the Nationalists and Catholic population of this country who live in Belfast and elsewhere, counties of Armagh, Down, Antrim, Derry, Fermanagh, and Tyrone?</P>

The Cabinet will, if the outrages continue, consider the advisability of resuming the Boycott.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  The answer to the first part of the question is yes.  As regards the second the difficulty the Government experienced in taking effective steps to deal with this matter is principally due to the <Col N="186" /> delay in the establishment of the Free State Parliament to which Mr. McEntee and the Belfast pogromists are united in opposition.

    <P>(a)  Does the President of the Republic accept as accurately representing his position the statement made at Westminster on February 16th by Mr. Winston Churchill, when he said, in introducing the Free State Bill,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now take Mr. Griffith's position. Mr. Griffith has not joined this Government (the Provisional Government).  He has been chosen as President of the Dáil, and he is also in Irish eyes President of the non-recognised Irish Republic, and he, if the Irish people accepted his advice and guidance, and endorse and ratify the Treaty which he has signed, will he be able to dis-establish the Irish Republic and lay aside its functions.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>(b)  Does the President of the Republic accept as a proper representation of the future relations between Ireland and England the following statement made by Mr. Austen Chamberlain in the course of the debate on the Free State Bill at Westminster:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have found a new solution in the development of the self-governing Dominions giving immense, almost absolute, freedom within their domestic affairs.  We have offered that position to Ireland, with only the limitations that Ireland remain within the Empire, accept citizenship, acknowledge allegiance to the King, national existence and to the maintenance of the communications of Empire. Who pressed us to give as near to Dominion Home Rule as we could but the Southern Unionists.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>(c)  Is it the intention of the President of the Republic in compliance with the agreement reached at the recent Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, and in justice to the Republic, to relieve all Ministers under the Provisional Government of their offices in Dáil Éireann immediately, appoint other Ministers to the vacant places in the Government of the Republic, and thus put an end to the anomaly of Ministers subverting the Republic they are supposed to uphold?</P>
    <P>(d)  Will the Chairman of the Delegation state if Mr. Winston Churchill was within the truth in saying of the Ulster option when introducing his Free State Bill at Westminster:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As to the month in which Ulster can exercise its option there is a difference of opinion between the Attorney-General and the Irish Signatories.  The Irish Ministers quite definitely hold that the month should run from the passing of the present Bill.  The view of the Attorney-General is that the month runs from the passing of the confirmatory legislation.  There will, however, be no question about it, the Irish Signatories to the Treaty having agreed from reasons of fair play to waive these views.  So Ulster will not have a decision without seeing the form of Government with which she will be associated.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If it be true that Ulster will not be called upon to make a decision before seeing that intended form of Government, will similar provision be made for all citizens of the Republic?</P>
    <P>(e)  Will the Chairman of the Delegation to London say whether during the negotiations there, any use was made of the threat indicated by Mr. Austen Chamberlain when he said in the course of the debate on the Free State Bill at Westminster:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At one time we thought it was certain the struggle would have to be renewed.  We were in communication with military and police advisors.  We were prepared, if no other course was available, to raise 100,000 men, in addition to putting every available soldier into Ireland to wage the cruellest of all wars, civil war, and the cruellest of all forms of civil war, guerilla war.&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>(a)  Whether <Col N="187" /> Mr. Churchill said that or not I have no evidence, but as an Irishman I accept no statement of my position made by an Englishman.  I state it myself.</P>
      <P>(b)  The same answer applies.  Everybody knows my position.  I am standing for this Treaty, and all these attempts to make these little traps are of no avail. I am not discussing my position, but I am the person to define exactly what my position is, not any Englishman.</P>

      <P>(a)  In face of the declaration made by Mr. Winston Churchill in introducing the Free State Bill at Westminster that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ulster will not have a decision without seeing the form of Government with which she will be associated; and in the meantime that Ulster stands wholly unaffected by the legislation&rdquo;</P>
      <P>he has considered the propriety of defining the extent of Ireland's financial obligation in the event of the final ratification of the Treaty, which provides in Clause V. that &ldquo;The Irish Free State shall assume liability for the service of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom ... and towards the payment of war pensions&rdquo;; is he in a position to say approximately what Ireland's annual burden will be under this Clause of the Treaty; if not, does he expect to be able to give the Irish people the necessary information on the subject before the General Election?</P>
      <P>(b)  Can the Minister of Finance say by what authority Lord Birkenhead stated at Westminster, February 14th:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is plain Mr. Collins is afraid an attempt might be made by violence by those who hoped to wreck the Treaty, and destroy the Provisional Government by seducing from them the armed forces upon whom, if it came to a trial of strength, they must in the last resort depend.&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins1919" hpid="MR. COLLINS MR. COLLINS">
      <NameTxt>MR. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>That question may be divided into three parts, the first part having absolutely no connection with the second and third parts.  I do not see why the first part of the question is addressed to the Minister of Finance.  To deal with the question of Ireland's financial obligation or otherwise was put forward by me, helped by an expert Advisory Committee, as part of the work of the Irish Delegation in London.  The British Government exchanged at the same time a memorandum giving their statement of their claim.  Those two statements stand to be arbitrated on under the Articles of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>As to what will happen, in the first place, let me say that I do not accept until that arbitration is completed that we owe England any contribution either annually or specific and I would not advise any representative of Ireland to suggest that we do owe them any contribution, as it weakens our case.  If I have anything to do with advising on the matter, supposing the arbitration is given that we do owe something I shall advice that the liability be redeemed at once, and it is only when the liability can be seen that any chancellor can put forward proposals for redeeming it.  Whether or not I shall be in a position to give the necessary information to the Irish people will depend largely upon whether we can have the necessary machinery working under the arbitration clauses.  In my own opinion, or, at least as things look, I fancy it is only when a stable Government comes into power that any financial adjustment can absolutely be made.</P>
      <P>(b)  For a reply to that question I refer the Deputy for Louth to Lord Birkenhead.</P>

      <P>Obviously this is an excellent proposal, with which I am in complete sympathy, but there is nothing on the Estimates to meet it at present, and if the House recognised it was a good principle I could prepare an estimate of the definite sum required for the next meeting of the Dáil.  I could not, obviously, ask the Dáil to command me to give an indefinite sum.  It would be required to know what rates have been struck and what the proceeds mean. Meanwhile there is another suggestion I would like to make.  Where classes for adults are being conducted they can get a certain grant from the Department of Agriculture.  I do not know if that has been tried in Co. Waterford.  It has been in County Cork and the amount is very indefinite.  For Co. Waterford a rate of 1d. in the £ would mean £1,100 but clearly in Co. Cork it would be much bigger.  The amount would vary considerably. If it is confined to the Gaedhealtacht areas, which I would define as four counties of Munster&mdash;Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Clare&mdash;two in Connaught &mdash;Galway and Mayo&mdash;and one in Ulster &mdash;Donegal&mdash;I could find the means required and submit it to the House, or perhaps the House could authorise the Ministry if the principle is adopted; that is the best thing that can be done under the circumstance.</P>

      <P>On the 28th January, the staff of the Boycott Department got notice that their services would not be required after the 24th February.  A few of them worked for the month.  The majority of them got a month's pay in lieu of notice.  It has now been decided by the Cabinet to pay them three months' salary, so that there will be no dispute about it afterwards.  I am taking it the staff means the office staff, the organisers of patrol, and the four Secretaries for Cork, Derry, Limerick, and Belfast.  The total amount of the three months' salaries is £1,507 5s.  There was some objection to the Estimates the other day.  The cost of the Department up to the present is over £1,500: the three months' salaries will cost £1,507. The Estimate is £3,000.  As far as I can, within that estimate, I will pay three months' salaries to the staff.  I cannot see my way to come along here afterwards to be told I paid out something I had no right to pay.  Of course I will not pay any member of the staff who has got other employment.  I do not think any of them have, but if they have I will not pay them.  I want that to be distinctly understood, that it is only those who cannot get other employment that I consider are entitled to payment. Of course, if one or two get other employment I will be able to keep the estimate within £3,000.</P>

      <P>I do not think consideration of that motion will take very long.  I should like to say at the outset that in putting it on the paper I did so expecting that it would be entirely a matter of form, in order to sanction by this sovereign Assembly the agreement come to at the recent Ard Fheis.  I would like to emphasise that I have not brought that motion forward here with any desire to create disturbance, to break the agreement, or any of the various reasons or suggestions which are made by some Ministers yesterday in connection with resolutions or questions brought forward.  I took it in fact when I put it on the paper that it would be seconded probably by a member of the House not in agreement with my views and passed unanimously.  That is the spirit in which I put it forward and I only did so because any agreement come to by an association such as the Convention of the Ard Fheis was would be signed by people concerned more in their capacity as private citizens or members of a political organisation and has not the force which a Decree of this House would have.</P>
      <P>I want at the outset to make it quite clear that I would resent very much any suggestion that in proposing this I am in any way desirous of postponing or obstructing an expression of the will of the people.  The only object of our coming to an agreement at the Ard Fheis was in order that the Irish people may not be fooled again, and if, as it was said, Ulster knew the Constitution with which she should have to be associated it is to my mind far more important that Ireland should not come to a decision until Ireland knows the association under which she will have to live.  It was in the interests of Ireland getting exact particulars of that Constitution without any possibility whatever of the change of a comma afterwards by anybody in or outside of Ireland&mdash;in the interests of the Irish people &mdash;that agreement was made in the Ard Fheis and that I bring this forward now. I, therefore, take it that it will be passed unanimously by the House and I think it would be a good thing if it were seconded by one of the other side.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I would really like if the President would explain what sinister motive he thinks I have.  I have said three times over I have none.  Honestly, I <Col N="192" /> cannot help suspecting a sinister motive in crossing out my motion for no reason I can see.  I am not used to any sort of political dodgery of this kind.  My motion is perfectly straight-forward and I cannot see why it should be objected to.  Would the President point out to me what implications he thinks that I have, for I do not know myself? If he is going to make it a contentious question then I will ask the Irish people to judge between us in the matter.  I mean no implications.</P>

      <P>As the seconder of the amendment, I would like to say that this agreement was come to in the Ard-Fheis after about two or three hours careful thought.  It was carefully worded, as it should be, as it was a very important agreement.  Miss MacSwiney proposes to completely change the wording.  She proposes to pass into law an agreement which says the same thing but which is worded in an entirely different way and to do all that in about ten minutes.  Now it took three hours to word the agreement that was come to at the Ard-Fheis so that it would exactly express what was meant by all parties, and what is the object of bringing up another agreement here now, professing to mean the same thing, but differently worded, if it is not for the mere purpose of obstruction?  Here we are on both sides, we want the same thing.  We were all satisfied at the Ard-Fheis when the agreement was before us. It was very carefully drafted; every detail was thought out.  It was done in a proper way.  Deputy Miss MacSwiney comes along to-day, meaning the same thing and she produces an agreement worded in an entirely different way &mdash;with phrases brought into it in inverted commas.  What is the object of that?  Do we want to do our business or do we not?  We did business at the Ard-Fheis.  What is the use of re-doing it in a different way here to-day?</P>

      <P>I am in thorough agreement with Deputy Hogan's remarks.  Let us see what happened at the Ard-Fheis.  President Griffith gave an undertaking.  Deputy de Valera professed himself absolutely satisfied with that undertaking.  Now Deputy Miss MacSwiney proposes that we pass a law in order that President Griffith and Mr. M. Collins keep the undertaking which they gave at the Ard-Fheis.  This kind of legislation&mdash;legislation to ensure an honourable undertaking given by two parties in this Assembly&mdash;does not appeal to me as a profitable way of spending the time of this Assembly. Let us face the realities of the situation. It is just a little like &ldquo;Nero fiddling while Rome is burning.&rdquo;  We are on the verge of a Post Office strike and there are 150,000 people out of employment in the country and we sit here fiddling.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, am I in order in saying my statement about ratifying the agreement applied to one thing?  I expected <Col N="193" /> a unanimous decision of the House on this motion.  The motion was not brought forward to ratify the agreement at all, and I never said so.  I said that owing to the agreement I expected a unanimous decision.  The motion is to safeguard the interests of the Irish people.

      <P>There is one reason I see.  Three months was the time specified in the agreement.  Now &mdash;a week later&mdash;there is another three months put in.  I have a suspicion of these alterations of dates.  The proposed Decree is not exactly in accordance with the agreement that was come to.  Why not put in the agreement and say let that be the Decree?  That is not what is being done.  If every agreement that one side comes to with another has to be made the subject of a Decree we will be kept very busy here, and I do not know the necessity for it.  If there is a suspicion that either side does not mean to keep the agreement let us have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. MACENTEE:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I was interrupted by the Minister for Home Affairs, on a point of order, and I sat down.  Now, Sir, with regard to the amendment which has been suggested I say it is a wholly improper amendment, because it takes cognisance of a good many other things than are within the power of this Assembly to take cognisance of.  By a Decree of the Dáil we are not going to try and bind political organisations in their legitimate functions.  We are going if we can to give the greatest possible opportunity to political organisations in this country. We are not going to say they are to be governed by such and such persons.  If we pass the amendment in its present form it would make it impossible if within three months the Ard-Fheis of Sinn Féin desired to ask for a conciliation of that agreement or to have it modified in any form.  The Sinn Féin organisation is to be governed by the Officer Board and the Officer Board only.  Now the motion is entirely proper; it relates only to the elections and it must take notice of that agreement because the agreement itself refers to the Constitution of this House, and it only asks that the agreement, so far as it relates to the Constitution of this House, be regularised by a Decree of this Assembly.  I think it is a perfectly proper one to submit.  There is no force in the point which has been made by the Minister for Local Government that we are attempting to take advantage of the wording.  I am sure the proposer of the motion will agree with me and will assent to it that by three months we understand three months dating from the date of the agreement.  Apart altogether from that, it is laid down in the agreement that when the Constitution of the Free State in its final form, as by law established, and approved by the majority of Dáil Éireann shall be ready to be submitted to the Irish people on that date an election can be called.  It may be earlier than three months or later, but at all events there is absolutely no idea in the mind of the proposer of taking advantage of a mere quibble of dates to withhold the elections for a day or so longer.  I submit therefore that we are quite in order in asking the House in exercise of the powers vested in it, for a Decree that no election be held for three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the parties to the agreement, I say that undoubtedly there is matter in this agreement which is extraneous to the work of the Dáil.  The Dáil is concerned with 2 (C) of the agreement: &ldquo;That no Parliamentary elections shall be held and that when held the Constitution of the Saorstát in its final form shall be presented at the same time as the Articles of Agreement.&rdquo; It is that particular item of agreement which ought to be confirmed here by simply stating that Article 2 (C) of the agreement signed on February 22nd at the Ard-Fheis stipulating &ldquo;that no Parliamentary elections shall be held and that when held the Constitution of the Saorstát in its final form shall be presented at the same time as the Articles of Agreement&rdquo; be and is hereby confirmed.  That is the article that we wish to have confirmed.  The question of interpretation comes in.  What is meant by the Constitution in its final form?  That question was asked at the Ard-Fheis and the answer I gave satisfied the President at the time.  The answer was that it is the form in which the present Cobinet of Dáil Éireann will present the Conairle <Col N="194" /> stitution to the Irish people and the form in which they are ready to stand by or to fall by.  In other words, that is the form in which if it is not accepted they are willing to ask the Irish nation to repudiate the whole Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="MR. DE VALERA MR. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the interpretation I give to-day.  That was the interpretation in my mind.  I understand that in another place an attempt to change it may be made.  Undoubtedly, the present Executive will have an opportunity of negotiating or conferring and they will have an opportunity of getting assurances if they want them.  The point for the Irish people to know is that if the Executive of Dáil Éireann&mdash;the majority party&mdash;finds that a comma is changed in that Constitution as they present it they will be in a position to repudiate the whole agreement. Therefore we will be together if by any chance such a thing were to happen.  That changes may be attempted we know.  As far as I am concerned my attitude all the time has been this: I am against the Treaty, but as long as the majority of this House is trying to get whatever its policy is to get, and if we are not able to secure the majority I hope we will secure, I am for backing them up.  I have said that and I will stand by it.  I am anxious and was anxious in coming to this agreement that the whole Irish people should again be united.  I believe there will be trickery and I believe that those who are working for the present agreement will find that&mdash;and very soon.  I wish not merely that this Constitution should be before the people but I wish also that the arbitration, which the Minister of Finance talks about so lightly, and the fact that Ireland will get rid of burdens so lightly, should also be decided.  I think, if there is to be fairness to the people of Belfast, there ought to be fairness to the people of the rest of Ireland. It is only fair that if they (the people of Belfast) are going to see what they are going to commit themselves to, the people of the rest of Ireland should see what they are going to commit themselves to.  I believe, when the Irish people realise to the full what they are committing themselves to by the terms of the Treaty, that they will do that which will do them honour and reject it completely.  As I said before &ldquo;To be pitied are those who do wrong and are poor after it.&rdquo;  We want to ensure, no matter what policy is set before the Irish people, that they will not be poor after it if the wrong course is taken.</P>

It is pointed out there are great pitfalls. &ldquo;We are simple but we are honest.&rdquo; That sort of simple honesty will not do. People want something more than simplicity. They want business.  The proposal is going to be that three months is not enough.  If five months be given it will not be enough.  In twelve months time they still will not be ready.  These are people who can never make up their minds about anything.  They are always watching out to see if they can get somebody else to make up their minds.  I am satisfied, from what I have seen here and from what I have heard and from the proposals still on the Agenda, that it is not the intention of the minority to have an election within three months. They wish to postpone the issue; they are afraid to meet the people; they were afraid from the beginning to put the issue before the people.  If they are not afraid, there is no necessity for all these precautions.</P>

      <NameTxt>MISS MACSWINEY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak about that for a moment.  I had not this agreement of the Ard Fheis before me when I wrote my motion.  Its object was to safeguard the people of Ireland so that they would have, as Ulster has, the right not to come to a decision until they knew what they were doing.  The reason I hesitated about this is because I believe&mdash;any Deputy on the other side of the House who does not believe it would want to look his history up&mdash;that Lloyd George is out to fool the people of Ireland again as he has done in the past.  My hesitation about this amendment is on the point that &ldquo;in its final form&rdquo; means &ldquo;in its final form.&rdquo; Now, I am going to say straight out where I see the danger.  The Constitution may be drawn up in its final form according as the members responsible want it.  They may wish to stand by it and if it is a very good Constitution&mdash;the better it is the better chance they have of getting it through at the elections&mdash; they will be returned by a large majority.  Have we got an assurance that after they have won and the Treaty and the Constitution have been accepted by the Irish people and the Republic has been dis-established that, &ldquo;in its final form&rdquo; will not mean that Lloyd George may come along and tamper with it? The present members of the opposition &mdash;the majority of the House in opposition to the Republic&mdash;now say they will not tolerate any change.  But they will have a new House to deal with then.  I want to safeguard the people against irrevocably committing themselves to the Treaty.  Now I believe that the present Ministers want to be quite honest in this matter and that they are going to do their best to see that Lloyd George does not fool them again.  To look at recent history, Mr. Michael Collins was told the Boundary Commission would deal with large territories.  Sir James Craig was told the reverse. Lloyd George says he never said there were large territories involved, while we were all given to understand that we were to get Tyrone and Fermanagh.  I am very glad to believe that no member of this House or in this country can equal Lloyd George in trickery or scoundrelism, but I tell you you have got to mind what &ldquo;in its final form&rdquo; means.  I take it that the Constitution and the Treaty are not to be submitted to the people until it is beyond the power of Lloyd George or anybody who succeeds him to alter a comma.  In that spirit, accepted by both sides of the House, I agree to that amendment as proposed.</P>
      <P>The assembly then agreed to have Miss MacSwiney's resolution withdrawn and the Acting Speaker put the amendment in the form in which it was read, and declared it carried.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That a decree be passed having for its object the admission of Irish women to the Parliamentary Franchise on the same terms as Irish men.&rdquo;  Ba mhaith liom an rún so do chuir os bhúr gcomhair.  The women did their own part in the war during the last five years and I think they should be given the franchise now and I hope there is no Teachta here against it.  The brave men who put their names to the proclamation of the Irish Republic in Easter Week wanted to put the men and women on the same footing on the voting register.  I feel that I have not been treated fairly on this motion.  This is the Bill which I now rise to propose.</P>
      <P>REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE BILL MEMORANDUM.&mdash;This Bill has for its object the admission of Irish women to the Parliamentary franchise on the same terms as Irish men.</P>
      <P>REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE A.D. 1922&mdash;A Bill to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1918.</P>
      <P>Be it enacted by Dáil Éireann by and with the authority of the Sovereign people and with the consent of the Honourable President, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>FRANCHISES.</P>
      <P>1.&mdash;For Section one, and sub-section (1) of section 4, of the Representation of the People Act 1918 (herein called the principal Act) the following Section shall be substituted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;(1)  A person whether male or female shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a Constituency (other than a University constituency) if such person has attained the age of 21 years and is not subject to any legal incapacity, and:&mdash;(a) has the requisite residence qualification or (b) has the requisite business premises qualification.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;A person in order to have the requisite residence qualification or business premises qualification for constituency</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  Must on the last day of the qualifying period be residing in premises in the constituency or occupying business premises in the constituency as the case may be; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  Must during the whole of the qualifying period have resided in premises, or occupied business premises as the case may be, in the constituency, or in another constituency within the same Parliamentary Borough or Parliamentary County, or within a Parliamentary Borough or Parliamentary County contiguous to that Borough or County or separated from that Borough or County by water not exceeding at the nearest point six miles in breadth measured in the case of tidal water from low-water mark.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The expression business premises in this section means land or other premises of the yearly value of not less than Ten Pounds occupied for the purpose of the business, profession or trade of the person to be registered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For Section two and sub-section (2) of section four of the principal Act the following section shall be substituted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;A person whether male or female shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a University constituency if such person has attained the age of twenty-one years and is not subject to any legal incapacity and has received a degree (other than an honorary degree) at any University forming or forming part of the Constituency.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of section 8 of the principal Act shall have effect as if the following words were substituted therefor:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person registered as a Parliamentary elector for any constituency shall while so registered (and in the case of a woman notwithstanding sex or marriage) be entitled to vote at an election of a member to serve in Parliament for that Constituency but a person shall not vote at a general election for more than one constituency for which such person is registered by virtue of a residence qualification or <Col N="198" /> for more than one Constituency for which such person is registered by virtue of other qualifications of whatever kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (11) (a) of Section forty-four of the principal Act shall have effect as if the following words were substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The qualifying period shall be a period of six months ending on the 15th day of March and including that day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>REGISTRATION.</P>
    <P>(1)  A register of electors (under this Act) shall be prepared in this and in every succeeding year and shall be made out for the qualifying period ending on the fifteenth day of March in each year.</P>
    <P>(2)  The register shall come into force on the commencement of the fifteenth day of June in each year and remain in force until the fifteenth day of June in the next following year.</P>
    <P>(3)  If for any reason the registration officer fails to compile a fresh yearly register for his area or any part of his area the register in force at the time when the fresh register should have come into force shall continue to operate as the register for the area or part of an area in respect of which default has been made.

    <P>The registration dates shall be the dates specified in the second column of Part One of the Schedule to this Act, and the documents specified in Part Two of that Schedule shall be kept published until the dates specified in the second column of that part of that Schedule.</P>

    <P>(3)  References to persons and officers shall be construed as references to persons and officers holding corresponding or the like positions under the authority or with the concurrence of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>(4)  References to Councils Courts Boards or Offices shall be construed as references to corresponding or the like councils, courts boards or offices acting or maintained under the authority or with the concurrence of Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <P>The discussion concerning other items on the Agenda has prejudiced the matter beforehand and has contributed to give the measure a Party tone and I feel it is useless to make any statement about my sincerity here. Still I want to assure you, a Chinn Comhairle, that I am acting in good faith in this matter, and in sincerity. One Teachta remarked in Tuesday's discussion that I could not have the measure very much at heart since I only sent in notice of motion at the last moment. The delay could be satisfactorily explained but I do not want to weary you. I want you to understand however that the conclusion that the Teachta came to is not correct. I have the cause very much at heart. I was in a Suffrage Society ten years ago. It is not a measure or cause I am espousing to-day for Party purposes. The Bill, copies of which in English have been supplied to the members, has for its object the admission of these women for the first time as Irishwomen to the Parliamentary franchise. In other words, it is a Bill to enfranchise Irishwomen between the ages of 21 and 30. I thought at first that I would explain the clauses of the Bill. Second thoughts showed how unnecessary that would be to a House containing so many legal lights. The points will, I hope, be dealt with and explained satisfactorily in the discussion. I will confine myself to a statement of the general principle. The civilization of a country is marked by the position of its women and, by that test, Ireland stands high. The Proclamation of the Irish Republic in 1916 was addressed to Irishwomen as well as it to Irishmen and guaranteed equal rights to all its citizens. It promised the people a national Government, elected by the suffrages of Irishmen and Irishwomen. I cannot believe that there is in this Parliament of the Irish Republic a single Deputy but holds with me that we ought now to remedy this injustice to a section of Irishwomen. During these last years of war and terror, these women in the twenties took their share in the dangers. They have purchased their right to the franchise and they have purchased their right to a say in this all-important question before the country. Without their votes or their voice, nobody can say that the will of the whole people of Ireland will have been ascertained.</P>
    <P>Mr. Griffith, President of the Republic, in reply to a women's deputation last week on this matter, while declaring his belief in equal suffrage for the sexes, put forward some objections.  He said it was a mistake to say that the Dáil had the power to alter the Franchise. Since when has there been a limit to the power of the Dáil in Ireland?  I understood that this was the sovereign authority in Ireland, deriving its power from the sovereign people.  And I have yet to be convinced that that is not the case.  The second objection he put forward was the difficulty of compiling the Register.  I have no expert knowledge on this point but it seems to me absurd to say that it would require eight months. Three months is the time allowed for the general register to be compiled. Surely if this decree was passed by An Dáil, the work could be speeded up and brought into the time.  The third objection is that if it were passed Great Britain would not recognise it and the fate of the Treaty would be affected, as President Griffith says.  And when he says a thing I believe he believes it.  But if President Griffith says that ninety-five per cent. of the adult women voters of Ireland are solid for the Treaty there is his best argument in the world to make <Col N="200" /> this Bill welcome across the water.  I had hoped before the Session opened, when I was thinking of this, to get the support of many members of the Dáil for this measure, irrespective of Party. Now I am not so sure.  However if any oppose it I only ask them one thing &mdash;not to accuse me of insincerity, of trailing a red herring, torpedoing the Treaty or anything like that.  It is time I think in the Dáil that we tried to escape from the tyranny of the phrase.  To cry &ldquo;red-herring&rdquo; at the measure does not in any way impair its nature or essential justice.  I now propose this Bill and I ask the Dáil to pass it into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMichaelMacDona" hpid="MR. JOSEPH MCDONAGH MR. JOSEPH MCDONAGH">
      <NameTxt>MR. JOSEPH MCDONAGH:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion that has been proposed by Deputy Mrs. O'Callaghan for enfranchising, on equal terms, men and women.  We have heard for the last three months in the Dáil a great deal about ascertaining the will of the Irish people.  We who are in favour of this Bill hold that it will enable the will of the Irish people, and all the Irish people, to be ascertained without fail. At the present time, on the old register, it will be impossible to ascertain fully what is the exact will of the Irish people with respect to this Treaty and with respect to the Constitution which those who are in favour of the Treaty propose to bring before the electors.  The Register of Electors, which purports to have come into force on the 15th February, 1922, for the qualifying period of six months ended the 31st August, 1921 (called the Fourth Irish Register) is illegal, because it does not include lists of the persons who became qualified in the period between 15th May, 1921, up to which date the Third Irish Register was made out, and the 31st August, 1921, up to which the Fourth Irish Register purports to be made out; and it does include all the electors who died and all those who ceased in other respects to be qualified during that period.  In many Urban Registration and in all Rural Registration Units no lists were made out as required by law of (B) &ldquo;newly qualified electors&rdquo; and (C) &ldquo;persons no longer qualified as electors.&rdquo;  It was the duty of the Clerk of the Peace for each Registration area to cause a house-to-house or other sufficient enquiry to be made and to prepare electors' lists (sec. 13 of the Representation of the People Act 1918 and par. 6 of the First Schedule to the Act) and each Clerk of the Peace was entitled to call upon Secretaries to County Councils, Clerks to District Councils, Clerks of Unions and Collectors of Poor Rate to assist him in his duty as Registration officer by preparing lists for their registration units (pars. 7 and 44 (4) of First Schedule).  After the end of the qualifying period, i.e., after 31st August 1921 the clerks of the Peace sent out requisitions to the Secretaries of Co. Councils, Clerks to District Councils, Clerks of Unions and Rate Collectors in their respective Registration Areas, requiring them to prepare returns or Lists (B) of newly qualified electors and (C) of persons no longer qualified as electors.  In some Urban Registration Units the officials concerned complied with the requisition and sent in the Lists (B) and (C) above referred to; but in many urban units and in all the Rural Registration Units default was made by the officials concerned and no lists were furnished of newly qualified electors or of persons who had died or had ceased to be qualified.  On the 15th October, the Clerks of the Peace purported to publish the Electors lists as required by Statute, and Order of 14th July, 1921. These electors' lists consisted of a Copy of the Old Register and Copies of Lists (B) and (C), and were to be the basis of the New Register.  In some Urban Units, as for example in the Registration Unit of Pembroke East, Polling District of Sandymount the List (B) and (C) were genuine lists containing the names of newly qualified persons and persons no longer qualified, but in all rural registration Units (for example Dundrum and Miltown) and in many Urban Units (such as Donnybrook) Lists (B) and (C) were merely sheets of paper containing no names but with a printed statement on each sheet in the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Owing to the fact that the requisite information has not been supplied to the Registration Officer, he has been obliged to leave this List blank.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMichaelMacDona" hpid="MR. MCDONAGH MR. MCDONAGH">
      <NameTxt>MR. MCDONAGH:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing this because President Griffith the other day in reply to a deputation said it would take eight months to prepare the Register.  I am trying to prove that the Register at present is bad and that it is not possible on it to obtain the will of the Irish people and, secondly, that a new Register could be prepared which will include the women between 21 and 30, in three months.  This shows that the new register is necessary if the will of the people is to be ascertained.  It can be made out within three months.  Three months is the period allowed by the Representation of People Act for compiling the Register.  If three months is the time given by Representation of the People Act for making out a new Register and if three months is the time that is agreed to between the two parties at the Ard-Fheis, I see no reason whatever why a new register cannot be made out in the interval that must elapse before the elections take place.  I cannot see if the time for making out the new Register is three months&mdash;I suppose that the people who gave that time knew the difficulties that were there&mdash;why the President states it would take eight months to make a new register.  For instance, take Clare.  You have there on the inside pages of the register simply 1920 and outside they simply put &ldquo;Clare Register 1922.&rdquo;  I submit that any election on that register will not give the exact record of what the people's will is. There were a good many men and women who were not in a position, through their activities, to get their names on that Register and I think it is wrong to exclude these men and women, some of whom were, I am sure, interned for the last year, simply because they were not available when the new Register had to be made out.  The President, at a Deputation, stated that there were 280,000 women between the ages of 21 and 30 who would be admitted to the franchise if the new Register were made out.  If that is so, that represents roughly one-seventh of the total electorate of Ireland.  When the President of the Republic states that he wants to ascertain the will of the Irish people, I am sure he wants to ascertain the whole will of the Irish people and not the will of six-sevenths of the Irish people.  Some few years ago, when the women were being admitted to the suffrage, the Irish Party opposed it very strongly.  I hope that those who are for the Treaty will not oppose every adult man and woman getting on the register and registering his or her vote as to whether the Free State shall be set up or not.  In Easter 1916, when the Irish Republic was proclaimed, equal rights for Irishmen and Irishwomen were guaranteed.  This will give equal rights to every Irishman and Irishwoman. This Dáil as a democratic body and as a body which has endorsed that proclamation of independence, if it is consistent must act up to that proclamation.  The excuse that there is no time cannot hold, because there can be no election for three months and three months will be ample time in which to make up that Register. Another point that may be put is that the Dáil is not competent in any matter concerning the franchise.  Well, in view of the fact that the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis was competent to have the elections postponed, I think that Dáil Éireann should be at least competent to have it insisted on that the new register shall be prepared so that the will of the Irish people, as required by the President, shall be ascertained.</P>

      <P>This is a trick on the Irish people to prevent the Irish people going to an election.  The sudden enthusiasm for the vote for women between 21 and 30 years of age suddenly arose after three years of the Dáil.  It is intended to torpedo the Treaty and I tell the people who bring it forward that they will not torpedo the Treaty on that issue.  I believe in and I have always advocated equality of voting power between the sexes.  I advocated it in my papers when there were no other journals in Dublin to do it. But I am not going to allow this trick to be used by people who are no more believers in woman's suffrage now than then.  We are told now that we can pass here a new Franchise Law.  Have we not been here for three years or more in the Dáil and no attempt made to pass or introduce this?  The fact that I am sitting here for two seats, Mr. Collins for two seats, Mr. de Valera, Messrs. Milroy and McNeill for two seats each means that we have disfranchised these constituencies, because we had no power to deal with the matter except by applying to the English Parliament for resignation, which we could not do.  When my colleague, Pierce McCan, died and we all tried to fill the vacancy we found we had no way of filling the vacancy.  We were &ldquo;cribbed, cabin'd and confin'd&rdquo; by the fact that we were elected under British Law, under a British Act of Parliament, under a Franchise which comes from a British Parliament and, therefore, we must act on that Franchise.  The only body that can pass such an Act as this is the legislative body which can be set up in Ireland under the Treaty.  I hope the enthusiasts for Woman Suffrage will be as enthusiastic when the Free State Parliament comes into being as they pretend to be now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this deputation of the various Societies was sent to me, knowing that they were sent&mdash;or most of them&mdash;not in enthusiasm for Woman Suffrage but in enthusiasm to destroy the Treaty, I told these ladies exactly what the position was. They were there representing certain bodies that wanted to queer the pitch of the Treaty.  I told them then what I tell you now&mdash;that you are not going to queer the pitch of the Treaty.  You are not going to get off on that false issue. You are not going to go out and pretend that we, on one side, are against Woman's Suffrage and that they, on the <Col N="203" /> other side, are for it.  As I said, there are two members here who are going to vote for this who, over and over again, told me that they would never vote for woman suffrage if they had the power. They are going to vote falsely here to-day in order to try and queer the pitch of the Treaty.  What do I find in this motion?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For section one and sub-section (1) of Section four of the Representation of the People Act 1918 (herein called the principal Act) the following Section shall be substituted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What Act is that?  An Act of the British Parliament which you are pretending not to recognise.  And you come along and you ask us in a few minutes to pass an Act repealing or amending an Act of Parliament which you profess not to recognise.  One of the biggest humbugs which has been attempted to be played on the Irish people is this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. SEAN T. O'KELLY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember a long time ago, a Chinn Comhairle, when a women's organization here in Ireland was working&mdash;I think most of them in association with the women's Association in England&mdash;about getting Bills to enfranchise women passed through the British House of Commons, a deputation of them came to the Dublin Corporation asking that body to pass a resolution in favour of having these Bills adopted.  I was one who took an active part in opposing the resolution on that occasion.  I stated then that I was opposed to passing a resolution of that kind in the Dublin Corporation, because it asked that we, the Corporation of Dublin, should ask the British Parliament to pass a resolution enfranchising women.  I objected then&mdash;and it is a long time ago&mdash;to asking any public body in Ireland to recognise in that fashion the British House of Commons. I stated, at the same time, that if ever we in Ireland had a Parliament that could enfranchise women that I would be one of the first to advocate the passing of such a measure.  And in fulfilment of that promise, which though made long ago has not been forgotten, I rise to support this motion.  I would not care which side of the House suggested such a motion.  I am glad that it is the progressive side of the House that has introduced such a motion here to-day.  I do maintain despite what President Griffith and Mr. McGrath have said that we have the power.  I will make them a present of this statement, if they like, that by virtue of the Treaty you have the power to pass such an Act.  I make you a present of that and use it where you will and when you will&mdash;by virtue of the Treaty which you have signed you have the power to pass such an Act and bring it into force.  You can do it in three months.  If you wish, you can make this law operative before the election takes place in three months time.  All the use you wish to make of that statement you can, and I defy you to do it.  You can have at least every woman in Ireland between 21 and 30 who would be entitled to come upon the register given a vote and I would urge you to take this step for your own reasons.  Not that I am anxious to see the Treaty pass.  In fact, I would use any and every means and, for myself&mdash;I make you a present of this statement also &mdash;I would not stop at any legitimate means, in bursting up your Treaty.  I would do anything legitimate to torpedo it.  I have done as much as I could in the past.</P>

      <P>I may not succeed but I will do my best, and I will not be a bit afraid to face here or outside those who take an opposite view.  I stood on the same platform with our friend Deputy McGrath, when the lime was thrown in our eyes here in Dublin for advocating Republicanism.  He was not afraid then. I was not afraid then, and I am not afraid now, to preach the doctrine and to stand for principles which I hold strongly.  I hold that the Treaty is a subversion of the Republican principles and&mdash;I make you a present again of this &mdash;I will do everything I can, even if you claim that my advocating of this measure will assist&mdash;to torpedo your Treaty.  I am not standing here to advocate this measure for that reason. I say that I believe the pledges I gave years ago, to stand for woman's rights whenever we had an opportunity to put them into operation, should as far as I am concerned be carried out.  And I also claim that I would do anything, as <Col N="205" /> I have said, to maintain the Republic as against those who are actively subverting it.  If you say&mdash;and I am sure you believe it&mdash;that ninety-five per cent. of the women of Ireland are in favour of your Treaty, well then what is your objection to giving them the vote? There will be a bigger flood of votes for your Treaty and we will be snowed under all the more if you are accurate in your estimate.  I do not believe you are and I can only judge by the votes that have been given by the organised womanhood of Ireland.  Take the vote of the Cumann na mBan convention recently &mdash;419 votes against your Treaty and 63 recorded for it.  That does not look very much like ninety-five per cent.  However, on your own statement that ninety-five per cent. of the women are in favour of your Treaty, I would urge you to act by the principles that Mr. Griffith himself has often proclaimed in his paper.  I make him again a present of saying that I, as one individual, was largely guided in my views in this matter, as in many other matters, by his political teachings.  From that point of view&mdash; now that they claim they have ninety-five per cent to vote for them&mdash;I think that Mr. Griffith should give the women the vote.  As to the people in this Chamber who may have changed their views, I believe there were many who changed their views during the discussion on the Treaty over and over again.  After all, what is the use of arguing and argument and discussion if people are not allowed to change their views?  Why are we here?  Why is any Committee ever called into existence if people are not allowed to change their views?  I also know, as a Whip, as Deputy MacGrath has said, when I was making up my lists, there was not a day that I came in here that I did not have to change some people who were on the lists as voting for the Treaty who turned over against.  There were certain people you could not rely on.  If you like, that is an argument as to the honesty of such people.  They listened to the arguments for and against.  They may not have done as clear thinking as others on the matter.  They waited to hear both sides freely express their views and decided accordingly.  I do not think it is any discredit to either side to change its views.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the other side not to make this a Party matter.  Personally, from a Party standpoint, I would say it would be a good thing for us if we could succeed in getting the votes of a few independent people on the other side. It would help us in going before the women electors.  On the other hand it would be more creditable to this body if this Act were passed by a non-Party vote.  President Griffith&mdash;yesterday I think it was&mdash;complained of nothing constructive being brought here by the opposition.</P>

This is evidence of it&mdash;a constructive measure that will be for the benefit of the country in the days to come.  It would certainly add very considerably to the authority of this body, or whatever representative body sits as the Government of Ireland, to say that we represent the whole people of Ireland &mdash;the adult manhood and womanhood of Ireland.  If you refuse to pass it, you hold an election with a very considerable part of the people of Ireland who have made this Treaty possible and who will, we hope, maintain the Republic, disfranchised. If you pass this measure you can claim, if you get your Treaty, that the whole manhood and womanhood of Ireland were with you.  If you refuse to pass it, you cannot claim that the election was won and a vote given in favour of your Treaty by the voice of the majority, because there will not be enfranchised the vast majority of the young and fearless men and women who put you in the position of putting your names to that Treaty and have put us in the unfortunate position of having to be in opposition to you to maintain the Republic to which you had sworn your allegiance.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this just measure for women because it is one of the things that I have worked for wherever I was since I was a young girl.  My first realisation of tyranny came from some chance words spoken in favour of woman's sufrage and it raised a question of the tyranny it was intended to prevent &mdash;women voicing their opinions publicly in the ordinary and simple manner of registering their votes at the polling booth.  That was my first bite, you may say, at the apple of freedom and soon I got on to the other freedom, freedom to the nation, freedom to the workers. This question of votes for women, with the bigger thing, freedom for women and opening of the professions to women, has been one of the things that I have worked for and given my influence and time to procuring all my life whenever I got an opportunity.  I have worked in Ireland, I have even worked in England, to help the women to obtain their freedom.  I would work for it anywhere, as one of the crying wrongs of the world, that women, because of their sex, should be debarred from any position or any right that their brains entitle them a right to hold.  In Ireland we have been in a rather difficult and complicated position.  It has been the habit of our tyrants over in England to use Woman's Suffrage as a Party cry. Each Party when it suited them ran the Suffrage Question for all it was worth. But when they were in a position to help the cause of Women Suffrage, the cry then was &ldquo;Oh!  there is something more important before the nation.&rdquo;  Now, I am sorry to accuse Mr. Griffith of taking up that English attitude here in Ireland. Mr. Griffith supported the Woman's Suffrage cause and he never varied when women suffragists were throwing axes at his political opponent, Mr. Redmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Griffith in those days spoke his opinions very freely as to woman's suffrage.  In those days women felt that they did not want to seek representation at Westminster.  I have a vote myself now to send men and women to the Dáil, and I wish to have that privilege extended to the young women of Ireland, whom I count in every way as my superiors.  With the glorious innocence and intuition of youth they fixed their eyes on high ideals.  They had the education that was denied to me in my youth and they have proved their valour during the years of the terror in a way that we, the older women, never got a chance to do.  There was a dastardly remark about women in men's clothing made just now by the Teachta who spoke.  I would challenge the men of honour, the other men who did not even require women's clothes to get out of the way when shots were being fired, and I would ask would any man of the I.R.A. turn down the girls who stood by the men in the days of the fight for freedom and did what the women did in the gap of danger?  It is for these girls that I speak to-day and it is the experience that these girls had in the last year that has brought to birth in them a great desire for this small privilege&mdash;the right of citizenship in Ireland.  Many years of organisation, of speechifying and talk did not enable our Franchise Society of noble women to put these ideals into the young women's hearts.  But it is the work they have done during the last couple of years, where they have been dragged out of their shells and made to take their place as citizens at the polling booths, helping at the elections and helping the men on the run, that has put this desire into the hearts of the young women.  This desire is voiced from every quarter in Ireland&mdash;this desire which I find re-echoing strongly in my heart.  No one can say that with me it is a Party measure, for I have always done it, always pushed it and always tried to get the women their due and their rights.  We have been in a difficult position in Ireland because we were on the run.  When our Dáil was held in secret, it was impossible to bring forward measures like this.  War measures were the only measures that were attended to and, naturally, the women did not push forward at the time when asking for their rights might have delayed people in <Col N="207" /> a house where they would be in danger of murder.  The women realised that. I realised it.  I even wished to put this forward before in the Dáil, but there were so many difficulties in the Dáil&mdash; too many other subjects to be discussed &mdash;that I did not bring it forward.  I have brought it forward before in different places.  One Deputy here seems to think that Cumann na mBan would torpedo the Treaty.  In the name of Cumann na mBan I thank him for his appreciation of their valour and strength and I can tell him that it will be up to them to do it whether they get the votes or not.  To-day, I would appeal here to the men of the I.R.A. more than to any of the other men to see that justice is done to these young women and young girls who took a man's part in the Terror.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill because those of us who took part in the establishment of the Republic in Easter Week, are bound by the promise which was given in the Proclamation. There are several other reasons, in addition to that, but the part taken by the Cumann na mBan and other women during Easter Week deserves some recognition from us.  The cheery word of encouragement given by the wives and daughters and sisters of the men who went out in Easter Week deserves recognition.  Moreover, most of you know that that enterprise was not received too popularly by the Irish public during Easter Week or immediately after.  But it was the women, when they organised their public Masses and their public meetings as far as they could, who kept the spirit alive, who kept the flame alive and the flag flying.  For that too they deserve recognition.  Moreover, from my knowledge of women in public affairs, I say that at least they have as true an insight in national matters as men.  I remember a dozen or more years ago, when we were agitating for compulsory Irish in the National University, we had considerably less trouble in converting the women, in showing them how necessary it was to have Irish compulsory in the National University, than in the case of the men.  We had to do that in order to get this thing done. That is another reason that I say the women deserve this little recognition. Moreover, our friend on the opposite side has made a statement that ninety-five per cent. of the women of Ireland are in favour of their Treaty.  I am not going to say for or against that.  But, if what they say is true, or if they think it is true, why should they resist such a motion as this?  I consider now that if the people of Ireland want this Treaty they are entitled to have it. But the whole people of Ireland who can understand what an effect this Treaty will have on the country should be given a voice in saying whether we will have the Treaty or not.  I at all events think so.</P>

      <P>We will see. Recently there was a change made in a certain measure very rapidly in another place.  I feel that it is our duty here to pass the Bill.  If, as is anticipated by some on the other side, some other institution comes into existence I, for one, would like to see this Dáil fulfil the pledges that were given to the women of Ireland by the men of Easter Week, even though you never were able to put it into operation and get it used in the next election.  The most heart-breaking thing for the last few days was to see this institution, which was Irish of the Irish, decried by members who should be proud to be members of it.  The natural weaknesses of this institution were shown up, when everyone should have been very careful of it as something that was sacred and dear to them.  We all know that it had weaknesses: that we had not the machinery to do everything we wanted.  But, anyway, the work for the last three or four years showed that good work could be done with it yet. Good work can be done by passing this Decree.  I say we are all agreed as regards the principle.  It is a question of ways and means.  As regards ways cannot see that we should make any and means, and the President's policy, I apology for claiming from that policy the best that that policy gives, because I for one do not take it that the theory of Government is that when the majority has got a policy and is carrying it out, that it must keep it all for itself and that the minority cannot get any advantage out of that policy.  We have a perfect right, even though we are a minority, to get the full benefit of any policy that the majority have and to do our best to secure it.  Now, undoubtedly the President has the power to get this amendment passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>I say the President's policy will enable him to do it.  I am only asking the President to do what his policy enables him to do.  And I say if I had his policy and were using it I would do it, but the machinery of this election&mdash;if it is to be an Irish election&mdash; ought to be dictated by the people of Ireland and by the representatives of the people of Ireland.  The President claims that his majority here gives him the right to speak in this place for the majority of the people of Ireland &mdash;for the Irish people.  He has the right to claim under his policy that the wishes of the Irish people in this election be respected, and that if it is the desire of the Irish people to have the women enfranchised they should be enfranchised.  It is suggested that there is some difficulty about the Register.  I will repeat again, by way of emphasis, the argument put forward by the seconder of the motion: &ldquo;You will have to get a new Register.&rdquo; You will have either to disestablish the Republic legally or you will not disestablish it at all.  The present register is illegal, even according to the rules we have had here.  We have legalised British machinery, and this is not legal even according to British machinery. We ourselves, here in the Cabinet of Dáil Éireann, on one occasion, determined that there would not be jurors lists compiled.  We had good reasons for that.  The present Minister and the then Minister of Local Government bungled the matter and prevented the voters' lists being compiled as well as the jurors' lists and the President immediately they came out was the most anxious of all.  We were discussing it in the Cabinet.  We were all anxious about having this Register made right.  It should be made right and it must be made right.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. DE VALERA:</NameTxt>
      <P>I say the President was interested in having that Register made right.  It is illegal because it has not been compiled properly.  The information that should be given to those who were in charge of compiling it was not given because of the orders of the Minister of Local Government, with the result that the usual method of compiling the Register &mdash;namely, the elimination of names that should not be on it and the addition of names that should be qualified&mdash;was not followed.  That is a serious matter.  If we take one example that we have before us, where Registration was properly done, Sandymount&mdash;one of the few instances where it was done&mdash; we find that only one name in six is right.  Rather I should say that the two Registers differ by one name in every six&mdash;the old Register comparing it with the new.  There is a difference of one name in six.  Therefore, it is fair to conclude that one name in six is wrong in the Registers throughout the country, where the old Register is kept.  But we have not even the old Register.  The rule says you get the old Register.  We have legalised for Irish purposes by a decree of Dáil Éireann certain machinery. Therefore, I said we have not even got the old Register, because in some places where a very small list came in they say that there was so little difference they used pages of the old Register to save printing.  And you have not the old nor the new now. Therefore you have no accurate Register. It is not even uniform in its inaccuracy because in some places it is done.</P>

      <P>The charge was made against me of bungling.  I have never made any claim to infallibility like other people.  I tell him, and I tell the Dáil, and every man that I make mistakes every day, and that I do my level best to correct them.  But that is a mistake I will be able to answer for when I appear before my constituents.  I am a longer time before my constituents than you are and I came back every time.  There are several questions involved in this business, and I will deal with them as best I can.  My first recollection of this business of Woman Franchise had to do with the Irish Women's Franchise League.  I got a letter from them this week.  Having a fairly good memory I recollected a similar subject being before the Dublin Corporation years ago.  I found, however, when I looked up the records, that on one occasion three ladies addressed the Corporation of Dublin. That was in 1911.  Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington, Mrs. Connery and Mrs. Weldon Palmer were there at the time the Conciliation Bill was before the British House of Commons.  The next record that I find in connection with it is a letter from the Hon. Secretary of the Irish Women's Franchise League asking the Corporation of Dublin to present a petition at the Bar of the House of Commons in favour of the Conciliation Bill.  At that time Seán T. O'Kelly earned the contempt of these women by pointing out that the Women's Franchise League was debasing itself by asking the Lord Mayor of Dublin to perform before the House of Commons in this business.  Now mark this: that Conciliation Bill was not a complete instrument.  It did not enfranchise the tenement dwellers of the City of Dublin.  The very same difficulty arises, as far as I can judge&mdash;and I am taking a correct perspective&mdash;in this particular Bill.  I do not make any charge against the Deputy who introduced the Bill, because I am certain that Deputy Mrs. O'Callaghan has not compiled the Bill that is before us.  But the very same mistake is running through this Bill.  You notice that though the Parliamentary Franchise is mentioned, there is not a syllable about the Local Government vote.</P>

      <P>I am supporting the amendment, as I believe it is a sensible proposition.  I have dealt, first of all, with the indiscretion of Deputy de Valera in mentioning about bungling and I have dealt with his duty.  I put up a proposition which would not be accepted.  Instead of that, the Cabinet at the time committed itself to the illegality Deputy de Valera now denounces. The Secretary of the Sinn Féin organization sent out instructions as to what the branches should do.  Now there is such a thing as compounding an illegality and if that is not compounding an illegality I don't know what is.  I am satisfied that this is not an honest attempt upon the part of the opposition. Directly the Provisional Government commenced to function, I brought up this matter and pointed out that if it were possible it would be wise to get a new Register.  I dispute with any person in this House or outside of it the statement that has been made that you can have a Register in three months. I have information in my hands from a person who is in the closest possible touch with such matters.

You can send for Mr. Walsh and ask him as to whether these were the instructions.  The figures are here:&mdash;&ldquo;From the 1st February to the 4th May to compile this Register.&rdquo;  In the ordinary way six weeks must be added to that for getting the list that is required.

      <P>The opposition is absolutely incapable of bringing forward a decree that will hold good-Rather a remarkable change took place within the past twelve months in the constituencies.  Take, for example, the district that I represent&mdash;Kilkenny and Carlow.  Now a person is not entitled to vote in respect of Kilkenny and Carlow at one election.  And you can understand the difficulty of dealing with the matter where a constituency has been altered.  Those are the points put before me by experts who have been dealing with these matters.  The Dáil, as such, did not bring out a register of electors.  It was done under what was formerly called the Local Government Board which functions from the Custom House.  It is now under the Provisional Government.  And the thing that is peculiar about this Dáil Session is that while nobody will recognise the Irish Provisional Government everyone is willing to lap up the milk.</P>

      <P>No.  The Dáil has no constitutional procedure which could guide the Chairman in the course of these Decrees.  I am only giving a personal opinion in this matter, and have to be guided by the present Cabinet and the members of the late Cabinet as well. In war time, Decrees were passed and immediately became Acts.  In normal times in any Assembly a Decree would be read at least a second time and probably a third time.  It would be introduced and referred probably to a Committee to discuss each clause and item and then it would go back to the House again for amendment.  I have no rules of Procedure.  The only rules before me are the rules governing debate and I do not wish to take upon myself the responsibility of saying that this is only the First Reading and that it should again be brought up.</P>

I know what was done.  I know what was done in Limerick.  We have no new Register for the last period.  We would be working on an out of date Register and it would be very unfair.  Now as to the enfranchisement of women, I would really like if the Dáil could see its way to pass it. In the last resource, even if the Register would not be in time for the next election, I am very sure that the women who fought for the Republic and helped the Republic would like this measure to be passed by this Parliament of the Republic.

      <P>The last day I agreed on our side, without any question, to a motion of £2,000 for the Tailteann Games.  These were part of the same enterprise that was started when we were all of one organization, when our only idea and hope was that the organizations working for Irish freedom and the ideals of liberty throughout the world would co-operate more closely than they had been with the aid of some sort of central organization.  This organization of Fine Gaedheal was founded and was intended to form a single connecting link between the several self-determination and other organizations in support of Ireland which had been formed by those of our race and all sympathisers with Ireland throughout the world.  The idea of starting it was that one Congress should be held by which this one central organization should be set up.  It was the keystone of an organization started three or four years ago when the movement to establish the Republic was begun.  The organization of our race throughout the world was something of value not only to the motherland but in this way: it meant that Irish native culture should have some channel by which it might be able to influence our own people and peoples of countries in which they live. On the other hand it was a channel by which Ireland might benefit from those of her race in other lands.  The central idea is that whilst they could only act as citizens of their own country, still as members of the Irish race they would be sympathetic with their mother land. There was never a time when Ireland so badly needed the co-operation of her children as now.  When the Minister of Foreign Affairs may find that he is not able to function and when there is a grip on him under the new Free State Constitution, you will be very glad to have some unofficial non-government machine by which Ireland's interests in foreign countries can be safeguarded.  The author of the Sinn Féin doctrine ought not to be opposed to an organization of that sort to assist Ireland in foreign countries.  The Congress which set up that organization met in Paris.  We were met there by the same arguments as here.  We were met by obstruction and bound because of the majority. Now the man who said he would have fair play for minorities and fair play for Unionists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many of the delegates to Paris had come before there was a question of the Treaty.  They came with the feelings of those they represented, who were strongly Republican at the time.  If any one wants to know what is the genuine feeling of those of our race abroad it is this&mdash;and it is a right feeling&mdash;that while they naturally want Ireland as free as she can be&mdash;full freedom is what they desire for Ireland &mdash;they are not going to dictate to the people of Ireland.  Therefore, they did not try to dictate to the people of <Col N="215" /> Ireland and I would be against them if they did.  They want to help the people of Ireland to obtain their full and complete freedom.  And certainly a terrible back sliding has taken place when this aim for the affiliation of the Irish in countries abroad and their organization from a political point of view to assist the people of Ireland in their efforts to obtain to the full their natural rights and secure for her her full rights is questioned.  When that becomes a contentious question, then I repeat, Party has gone mad.</P>

      <P>And it is Party gone mad to oppose a loan of £5,000 to cover the initial expenses of this organization until it is able to get back the money from the organisations which will affiliate with it.  This money in Dáil Éireann has been subscribed mainly by those organisations or members of those organisations.  To prevent them now being helped at the top and to cause a delay I think is a shame.  If it is opposed by the other side it is a shame. I did not expect it would be.  I say this as to Paris&mdash;members of this Assembly went out to Paris and they said it would be nothing but cultural, men who knew that culture alone would not keep this organisation together.  What keeps them together is the desire to help the people of Ireland to achieve her full rights.  I don't think that anybody on the other side has said that Ireland has achieved her complete independence. Therefore, the organisation is to help Ireland, from that point of view, on the rough road that she may have to travel. It was said that this was &ldquo;Party.&rdquo; When this, as a fundamental aim, was put forward, it was opposed.  Finally, it was accepted and when it became a question of officers, a number of officers were elected unanimously.  The President, Vice-President and Hon. Secretary were elected unanimously.  There was unanimity there.  It came, after some sort of argument about Party methods, to the appointment of an Executive Secretary at the first meeting of the Executive.  It happens that only one member of the executive has the same political views, in so far as they wish to express their views, as the present Cabinet.  I admit that but I do not think one ought to veto any man because he happens to represent a different political faith.  It came to the appointment of an Executive Secretary. That Secretary had served Ireland well. He had served Dáil Éireann well as Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.  He was a man who knew the details of the work, because he, more than anyone else, had done the organising work necessary in order to bring the Congress together.  Then an exception was made. His appointment was not made on Party lines but the suggestion was that a Co-Secretary should be put there to watch him, with equal authority&mdash;a suggestion that no business man would dream of for a moment.  I am trying to anticipate the Minister for Foreign Affairs who was going to speak on this subject.  The Co-Secretary was suggested. He was to watch the other man. I think we ought to have come to a time when we ought end this thing&mdash;when you have two opposite forces causing a nullity.  This man was chosen Hon. Secretary.  He had experience.  He resigned his position as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs because he found that his work there was going to be curtailed by the restrictions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He was either not to be there or to be put into the humiliating position that another man had to be put to watch him.  No business man would have two secretaries as Executive Secretaries.  You could get nowhere with it.  We decided that we would not stand for that&mdash;for that rule that you have an example of here, with a Catholic and Protestant, one watching the other. We find that the Hon Secretary who was here in Ireland was able to watch and see that his Executive Secretary would do his work, and the President and every member of the Committee would have an opportunity of going in and examining the whole correspondence if they so desired.  The man being efficient and the best for the position and on grounds of practical work, we refused to change that appointment.  Because of that, those bitter things were written over here.  I say that appointment was made in all good faith and honesty.  He was a servant of Dáil Éireann and perhaps some one wanted him to be penalised because he was a Republican and because he wanted to have Ireland <Col N="216" /> free and to secure for Ireland her rightful place amongst the nations of the earth.  It was because of that that we would not turn him down or put a spy to watch upon him.  That can be the only objection why £5,000 should not be loaned for it is on good security.  The people who subscribed the millions to Dáil Éireann will also subscribe this.</P>

The first conference naturally had to be to a large extent tentative just as your Tailteann Games this year will not be of the same character as those that will follow.  It was intended that there would be a re-union of the race, a central re-union of the race, every three years.  The next time it would be in Ireland, the time after that it might be away, while the following re-union would be back again in Ireland.

The objection is to the particular Association for which this money is asked.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the grave statements made by the Deputation from the Catholic Total Abstinence Federation regarding the abuses which had grown up in connection with the sale and manufacture of intoxicants in Ireland, a Commission representative of all sections in this Dáil be set up to enquire into the question of these abuses, and to suggest the best means for their removal and prevention.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion I have proposed is not a Party move, because no Party could gain above another by a measure devised to advance the cause of temperance.  The whole nation and both Parties would be gainers in this.  The origin of this matter lies in the representations that were laid before this Dáil by the Deputation from the Catholic Total Abstinence Federation and it arises very opportunely just now when the whole Irish people look forward, with a certain amount of misgiving and dread, to the election; not misgiving and dread because their own political ideas are to be the issues in the election, but because the election may cause a great deal of ill-feeling and bad blood between brother Irishmen.  Now, it has been agreed that if one thing more than another has made for that better feeling in the past, it has been the fact that in those days numbers of Irishmen were prone to the evil of intemperance.  In one or two cases, and particularly in the election of 1918, the very salutary measure was taken of closing the public-houses and those elections went through without any disorder in any portions of the country.  The elections now are due within a very short period.  As the Total Abstinence Federation told you, while English authority in this country has lost all its power and force and while the only Assembly that hitherto had been able to enforce its authority upon the Irish people has been gravely shaken <Col N="221" /> by the action of some of its members, we find that the evils consequent on intemperance are becoming daily more and more grave.  Consequently, any man who has any regard for his country must ask himself how he can check it.  It would be naturally the duty of the Government to take this thing upon themselves. I know that the President of the Dáil and the President of the Republic would look with very great sympathy upon any efforts which might be made to check intemperance. Answering my question this morning, he said as soon as the Cabinet had time they would go into the matter and deal with it.  Intemperance is an evil that develops and spreads by geometric progression; in a very short time the evil would spread over the country.  I need not refer to the old days when it was necessary for a distinguished Irishman to preach a crusade.  The Cabinet's hands are too full and I am suggesting, therefore, a way out by immediately setting up a Commission to deal with it. That Commission, if set up here, may be able at the next Session of the Dáil to suggest measures to the Cabinet by which the evils may be prevented or whereby the abuses may be removed. That it can devise a measure I am certain. During the late European war certain restrictions were imposed upon the sale of intoxicants, which restrictions, whatever their origin, were beneficial in their effect not only on the whole community but on every section of it.  They made the condition of those whose livelihood depends on this business certainly tolerable.  Their occupation, instead of being, as it had been in the past, an instrument for degrading the nation served to satisfy a reasonable want in some sections of the people. They were able to live decent lives.  I have practical experience of it because I have an intimate knowledge of the business.  I remember the time when the sale of intoxicants was practically unrestricted in this country and there was no section of the people to suffer more from that than the ordinary publicans. They had not the lives of ordinary business people.  They were in the shops from seven in the morning till eleven at night and whatever their position might be, the lives of their assistants were much worse.  In addition, a large number of the people squandered a good deal more of their money than they could afford and intemperance was widely prevalent. After the enactment of certain restrictions, the lives of the people connected with the drink business became tolerable. For a number of years here, from 1914 to 1922, it was very rare indeed to see a drunken Irishman or Irishwoman. We have been told that intemperance is on the increase, this being largely due to the psychological reaction of the people against the terror&mdash;if you like, the unnatural conditions under which they had to live.  Naturally, if you compel or try to compel the people to live within the boundary of an eight-hour day, as most of us were compelled to live, when you relax these restrictions human nature will indulge in a little excess.</P>

      <P>It is all right.  If every speech in this Dáil had been delivered to as good purpose as this, this nation would be in a happier condition to-day.  The Catholic Total Abstinence Federation has told you all those things. There are at our disposal means for remedying them.  This Dáil can do it, and it is only the authority of this Dáil that can cope with the growth of intemperance in this country.  In the period between 1919 and 1920, when the English authority was on top in this country and we had not the machinery to take these steps, we were faced with the spread of drunkenness and intemperance. The authority of this Dáil, backed by the arms of the volunteers, suppressed this and put a stop to intemperance and put it under proper control.  The Commission which I am now asking the House to appoint can do exactly what we did before in regard to the sale of poteen.  It can enforce the licensing restrictions and laws everywhere and it will give the people a much greater incentive to put down intemperance.</P>

      <P>I desire to second the motion.  It is very appropriate that it should come from Mr. MacEntee, who is connected with the trade.  I do not refer to that in any offensive way.  And it comes well from me too.  I am not a tectotaller, though <Col N="222" /> a strong temperance man.  Total Abstinence Associations do not ask you to bring in any new laws.  They ask you to enforce the existing laws.  There are abuses of the existing laws.  I brought it to the notice of the late Minister for Home Affairs and little was done.  The decent publican is not trading after hours but the mean publican is.  If you set up this Commission, you would be well able to stop that abuse.  That is the reason I second this motion.</P>

      <P>I suggest that Saint Patrick's Day is a holiday at the present time.  People who are out for a holiday do not want to walk around the streets.  If you let out people for a holiday, they ought not to be debarred from getting refreshments. It was tried in the Gaelic League and the result was a popular revulsion against the Gaelic League.  You will make it a most unpopular thing if you do that.</P>

      <P>I have some experience in this matter.  I was speaking to somebody in the licensed trade&mdash;I think it was a member of the Assistants' Organisation&mdash;last week, and asked him was it possible to bring into effect a public holiday this year and he informed me that they had come to some arrangement&mdash;that they would open their houses from 9 to 11 o'clock and in the evening from 6 to 8 or 9 o'clock.  He said that was their suggestion&mdash;that they were agreed to do that.  If this matter were left to the Cabinet to see and issue an order to that effect, would it meet with the approval of the House?</P>

      <P>I have no objection as long as the idea is carried out. Whenever a public holiday has been declared this provision has been added and it has not been found that the public suffer.  There is also the other side of the question&mdash;merely making the closing of public houses ostensible instead of actual.  One reason I brought this matter forward is that I had letters from various country towns stating that the publican has sometimes shut his front door and left his side door open.  That of course is not what we want.  I would be against any unreasonable interference with food and drink for the people.  But in this matter the example would be a good one and I do not think it would be ineffective.</P>

The statement has been made that the Gaelic League attempted a thing of this kind and, as a result, that it became very unpopular.  Now, I have been connected with the Gaelic League much more intimately than the gentleman who made that statement and I repudiate such a statement.  I am not aware&mdash;I never heard it stated before&mdash;that the Gaelic League became unpopular as a result of attempting things like this.  It gained adherents.  It did not succeed as well as it should but it was not the power in the country that this Dáil is even at the present date.  I believe that if the Dáil decide that this thing be done, it will be done and it will not become unpopular.</P>

Some of us have been working very hard during the past three or four weeks among the owners and assistants to get certain arrangements made about hours, not for St. Patrick's Day alone but for every day of the week, by which we will do good.  We could have done more if we had been able to meet them than by passing any pions resolutions.  That is the way we will get over the difficulty of arranging between the owners and assistants. Some of us have been doing our best to come to an agreement by which we will do away with a lot of the evils from which the liquor trade is suffering, and if we are allowed to carry on that we will do as well without resolutions as with them.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have an opportunity, when the Dáil meets again, to discuss the question of the policy of the Ministers and that we will have reports to consider, which we can in a regular way deal with.  At the present time there is one thing which I for one think most improper for the Cabinet; that is, the formation of a police force, which is bound not to have the confidence that is necessary for a police force, if it is to work effectively. I suggest in connection with this, as we will not have an opportunity of meeting again, that the Ministry take carefully into account&mdash;that is, the members who are acting definitely as Ministers on this &mdash;whether by appointing such a force they are not going to cause the very trouble which the police force is intended to obviate.  If you have given the safeguarding of public order to the Army, that is all right, because the Army still is the Army of the Republic. But if you set up a force giving allegiance to any other Executive then I can only tell you, from my knowledge of the feelings of those who want to see Dáil Éireann maintained and no rival force put up against the forces of Dáil Éireann until the Irish people's will has been properly ascertained, it is going to be a source of trouble and not of public order. So I would suggest to the Ministry to keep the machinery and not at this time anyhow form a new police force.  I understand that the police force of the Republic is being somehow disbanded, and I think it is a great mistake.  I think it is not keeping to the spirit of the agreement, when it was said that Dáil Éireann should continue to function as before the agreement.  That is before the Agreement was signed in London. Dáil Éireann functioning means that the Republic functions, that the Republic is still the form of Government which the people will give adherence to.  When I have said that this Dáil is supreme, I mean that it is the supreme governing authority in Ireland until the people decide otherwise.  That the people themselves are the ultimate source of authority, I would be the first to admit.  That the people are above their representatives, I admit.  I do not question it for a moment.  Therefore I suggest that in the interests of public order the President and Cabinet do not sanction the formation by some other authority at this moment of a police force.  If a police force were formed at the present moment, it should be formed under Dáil Éireann, which would give it authority all over Ireland. If there is no intention to form it under Dáil Éireann, it should not be formed at all.  The Army should be continued as a police force.  I hope, when the Dáil comes back, that we will have the opportunity of dealing with this matter in the regular place.  I would like to protest in the strongest manner I can, as representing nearly half of the Assembly, against the almost scandalous haste with which estimates were passed here without discussion.  There was no other opportunity except on the estimates to discuss this, and I think it most unfair and most ungenerous on the part of the majority to closure debate.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, agus a mhuintir na Dála, in accordance with the notice of motion which I have handed in to you I move the suspension of the Standing Orders of the day for the discussion of a special matter of National importance, as to the right of the individual member of this Assembly to information respecting all the interests of the member's own respective constituency.  You had a statement from the President this morning precluding individual members of this Assembly from information respecting the workings of members of the body known as the Provisional Government.  Now this raises the question of the supremacy of the Dáil.  It is <Col N="225" /> a vital matter and on that account I cannot apologise to you for keeping you at any great length.  There was a question continually raised in the House about the powers of the Dáil.  Now, we must admit that the powers of the Dáil were practically always limited.  But I maintain that there is a difference between the power of an Assembly and the right of an Assembly to claim that power.  Before the Truce, England had the power.  Our power was limited. But we never denied the rights of this Assembly to speak on behalf of the sovereign Irish Nation, whenever the opportunity provided itself by virtue of the right to secure that power.  Now the Treaty Party can claim everything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But as that body was set up with the cognisance of this Assembly &mdash;arising out of the action of the majority party in this House&mdash;I claim that this Assembly has the superior jurisdiction and that they are responsible to the people for all the actions of the body known as the Provisional Government and when they inform us that the policy of each is in complete harmony we realise that that should be so.  However, the anomalous position arises that whereas they recognise that this body has the superior jurisdiction, they deny the right of individual members of this Assembly respecting certain workings of that body.  Now I claim that it is not the right of any political majority to prevent the minority doing their best according to their own patriotic views, more especially without calling them obstructionists and wreckers, as President Griffith called me this morning.</P>

      <P>They realise that I cannot recognise the authority of the Provisional Government, because in the meantime, pending the expression of the people's will, I have by taking my side against the Treaty denied that that body has any authority.  There are certain powers relegated to them arising out of the majority action of this Dáil. To show that the matter of Haulbowline was taken up by me I will just read a letter I addressed to the Secretary of An Dáil on the 23rd November.  Here is the letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3 East Hill,</P>

      <P>Rúnaidhe, Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A chara,</P>
      <P>At the opening of the truce period I placed certain material, concerning the Haulbowline Royal Dockyard, in the hands of the then Chief Liaison Officer, Mr. E. Duggan, T.D. for the then Minister of Labour, Mr. J. MacDonagh, T.D. This material purposed to prove that an injustice&mdash;a reprisal on the people of the district for their loyalty to the Republic, probably &mdash;was being perpetrated by the shutting down of Haulbowline.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Duggan promised me to keep the matter in view, and to have the question disposed of when an opportunity was provided.</P>
      <P>Mr. Duggan is now one of our plenipotentiaries and has an opportunity of disposing of the question from the point of view of an English reprisal with an accompanying breach of the truce or from the point of view of how Haulbowline would fare in the possible event of a settlement.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Without wishing to learn anything concerning the negotiations at present proceeding between England's representatives and ours I would be thankful if you would ascertain from the President as to whether or not the matter of the closing of Haulbowline has received the attention it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There was at that time 1,600 individuals signing the Labour Exchange Unemployment Book. Now if I interest myself in my own constituents, I am told by the President that I want to wreck the advancement of Haulbowline.  He may have obtained these impressions from certain individuals who, to the best of my knowledge, never did much, if anything, on the side of the Republic.  But I challenge him to obtain an expression of opinion from any organised public body in my constituency that any move on my part was designed to wreck the advancement of Haulbowline. There was a body formed which was called the Cobh Development Committee for the purpose of looking after this matter, and I informed that Committee that if they thought, by virtue of my political opinions, that I would put in danger the advancement of Haulbowline I was quite willing to resign. They asked me to stay on.  Even in my remarks here in the public session of the Dáil, I stated that I always wanted Haulbowline for the nation; and I state now again that I will help any side which wishes to secure it for the nation.  But I must not be put in the position of being compelled to make an act of recognition of an authority that I do not recognise. If harmony exists between the Dáil and the Provisional Government the President can surely make arrangements for the supplying of information through this Assembly.  Now I would refer both the President and the Minister for Finance to the Minister of Trade (Mr. Blythe) and ask him had I always approached this matter with a complete absence of Party spirit.  I found after sending telegrams and letters to Mr. Blythe that he could not help me in this matter.  The information was not put at his disposal, because he was merely a Minister of Dáil Éireann.  I have reasons for requiring this information.  In my opinion, the Provisional Government are allowing sectional and place-hunting interests to fawn upon them in this respect and I advised them and they spurned my advice.  That was the reason why I called on the Minister for Economics.  That explains how that arose.</P>

      <P>I am not apologising for any of my actions.  I had occasion to call upon the Minister of Labour in connection with a dispute in my area.  I met one of the clerks in his Department and he asked me to come up to the City Hall and both the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Agriculture saw me speaking to that gentleman there.  After my business was done, he told me that there was a matter concerning Haulbowline and it would be well if I called up to the Minister of Economics and spoke to him on the matter.  It was not my fault if the Minister of Economics had not up special colours at that time to denote he was the Minister of Economics to the Provisional Government at that time and also if he did not ask me if I was speaking to him as Minister of the Provisional Government. If he imagines that I asked information from him respecting business that was not Dáil Éireann business, that is the difference between us.  I claim that it is my right to obtain such information from the Provisional Government. If this information be denied us, the only conclusion we can arrive at is that Ireland for the first time is going to be governed by an autocracy comprising these gentlemen.  In my opinion, they want to drive me into that position.  The new election cry will be this&mdash;&ldquo;The Provisional Government got us this and this; are the Dáil members of any use to us?  He could not even get us information on the point.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I also have a kind of feeling that the House wants to adjourn.  I am very conscious of a kind of feeling of wanting to adjourn myself.  But certain things raised by Mr. FitzGerald call for a definite reply. Some days ago he came to my office in the City Hall.  I did not ask him who sent him but he came, and I can assure him I am not lying awake at night wondering whether that was an act of recognition. As to the purpose of his visit, I gathered after a good deal of time that it was to tell me that on a Committee I called into existence to advise me as to the future of Haulbowline that the basis of representation was wrong, and also to inform me that all the hands at present employed in Haulbowline must be dismissed and that they must get no preferential treatment in the event of Haulbowline being taken over by the Provisional Government.  I was a little surprised at that.  I am a little surprised at it still, and certain Labour people are surprised at it.  However, I made a statement here at the beginning of the Session and I hope I made myself plain.  Dáil Éireann met and the majority approved the Treaty.  Certain steps were taken and a meeting of the members elected to the Southern Parliament was summoned.  I think everyone here received an invitation. Everyone did not attend.  However, that Assembly met and elected the Provisional Government and to that meeting, or to any of the members who attended it, I am prepared to give a very full and detailed account of my activities as a member of the Provisional Government. But, again, quite definitely I am not prepared to give an account of the things which I (as a member of the Provisional Government consequent of and by virtue of the Treaty) am doing to people whose aim and policy is to put the Treaty in the fire.

      <P>Well I believe you are.  I told him that I would be very glad indeed to get any advice from him as to the personnel of the Committee, as to the future of Haulbowline and everything like that; that I would take a careful note of it and give it every consideration, but I also told him what I have told the Dáil here, that I do not hold myself responsible to him as a member of the Provisional Government for the things I do as a member of that Government.  On the question of denying him information, I have only to say that I will deny him no information that he asks for in the proper spirit.</P>

      <P>I want the people in my constituency to know how we are hampered here at every turn. My friend and colleague wanted information as a member of the Dáil with regard to Haulbowline which is part of his constituency and mine.  He was denied it.  I want to know why.  The question was asked this morning of the Minister of Finance and he refused to answer that question except as a Minister of the Provisional Government.  What concerns us is this&mdash;that every part of our constituency belongs to the people of that constituency as part of the people of Ireland, and not to any Provisional Government.  We are responsible to the people of the constituency, and when we come up here we are told that we are not to get information.  We are to go to the Provisional Government, which that constituency does not recognise. I want to make it perfectly clear to the people of Ireland.</P>
