    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE MINISTER for FINANCE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is that credit is not allowed as a rule in <Col N="2045" /> respect of the payment of any Customs or Excise duties.  In the case of the Excise duties the only considerable exception to the rule is the Beer duty, payment of which may be permitted to be deferred for approximately three months.  In the case of the Customs duties there are no exceptions.  The answer to the second part of the question is that tobacco manufacturers, in common with other manufacturers from materials liable to Customs duties, are required to pay duty on their materials at the time of entry for home use, and unless legislation in the Finance Bill were put forward for making an exception to the rule, I have no authority at all to alter it.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Recorder of Dublin has made it a practice in granting decrees for Criminal and Malicious Injury in respect of damages occurring within a mile of the County Boundary, to levy same in equal proportions in the County and the City of Dublin?  And if, in view of the manifest injustice of levying on the County any portion of decrees for damage caused in the City, unless such damage is clearly traceable to residents of the County, he will bring in such amending legislation as may be necessary, sary, or do such other things, or take such other steps, as may be necessary, to ensure that the damage done within the jurisdiction of a local authority shall be borne only by that local authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>On present information I am not prepared to say that the existing law in this matter results in substantial injustice such as would call for amendment.  The matter appears essentially to be one which should be left as at present to the exercise of a reasonable discretion on the part of the Judge.  The proposal made by the Deputy would not appear to provide an improvement, as it would have the effect of making the ratepayers of an area bear the entire charge for damage within the area even if committed by a person from outside the area.  For instance, if damage were committed to property of Deputy Figgis, according to his proposal that charge would remain <Col N="2046" /> on the county, whereas I expect the Deputy would prefer it to be on the city.</P>

      <P>I have no information to the effect that Lord Greville is about to sell the rights of collecting the tolls of fairs and markets of the town of Mullingar.  Under Section 103 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, the Town Commissioners are enabled to purchase private rights in markets and tolls for the purpose of establishing a market, but they can only do so with the consent of the person whose rights they propose to purchase.  The powers of purchase conferred by this section do not authorise the purchase of a fair, nor can the Town Commissioners be invested at present with urban powers for that particular purpose under Section 104 of the Act of 1878.  This matter will, however, receive consideration in forthcoming legislation on Local Government.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture if it is the intention of the Ministry to continue or to extend the activities of the Forestry Stations; whether the tree planting season has now begun, and, if so, whether the number of men employed at forestry work cannot be greatly increased with advantage; whether it is a fact that at the Forestry Station at Lugduff, Glendalough, the staff was reduced by six men on Saturday, 21st October, just at the beginning of the planting season, and if so, is it to be taken as a sign of the intention of the Ministry to abandon the necessary and valuable national work of re-afforestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Ministry to continue and to extend the activities of the Forestry Stations so far as the funds available and the area of suitable land which can be acquired for the purpose will permit.  The tree planting season has now begun.  The number of men employed on forestry work is usually increased during the planting season, provided that the number employed during the summer months in drainage and preparation does not exceed the permanent staff.  The staff employed at Lugduff, Glendalough, was in excess of permanent staff throughout the summer by 8 men owing to a considerable area of fencing having to be erected in preparation for planting.  It is estimated that the whole of the planting possible at this centre will not require more than 6 or 7 men, of whom 5 are regarded as permanent labourers.  As a result of this, the staff was reduced on Saturday, the 21st October, by 6 men. I may say that forestry operations at Glendalough and elsewhere throughout Wicklow are being carried on at the maximum rate.  This is very largely regulated by the number of plants in stock and general considerations regarding the economical working of each centre.  At the present rate of planting the area of land now held for planting purposes will be entirely used up in about six years.  Planting operations must, therefore, be largely governed by land acquisition in any particular district or county.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether any proposals have been made by the Government to owners of land suitable for afforestation with a view to the planting during the present planting season, and whether any policy has been considered having in view the utilisation of unemployed agricultural labourers in afforestation schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN Mr. P. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific proposal has been made by the Government to owners of lands for afforestation, with a view to planting during the present season. During the past 22 years the Department have urged private owners, in every way that was possible, to plant bare land and replant worn-out woods, but the Department had no power to <Col N="2050" /> compel owners to act on this advice, nor had they funds at their disposal to enable grants or subsidies to be given for the work.  Technical advice has been given as required from time to time on various matters connected with forestry operations, but initiative in actual afforestation work by private owners had necessarily to be left to the owners themselves. No opportunity has been afforded for changing this policy during the present planting season.  With regard to the utilisation of unemployed agricultural labourers, this policy forms part of the ordinary afforestation programme of the Department on the lands which have been acquired for State forestry; local circumstances, however, necessitate modification, from time to time, at various centres.  A certain number of men have to be permanently employed at each forestry centre, and when so engaged they cease to be unemployed agricultural labourers, assuming them to have been such in the first instance. When taking on additional labourers in a temporary capacity, whether in summer or winter, the Department cannot differentiate between agricultural labourers and other unemployed men in the locality.  The Department's programme for the current season contemplates the planting, or replanting, of, approximately, 1,000 acres of bare ground at the various centres throughout the country. In this work permanent labourers will be supplemented by temporary men who, it is assumed are unemployed when taken on, and who will number from 50 to 100, employed for various periods as the work requires.  The money voted, and the stock of plants available, will not admit of any substantial expansion of this programme.</P>

The object of the Order is to ensure that, as far as is practicable, animals be humanely treated on vessels at sea.

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties facing the farmers who have quantities of malting barley for sale. Although the prospect for such farmers gives cause for anxiety, it will not help the solution of their problem to overstate the position, or to create such a feeling as will lead to something akin to panic.  It should be kept in mind that it is not yet known what quantity of barley will be required this season by malsters, brewers and distillers.  At present all available information which would be of assistance is being obtained, and until the full extent of the demand for malting barley and the intentions of buyers are known, it would not be advisable for farmers to use sound barley of good malting quality for stock feeding purposes.  I cannot, therefore, give any promise that the Government will entertain a scheme of loans such as is suggested in the question.  The case of barley growers is a specific example of the general depression in the farming industry which the Commission on Agriculture is now investigating.</P>

      <P>I have made enquiries into the case of the men who performed police duties in Limerick.  In so far as these men were taken over by the Government the position was that they were attached to the National Reserve for which they were attested, their duties being confined to Limerick City and being more or less of a police nature. When they signed on for six months they were accepted not specifically as members of a police force but as part of the National Reserve.  They were not dismissed, but on the arrival of the Civic Guard in Limerick it was found unnecessary and undesirable to have two sets of men performing police duties and the services of the members of the National Reserve as policemen were discontinued. No complaints were made as to how the men performed their duties, and as a matter of fact their services were appreciated, and they acted as peace officers with a considerable <Col N="2055" /> amount of success.  If these men were suitable for the Civic Guard and fulfilled the appropriate conditions they would be taken into the Civic Guard.  I presume that those of them who are not suitable for the Civic Guard may continue to serve in the National Reserve for which they have attested.</P>

It is not reasonable to ask Members to come here and discuss important matters of which they have not got adequate notice.  For instance the Estimates have only been <Col N="2062" /> received this morning and we are supposed to deal with them this afternoon. It is not reasonable to suppose that there could be adequate discussion without proper notification.</P>

      <P>The Orders of the Day for to-day and copies of the Estimates were posted from the Clerk's office on Monday afternoon, and it was considered that they would be in the hands of Deputies yesterday morning. It was the earliest possible moment we could manage to send them out.  If there is any difficulty about regular delivery by post I shall look into the question of having them delivered by hand.</P>

      <P>Another matter that I would like to raise is the question of a Committee of Procedure and Privileges which was suggested in the early part of the Session. It was generally understood, I think, that a Committee to deal with the Procedure of the Dáil and the Privileges of Members was to be set up, but so far as I am aware no such Committee has been set up yet.  The need for it is greater to-day than ever because of the coming into being of another House of the Parliament of Saorstát Eireann.  And there is necessity, in my opinion, for some formal procedure to be devised for the consideration of Bills, the preparation of Bills, the consideration of estimates and the transfer from one House to another of proposed legislation and the general conduct of the business of the Dáil which is not provided for satisfactorily in the Standing Orders that we have now adopted, I think it is necessary to urge that such a Committee as was originally proposed should be set up immediately to devise ways and means for conducting the business of the Dáil/Oireachtas satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>When the Standing Orders were considered on the 26th September it was decided to insert an Order which provides that a Committee of Procedure, on which the Government should be represented by not less than half its Members, should be set up.  No motion has ever been made, and no motion has been received for the setting up of that Committee.</P>

      <P>This resolution covers some of the points which otherwise would arise later in connection with the Electoral Bill.  The Bill itself will be a very lengthy measure, because it will codify a good deal of existing law without any great alteration.  It probably, with schedules in the present stages, would run to two or three hundred typewritten pages.  A good deal will not be controversial. This resolution deals with some of the points about which there might be a difficulty.  We can get the mind of the Dáil on that now in discussion of these resolutions and incorporate them in the Bill in such a way that radical amendments of the Bill itself would be less likely than would otherwise be the case, and the confusion also that arises from the adoption of a large number of radical amendments to a measure which is already drafted.  We found those difficulties when there was a radical amendment in the Constitution.  As quite a number of matters that are not altogether closely related are dealt with in each of these Resolutions, and as it might be difficult for the Dáil to vote on the Resolution as a whole without having considered its separate parts, I would be satisfied if the Dáil were willing that we should debate the principle of the resolution and then that we should take the Clauses one by one in Committee, afterwards passing the Resolution. If that were desired and if that met the will of the Dáil I would be prepared to move practically formally that this resolution be read the first time and that the Dáil thereupon go into Committee to consider the Clauses one by one and we could deal with each of them on their merits.</P>

      <P>The second Clause of the resolution proposes one change at least in the law as it stands at the present time.  There is at present a qualifying period.  That is, six months prior to the date of the making up of the register, a person must have resided in a constituency in which he is to be registered, or in the contiguous constituency. We propose to do away altogether with the qualifying date.  This matter was mentioned by Deputy William O'Brien when the resolution was last before the Dáil.  I think he suggested then that the qualifying period should be shortened.  On going into the matter we did not see any reason for retaining the qualifying period at all, and we believed there is no difficulty in saying that a person can be registered in the constituency in which he was registered from a specified date on which the register must be made up.  The only other point worth mentioning is (b)&mdash;that is, that a person may be registered in respect of a constituency in which he occupies premises for the purpose of his or her trade, profession or business.  At present the person may have two votes, one in respect of his residence and one in respect of business premises.  In the future one person will have no more than one vote.  He will now have to make his choice.  It is already agreed that a graduate of a university can make his choice between the university constituency and the constituency in which he resides. We will apply the same principle to <Col N="2070" /> business premises.  It is felt that it will, in a country like this, be advantageous to facilitate the business community in returning a certain number of representatives who will be definitely business representatives. It will make no great difference as to membership of the Dáil, but if we had not this provision we would probably find a large number of people who occupied business premises, but who resided in different parts of the country, would be like this.  Take the case of Dublin.  Those residing in the County of Dublin would be scattered. Some of them might reside in Dublin City; they would be split up into a variety of constituencies that might represent a certain class or a certain social creed, if you like to put it in that way. Well, they might like to return Members who would be of the same type of mind, and who would be reckoned as having the same outlook on social problems and even on economic problems generally. They would not be able to return any Member who would represent the business, commercial and manufacturing point of view.  And we think it is desirable in this country that this facility should be given them&mdash;that they can choose where they will vote&mdash;whether they will vote where they reside or vote where their business premises are situate.  If they choose to do so they will be able to vote in one constituency, and to return or at least vote for, perhaps, more members than one, representing a definite commercial outlook which might not otherwise be represented, because there is more in it than merely representing people of a certain economic standing in the country.  We think that at any rate they should have representation, and we think it is much more desirable that they should have an opportunity, as they are, comparatively speaking, a small class in this country, and will, in very few constituencies, be able to return anybody definitely representing a business outlook, and they should be given this choice.  I think those are the only special points in this clause of the Resolution.</P>

      <P>The proposal of the Minister in regard to the abolition of the qualifying period is very welcome; and I think it is a very considerable advance in the direction of recognising that it is the individual, as <Col N="2071" /> man or woman, it is the humanity of the voter that is being recognised, rather than the social position or property qualification; and that is a considerable merit.  But the attempt to hang on to the idea of a property qualification in Sub-section (b) is a defect and an inconsistency which I do not think the Minister has succeeded in dispelling. There is no reason whatever why we should depart from the plan, from the proposal to make the place of residence the place of registration. What is proposed here in sub-section (b) is to allow a particular class of person who happens to possess a business house &mdash;not a business qualification&mdash;to allow the person who possesses a business house in a particular constituency to turn his back upon his residence and to say &ldquo;I prefer to be registered for my business premises.&rdquo;  We might just as well claim that a man who works in a shipyard would be entitled to claim registration for the particular constituency in which the place of his occupation was situate.  There is no more reason why the occupiers of business premises should be given a choice of the place of registration than that any other body of citizens should be given a choice as between their place of residence and the place in which they do their work. The Minister has instanced the desirability of allowing a particular class of voter to secure representation, that their residences are diffused and they may be living over a wide area, but that they are concentrated for business purposes and therefore they should have an opportunity of getting representation under Proportional Representation, because they are concentrated in that particular business locality.  But I suspect that that will only apply to one constituency in the country, or possibly to two.  And it seems to me that the claim to make this big change in the policy and plan of the Electoral scheme because of one constituency is a very serious defect.  And the particular constituency in question is almost certain, if you are going to deal with practice rather than with principle, is almost certain to be able to secure representation by virtue of residence, that is to say, to secure representation of the particular elements in the community that the Minister speaks of. By virtue of residence in the constituency they can get that representation.  And <Col N="2072" /> there is no reason why they should deflect from the ideal of giving the individual, by virtue of his humanity, a right to vote in favour of hanging on to the old property qualifications which we are generally discarding because that is what this special sub-section proposes to do. It desires to retain something of the property qualification and special privileges to a class of people because they have business premises, that is, because they have money and a particular walk in life.  We have not been bold enough to give representation to people because of their occupation, or because of their social status&mdash;certainly not because of their occupational status&mdash;but we are attempting, by virtue of this clause, to say for this particular section of the community, we are prepared to mar the plan just to conciliate one particular constituency in the country.  I think it is a defect, and I would move the deletion of sub-section (b) of Clause 2.</P>

      <P>With regard to that, on account of the Proportional System this provision, if carried into legislative effect, cannot alter the whole Constitution of the Dáil very much.  It cannot give any class of people more representation than their numbers in the country entitle them to.  It is no defect, nor does it create any defect, in the system of Proportional Representation.  Neither does it preserve the idea of property qualification.  It is not proposed to limit&mdash;to put a minimum limit&mdash;on the value of the premises to be occupied. All of us realise that in an Assembly such as this it is not entirely a matter of returning members.  A single member who represents a distinct point of view, a distinct interest, can often be of more real value to the Dáil and in the carrying out of the real business of the Dáil than perhaps a considerable number of members who only represent a point of view which is in strong force in the Dáil.  One of the great advantages of the representation of minority is not entirely that it has the power to vote, but that it has an opportunity of expressing its point of view in the presence of those who make the decision, and is able to challenge them as to the course they are pursuing, and is able to point out the consequences of that course and is able to suggest alternatives.  Now, the business community in this country <Col N="2073" /> is a class, unfortunately, that is not likely to be sufficiently represented.  It is not likely to be represented according to its numbers by persons who have a definite business point of view, who are not in the composite representative, say, of the farmers and the landed gentry, but people who represent a business point of view.  It is important from our point of view that that business element in the country should be definitely represented and should be able to express itself in this Dáil.  It is introducing no new principle, because we propose adopting a system which already exists.  We adopted it by dropping out the dual vote, for the dual vote which we have is indefensible.  We propose in this case to substitute a choice.  Now, if a person holds two premises, there is not much difference; very little difference can be pointed out between the house that he holds for the purpose of residence and the house that he holds for the purpose of business. I think it will not be any blemish in the scheme&mdash;that it will ensure a point of view which might not otherwise be adequately represented at all; that is, not represented in the sense of having definite spokesmen, and it is a thing, I think, which will conduce to the doing of the business of this Dáil in a way that will be more satisfactory and more efficient than if we did not take care to have that representation.</P>

      <P>One of the matters that appeals to me in this clause which Deputy Johnson proposes to strike out is that it enfranchises people who might otherwise be dis-enfranchised. There are quite a number of people in this country who keep up homes for their wives and families, and, at the same time are compelled to reside, for the purpose of their business or profession, in the houses of employers.  Now, these people ordinarily reside, I take it, where their home is&mdash;where their wives and families are.  That is a place to which they might not be able to get at the time of an election, having regard to their duty to their employers, and this clause, if left as it stands, would enable these people&mdash;everyone knows the class to whom I refer, people like chauffeurs, gardeners, coachmen and several other people who will now be women-voters&mdash; will enable them to choose the constituency <Col N="2074" /> in which they will give their vote, and will enable them to vote at the place where they happen to be, by reason of their employment, when they might not be able to get to the place where their home is to register their vote there. Therefore, I think, this amendment, and I quite follow the grounds put forward by the Minister for Local Government, is one that will enable some people to get votes, who might otherwise be deprived of them, and for that reason I would support it, from the point of view I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise the strength of the argument for allowing in an Electoral Bill persons who reside in fact and sleep at the place of their business, having votes for that particular locality, if that is where they are interested. That is a very different proposition. The proposition that is intended here, judging by the speech of the Minister in moving it, was, that a person might reside in Rathmines, because that is the constituency in question I am sure, and have an office in Dublin.  He may rent an office, or a pretence of an office, and may pay 5s. weekly or 5s. yearly for a seat in an office, for the purpose of qualifying as a voter in that particular constituency, and he would then have the choice of whether he should vote where he lives and where his real interest is&mdash;that is to say, his interest as a human being, rather than his interest as a business man or a voter.  The probability is that it would be used rather for political manuvring than for anything else, giving an option to residents of the county who have business, say, in the central division of Dublin, to concentrate their votes in that particular division. I can imagine every workman, every chauffeur, whom the Deputy has referred to, being supplied with seats in offices for the purposes of qualifying to vote.  If you want to avoid the possibility of that kind of double-dealing for political purposes, you have got to make a clear, definite, single franchise, and a single qualification, as when you make a double one, giving the choice only to one particular section of the community, you are opening a way for possible malpractices in voting.  We know how it has been done in the past, and we have no reason to think that with the coming <Col N="2075" /> of Saorstát Eireann, that we are all going to generate wings and become angelic.  That is not going to happen at all.  We are going to have manoeuvring for a majority in the future, as in the past, if we allow it by the Electoral Law.  I want to avoid that if possible, and the one way to avoid it is to have a single qualification, and no opportunity for a choice for one particular section of the community.</P>

Now, it seems to me, if it is only likely to apply to only one or two constituencies, the appalling danger that has been pointed out is not at all likely to arise. He also suggests that chauffeurs, gardeners, whom I presume would be in some sort of Trade Union, are going to vote for these political manuvrers. Evidently Deputy Johnson has lost faith in the power of the organisation that he represents in this Dáil.</P>

      <P>It seems to me, it does not necessarily follow that a man who has a vote for his business premises is going to vote for that type of candidate at all that the present Minister for Local Government is anxious about.  Deputy Johnson assumes that the voter would vote only in his place of business.  I wonder was he likely to vote for some plutocrat, who also had a vote in the same area?  I think the Deputy is needlessly alarmed as to what is going to happen, that the whole machinery of legislative operation is going to be corrupted by the return of even a couple of representatives of business men from a couple of constituencies. It seems to me if you delete this on the grounds of the argument put forward <Col N="2076" /> by Deputy Johnson you would have to delete also the following&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the one point in answer to that is that the object of this is not to retain any semblance of privilege and to introduce an element of choice which in this clause, in this sub-section, will tend to convenience the person who wishes to exercise the franchise.  For that reason I think the objection is based upon a needlessly false alarm.  I do not think it should be persisted in.</P>

We have given a vote, if you like, on the basis of humanity; we have given everybody a vote; but we might as well face the fact that people will vote according to their interests.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; again, but can you divide business from humanity?  Will not a man's business have a certain amount of influence on his humanity, or whatever you like to call it?

The labourer is entitled to representation, and the commercial class and the farmer. Every class of community is entitled to representation, and the best sort of Franchise Bill is the Bill that will give each the representation that their numbers entitle them to.  I say this particular provision will give business interests the representation that their numbers entitle them to and that if you take these provisions away, if you remove them, then they will not have the representation in the Dail that their numbers entitle them to.  In the interests of democratic government I am in favour of this clause.</P>

Unless he makes an exception with regard to University elections, there will be great practical difficulties in working this out. I think a University Register is in a very different position from the other Registers. When a person gets his degree is the time that he goes on to the University Register. I think there will be great practical difficulty in working out the University Register unless exception is made allowing him to be registered for two places if necessary, but of course requiring him when the time comes to decide as to which constituency he will exercise his vote in.</P>

      <P>Clause 4 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;No Member of any Police Force on full pay may be registered as a Parliamentary Elector or vote at any Election to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That clause is a proposal to continue the present state of affairs, or the state of affairs that has existed heretofore.  It may be necessary for the prevention of corrupt practices that in future the police shall have additional duties in respect of the carrying cut of Elections; but whether any additional duties are cast upon the police or not, they have had heretofore very important duties in connection with this matter.  It is most important that the police should, so far as it can be assured, be impartial and do nothing to <Col N="2079" /> assist or favour one candidate more than another.  Now it is impossible to prevent members of a police force from having their own political views, but it is possible by preventing their being on the register, to insure that appeals shall not be addressed to them; that they shall not be subjected to canvassing and that they shall not be obliged or invited to declare their preference, one way or another.  It will often happen that a policeman, in the execution of his duty, would have to do something that may lose, perhaps, a vote to one party or give a vote to another party.  If he has declared himself a canvasser on the side of that party or against that party his action will be challenged.  The very fact that he may have been canvassed, that he is interested in the election to the extent of giving his own vote, may predispose him to some partiality in the execution of his duty.  We are convinced that it is most desirable that men holding these positions should be excluded from the franchise.  We believe that the restriction under which they laboured in the past was a good and wholesome thing and we are of opinion that it should be continued in the future.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced by the reasons that the Minister has given that this provision is a wise one, and I think that members of the police force are equally entitled to the franchise with all others.  The reasons given by the Minister would apply with equal force to Presiding Officers and the officials charged with the conduct of the election.  It is highly desirable that they should be impartial, and that they should be above suspicion, but they are not deprived of their votes in order to insure that.  It is quite true that policemen would, of course, have their own views upon public questions and upon politics, but depriving them of their votes will not deprive them of their views. It may be an incitement or an inducement to them to try other methods of having their opinions given effect to.  It is quite true, of course, that police will be required to keep order at elections; but should they require assistance no doubt the Army will be called in to assist them in carrying out their duties, and it is proposed to give votes to members of the Army.  I think this one section of the community ought not to be made an exception of; they should have <Col N="2080" /> votes like everyone else.  Deputies who know me will not accuse me of excessive partiality to policemen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for the time being responsible for the efficiency and discipline of the police forces, I advocated that particular clause in the Resolution.  I did so, facing the conditions we have in the country at the moment, and endeavouring to visualise the conditions we may have in the country for five, or seven, or ten years.  I did so remembering that one of the forces concerned is an infant force, a young force barely getting under way, and recognising that the strain of political feeling in this country for some years to come might be just a little too much for that force, if allowed to permeate and grip its members.  I did so, too, remembering that the police force has to serve impersonally any Government returned by the majority will of this nation, and that therefore, so far as it is humanly possible, they should be in a position, as it were, to take up an attitude of benevolent neutrality towards all parties contending for popular favour, holding the ring at election times between these parties, and serving with absolutely the same machine-like discipline and efficiency any Government that may be returned as a result of the popular vote.  The importance of that in this country, where you may have Governments, particularly under this system of Proportional Representation, succeeding one another with a certain procession-like rapidity, cannot be overestimated. I do not think that, when the position is properly explained to the members of the forces, you will find any deep-seated desire for the vote, or any resentment at the fact that it has been thought fit by those responsible for their future to insert that particular clause. We stand over it absolutely and on high ground, the ground being the future efficiency of the members of the force, their future discipline, and the good of the nation.  We stand over it so that if parties opposing us at the moment are returned to power by the people they may find at their disposal absolutely solid pieces of Government machinery prepared to serve them with the same discipline and with the same efficiency as they served us.  Whatever may be the political variations in this country in the <Col N="2081" /> future, it is our wish that this force would stand as the one firm thing in a world that may be otherwise wobbly; or, as I may quote it&mdash;&ldquo;standing as a rock 'mid melting snows.&rdquo;  That is the conception, that is what we aim at, and there is no thought that by inserting that clause we would hit one political party or help another.  It is simply done in the broadest possible spirit for the future of the force and for the future of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to suggest&mdash;and I am sure Deputy O'Brien did not suggest&mdash;that there was any party motive of any kind in the proposed deprivation of the civil rights of policemen.  I fear that the conception in the minds of Ministers of the functions of a police force in the country is not very far removed from that which has prevailed in the past.  I am not sure whether policemen have heretofore been deprived of their votes on the Register.  I think, by some kind of an internal order, they have been advised not to exercise the franchise, but I think their names do appear on the Register.  I am not positive about that, but certainly sometimes they do appear on the Register, because they have come under my own notice in that respect.  The whole question arises as to whether the arguments that have been adduced in favour of this clause could not be made to apply to every soldier and every civil servant.  You want them to be impartial servants of successive Governments, no matter what the party complexion of those Governments may be.  But you are not proposing to deprive either the civil servants or the soldiers of the army of their civic rights. It is, perhaps, the kind of thing that one might expect, to ask policemen to be &ldquo;solid pieces of Government machinery,&rdquo; but it is not very congratulatory to the policeman.  There is a denial in this clause of the suggestion that we thought was being received with some favour, and that is that the Civic Guard should become more and more a body of people associated with the civic life of the community&mdash;actual servants of the community in which they are acting.  You are suggesting that your police force is going to be a semi-military force in the future as it has been in the past, simply moving at the direction of a central authority, and not having any thoughts outside <Col N="2082" /> their military or semi-military duties, or their police duties.  Now, you are not going to make good policemen of automata of that kind.  The best policeman is the best citizen, and the best citizen is the man who has some sense of responsibility for the Government. You are, I say, depriving them of that, and you are asking that these constituting the police force should be simply automata, moving at the direction of a central authority without any thought of their relationship to the community of which they are the servants, and moving simply as &ldquo;solid pieces of Government machinery.&rdquo;  That is not the conception of the functions of a police force that you ought to have in mind.  Not alone should the policeman be the servant of the community for the purpose of keeping order, but he should be a sensible servant, having some conception of his relationship with the citizens, so that he would not be simply a man with a baton or a gun for the purpose of knocking heads at the order of his superior, but that he should use some sense of his relations with the community in deciding what action he shall take towards that community. The Minister says he is sure the police would not object to being deprived of their right to vote.  I am sure it is true at the present, when you are making it a condition of service.  Men want employment, and they are not thinking in terms of their civic relationship, and they will not object at present, and possibly they would never object.  I do not know.  Individuals here and there certainly would, but it is our duty as a State to put that policeman in proper relationship to the community as a citizen of the community on whom certain special responsibilities are devolved.  You must not deprive him, because he is a policeman, of his sense of partnership in the community. He must have the feeling that he is an organic part of the community; not something from outside brought in to do a particular job.  He must be part of this organism, this society, this constituency of Saorstát Eireann.  I think it is a most undesirable proposition to deprive these men of their votes.  Members of the police force should have the same civic rights as members of the defence force.  The practical objection is raised that he might conceivably act as a partisan because he has decided to vote a certain <Col N="2083" /> way himself, and he might conceivably act to prevent another voter nullifying his vote; but in practice, certainly, while the Civic Guard is in its present position, his duties will be generally away from his relatives, and, in my view, he should be placed in the same position as the members of the defence force referred to in Clause 5, and he should be entitled to vote as well as an absent voter.  That would get over the difficulty suggested as to the possibility of using his position to deprive or to unfairly influence other voters in the exercise of their rights. But the main objection is one of principle, where you are proposing that the police force shall be alienated from citizenship because the sign of citizenship is the right to vote.  If you deprive a man of that right you are practically asking to set up a guard foreign to the civic life of the community&mdash;something imported into the civic life of the people but not part of it.  That is a bad principle, which ought not to prevail at the beginning of this State, and consequently I beg to move that Clause 4 be deleted.</P>

      <P>One does not decentralise at a time when the very basic principle of Constitutional Government is challenged and is not vindicated. Personally, up to a point I would favour decentralisation.  I would favour the greatest possible co-operation between <Col N="2084" /> the police force and the local authorities in this country, and associate the police as far as possible with the civic life of the country, when, and only when, the civic life was worthy of association with, and when such association would be of service both to the country and to the police force.  The civic spirit in this country is at a rather low ebb at the moment.  Basic principles are challenged; the local authorities are not without sin, and no man with a proper conception of his duties or responsibilities, holding the position which I now hold would dream of decentralising the police forces or associating them in any considerable contact with the local authorities.  When and if the civic life of the country improves; when and if there comes a more general recognition of the principles on which civilised government rests everywhere in every civilised country, then, whoever has the misfortune to hold the office of the Minister for Home Affairs can sit down at his desk and seriously consider the very interesting problems which Deputy Johnson's speech has raised.  This is not legislation for all time, but it is legislation passed in the recognition of the hard facts of the situation with which we are faced.  We make no particular apology for having recommended the insertion of that clause.  I do not consider it needs it.  I consider it is a rather obvious deduction from the anxieties of the moment and the immediate future that you must have a force as far as possible colourless, nonpartisan politically, as far as humanly possible, prepared to protect the rights and property of all citizens in the country with absolute impartiality, prepared to enforce the law, impersonally and impartially, against every citizen of the country.  That is the thing we must aim at.  To a very large extent that has been already secured.  We do not propose to imperil it by putting the police forces in a position of being canvassed, propagandised from every quarter, and we want to make it not worth people's while to tamper with the benevolent neutrality of the police forces.  Later on, when we grow up as a Nation, when we get a better perspective and sense of proportion, and a more general recognition of basic principles, other interesting questions can be considered.</P>

      <P>Clause 5 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Any person serving as a member of the defence force of Saorstát Eireann on full pay who is entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector may be so registered in the constituency in which he would but for his service be ordinarily resident.&rdquo;  It is not proposed to restrict the right of members of the Defence Force of Saorstát Eireann to vote. They are not in any sort of ordinary times and this resolution puts forward a provision which it is intended should be the law for some number of years, at any rate.  In any ordinary times the members of the Defence Force will not be intimately connected with the administration of law in the country.  The Defence Force exists in reality for the defence of the country against outside enemies, or for the defence of the community against internal enemies who cannot be dealt with by the ordinary Forces at the disposal of the Government or the Executive, or by the ordinary means of enforcing law.  Consequently we feel that there can be no reason, no good reason, put forward for refusing the right to the members of the Defence Force to exercise the Franchise; and on the other hand, they are already sufficiently separated from the general community by the discipline under which they will carry on, to make it desirable that we should, so far as we can, without prejudice to their efficiency, without prejudice to the proper discharge of the duties which lie upon them, to bring them into touch with the ordinary life of the Nation.  All the arguments which Deputy Johnson put forward in favour of giving a vote to the members of the Police Force apply to the members of the Defence Force, and the objections which exist to giving the vote to members of the Police Force do not apply to the members of <Col N="2087" /> the Defence Force.  Now, this Clause provides that a member of the Defence Force shall be registered in respect of the place in which he would have been ordinarily resident, except for his service. I think it will be generally agreed that that provision would be desirable. We may have very large numbers of soldiers for some particular reason drafted into an area, and if they are registered in respect of that area they would throw out of gear the ordinary arrangement for the Election.  They would disturb the balance that would exist; consequently it is better to have them registered in respect of their home constituency.  There might be some difficulty in deciding where a soldier was ordinarily resident, but I think that can be got over without any great difficulty. If he is married, it will be where his wife lives, or otherwise where his parents reside, or failing either of these, it will be in the place where he declares when he offered his services that he was ordinarily resident.  I do not think that would be a matter to which any objection would arise.</P>

      <P>The purpose for which Clause 6 was drafted was to give effect to the provisions of the previous Clause, to give an opportunity to the Defence Force for recording their votes.  If a member of the Defence Force is registered in respect, not of the constituency in which he is serving, but in respect of the constituency in which he would ordinarily reside, it is necessary that he should be able to vote by post so as to exercise the right given him by registration. There is a flaw in Clause 6. As it stands it would prevent University electors voting by post.  That was not intended, and I understand an amendment will be moved to the resolution removing that flaw.  It is felt desirable to restrict postal voting so far as possible. If you give a man, other than a soldier, the right to vote by post, because of absence from his constituency, there <Col N="2088" /> are no logical grounds on which you could refuse to allow a person who might be ill in hospital or ill at home the right to vote by post.  Now, if you did that you would break down the principle of the secret ballot and open the way to a great deal of corruption.  The next thing you would have would be persons obtaining medical certificates that they were unable to go to the polling booths and claiming a right to vote by post. They would then be able to fill up their papers in the presence of some interested parties and the way to bribery would be open.  Now there is no logical reason for refusing the right to vote by post to sick persons, if it is given to people who for business reasons may happen to be absent from the poll from the constituency in respect of which they are registered. However, the postal vote is one which affects a very small proportion of the electorate; it gives a considerable amount of trouble.  It is contrary to the general principle of the secret ballot.  It is liable to abuse, and generally we think that it is most desirable to abolish it, except in the case of the military vote and in the case of the University vote, because if there was no right to a postal vote in the case of a University constituency, it would mean that a very small proportion of the graduates would be able to vote.</P>

      <P>I propose to move an amendment to this Clause by introducing in line 2, after the words &ldquo;by legislation to enable,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;registered electors for University constituencies.&rdquo;  The Clause will then read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provision shall be made by legislation to enable registered electors for University constituencies and members of the defence force of Saorstát Eireann on full pay to vote by post at any election of a member or members to serve in either House of the Oireachtas, but save as aforesaid, no person shall be entitled to vote by post or by proxy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Dáil will not think me ungrateful for the too generous treatment which it meted out to Deputy Magennis and myself when we asked you to grant University representation in the Dáil to the Universities which we have the honour to represent here.  It is not because we are ungrateful or that having got one thing that we are asking for <Col N="2089" /> more, that I move this amendment. The only object of this amendment is to give effect to what has already been done.  You have already declared that Universities shall have practical representation here, and this will enable the electors of these Universities to exercise their rights.  A University is not a locality such as a constituency for which we register in the ordinary course. These electors are scattered over the length and breadth of the land, and unless you grant to them the privilege which they always hitherto enjoyed of registering their votes by post, you must, I think, of necessity disfranchise 75 per cent. of the whole electorate, and you would commit the representation of the Universities, not into the hands of those graduates who ought to vote, but to a mere junta who happen to be resident within the four walls of the University itself or in its immediate vicinity.  Such representation as that would not be an effective University representation at all.  It would be mere nomination by a section or an infinitesimal portion of those entitled to vote.  Therefore, I do with all confidence and sincerity commend this amendment to the Dáil, in order that they may give real effect to the amendment which they granted, and for which I am profoundly grateful, and which I hope will be of good benefit to Ireland, giving University representation here.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  I understand, from the Minister introducing the Bill that it is merely an oversight that this amendment is required.  The Dáil will recollect on the final draft of the Constitution it was by common consent arranged that provision should be made for the election, in the case of University constituencies, being carried out throughout successive days, whereas they are all to take place for the normal constituencies on the same day.  The fact that that differentiation was made was due to the circumstances to which Deputy Fitzgibbon has just now drawn your attention. It is inevitable, with electors in every part of the country, that unless the votes were returnable by post we should merely have a mockery of an election, so it seems to me that this only requires to be mentioned to be passed.</P>

      <P>There is one objection to this amendment as it stands, <Col N="2090" /> and I am hoping the mover will agree to an amendment of his amendment.  The objection is, that as it stands, the graduate at present qualified to have his name appear on the University Register may be living in China, Peru, Australia or London, and would be able to vote by proxy.  I think the general sense of the Dáil, and of the country, is that whatever may be said for University representation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I suggest to Deputy Fitzgibbon that he might agree to put in some words to imply that these voters must be &ldquo;ordinarily resident in Ireland,&rdquo; which, I think, would commend itself to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I rather think that is an extraordinary provision to begin with.  The first clause says: &ldquo;Every person who is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  In our Constitution, we took considerable care over the definition of &ldquo;citizen,&rdquo; and, therefore, those graduates of the University who do not chose to take upon themselves the privileges of citizenship of this country will be precluded from exercising their votes.  But, on the other hand, I do not think it would be fair to exclude those citizens of Saorstát Eireann, who desire to vote for the University constituency, but who happen to be temporarily outside it, from exercising their rights.  I do not think, and I will venture to say that if Deputy Johnston reads the Constitution and the first clause of the electoral provisions, he will see, that these people who have voluntarily made themselves strangers in this country, will not be entitled to exercise the right to vote.</P>

      <P>The mention of proxy voting in the last line of this clause occurred because there is at present in certain circumstances a right to vote by proxy, and we desire to emphasise the fact that it was our intention to remove entirely the right of proxy voting.  It is not intended that military or University electors can under any circumstances be able to vote by proxy. I accept the amendment of Deputy Fitzgibbon. I do not think it would be desirable to confine University representation to people &ldquo;ordinarily resident in Saorstat Eireann.&rdquo;  One of the things that commends it to me, at any rate, is the fact that University representation will enable numbers of people, who, for various reasons, have left this country, but who remain domiciled in this country &mdash;from the fact that they intend to return to Ireland&mdash;is that it will enable certain of these people to keep up a link with the country that they have temporarily gone away from.  It will also enable people who are conscious of the unity of Ireland, but who may be living in the part of Ireland which is not in the territory of the Saorstát Eireann, or within its jurisdiction, but who are domiciled in its area, and intend to return to it, citizens of Saorstát Eireann, it will enable them, when out of that territory to keep a certain interest in the political affairs and in the political fortunes of Saorstát Eireann.  I do not think it would be desirable to make the further change that Deputy Johnson suggested.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear on the point as to what effect this would have.  If it is certain that it applies only to those domiciled in Ireland and temporarily away, a good deal of my objection to this amendment falls, but unless I get an assurance from Deputy Fitzgibbon that no vote is granted under this clause to a graduate of the University who is not domiciled in Ireland I think we will have to oppose it.  I am reminded that in Article 3 of the Constitution the term domicile there deals rather with those who on the coming into operation of this Constitution shall be citizens by virtue of their domicile, and there are conditions governing the future acquisition of citizenship, the conditions to be determined by law. Whether the passing of this clause would, by virtue of a man's graduateship, <Col N="2092" /> entitle him to vote irrespective of his domicile is a question on which I would like some assurance from the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am very slow and disinclined to give legal opinions offhand, and we all know legal opinions given for nothing are worthless.  The last thing I would like to do would be by any rash expression of opinion, to mislead this Dáil.  I have not considered this matter.  I was under the impression when I read this clause that no one who was not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann could possibly vote at any election for representatives to this Dáil. Therefore if a Japanese or a foreigner of any description who happened to come to one of our Universities&mdash;and we have seen a great many from the Indian Empire in the last eight or ten years over here&mdash;none of these people who come here and obtain a degree would get the right to vote at an election for representatives to this Dáil unless they were citizens of the Irish Free State, and to become citizens of the Irish Free State when they are living somewhere else they would have to make a declaration for that purpose.  I do not think that people whose entire interests are outside this country would make a declaration which would deprive them of a vote in their own country, where their interests mainly lay, merely for the sake of giving one vote for a representative for Dublin University.  Speaking for myself, I think the desires of Deputy Johnson are met by the terms of this Bill and in the Constitution, and the people whose influence he is afraid would come in are precluded by these terms from exercising votes, but if he has any doubts about it he must find some other means of resolving them than by asking me questions across the Dáil, because I confess I am unable to give a definite opinion offhand.  But, to the best of my opinion, I think no foreigner or stranger would get a vote.  I think I am right in that.</P>

It would arise in considering the question of whether a person was or was not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.  I do not know whether it could be held that any person who was a citizen of Saorstát Eireann and remained a citizen was not domiciled in Saorstát Eireann.  But, in any case, if such a contingency should arise, then we would have to consider whether or not such a person would be entitled to be registered as an elector of a university or anywhere else, but it scarcely arises on the question of giving those who are registered electors of the university a right to vote by post.  It is a matter, of course, that has not been specifically settled by this resolution, as far as I can see, and it can be considered when the Electoral Bill is before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We are already bound by the Constitution to carry on the elections in accordance with the principles of proportional representation. The only extra provision in this clause of the resolution is that the system of proportional representation to be used shall be that operated by way of the single transferable vote, that is, we shall adhere to the system of proportional representation under which this Dáil has been elected&mdash;the system with which the people of this country have become familiar within the past few years, and which they have learned to use.  There are other systems of proportional representation, but whether they have any advantages over the system of the single transferable vote is a matter about which there may be a great deal of dispute. The only systems that I have read anything about are systems by which electors can vote for a list, and the idea of the list, as far as I can understand it, seems to be to strengthen the bonds of Party discipline.  In any case, I think <Col N="2094" /> it may be said there are no substantial advantages to be found in the other systems of proportional representation that are not to be found in the system to which we have become accustomed.  We think it is desirable that a system which is, on the whole, a very satisfactory and a very fair system, should be adhered to, and that the people of this country should not be confused by having a new system imposed on them when they have just begun to understand the present one.  If, after a number of years, or, in view of the peculiar circumstances &mdash;the peculiar system of electing the Seanad&mdash;it was thought necessary to modify the present system or to adopt a new system, then it could be done later, but we feel that, for the present, and for the first elections that will take place for the Parliament of Saorstát Eireann, it is much more preferable to adhere to the system that has been in use.</P>

      <P>I just raise this question without pressing it too much.  I would like to understand from the Minister whether he has considered the wisdom or otherwise of allowing the single transferable vote system to be applicable even when there are two candidates to be elected.  There is nothing inherently undesirable in it.  As a matter of fact, even for the election of one person it is considered by some to be the right method&mdash;that is to say, to use a single transferable vote&mdash;but certainly for the election of two there is a good deal to be said for applying the same method.  If you had an electorate of 50,000 voters recording their votes for two candidates, 25,001 might elect both, and the other 24,999 are without representation. I think a good case could be made for one of the two almost representing a majority&mdash;that is to say, if the minority is big enough, as would be requisite under the single transferable vote, one of the two could be a representative of that almost half.  I would just request the Minister to say whether he has considered this view of the case with regard to constituencies where only two are to be elected.</P>

Some of us have gone into this with some care, and you will find when you work it arithmetically that you may get five candidates and only one to be elected.  Unless you use the single transferable vote it might very easily happen that the person elected might be the representative of the minority, and not the representative of the majority will of the people.

      <P>Before I come to the schedule I would just point out that this resolution deals with both Houses of the <Col N="2096" /> Oireachtas.  There is nothing here as to the system by which the provisions set out would be enforced, but we think that whatever is decided by this Dáil to be a disqualification for membership of either House of the Oireachtas should be observed in the election of the portion of the Senate which the Dáil will be entitled to elect very shortly.  If, after these resolutions have been passed by the Dáil, it is found that some person has been nominated who is disqualified by the resolutions, it might be necessary that it should be moved that the name of that person should be removed from the list of candidates, or it might be thought desirable to allow the election to go on and to allow that person to sit temporarily in the Senate until the Electoral Bill might have been passed and when a competent Tribunal would deal with the matter.  I think, therefore, that if these resolutions are passed it will be desirable that members of the Dáil should not nominate any person for the Senate who was disqualified by the terms of these resolutions, and if a Deputy persists in nominating a disqualified person then a resolution of the Dáil should be proposed before the Poll is taken removing the name of that person from the list of candidates if the case is a clear one.  I can only take the sub-clauses one by one.  Sub-clause A reads:&mdash;&ldquo;A person who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment with hard labour for any period exceeding six months, or of penal servitude for any term imposed by a Court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  We do not think it is desirable that a person who has committed an offence against the laws of the State, and who is actually at the time of the Election serving a sentence because of that offence, should be entitled to be elected a Member of either the Dáil or of the Senate.  If the offence were a very trivial one, perhaps an offence of an accidental nature, the objection to such a person being elected would not hold.  Consequently we have fixed six months with hard labour or a term of penal servitude as sentences which would indicate that the offence committed was one of some seriousness. We think it is not good from the public point of view that persons criminally convicted should not be under any disqualification for membership of the Parliament of the Nation.  We do not think <Col N="2097" /> that this particular proposal is so stringent as to be open to any serious objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. O'BRIEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he has given any consideration to the fact that this might be used to disqualify a person who had committed a particular crime connected with public affairs, or labour affairs.  I would draw his attention to the fact that in the past a provision of this kind has been so used.  There were, I think, several cases arising out of the Land War some thirty or forty years ago.  In more recent times we had other examples.  I have in mind the case of Mr. James Larkin, who in 1910 was convicted at Cork and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, with hard labour, for a purely technical offence&mdash; for what was universally admitted to be a purely technical offence.  The offence was that of receiving 1s. 3d. from a worker for the purpose of enrolling him as a member of a certain Labour organisation and failing to so enrol him.  He was sentenced to twelve months with hard labour, and two years following that he was disqualified from serving upon a local body to which he was elected by a very large majority.  This sub-clause states, of course, &ldquo;While serving a term of imprisonment,&rdquo; but it could equally apply that a member of this Dáil might be so convicted in the future. We are not so optimistic as to expect that we will not see class bias on the Bench in the future as in the past, and a member of this Dáil could be so disqualified. I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to that and make some stipulation regarding the nature of the offence rather than the actual term of imprisonment.  He might have some such qualification as the commission of a felony, or a description of that sort.  That would narrow it down and prevent a state of affairs such as I have indicated occurring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister deals with the question put by Deputy O'Brien another matter occurs to me that is worthy of some consideration. The disqualifications are imprisonment with hard labour for a period exceeding six months or penal servitude. Now in many cases it frequently happens a sentence of imprisonment for very much longer than six months without hard labour is imposed upon people <Col N="2098" /> who, but for their physical disability or age, or some consideration of that kind, would be given hard labour; instead of getting six months with hard labour they are given a year's or two years', imprisonment, but without hard labour. The offence in that case is just as great as the disqualifying offence which gets six months with hard labour, and the remission of the hard labour is merely due to some physical reason affecting the offender, and not to the crime.  I venture to suggest to the Minister that if he were to put the words &ldquo;with hard labour&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;six months&rdquo; it would meet the difficulty that is in my mind.</P>

      <P>The difficulty which occurred in the case of Mr. James Larkin would not occur under the provision proposed by this resolution.  The person is only disqualified if actually serving the sentence at the time.  I am very much inclined to agree with Deputy Fitzgibbon that there are many cases in which people are imprisoned without hard labour because the Court thought their health or age&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Or sex made it undesirable that hard labour should be given.  The fact that hard labour was not given did not mean that the offence was anything the less serious than if hard labour had been given.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Brien, I think there cannot be a distinction made as to the nature of the crime.  If any person offends against the laws of the country in such a way as to merit a fairly severe sentence, then that breach of the law should be regarded as a sufficient disqualification from membership of the legislature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the things you cannot provide against.  The idea that any person would get a sentence without meriting it is rather an argument in favour of a possible reform of the system of administering justice than of modifying this Clause.  Of course there is a difficulty in connection with this whole question of hard labour.  It may be that when we come to alter the laws in relation to the judiciary and a variety of other matters, there may be some different classification of punishment <Col N="2099" /> rather than imprisonment with or without hard labour, and penal servitude. We may even know before the electoral law is enacted what is intended in regard to that, and it may be possible to modify this provision in some way.  For the moment I would be inclined to ask the Dáil to let it stand as indicating the opinion of the Dáil that a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment, which indicates an offence of some magnitude, not merely some accidental or negligent breach of the law but something that was wilfully done&mdash;some definite crime &mdash;should be ineligible for election as a member of either House of the Legislature.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Sub-clause (d)&mdash;&ldquo;A member of the defence force of Saorstát Eireann on full pay.&rdquo; This is a matter which was debated in this Dáil some time ago.  It was debated when the Constitution was under consideration.  We recognise that it is not desirable that officers of the Army on full pay should be members of the Dáil, but in the circumstances which had existed heretofore it was impossible to exclude, and it was undesirable to exclude, them.  We were then at a time when it was through the efforts of members of the Army that made it possible for this Dáil to exercise authority.  It was undesirable that they should be asked to leave the Army in which they had served, and in which their services were needed.  It was undesirable that they should be asked to leave the Dáil to which they had been elected while they were members of the Army.  At the same time we recognise that in any sort of normal times it would be undesirable that members on full pay, active service members of the Army Forces of the Nation, should sit in the Legislature, and for that reason we propose to insert this provision in the forthcoming Electoral Law which will, so far as future Dáils and future Seanads are concerned, disqualify any officer or soldier from sitting in the Dáil while on the active list of the Army.</P>

    <P>I do not think it is necessary at any length to recommend this Clause.

      <P>We think this Clause is necessary.  It would certainly be impossible to have a person holding office in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann acting as a member of the Legislature, and probably taking a leading part in defeating or thwarting proposals of the member of the Ministry or Executive who would be responsible for the Department in which he was employed. It would be very undesirable that a member of the Civil Service should be dismissed, not for any misconduct in his office, but for his action in the Dáil, and for the difficult position that might be created by his action in the Dáil, and we think it is not only desirable but essential for the smooth working of the Department that members of the Civil Service should be disqualified from becoming members of the Dáil or the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is not a desirable Clause to be passed, and I think that the purpose of the Minister could be obtained if instead of disqualifying all except those who are especially permitted he should make it a condition of service for those that are considered to be disqualified.  It was stated in the Dáil some months ago that postal employees, for instance, were Civil Servants and had to suffer disabilities. I do not think it is a desirable thing at all to say that a man, because he is employed by the State in a service of that kind, should be disqualified from becoming a member of the Dáil.  It may be said that teachers, for instance, are Civil Servants.  In some senses it might be argued that they are, but it is not desirable that they should be disqualified. If the railways were nationalised it might then be said that the railway servants were Civil Servants, and that therefore they should be disqualified, and that the time that they spent in the service of their constituents in <Col N="2102" /> the Oireachtas was not spent in the service of the State.  But it is not a good thing to expressly prevent them from becoming members unless by special permission.  Rather I think it should be the other way about.  If it is considered by the Dáil that a certain class of Civil Servants ought not to be allowed to be members, and that you make that a condition of service, I do not think it is right to make that general prohibition with express exceptions.  I think this is a reactionary proposal and ought not to be agreed to, and I therefore beg to move its deletion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be two ways of doing this thing.  A member of any branch of the service, excepting someone who might be excluded from this provision, might be informed that if he became a candidate and was elected to the Oireachtas his service would cease. I do not think that desirable.  If the law gives him the right to become a member there might be trouble in many circumstances and difficulty in enforcing that rule.  If for instance a representative of the Post Office employees had been elected a member of the Dáil, the Executive might find itself up against a crisis, if it had enforced the Service rule, which requires that such a man should be retired upon his election to the Dáil.  It is much more desirable that he should be required to leave the Service, and if he were elected it would be up to the Department to dispense with him.  I think it is absolutely essential as a general rule that Civil Servants should not be members of the Dáil or the Oireachtas.  There would be a temptation both to the man and perhaps to the Head of the Department, if he were in the Dáil and were obstreperous to get rid of his opposition by say promotion within the Service.  That would not be the sort of corruption which does not so readily happen, but it is clearly corruption. An insidious form of corruption would be invited by having a member of the Civil Service a member of the Dáil. A man without being obviously and indisputably corrupt would be able to use his position in the House for his own advancement in the Service.  He would be able to use knowledge he would gain in his department to attack those who were his departmental superiors, and would still be his superiors, after he had left <Col N="2103" /> the Dáil.  I think, in the interests of clean administration and in the interests of the efficiency of the department, it is undoubtedly necessary to see that no members of the Civil Service&mdash;unless some people specially named, who can be members without disadvantage&mdash;that no members of the Civil Service shall be in the Dáil or Senate, and the way is not to put it up to the Department to dismiss the man but to put it up to the man to decide whether he is going to serve the State as a Civil Servant or as a legislator.  If railway men and teachers are later on to be made Civil Servants, it can then be decided whether they would be expressly permitted to be members of the Oireachtas or not.  That matter would not be affected one way or the other by the adoption of the provision outlined in this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we need to define what is a Civil Servant before we accept this Clause as it stands.  If it is true that postal employees are Civil Servants, it would be equally true that railway men are Civil Servants, and it has been maintained successfully in another place that teachers are Civil Servants, and to meet the case put forward by the Minister, all that is required is that the particular kind of Civil Servant shall be defined, and condition of his employment shall be that he is not eligible to become a member of the Oireachtas.  That has already been done with the Police Force, and it seems to be that this method of lumping all servants of the State, and saying that none of those shall be allowed to become members of the Oireachtas is bad legislation, and ought not to be passed.  We have a suggestion in the Constitution for a possible development of vocational councils.  Vocational councils might well be councils of an organisation of an industrial function, which is somewhat under the direction of the State.  You may then say all those are Civil Servants, because they are serving the community.  Thereby they would be deprived of the right to be represented in the Oireachtas.  And until you have shown definitely what you mean by Civil Service, I press my amendment for the deletion of this Clause.</P>

If <Col N="2104" /> any doubt were to arise, I do not know that there are any doubts as to any class at the moment, but if any doubt were to arise that doubt can be decided.  But you cannot provide for every question that will arise in the future.  Questions will arise that will have to be decided when they do arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be within the memory of this Dáil that not very long ago they decided to appoint a Committee to deal with the question of corrupt practices at elections, in order that these corrupt practices might be brought to an end, and at the time one or two stated in the course of that debate, if the Dáil will recall it, that it was right that some essential principle should be adopted, and I am in agreement that some essential principle should be adopted without any reference to a Committee, which is different to a Commission.  A Commission advises the Dáil as to general principles, and a Committee carries out general principles committed to it by the. Dáil or by the Legislature in question, and there is an important principle that I raised on that occasion that I would desire this Dáil to give its confirmation to, before the Committee should sit. There was, I believe I am right in saying, a general measure of consent for the principle to which I refer, the principle being that offences such as were complained of should be treated as criminal offences, and that criminal penalties should be attached to them.  It is well known that grave evils call for drastic remedies.  The offences such as we are referring to, and which are known as corrupt practices at elections, have become very grave evils in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my purpose to go into that matter now, as it was once before very fully debated and very fully discussed. I desire quite briefly to run through the main details, the main headings of the Clauses, that are before the Dáil now.  If this were referred by the Dáil to the Committee it would be assumed by the Committee in giving them consideration, that it was bound to the essential principles that were debated, and it would be for the Committee to change the wording or change the details, or change the application or widen the application, as it thought fit, while never-the <Col N="2111" /> less adhering to the central principle, that all these Clauses tend to convey. In drafting out these Clauses, I have run through all the various items from the very beginning of an election to the end, beginning at registration, and continuing right through to the vexed question of personation.  In the first of these Clauses, if Deputies will turn to it, there is a statement made, &ldquo;it is provided that any person, who of his own application is registered, or who of his own application attempts to be registered more than once, as an elector entitled to vote at a general election, or who of his own application is or attempts to be registered without being duly qualified to be so registered, shall be liable on conviction to a penalty of £25.&rdquo;  It is provided for in the rest of that Article, if a person having the two possibilities, desires to be registered in respect of one and not the other, he may be reminded of that fact, and there is no penalty attaching because the choice is given to him. The second Clause deals with this more important matter and one that is familiar to the Members of this Dáil: It says &ldquo;Any person who causes or attempts to cause another person to be registered more than once as an elector shall be liable on conviction to a penalty of £50.&rdquo; The penalty in this case has been doubled because the evil itself is very much greater.  One single person might in good faith apply to be registered more than once, but it is extremely unlikely that one person is going to apply on behalf of a large number of persons, but it did occur in the Constituency I represent. We know that at the last election, there were I think 680 persons who not merely did not exist, but who had never existed, who had been entered and registered by a certain political organization, and I believe it is perfectly true that of these 680 persons, who never even had life over 500 of them voted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. FIGGIS Mr. FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they voted for me.  That, of course, was organised corruption.  We have spoken in this Dáil several times, while passing the Constitution, of diminishing or weakening the power of political organizations. In no way could it be done more effectually than by passing the principle embodied <Col N="2112" /> in Clause No. 2.  The penalties are set out in Clause 3 in addition to the penalties already outlined.  That means that any persons found guilty of these offences are not only penalised by money fines but are restricted from exercising the franchise for a stated period of years.  I come now to nomination.  Nomination is a matter that has been included in the consideration of this whole question and is probably one of the most important; because, as things stand at the present moment, what is before the candidate?  He must apply between the hours of 12 and 1 o'clock on a given day.  That is to say, any person who wishes to prevent him getting there has a limited time to watch him.  Clause 4 provides for that by stating that directly the election is open such nomination papers may be handed to the Returning Officer, and nomination papers delivered a week or ten days beforehand would be assumed to have been delivered within that hour specified.  In other words, it is made more difficult to waylay or frustrate any person arriving.  The penalty is attached to that in Article 5. I think, owing to the conditions under which the last election occurred, that Clauses 6 and 7 are probably those that will attract most attention.  They will certainly cover ground that will have to be faced at the next election, and probably at several elections in the immediate future.  They deal with the freedom of electors.  Clause 6 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>`Any person intimidating or attempting to intimidate an elector or electors, shall be liable on conviction to be imprisoned with hard labour for a period of twelve months.  Such intimidation shall include the making of public speeches or writing of articles in the press, threatening to make an election impossible, or to imperil the safety of electors before, at, or after an election, and in connection therewith; the using of threatening language, or any bodily interference at a time of elections; the placing of armed forces in the vicinity of a polling booth other than the armed forces provided by the Returning Officer for the protection of such booths; and the parading of armed forces in any constituency in which an election is proceeding.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the person is convicted on indictment of bribery such person shall be liable to be imprisoned, with or without hard labour, for a term not <Col N="2113" /> less than six months and not exceeding one year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last item dealt with in the Clauses is the question of personation, and I have attached to these Clauses a Schedule.  I know that several methods have been put forward by which the personation may be prevented, and this is only one method.  This raises no essential principle. It is a matter that may be referred to the Committee that will be appointed.  The Committee may devise some other method. What it does raise is the important question of principle in all the clauses dealing with personation in these Clauses now before the Dáil, that when a person shall be found guilty of personation a person shall be found guilty of a criminal offence.  There are only two small matters to which I would draw the attention of the Dáil at the present moment.  The first is in the first sentence in the Ballot Act of 1872, which is the Act now in force, and which would be embodied in the codification of law that will be brought before this Dáil at a later date; the Presiding Officer is added to the Returning Officer, and it is provided in Clause 9 that a presiding officer or a Returning Officer if he prosecutes any person on good faith believing that person to be guilty of an offence shall be held harmless before any Court, and so he will have a certain liberty of action that is not open to him at the present moment. We know that personation agents and Returning Officers have hesitated to put the powers they now have in force, for if they make a mistake, even though they make that mistake in good faith, it would probably cost them £50 on each occasion. This proposal would give them considerable freedom and enable this matter of personation to be brought within control much more easily, if either the personating officer or the candidate or the Returning Officer dealing with the matter on behalf of the State should be protected providing that he or she is proceeding in the matter in good faith.  I move this with the suggestion that they be referred to the Committee that will be appointed, and that the Committee should report and change wherever it thinks advisable while adhering to the central principle, which is, that this offence shall be considered as a criminal offence and treated as such.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. I think it is a very necessary thing and I am seconding it for the purpose of <Col N="2114" /> discussion, and I feel if we can by any law prevent these corrupt practices at elections we will be doing public good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>And we are not confined to that.  I think anything we can do to strengthen the hands of these Presiding Officers or Returning Officers at elections might well be done.  If this Committee meets and considers these matters, if it does consider them. they ought to hold firmly in their minds the real penalty against corrupt practices&mdash; that where they are shown to prevail to a great extent that the constituency itself should be disfranchised for a time at all events.  That is really the only way to bring home to a constituency as a whole the crime of corruption at an election for membership of any house. If corrupt practices are found to prevail to any extent in any constituency that constituency ought itself to suffer.  You can never hope to catch all that are guilty of the crime, but you could bring home a sense of civic responsibility to the constituency as a whole by saying it has proved itself unfit to send members to the National Assembly.  I do hope that when the Committee come to consider what penalties ought to be inflicted for corrupt practices that they will not abandon that, but rather strengthen the powers at present existing in the electoral law.</P>

      <P>I find myself in some little difficulty over this.  I agree that the proposals should be referred to the Committee for their consideration, and so far as the motion goes I am prepared to support it.  But the mover wants us to do more than that, and the implication according to his argument, of our passing the Resolution is that we approve of the clauses subject to such amendments as may be put forward.  I do not think that that is satisfactory at all, because we have not been able to discuss and we shall not be able to discuss these various items or clauses with the care that they require before we even pass them as a kind of a second reading of the Resolution.</P>

      <P>I think that this is really a ridiculous motion.  The Committee were appointed to advise practical measures for preventing corrupt practices at elections.  Mr. Figgis will be a member of that Committee.  He will have an opportunity of putting his proposals before the other members of the Committee, but before that is done he wants us, without any consideration and without having any regard to the fact that there is a Committee appointed, to consider the matter in bulk.  He wants us to hallmark the proposals which he can bring before the Committee.  He wants us to do all the advance work which the Committee was appointed to do.  I did not remain for the discussion so that I do not know what it is about, but I think this is a ridiculous proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to state that there is, I think, a question involved in putting a Resolution of this sort before the Dáil.  A Committee has been set up by the Dáil to deal with a matter of this sort, and it appears strange that a member of that Committee would come before the Dáil and put up to it for sanction these proposals which will be considered by the Committee.  If the Committee is doing its business and considers that the various recommendations in this proposal are worthy of their consideration and of their report it is not necessary to give them a direction They are on a particular line of work. If this comes within the sphere of that why not deal with it in the Committee? <Col N="2116" /> It appears as if one member of the Committee uses the Dáil in order to impress the Committee.  I do not know whether that is the case or not, or what special views he has on the matter.  I do not think that the Dáil should really be bothered with a question of this sort when it has entrusted the consideration of the whole matter to a Committee specially appointed for the purpose.</P>

I handed them in because I had no conception that the Committee was being formed, and because I thought that the proposals I have put forward embody a principle of some importance.  I think that the President&mdash;I am prefectly sure quite unintentionally&mdash;has misrepresented the fact.  I have not brought these forward as a member of that Committee. When I brought this forward I was not a member of that Committee.</P>

      <P>I suggest in that case that the Deputy ought to withdraw them.
