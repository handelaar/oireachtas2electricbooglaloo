Ach ba mhaith liom an rud so a chur os bhúr gcomhair arís, sé sin rialacha na díospóireachta atá beartuithe agaibh.  It is not that I like, as I said before, that as presiding Chairman I should prevent anybody from speaking in the Dáil.  But I would specially call the attention of this assembly to the Rules of Debate, particularly the following: &ldquo;Every Deputy shall confine himself strictly to the matter under discussion.  No Deputy shall speak for the purpose of obstructing the business of the meeting, and no Deputy shall make a personal charge against another or use offensive remarks about another.  No Deputy shall speak twice upon the same question unless by way of explanation to clear up a misunderstanding, but a Deputy is not precluded from speaking on any amendment by having spoken upon the original motion or upon any other amendment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would also respectfully ask the delegates here to try and assist in the maintenance of order in the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>Now, according to the Orders of the Day, there is a question here to the Ceann Comhairle.  It is the first question on the Orders of the Day&mdash;it is from Deputy Cathal Brugha.  It is: &ldquo;Cad é an miniú atá agat le tabhairt ar an gcuireadh chun an tionóil seo den Dáil a cuireadh annso fé dhó i mBéarla?&rdquo; As the Ceann Comhairle is not here my only ruling can be that it is out of order.  I had nothing to do with calling the meeting. The Ceann Comhairle is supposed to call the meeting or the members together for the Session.  As I have nothing to do with it, I shall rule it out of order.  I now call on President Griffith to answer the next question on the Orders of the Day.  The question is by Deputy Constance Markievicz:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is the working agreement, if any, between the Cabinet of Dáil Eireann and the Provisional Government with reference to the attitude and activities of Ministers who are acting in a dual capacity, <i>i.e.</i>, as Ministers of Dáil Eireann, the elected Government of the Irish Republic pledged to maintain the Republic, and as Ministers of the Provisional Government appointed to the work of disestablishing that Republic?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Now, our <Col N="133" /> position is clear, and must be clear, to the Irish people.  We were elected as a Government to see this Treaty carried out.  We have an obligation to keep the Dáil in being until we go to an election. We answer for that responsibility here as members of the Dáil.  But the members of the Provisional Government do not answer and need not answer for every detail that they carry out, and the attempt being made by the opponents of that Provisional Government to use this body as a means of harnessing it will not be tolerated by us.  We are here to keep the Dáil in being until the elections, and for that responsibility we answer.  This is for the purpose of propaganda&mdash;that is, propaganda for Lord Carson and his friends at the other side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The answer I give is that the Cabinet of Dáil Eireann and the Provisional Government are working in concert.  Here is the next question by Deputy Art O'Connor:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whether there have been any dismissals or resignations from any of the Government Departments since January 7th, and if so, for what reason?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Whether there has been any attempt in any Department to hamper the Republican activities of any employees who pledged themselves to the work of the Republic?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My answer to the first is&mdash;there have been no dismissals from my Department, nor resignations.  If there has been in any other Departments the Minister can be asked about them.  But the subsidiary question, perhaps, explains the meaning of this.  My answer to number 2 is&mdash; there has been in no Department any interference with any employee on account of his views, but no paid official is entitled to use his position against the Government that appointed him.  The next question is by Deputy Joseph MacDonagh:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Was it as a result of the agreement arrived at between the Minister for Finance and Sir James Craig that the Dáil Cabinet terminated the Belfast Boycott, or was it the policy of the Dáil Cabinet to terminate it prior to the Collins-Craig agreement?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The answer to that is&mdash;the policy of the present Government of Dáil Eireann is to aim at a unified Ireland.  This was the policy before what was described as the Collins-Craig agreement was arrived at. The removal of the Boycott was a part of that policy.  The Cabinet had discussed the general position regarding the removal before the Boycott was removed.  That is my reply.</P>

      <P>I have always understood that anything that the Cabinet does in the interval between the meetings of the Dáil comes up for ratification by the meetings of the Dáil. Therefore I take it that the proper course would be to have this abandonment of the Belfast Boycott ratified by the Dáil. I ask now why this ordinary course was not taken?</P>

      <P>The next questions are addressed to me.  There are five or six of them.  The first question is by Mr. Art O'Connor:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Aire um Gnothai Coigcriche (Minister for Foreign Affairs).  To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether it was by arrangement with him that the Minister for Education, Dáil Eireann, and the Speaker of Dáil Eireann called upon Monsieur Poincairé, Prime Minister of the French Government, during their recent visit to Paris?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without accepting the statement of facts <Col N="134" /> as accurate, the answer is no.  But I think it will be generally agreed that it is deplorable to make a contentious matter of the signal courtesy shown by the Premier of France to the representative Irishmen who called upon him&mdash;a courtesy we all appreciate.  The next question is by Deputy A. O'Connor:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask Minister for Foreign Affairs if he can tell the House whether it was in his capacity as Speaker of Dáil Eireann or any other capacity that Mr. Eoin MacNeill recently paid a formal visit to Monsieur Poincairé, Prime Minister of French Government, during Mr. MacNeill's recent visit to Paris?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer is&mdash;I understand Mr. Eoin MacNeill paid no visit to the French Premier in his capacity as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Eireann.  I will leave Miss MacSwiney's question to the end and answer the others first.  Madame Markievicz:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if it was by his instructions that Mr. MacWhite, Propaganda Agent of the Republic in Geneva, recently called, with the Minister for Education and the Speaker of Dáil Éireann, upon Monsieur Poincairé, Prime Minister of French Government in Paris?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer to that is, without accepting the statement of facts as accurate, no. The next is by Art O'Connor:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he approves of the action of Mr. MacWhite, Agent for the Republic in Geneva, in calling, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Speaker of Dáil Eireann, upon Monsieur Poincairé, Prime Minister of the French Government in Paris, and, if not, what action he has taken or proposes to take in the matter?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer is that Mr. MacWhite did not call upon Monsieur Poincairé, the Prime Minister of France, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Speaker of Dáil Eireann.  Art O'Connor:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has received reports from the Minister for Education or the Speaker of Dáil Eireann with regard to the recent visit to Monsieur Poincairé, Prime Minister for French Government, and, if so, will he communicate to Dáil Eireann the nature of the reports?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have not received any reports; and now I turn to another subject.  There are two questions about another matter, one from Miss MacSwiney, and one from Madame Markievicz.  The first is from Máire nic Shuibhne.  It is:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he can give an undertaking to An Dáil that he will not dismiss from his Department any servants of the Republic for political reasons, nor in any way hamper their activities on behalf of the Republic to the service of which they pledged themselves?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The other question is from Madame Markievicz:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs what instructions, if any, were issued by him calculated to restrain the Republican activities of representatives?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I want to answer these two questions fully so that the House may be in a position to understand.  No such instructions as suggested were issued by me. But, on the contrary, I issued instructions designed to direct the activity of our representatives towards taking every advantage of the great improvement in our foreign relations since the signing of the Treaty with England, dissipating the qualms of those abroad who were formally afraid to meet our representatives &mdash;and to this end I issued a memorandum of instructions to all our representatives abroad.  I think it is right that the House should know of the terms of these instructions since the matter has been raised.  The memorandum is dated the 25th January, 1922, and reads as follows&mdash;it goes as an official memorandum from the Foreign Office to our representatives abroad:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the policy of the new Government of the Republic is friendly to the Provisional Government set up under the Treaty with England, this Government has undertaken the duty of maintaining the existing Republic, and the efficiency of its machinery until the Irish people shall have determined whether or not to accept the proposed Irish Free State.  Moreover, if, in the meantime, the British Government should fail to carry out its <Col N="135" /> engagements, Ireland must be in a position to resume the struggle without delay.  The Irish representatives abroad will continue to represent the Government of the Irish Republic, and that Government alone, but their position will be modified in three respects: (<i>a</i>) Propaganda in regard to an England which has abandoned savagery in Ireland and has signed, and is now being put to the test of working out, a Treaty of peace, approved by Dáil Eireann, must be consistent with the situation thus created, so long as the British Government faithfully observes its compact.  (<i>b</i>)  As national unity is now broken by the emergence of two political parties in the Republican State, members of the diplomatic service will be under the obligation of reflecting faithfully the policy of the Government, whatever their personal opinions on party politics. It will be their duty to refrain from propaganda either for or against the Treaty.  (<i>c</i>) The signing of the Treaty and its approval by Dáil Eireann, have had the effect of opening everywhere many portals formerly closed to us through fear of England.  It should, therefore, be possible immediately to widen the circle of Irish influence on the continent, and develop relations, political, diplomatic, intellectual, economic and social to a very much greater extent than anything that has hitherto been attempted.  Our representatives abroad will do everything possible to take advantage of present conditions to this end.  The publication of the <i>Bulletin</i> issued abroad should be continued.  It is realised that the editor of the <i>Bulletin</i> will have more difficulty under present circumstances in making his material interesting, and the <i>Bulletin</i> may, where necessary, be issued at less frequent intervals. But the Publicity Department has been instructed to supplement the information contained in the newspapers by special &lsquo;copy&rsquo; in order that the reputation which the <i>Bulletins</i> generally have acquired may be the more easily maintained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that everybody will recognise that that is a fair set of instructions to give to foreign representatives under the present circumstances, and particularly as the rule as to Civil Servants or Diplomatic Servants of the Government taking any part in Party politics is a universal rule that must be enforced now in Ireland as in everywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>MISS MARY MACSWINEY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a supplementary question&mdash; that is, if the Minister does not realise the fundamental difference between Party politics as practised in England, and Party politics when it means the subversion of the established Republic which, according to him, means that the servants of the Republic who have devoted their lives to the establishment and maintenance of that Republic are pledged, according to these instructions, to treat as Party politics, and to refrain from expressing their views and opinions on, what is to them a matter of life and death to the nationhood of their country?</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. GAVAN DUFFY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not complain of its length.  I only mentioned it. This is not a question of the nature of the differences that divide us.  The people who are our representatives abroad must represent Government policy.  Now, it was upon that point on the 28th April last that President de Valera issued instructions to a similar effect.  I will read for you an extract from the letter of President de Valera to an envoy abroad, dated 28th April, 1921:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Our representatives abroad, whether they be members of the Dáil or not, must regard themselves unequivocally the direct agents of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and must carry out the instructions of the Department, whether they personally agree with the policy or not.  Objections or considerations having special reference to conditions in the country in which they are stationed are, of course, legitimate, and may be urged in the correspondence with the Department, but where the Department insists it is only by resignation that the representatives can find a way out.  The Ministry is responsible to <Col N="136" /> the Dáil, and therefore its policy is, ultimately, Dáil policy.  When those of our representatives who are members of the Dáil wish to communicate with the Dáil they must do so in an independent and separate communication either to me or to the Secretary of the Dáil, not through the Foreign Affairs Department. I will see that it is duly brought forward and considered at our Sessions.  This alone will prevent misunderstanding and very probable frictions.  Of course, were our circumstances not what they are, there would be no thought of having a member of the Dáil appointed as an ambassador abroad.  Your letter also demonstrates what a danger we run when our representatives are too long from home, particularly when through infrequency of communication they derive their information either from the general outpourings of the Press, or from communications from centres other than from headquarters.  This leads to a further danger which is developing, that of communicating by letter to private and unofficial persons matters which will not be treated as confidential, and which, in any case, should not be discussed except in official communications with the heads of the State Departments or other authorised persons.  The abuses in that direction would not be tolerated for an instant by any of the universally recognised Governments. It must be put a stop to in our case, else we shall one of these days have a sharp reminder that it is not without purpose the older Governments take care to rigidly enforce this rule.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMacSwiney" hpid="MISS M. MACSWINEY MISS M. MACSWINEY">
      <NameTxt>MISS M. MACSWINEY:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that exactly emphasising my point that this is a question, not of Party politics, but of fundamental differences.  The servants of An Dáil must maintain the policy of the Government and the Government of An Dáil is the Government of the Republic, and therefore they must maintain the Republic.  The fact that President de Valera, when he held office, had to write such a letter to one of his officials, only shows that such letters can be used in the interest of, and inside, the Republic; but they are not to be done for the subversion of the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. EAMON DUGGAN:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a number of questions addressed to me&mdash;(a) Mr. Austin Stack:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether there is any truth in the rumour that a police force other than the Republican Police is being set up; and, if so, by what authority?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply is: Yes; by the authority of the Provisional Government.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is a fact that members of the R.I.C. who served against Ireland during the war, and who are at present serving, are engaged in forming a new police force?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply is that certain officers of the R.I.C. have been invited by the Provisional Government to act on a Committee engaged on drawing up a scheme for the organisation of the new police forces. The record of each one of them during the recent war was satisfactory.  A specific case was raised here yesterday, and in connection with that I have received reports as regards this man which I will communicate privately to anyone.  I would like to say that this man did not arrest Roger Casement; that he did not prosecute him.  He happened to be serving in the Barracks to which <Col N="137" /> Roger Casement was brought on his arrival.  He came into contact with Roger Casement from the time he was there, and Casement gave him his watch as a souvenir.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether the British Courts of King's Bench and other English Courts in Ireland are being held with the sanction of the Minister for Home Affairs?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply is&mdash;there are no English or British Courts in Ireland.  The Courts, as well as all other Departments of Government in Ireland, have been taken over by the Provisional Government.  They are allowed to carry on during the transition period pending the establishment of the Free State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether Writs in the British Courts are still issued in the name of the English Sovereign?  Whether, in the oath administered to jurors (Grand and Petty), the words &lsquo;Our Sovereign Lord the King&rsquo; are still being used?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply is there are no British Courts in Ireland so far as I am aware.  No change has been made, or will be made, in the form of procedure of these Courts during the transition period.  The Provisional Government is merely taking over the Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(e)  To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Department of Home Affairs have issued instructions that the Irish people are at liberty to recognise Courts other than the Courts of the Republic?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer is no.  In a couple of cases permits have been issued to persons to proceed in the other Courts where there was no machinery; and that was done by the precedent set by my predecessor in office.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(f)  To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is the opinion of the Minister for Home Affairs that Republicans should or could submit to the jurisdiction of the English Courts of King's Bench, and other tribunals held in the name of the King of England?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply is there are no English Courts in Ireland.  The Courts referred to have been taken over.  I see no objection to any Irish citizen submitting to their jurisdiction if they so desire.  Owing to the Treaty, the Republican Courts are now functioning freely.  The Circuit Judges will hold Courts in nearly fifty centres all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(g)  To ask the Minister for Home Affairs what steps, if any, are being taken to give the control of law and order in the country into the charge of the Republican Police Force?&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The answer is that the Republican Police have been returned to their army units, and the army officers are charged with doing the police work which they did. This is a temporary arrangement.  The change is that the whole Army is now responsible for police work, whereas formerly it was confined to certain men to whom the work was specially delegated.</P>

      <P>The explanation is that a number of questions were not put in in time yesterday for this morning's Session, and the arrangement I made was that the Clerk of the House was to put these on the Orders of the Day.  The staff of the House were up to one o'clock this morning working at these Orders of the Day and at the supplementary questions.  The reason it was put in was just what I said&mdash;because we did not have them in time.  If these supplementary questions were here in time they would appear in the ordinary course.</P>

      <P>Mr. Joseph MacDonagh's question is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  To ask the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the fact that one hundred and twenty Catholics were chased from their employment at the Midland Railway terminus, Belfast, by the pogromists who were not shipyard workers, and their places filled by non-Catholics who still hold them, he will see that these Catholics be immediately reinstated?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will read out this twice.  It is difficult to see why that question was put to the Minister for Finance, and it is news to the Minister for Finance to hear that the <Col N="139" /> writ of Dáil Éireann runs in Belfast, and that Dáil Éireann is responsible for the pogroms and the sacking of Belfast.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. M. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Boycott was worked it would have done it.  Madame Markievicz:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  To ask the Minister for Finance how much was spent in salaries during the last week, in all Dáil Departments, and how many of the Dáil employees are now working in the City Hall?  How many of the Dáil Eireann employees have been dismissed?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is £475 17s. 7d.; that is for the sixteen Departments of Dáil Eireann.  The answer to the second part is: there are three Dáil Eireann employees working in the City Hall, two in the Labour Departments and one in the Local Government Department.  As head of one Department I have no means of telling how many Dáil employees have been dismissed.  So far as my knowledge goes the dismissals occurred through the cessation of the Belfast Boycott. If there were any others it was through incompetence, and there should have been a good many such.</P>
      <P>Mr. Joseph MacDonagh&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  To ask the Minister for Finance what provision is being made by the Dáil Cabinet for the officials whose services, in connection with the Belfast Boycott, are no longer required?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The answer is: it was decided at a meeting of the Ministry held on the 27th January that the staff should receive three months' salary in lieu of notice. Mr. Joseph MacDonagh:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  To ask the Minister for Finance did he consider he was justified in coming to an agreement with Sir James Craig to terminate the Belfast Boycott in view of the barbarities practised by the pogromists, and the complete absence of compensation or reinstatement of Catholics up to the date of the agreement, and does he now consider that Sir James Craig has not fulfilled his part of the agreement?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance of Dáil Éireann came to no agreement with Sir James Craig.  And if a question is to be addressed regarding that agreement it is to be addressed to the Chairman of the Provisional Government.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Defence whether there is any other military force in Ireland under Irish authority except the Irish Republican Army?  Is the Provisional Government exercising any authority, direct or indirect, over any part of the Irish Republican Army?  Is there any connection, direct or indirect, between the Provisional Government and the I.R.A.?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To part one and two of this question the answer is in the negative.  As regards part three&mdash;there is this connection between the Republican Army and the Provisional Government: We have arranged with the Provisional Government to occupy for them all evacuated military and police posts for the purpose of their maintenance and safeguarding.  Expense entailed by such occupation is charged to the Provisional Government.  The Provisional Government is given an assurance that troops occupying such posts shall not use their power to interfere with the expression of the people's will at the pending General Election, and will not turn their arms against any Government elected by the people at that election. On the earlier portion of the reply, that is, with regard to the military forces in Ireland under Irish authority, lest from that portion of the reply it might be thought that there was any authority for such grave interference with the public as has recently taken place in South Tipperary in the shape of the imposition of forced levies and the seizing of private property, I think it well to say that there has been in this area indiscipline on the part of certain senior officers, resulting in the fact that portion of our forces there have not been effectively under control of the G.H.Q.  To a smaller extent there has been similar indiscipline in Limerick City.  Steps have been taken to right matters in both areas.</P>

As I have said, I do not pay very much attention to what is said by British politicians in the British House of Parliament but, unfortunately, the people of Ireland do and are too often deceived by what is said there.  Now, as a supplementary question I put this to the Minister of Defence&mdash;whether he is aware the following statement appeared in the Dublin newspapers yesterday, and I ask him what amount of truth, if any, is contained in certain underlined parts of this.  This is the thing that was in the papers:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sir W. Davison: What means have the Provisional Government for protecting these stores?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" />&ldquo;Mr. Churchill: That is unworthy. The so-called I.R.A. is under the orders and obeys the orders of the Provisional Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir J. Butcher: Some of it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Churchill: In almost every County in Ireland they are strictly obeying the orders of that Government. The Minister of Defence of Dáil Eireann is also Minister of Defence in the Provisional Government, and it is through him that authority is exercised upon this Army.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Is the Provisional Government exercising any authority, direct or indirect, over any part of the Irish Republican Army?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  Personally, I have not seen what Mr. Churchill says about us, and a lot of us are too busy at the present moment to pay very much attention to it; and I certainly have not the slightest sympathy with anybody in Ireland who pays more attention to what Mr. Churchill says about me and knows of me than to the knowledge they have of me from my association with them.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he has taken into his service a Mr. McCarron, and made him Private Secretary and Liaison Officer between the Department of Local Government and the British Local Government Board?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have not taken him into my service, as Minister of the Local Government Board.  Mr. McCarron is still on the pay roll of the Local Government Board. There is only one Local Government Board or Department.  If the people had time to look at the note-paper sent out by Dáil Eireann they would have learned that, up to this, Mr. McCarron is still on the pay roll of the Government Board.  His services are being availed of by me in my capacity as member of the Provisional Government in the office of the Local Government Minister in the City Hall.  He is acting under my direction and with my authority in all matters affecting all functions of the Local Government Board in such activities as were not dealt with by the Local Government Department in the pre-Truce period.</P>
      <P>Mr. Joseph MacDonagh:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that Mr. McCarron was one of a number of officials in the British Local Government Board who, during the European war attested under the Derby Scheme and was subsequently declared indispensable to the office by Sir Henry Robinson, the object of the combined move being to inveigle less favoured members of the staff into the British Army?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Well, I was never in the British Army and I do not know what the arrangements are.  I am not aware of any officials who attested, and I have no information concerning Mr. McCarron attesting.  I have not the advantage of being in Sir Henry Robinson's confidence and, consequently, I am unable to say what he might have done in 1914, 1915 or 1916.  I met Sir Henry Robinson on the day that we took over the Local Government Board and the other Boards.  I have not met him since.</P>
      <P>Mr. Joseph MacDonagh (North Tipperary):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government whether it is a fact that Mr. McCarron offered his services to the British military in Drogbeda during Easter Week?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot say whether it is a fact.  I was not in Drogheda during Easter Week.</P>
      <P>Mr. Joseph MacDonagh (North Tipperary):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that this Mr. McCarron is the auditor who surcharged the Bal rothery Board of Guardians for paying salaries to Dr. Richard Hayes, T.D., after the return of the later from prison in England, which surcharge led to the seizure by the R.I.C., and sale of property of certain Guardians, including the Chairman, Miss Adrien?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> I am aware that Mr. McCarron is the officer who surcharged the payment of Doctor Hayes' salary.  In this case my recollection is that Miss Adrien was not the Chairman.  I am aware that the Chairman paid eight pounds, nine pounds or ten pounds&mdash;his quota; that Miss Adrien's sewing machines were seized, not by the R.I.C. but by the military; and that a valuable piano, the property of Mr. Frank Lawless, was seized and taken away and sold in England, and that he did not get back the difference between the amount surcharged and the cost of the piano.  I note the fact that Mr. Lawless' loss, which was considerably the greatest, is not mentioned in the question.  I suppose it is because he voted for the Treaty.  I consulted Doctor Hayes about making this appointment.  I also consulted the Lord Mayor.  Doctor Hayes said he had no objection.</P>

As a matter of fact, in accordance with the terms of our Trusteeship we might have made that arrangement ourselves. The only reason for bringing it before the Dáil is&mdash;there is a certain amount of danger attached to the course &mdash;under the present circumstances it is advisable to prevent misunderstandings and things of that kind.

      <NameTxt>MR. M. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give my chief reason for supporting it. It is that as long as the accounts are in various names they will really be at the command rather of individuals who are responsible for these monies than at the command of the Dáil.  In the past, when how to safeguard our monies was a very serious matter, this device had to be resorted to.  We had to get names of stable and unstable people.  Sometimes the more unstable they were the better. It will be seen there might be great danger that a person, simply because the money was in his or her name, would consider whether that money could be realised.  That is the principal safeguard in this matter.  Of course, we understand that from every point of view it is perfectly safe now in any Bank in the names of the Trustees owing to the circumstances&mdash;to put it briefly, owing to the signing of the Treaty&mdash; that there is no longer the danger of Banks having their offices raided and seized and closed up because they are doing business with an illegal body.  The other reason that makes me in favour of the motion is, it may be said that the Trustees have a majority on the other side, but I for one do not anticipate any difficulty owing to that majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. DAVID CEANNT:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one slight technical omission I would like to have inserted.  The reason is because we hear so much about the different Governments or supposed Governments in this country.  I want it made clear that it be decreed by Dáil Eireann.  I want that put in the original.  Now, a Chinn Chomhairle, there is, at the present time, a considerable amount of land evacuated by enemy forces which was formerly the property of the people of Ireland.  During the next few weeks there will be a considerable addition to that.  And now that the enemy forces are after evacuating it it is our duty to see that such land will, if not wanted for the training of the I.R.A., be divided up into economic holdings and parcelled out to landless men.  We have at the present time, throughout the whole country, a tremendous amount of unemployment. We have, in the agricultural industry, a lot of land going out of tillage on account of the exceedingly bad year through which the farmers have gone. Agriculture is down to a very low level with the result that thousands of men are out of employment, and we have now at our disposal one means.  It may be a small beginning, but a small beginning that may lead to big results later on. Now that we have a chance, it is our first duty to the people of Ireland and to the unemployed and landless men to fulfil any promise which we made them in the past that we would, at the first opportunity that would be offered us, do what lay in our power to put as many back on the land as we possibly could.  Now, if we commence when we have this opportunity, even in a small way, later on we hope to see all the big places&mdash;the grazing ranches, the big estates, perhaps&mdash;purchased to be parcelled out into economic holdings for the people, so that the people of Ireland will have the right to live and thrive in the land which is their right.  I know of places where there is a considerable quantity of land that has been evacuated.  I know of one place where there is a thousand acres of valuable grazing and tillage land.  Fifty acres of that have been under tillage for the past year by the military forces of England. There is a considerable amount of machinery there.  I am sure what is the case in my part of the country is the case all over Ireland.  And if we take the opportunity now of dividing up this land we should, at least, parcel it out into economic holdings of fifty or sixty acres in each place, and I am sure in that way we could make provision for several families throughout Ireland.  I want to make myself perfectly clear that in giving the land to landless men, preference should be given to active members of the I.R.A. who, during the trying times of the last two or three years, have given their services to the country, and have brought us into the position that we now hold of being here in this House as Ministers of the Government which they helped to do by their exertions and sacrifices and by their lives. These men and their dependents are entitled to anything that we can do for them.  These men came out, not for any pecuniary gain, but for love of country. And the first duty of a nation should be to the soldiers who fought for them. These men were out night and day, left their homes and families without fee or reward.  Some of them and their dependents are in a very necessitous way. Some of them have not the necessaries of life.  They are depending on their neighbours, and it would be a crying shame if we did not do what we possibly could to recompense them, and to show that we appreciate the services and the sacrifices they made.  This is a small beginning which might lead to great things.  Let us show that we mean what we have always been preaching about, that we will now give expression to those opinions, that we will do what we possibly can to relieve unemployment to as great an extent as we possibly can, and that we commence it now.  And <Col N="145" /> therefore I move that it be decreed by Dáil Eireann that all lands which were in the occupation of enemy forces in Ireland and which have now been evacuated, except those which may be retained as necessary training grounds for the I.R.A. be divided up into economic holdings and distributed among landless men, and that preference be given to those men or dependents of those men who have been active members of the I.R.A. prior to the Truce, July, 1921.</P>

      <P>As far as I understand this question, I take it that it fits in more with agricultural policy than anything else; and I think it would be only a very small fraction of what would be the general policy of getting the land into the hands of the people, or the general policy of saying that those people who fought as soldiers during the war would get proper consideration in the division of such land.  I would like to have it understood first and foremost that at the present moment we have no knowledge of the amount of land that will be transferred to us in this particular way.  We have no definite knowledge as to the ownership of those lands&mdash;whether they belong to the Government or whether they belong to private individuals, that is whether the British forces in Ireland who occupied these lands rented them or had them on lease from any person; and I feel that the motion is premature and that even the passing of this motion here could not be very effective in getting what Deputy Ceannt really wants, that is, to get land for men who fought in the war.  I think we ought to hear what the Minister for Agriculture has to say on the matter.  I feel that it is premature at the moment to pass that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MR. PATRICK HOGAN MR. PATRICK HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>MR. PATRICK HOGAN:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a difficulty because I do not know exactly to what land the Deputy refers.  There are certain lands, such as Freemount Farm, evacuated by the British troops and handed over to the Provisional Government, and which, I presume to be in the occupation of the I.R.A. under the conditions which the Minister of Defence has explained to the House in answer to the previous question.  And I should say that the first thing we should have to consider is this: Whether the tents and the lands attached to them would be wanted by the Army.  That is the first thing we have to consider.  And we can't consider that until we know what lands are in question.  Secondly, if there is a balance of lands over after the needs of the Army are supplied, that is a matter for the Provisional Government. These lands were handed over to them and I can assure Deputy Ceannt and the other Deputies who have spoken that we are absolutely alive to the need for the completion of Land Purchase.  We realise that that has got to be done immediately.  But to me immediately is conditioned by the fact of which you are all aware&mdash;that to complete Land Purchase you have got to have legislation, and carefully thought out legislation, much more careful legislation than in the motion.  Besides legislation you want finance, and consistent with having these matters thought out, I quite agree with Deputy Ceannt and the other Deputies who have spoken that Land Purchase must be completed.  I want to make it clear that these lands, or the portions that will be available after the Army has been supplied, are handed over to the Provisional Government and must be dealt with by the Provisional Government; and it is only the Irish Free State, if and when it comes into existence, or some Government that has control of the finances of the country, that can properly and adequately complete Land Purchase. In the meantime we are doing what we <Col N="146" /> can to divide the lands that are in the Dáil Departments.  And I may say in this connection there are about six thousand acres of land in the hands of the Dáil Departments and one way or another, in the Land Bank or directly under the Dáil Departments; and those six thousand acres are now about two years lying practically undivided, with some of it paid for and some of it paid for in part.  On practically the whole of that six thousand acres the poor men are now practically broken for the very simple reason that to finance those schemes the poorer tenants and the poorer landless men had to go to the Banks and borrow money at six per cent.  In the County Mayo I am dealing at the present moment with a very big area of land which was purchased under the Land Bank scheme.  The poorer men had tried to get the money for a fourth of the deposit in the local Bank; and they got a certain amount and they were unable to get the rest.  The result was that the men who should not get land under the State Bank or Land Bank scheme had to get land because they were the only people who had the money.  And we were faced with a dilemma, that for the last two years the people who had paid the money were not entitled to the land, and that those who were entitled to the land hadn't the money to pay for it.  That was the dilemma we were up against. And I sent down Inspectors to survey the whole situation and to try and find a way out; and I would ask every Deputy here who is interested to find some way for me.  The only way that would please the poor tenants is to set the lands largely for grazing.  We were in the position that the poorer men could not find the money.  The Land Bank could not afford to let them off.  And they could not find the deposits.  We have either to divide the lands and leave out the poorer men, the poorer tenants, or put off the whole scheme for a year until we would have a Government of our own to clear up the mess and finance it.  There is no use tinkering with this question.  The settlement of the land question is an absolute necessity, and the settlement or completion of Land Purchase is the way to increased tillage.  The right way to increase tillage would be by men on the land whose interest it would be to till. It is the economic way also.  I am surprised to find any men here talking about tillage at this hour of the day.  The breaking up of new lea land after January is absurd.  It is merely producing a minimum of food at an absolutely maximum amount of cost.  The labourer who gets &ldquo;conacre&rdquo; in the middle of January to produce food is producing food at a cost of fifty per cent. more than he can buy it.  Breaking up new land in the middle of January is bad farming.  Now, that is as far as tillage is concerned.  But to come back to Land Purchase.  I have shown you the dilemma in which we found ourselves trying to put Land Purchase through without finance, and that is the fact of it.  And that case is only typical.  Just face the problem squarely: How can landless men go on land and make it a paying proposition and live on it after borrowing the money at six or seven per cent.?  There is no use pretending; it can only be done by the Government who has control of the finances of the country, and who has the credit to borrow the large sums that we are not in a position to borrow at present.  In so far as lands can be divided, there were about six thousand acres of land came under my jurisdiction. Some of it can't be divided&mdash;that is the long and the short of it.  We must put it off until some Government clears up the mess and produces the finance. With regard to the lands that can be divided, I have already borrowed Inspectors from the Irish Land Commission whom we control now, and they are dividing the balance of the lands that are lying there for the last two or three years, and set for grazing.  I have a list here in my pocket which I got from the Land Commission of at least ten cases of large areas of land in the hands of local landless men for the last three years on which there has not been one perch of tillage done.  Any farmer will know and understand that; there are Deputies here who don't realise it.  You can't do tillage&mdash;I am not now speaking of tillage in the way a Scotchman or a large English farmer does it, but in the way it is done by the small farmer here&mdash;you can't do tillage properly unless you have your cows and your horses and farmyard on the land.  The question of transit comes into it.  It won't pay.  You will have to cart the manure; you can't have the requisite amount of manure.  Tillage never pays much, and never pays at all except when worked by small men on the holdings.  I am speaking of tillage under Irish conditions, not American conditions, <Col N="147" /> where they can do things on a large scale.  But that is the fact about Irish conditions.  Now, that is what I have to say about Land Purchase. The first question is what the Army wants; after that it is a question for the Agricultural Department of whatever Government is in being to deal with the rest of it; and I can assure Mr. Ceannt that we are absolutely alive to the fact that Land Purchase must be completed by two means&mdash;finance and legislation.</P>

      <P>I am supporting the motion introduced by the Deputy from Cork, Mr. Ceannt, for the reason that it is an attempt&mdash;not upon a very ambitious scale&mdash;to deal with one of the most urgent problems in the country at the time.  It is: what is going to be done with landless men? We have heard a lot in this House about establishing law and order.  The most productive agent of disorder is starvation, and the labourers in the country are practically upon the verge of starvation. It is all very well to say that if you break up land now the man who goes in to work at it will have fifty per cent. added to the maximum of labour needed for land broken up in the early winter.  He can't produce anything in the way of food until he has the land, and he can't buy until he has the money.  I would like that the Government would go much further into this matter.  It is only tinkering with the matter to introduce a motion of this kind, because it only touches the fringe.  I think it would be a great practical benefit if the Dáil now established a commission to enquire into the position of these labourers in agricultural districts; and to see if they cannot devise some practical way of affording them relief; and they ought to provide them with a practical means of making a livelihood for themselves.  I think if the Minister for Agriculture, instead of relating all the mistakes that were made in the agricultural policy of the Dáil, made entirely under the direction of the present Minister for Finance and the present President, he ought to tell us what he intends to do in the future, and I suggest that one of the most practical things he could do in the future would be to set up a commission such as I have outlined.</P>

      <P>The economic condition in the country, as Deputy MacEntee said, is very grave.  At the last Session of An Dáil we received a Labour deputation the spokesman of which stated there were one hundred and thirty thousand people out of employment up and down the country.  That is a fact that cannot be waived.  And the economic condition of the country, was, I venture to say, a big factor, if not a deciding factor, in many minds in the big decision come to at the last Session of Dáil Eireann.  I have letters daily from people in the West speaking of starvation&mdash;some of them unfortunately, native speaking people.  As to how that should be tackled is another matter. Tackling it by tillage in the late spring cannot be done.  Tackling it by schemes of road repairing, by drainage schemes, by Housing schemes is, perhaps, a possibility, if a Parliament with financial and with legislative powers is set up in Ireland. But to ask the people to plough up now at this time of the year lea ground, and produce a crop from it, is not a business proposition, and is not a proposition that would commend itself to a man who knows anything about agriculture.</P>

The country needs settled Government, and a Parliament that can legislate.

This question of Land Purchase is a very big question, and it would be the first duty of the new Government to deal with it.  It would want the whole finances of the country to deal with the question properly.  There is no use in taking up patch-work schemes.  The whole question must be tackled.  But it is worse than useless to appoint a commission. These commissions, in the old times, were meant to shelve questions.  Whenever the English wanted to shelve a question they appointed a commission.  The T.D. for Monaghan, Deputy MacEntee, enunciated a strange theory.  He said if you had land you could raise crops, but if you had not the money you could not buy food.  How, I ask, can a man build houses on his land and buy seeds if he has no money to help him to carry on his farming?  This question must be dealt with by the State.  The State must have the whole finances of the country at its disposal to deal with this question properly, and when the new Government is established in a few months, it must be taken up as a national question.  There is plenty of room for every man in Ireland, and it is only just that the question should be dealt with properly.  There is no use in this patch-work business at all.</P>

      <P>I support this motion as proposed by the Deputy from Cork.  This thing is not as big as the question mentioned by the Deputy for Connemara.  It is a small matter acquiring patches of land here and there adjacent to the towns.  There is a lot of talk about questions of Spring tillage It is a question of soil.  I know lands in my area should be ploughed in the Autumn if they were to be of any use or any way prepared for tillage in the Spring.  But there are light lands; and some good could be done even if acquired now for potato sowing or for oats.  It is a different question.  But the trend of the argument, as I find it, on the Ministerial bench is to prove that Dáil Eireann is helpless.  The work done by Dáil Eireann in the past I call great work under the circumstances; and a lot of you would agree that it was great work to acquire land under the Land Act system.  And now the Minister of Agriculture throws a bucket of cold water on it.  I am sorry that the ex-Minister is not present.  I have a question addressed to the Minister which will be on the paper to-morrow.  It will re-open this question, and I hope the Minister will be present.  But there is a small matter that I am interested in now.  There is a sale to-day at three o'clock of twenty-three acres of land adjacent to the town of Gorey, and some two months ago, when this sale was announced, we took action to acquire the land, and the District Council will grant its credit to acquire the land.  I went to the offices of the Local Government Board of Dáil Eireann and saw the Assistant Minister. The local Bank is giving us the loan at five per cent. for thirty-five years, and all they want is the sanction of Dáil Eireann.  The Bank asks the sanction of Dáil Eireann to this loan; and I want an answer now from the Minister for Local Government.  I have got two telegrams now to the Minister for Local Government and I want the sanction sent down so that we will have it in time at three o'clock.  That is the way we go about acquiring land, and this land is a paying proposition.</P>

      <P>The fisheries would be a paying proposition, too.  You want to throw cold water on Mr. Barton's Bank scheme that the Minister for Finance said was the greatest thing in Ireland, and that no matter what we could do in the future, it would live.  You may say it is necessary to have a Free State established&mdash;this is not a question of the Free State.  The land is wanted now and there is no reason why it cannot be obtained.  If there is no <Col N="149" /> finance it could be obtained through the local Councils as we find in Gorey and all we need from you is the sanction of Dáil Éireann; I think that could be obtained.  You will not be asked to pay.  The ratepayers will be willing to pay it; and they are not looking to any other body in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister of Defence and the Minister of Agriculture say it would require an amount of money to take over these lands.  These lands that are to be vacated are the lands of the people of Ireland no matter what Government is in power.  On these lands there are a certain amount of buildings. On some of them there is a considerable amount of tillage; and they are ploughed and fit for cultivation.  It would be a very easy matter for the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Agriculture to decide this.  Even within the next few weeks the Minister for Defence could find out what amount of land he will require for training purposes for the I.R.A., and then he could see what amount is available for distribution. The buildings are on the place already. The people of Ireland will eventually have to find the money, and it is only shelving the thing to put it back.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. M. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Five times you have spoken now.  The most important question for the nation is evacuation. If these lands are not evacuated who will divide them?  I want to put these things on a perfectly logical basis as far as I can.  But I am not going to allow people to get away with a motion like this who, on principle, are against evacuation, and then want to pose to the workers here as the people who want to divide up these lands.  Now, the amendment I am going to move is this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the matter of utilising the lands evacuated by the British forces in Ireland under the terms of the Treaty be considered at the earliest possible moment, and that special consideration be given to the question as to whether they may not be distributed amongst landless men, <Col N="150" /> preference being given to those men, or the dependents of those men, who have been in active military service of the I.R.A. prior to the Truce of 1921.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can promise on behalf of the Provisional Government that, as soon as the land that is required for Army and Police purposes is definitely allotted, that the remaining portion of the land could be divided immediately; for under that division no question of finance would arise.  These lands will be taken over from the English as part of the general settlement.  The moment allocation is made for national purposes the residue of the land could be divided at once.  But I say here now that the minority of the Dáil, who are against the basis on which this resolution rests, must not be allowed to put themselves before the country as people who are interested in putting men back on the land.  We are all interested in Land Purchase, and it is a matter in which the Provisional Government has the greatest concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. M. COLLINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Half of you do not like to hear the truth.  We are all interested in Land Purchase, and it is one of the matters that has been giving the Provisional Government the greatest concern; and it is not a simple question. At present Dáil Éireann has lands at its disposal.  Why is there not a motion that these lands should be divided?  Is it not more practicable to divide lands which we own ourselves than lands which we do not own?  Now, these lands will revert to Ireland, but only under the terms of the Treaty, which you and your friends are trying to smash.  It is only on these terms these lands will revert to Ireland.  Why not divide the lands which we already have, and which have been purchased by the National Land Bank?  Deputy Etchingham referred to people who are trying to cast discredit upon the working of the Land Bank.  I do not know of any such people.  The work of the Land Bank has been as good as it could be in the circumstances, and everybody, and nobody sooner than the originator of the Land Bank, Mr. Barton himself, will agree that it only just reddened the surface, and that it only dealt with the thing in the smallest possible way.  It will need ever so many millions to deal with the Land Schemes in Ireland.  And all these schemes&mdash;drainage and reclamation will cost many millions.  That is not the point of this motion.  The point of it must be put clearly.  If the mover had put in after the word &ldquo;evacuated&rdquo; the words &ldquo;Occupation of enemy forces which have now been evacuated in accordance with the terms of the Treaty,&rdquo; nobody could find very much fault with it.  But these words are left out, and left out for the purpose of discrediting the people who are upholding the Treaty.</P>

      <P>Well, I am speaking on the amendment.  The resources of the Land Bank are too small.  We have two thousand or three thousand acres down in our part of the country. The men who were getting the land were men who could only turn up with a quarter of the price of the land.  We had, on the one hand, people who had money and were not entitled to the land. We got them to hold the land until such time as we had a Government with sufficient resources to come to the assistance of the poor men.  In our present circumstances, without a recognised Government, and with very limited credit, we are not going to have the resources to take over this responsibility. We can only have it with a recognised Government that could furnish fifty or sixty millions for the scheme.  There is one suggestion that should be acted on at once, and that is&mdash;as in Denmark, we should insist that people who put in claims for land should have an agricultural education.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this amendment, and I do so because our resources at present are not sufficient to take over much land, or, indeed, any land.

At present it is hopeless to try to do anything with the land question.</P>

      <P>As Director of the National Land Bank I should like to make a short reference to the remarks of the speaker who has just sat down.  I do not think it fair to make a rather vague, general&mdash;I do not say charge&mdash;but a statement implying something of having wrongly selected tenants in occupation of land.  I do not think there is any ground whatever for that statement.  Our own organisers and servants have taken the utmost care in every case to have the societies which have been formed formed carefully, and to have proper people coming under the scheme; I do not think it right that the remarks made by the previous speaker should pass unchallenged, especially as they have not been supported by any evidence whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. ROBERT BARTON:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the question of the Land Bank has been raised, I think it would be advisable for me to say what has been done.  First of all, I would like to say that I sympathise with the Minister for Agriculture in asking for further time and thorough investigation before any fresh schemes for Land Purchase are taken up by the Dáil.  I sympathise with him in the magnitude of the task he is taking on his shoulders.  I also agree with him that the land question has only been scratched on the surface.  But the scratching has been very effective, as I think I will show you.  Now, the Land Bank has loaned three hundred and seventy thousand pounds for the purchase of land.  That is the approximate figure for the purchase of sixteen thousand five hundred acres of land, or an average of about twenty-three pounds per statute acre.  I don't think that any Deputy could consider that that price was an excessively high price.  It has farmed some thirty-nine estates and purchased fifty-three estates; and the Societies have an approximate membership of eight hundred and fifty-three. Of the Societies that have been formed sixteen have actually divided the land, amounting to, approximately, three thousand one hundred acres; in the case <Col N="153" /> of eight Societies the land is in process of division, amounting to three thousand seven hundred and fifty acres; and in the case of six societies preliminary steps towards the sub-division have been taken, amounting to two thousand two hundred and twenty acres; and there are nine Societies remaining in which the land has not been vet sub-divided.  I may say that the experience which the Land Bank has gained during these operations is at the disposal of the Minister of Agriculture and of the nation; and the staff at the Bank, at any time and every time, will assist the nation with that experience which it has gained in the past.  Before I sit down I would remind the House that the Land Bank was instrumental in purchasing practically the whole of this land, and the occupiers of about one hundred houses in one town have become the actual owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. WILLIAM SEARS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the scheme of the National Land Bank worked admirably in the counties where the people were able to put down the money.  But in the West of Ireland they were not able to do that.  And in several cases where the Land Bank scheme was put into operation it has led to great difficulties and trouble.  The Minister of Agriculture referred to a case in Mayo.  The National Land Bank sent down Inspectors, and invited the people to take shares.  There were a large number of people around the village who were badly in need of land. And they took shares and promised to find the money, but were unable to find the money.  But there also came into the scheme a number of people with plenty of money.  And where the poor people were unable to finance, the rich people absorbed all those plots.  So that what was taking place was a perpetuation, on a large scale, of the old system. And the poor people were left outside, and the people who had land already were made richer than before.  The statement made by the Minister of Agriculture about the scheme of Land Purchase will be the best piece of reading furnished by this Dáil to the people of the West of Ireland.  The position in which they are situated is a very tragic and a very sad one.</P>

      <P>I say, therefore, that if this resolution is carried you will be tinkering with a very serious and tragic question.  This is not a case of finding tenants for a few park fields.  It is finding land for thousands of people who are in a desperate condition. Another year or half-year of the Terror would have brought ruin and bank ruptcy to nearly every farmer to the West of the Shannon.  They had the rates up last year as large as the rents; and not only would the farmers be in the Bankruptcy Courts, but every town in the West of Ireland.  I always thought it a terrible disgrace to Ireland that an army of eight or nine thousand men, all harvesters skilled in farming, had to go across to England to help to reap the English harvest.  These may have eight or nine acres of land; I often heard of people, able-bodied men with large families, hungry for land; I often heard them say they could stretch from one hand to the other across their whole little farm.  The statement of the Minister of Agriculture that something should be done with the land question, will certainly bring home the matter to the Congested Districts Board.  The Congested Districts Board have districts in hands for the last twenty years, and, strange to say, they have in their possession for eleven, twelve and fifteen years, large tracts of land; and on the verge of those farms are people almost on the verge of starvation.  And yet nothing has been done to divide up those ranches.  They were very glad, therefore, to see that, under the Treaty, our people have got possesion of the Congested Districts Board.  And I hope they will make use of it to divide up those lands.  Now, take the case of a man out of employment.  I know bogs in Mayo, regular storehouses of fuel; and the Congested Districts Board were written to and asked why were not those bogs made accessible to the people, who were famished for fuel.  Their reply was those bogs were not drained or roads made through them.  Here you have people hungry for employment, and work to do; and you have people looking for land who had tracts of land&mdash; not a few park fields&mdash;and the people huddled into little farms, little houses and little villages.  I think nothing <Col N="154" /> should be done until people get the finances to finance the scheme that would settle the Congested Districts Board, and complete Land Purchase.</P>

      <P>I think we are straying from the question on the paper&mdash;from the motion and the amendment.  We all know the momentous problem that is thundering at our doors here.  And it is the question generally all over Ireland. This is but the fringe of the subject, and in dealing with this fringe it behoves us who are responsible to take effective steps, and to make sure that we proceed upon the right road.  We don't know&mdash;any of us&mdash;how much land is involved in the motion the Deputy from Cork put down here.  It may be much and it may be little.  We know that it is not a case of making the occupiers of land, owners.  There is no necessity to introduce the question of funds.  We want to examine the question as to how this land comes to us&mdash;whether as judicial tenants, or whether as land purchased out, or land already vested.  We want to know under which of these conditions it arrives under our control? And when we have this ascertained we should decide carefully how we are to proceed with regard to the allotment or partition of this land which will be at our disposal.  Now, I think this is too hasty&mdash;we should not rush at once to do this.  Because it involves serious issues. And it involves very careful thinking out on the part of the people who feel any responsibility to Ireland.  In this matter I would, therefore, suggest that the House should agree to the amendment of the Minister of Finance that the matter stand adjourned until they have ascertained on a proper foundation what are the equities in the matter, and what are the best methods of proceeding.  If you adopt any other course you are only going to create a precedent that will be ruinous, and disastrous to the whole land question when it comes up for settle-hereafter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Dáil the Provisional Government should, in dealing with lands which were in the occupation of enemy forces in Ireland, and which have now been, or are being, evacuated under the terms of the Treaty, excepting those that may be retained as necessary training grounds by the Army and Police, give special consideration to the question whether those lands may not be distributed among landless men, preference being given to those who were active members of the I.R.A. previous to the Truce before July, 1921.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Milroy I wish to say that I do not know much about the details of agriculture, but this is a bill that appeals to us all.  He first spoke about implications in this motion; and he suggested that the motion is dishonest; and that it is aimed at stopping evacuation and making an end of the agreement made at the Ard-Fheis.  With regard to that agreement a rather interesting point has been put to me.  While it was a defeat for the Irish Republican Party, who had a majority at the Ard-Fheis, it was a victory for Ireland.  If that is so, that is exactly what we aim at&mdash;that Ireland should be the victor no matter what party suffers.  That is why I get up to speak to that motion.  It seems to me that those who are opposing it are making a very big mistake for their own party.  If they are out to defeat us and pass the Treaty how do they think that they can get it better&mdash;get more support &mdash;than by taking over that land handed over to them by England and using it for the good of Ireland?  The land is in their control.  The Minister for Agriculture who is responsible to Dáil Eireann, has a dual capacity.  As Minister of the Provisional Government he is one of the Ministers who have control <Col N="156" /> of that land.  Why cannot he and those acting with him&mdash;the Ministry of Dáil Eireann&mdash;get together.  The Minister of Defence will tell them inside a week how much land he will want for the soldiers, and he can rent the rest of it to the people of Ireland who badly want it. It can be done, and it is perfectly absurd to say it cannot be done.  It can be done if they will only look on this as Irishmen first and Treatyists after&mdash;if they will look upon themselves as bound to take every inch that the enemy has evacuated, and not wait to see whether the enemy is going to get final victory or not.</P>

In its effect, so far as the Irish people and the landless men are concerned, it leads to pretty much the same point.  But there is, beneath the surface an important principle, and it is this: that this land is being handed over to the Provisional Government consequent and by virtue of the Treaty.  And as one member of the Provisional Government, as I have said, I have the strongest possible objection to doing things that are consequential on and to answering for my conduct in things which are consequential on, and by virtue of, the Treaty, to people whose declared policy, from their weekly platforms and by their Press, is to put that Treaty in the fire.</P>

      <P>You may know more about it than I do; and that remark is uncalled for.  I want to say this&mdash;anyone who respects the Dáil should not allow a decree of that kind to pass; it is unworthy of a business assembly which goes about its business in a businesslike way.  Now, the amendment gets over all that difficulty.  Miss MacSwiney says that the land should be divided and can be divided, and I absolutely agree.  And, as we seem to be at one in the object in view, I wish to point out that you cannot do that by a decree and that, if you do, you are doing something that is really particularly futile.</P>

      <P>And it is not on our side.  The agreement mentioned to-day is that Dáil Eireann continue to function, and that the Cabinet need not be afraid of being thrown out by an adverse vote here; and one reason I had in my mind was that matters should be discussed here on their merits and not on Party lines.  The Deputy, evidently, coming from an area where certain lands had been evacuated, felt that there was need that these lands should be divided, and brought forward the motion which has been dealt with for the sake of advertisement. Speeches have been made that were fit for the hustings and not for the Dáil here.  If the other side want to have the credit of having this motion I do not see why anybody on this side should want to stop them.  So long as it is done I don't care who has the credit of having it done.  The question has been raised here.  We are a minority in the Dáil and, as I have said time after time, we want to see that Ireland is not tricked again.  As I often quoted here before, there is an Irish proverb which says: &ldquo;Pitiable are those who do wrong and are poor after doing it.&rdquo;  We, at least, try to take no advantages which are not for the good of the people of Ireland.  This is a matter that would not have raised any difficulty about Executive action in the old Dáil here. It is a simple principle.  That is to legalise the transfer of these lands from their present position through the Agricultural Department, so that they might be divided there.  That is all I take it in essence; and that a direction be given that they be divided up amongst landless men who have been active members of the I.R.A.; and if there is anybody who is objecting to it on principle I have not heard of it.  The Cabinet would take the ordinary course as to what were the steps necessary.  It is for the members here to decree that certain action be taken.  And it is for the Cabinet to carry it out.  Putting it into the terms of the amendment seems to me ridiculous and unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Looseness of thought and looseness of expression is at the bottom of all this business. I spoke on the motion at first, and now I want to say a word on the amendment. I do not question that this motion is put forward in the very simple intention that Mr. de Valera speaks of, but it is unfortunate that a motion put forward in that simple intention would not be carefully and properly worded, considering it is put before this meeting here as a decree of Dáil Eireann.  And if there are lands in the neighbourhood of Fermoy and around there, some of which have been prepared for tillage by the military, and if there are lands there that want to be attended to why should they not be attended to by reference to the Ministry here instead of bringing in a regular decree affecting such lands in the country&mdash;and affecting them and proposing to assign ownership to them without finding out or having an idea as to who the owners are at the present time, and what is the amount of land involved, and as to whether any of these lands would not be more suitable for industrial than agricultural purposes.  I disagree with the introduction of the reference to the Provisional Government in the amendment which goes forward, because I think, also, that that is unnecessary. The resolution or amendment which would get rid of that very objectionable thing that is in the amendment, is one that ought to be passed from this meeting here, and I am perfectly sure it would satisfy Deputy Ceannt as well as his own.  But except we can deal with <Col N="159" /> things systematically and clearly, and except we can get rid of useless talk about the Provisional Government, I do not see how we are to get any work done here at all.  I think, Mr. Chairman, you should tackle that word &ldquo;Provisional Government&rdquo; from the point of the Standing Orders, and see if some kind of phraseology will not be introduced and made incumbent on the House that would avoid mentioning it.</P>

      <P>What seems to me to be wrong with this proposal is that it is not in form.  If it had been a resolution of instruction to the Cabinet to take this matter into consideration it would be all right.  But I certainly say that a law of this kind should not be passed.  And I say in the Dáil now that in the old time that a resolution of that kind was not passed, and the person who brought it forward was instructed to put it into regular form.  Apart from the amendment, what would seem to me to be the proper thing would be to postpone it and have it put into form so that it could be passed as law.  Either that or convert it into an instruction to the Cabinet to go into the matter.  I certainly think in the old Dáil there was a general consent that, in the form in which that is at the present time, it would be regarded as not in a proper form to be passed.</P>

      <P>I think that the attitude of the Government in regard to this motion is very much similar to that of those people who used to say, centuries ago, that nothing good could come out of Nazareth.  They have admitted that the object of the motion is praiseworthy.  They have got up here and some of them said so.  I think it was the gentleman who said on one occasion that he would have to look for principle with a microscope who now opposes this motion on the ground of principle.  There is a principle in the motion, and that principle is that the land of Ireland belongs to the people of Ireland, and that those who fought for that land should have it now after it is evacuated by the enemy forces of Ireland. I am sure that there is no person on the side of the Government who would refuse to assent to the motion because the land may not come into their hands, or because they are not certain how the land is going to come into their hands. We do not want them to do anything dishonest, and certainly we all pre-suppose that the land has come honestly into their possession&mdash;it doesn't matter by what machinery&mdash;and the thing we ask them to do is, having the land, that they should proceed to divide it up amongst the people who are in sore need of it.  It has been said that the object of the motion is good; obviously, it is for that reason we ought to accept the motion.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw attention to one fact that has been overlooked.  I appeal to all serious people on both sides to reflect that we must maintain the dignity of this sovereign assembly; and I ask them to realise that they do not maintain the dignity of this sovereign assembly if they present to the assembly one night, a proposed law, and pass it next day.  In no country in the world that I know of, except in a time of war or emergency of that kind, is a law presented one evening and passed the next day without adequate consideration.  That is not the way to deal with a serious subject, and we are making ourselves ridiculous in the eyes of thinking people if we deal with a subject in that way.  I do not think there is anybody who objects to the principle of the motion.  But I say it is a principle that a law of that kind is not passed except in a war emergency.  This matter of emergency decrees is a relic of the time when we were fighting England in the <Col N="160" /> field, and when we had to face things on the spur of the moment.  But that is not a worthy way to deal with the principal subject matter that will come before this assembly.  A great deal of unnecessary heat has been introduced into this matter.  The Minister of Agriculture was assailed when he said if you accept the words of this motion and act upon them as they stand, as you must act upon them, that a person who had the possession of land and was deprived of it by enemy forces would not get back his land, because you would be compelling the Government to give the land to landless people&mdash;the people whom you wish to benefit.  The whole thing is ill-considered, but the principle is a thing everybody will agree to.  But let us do it in a reasonable way.  We must realise that there is one vital distinction between the proposal and the amendment; that one is to do the thing here and now without giving proper consideration to the serious subject matter, whereas the amendment recommends that the thing be taken into serious consideration by the Government and acted upon.  In other words, that this Government, or the Provisional Government. have an opportunity of considering the matter before acting on it.  If you give them the opportunity, no doubt it can be done; but if you pass this without consideration you are bringing this assembly into contempt.  It is not right, except in a war emergency, to rush a thing like that.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name. As to the feasibility of putting the motion into force, each dispensary district in the town and the rural district is the registration area, and the medical officer for each dispensary is the Registrar for the district.  He is chosen, of course, as registrar, as a matter of expediency; because the M.O. of a dispensary district holds dispensaries twice a week, and it is convenient for the people to attend there and have those records made.  There is no technical knowledge of any kind required for doing this registration work.  With regard to registration, all that is required is this&mdash; fill in the different columns in the book; and the entry in the first column is merely the date and place of birth, and the Christian name in the second; the class is indicated in the third, the name and surname of the father in the fourth, and then the signature of the informant, the date of the registration, and the signature of the registrar.  The registration of a death differs only in as much that the disease from which the deceased person suffered is entered in one column, and the medical nomenclature could be adhered to in that.  With regard to a marriage it is simply the names and the dates of the contracting parties, and the signatures, so that there is really no difficulty whatever in having it done.  It does not require any intimate knowledge of the language; one does not want to be even a student of the language in order to be a registrar of births, marriages and deaths in Irish.  The necessity for such an order is obvious to everybody, and it would be practical and feasible and would be no expense.  When this decree is issued no expense will be incurred. With regard to the necessity, it is perfectly obvious to each and everybody that everything should be done to stimulate the interest of the people in the Irish language.  By doing this you will be restoring to the people the use of their own Christian names, surnames and their place names, and in that way it would have a very far-reaching effect in bringing the language before the people.  I am confident that the House will pass it.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is such an easy thing as Doctor O'Crowley says.  You have to put Irish on every name and an Irish rendering on every town and townland.  So it is not at all such a simple thing for every person.  It is a bigger thing than Doctor O'Crowley suggests.  But it is not necessary for the registrar to be a doctor. Any Gaelic League scholar in the district can be the registrar&mdash;he would take it for the same fees as the Doctor gets.  The fee is one shilling an entry.  You can give the appointment to anybody.  The Registrar-General could supply every person in Ireland with a book of the names and place names, because that will be necessary, and also a list of the names of people with names that are not pure Irish names; and the ones that are not purely Irish can be twisted to get an Irish rendering.  If I took the names in the district in which I was it would be hard to get an Irish rendering.</P>

      <P>Mayo is an Irish-speaking district; but I am thinking of places like Dublin where it is an hour's work in the morning for the various registration offices to fill in these names; and I think there would be very considerable difficulty doing this before the first July.  I think everybody wants it to be a success.  I do not know whom Doctor O'Crowley consulted.  There are many people for whom there might be <Col N="163" /> some objection, and I would suggest, in a certain case, anyway, such as Dublin City, where the knowledge of Irish is inconsiderable, that, for some time at any rate, there ought to be a bilingual registration or, at least, some machinery set up so that there would not be a danger of the non-success of this movement.  I think everybody will agree that if it will help the language an effort should be made to make it successful.</P>

      <P>I object to this, and I quite recognise in so doing I lay myself open to the misrepresentation of being against the language. Both my children were educated in the Irish language alone.  Their births were registered in Irish, one of them nine years ago and the other seven years ago; and in this matter I have done as much as one man could do.  But I object to this thing on the ground that it is unfair in the present state of our Irish development. If the proposal were that both languages should be used&mdash;that would be another thing; but it is unfair, in the present state of Ireland, to compel numbers of people who have not our view to accept our Gaelic ideals; and it is doubly unfair when you realise that this Dáil had declared officially that it was to be bilingual.  Now, that was reasonable, that was fair, but this proposal would be an oppressive one, and would be unfair to the majority of our countrymen.</P>

      <P>I would like to have names in Irish, but I do not agree that every doctor should be made do this&mdash;most of them do not know Irish at all&mdash;and certainly there is work for more than one man here in Dublin, trying to straighten out these names to Irish names.  I am not a very great Irish scholar, but I heard and have seen some extraordinary translations of some names in Irish in this country.  There is the name &ldquo;Nessan&rdquo; turned into &ldquo;Mac Niece.&rdquo;  There are a number of doctors who know nothing at all about Irish.  I spent, myself, an hour trying to convince a doctor to register a child in Irish. I spelled it for him, and then he called the next child he had by that name.  I suggest to Doctor O'Crowley he would change this resolution and have it to read &ldquo;Irish and English&rdquo;.  Then, when it came to the Registrar-General, he could straighten them out.</P>

As to the matter of registration, it is the case now that in every country district there is somebody or other qualified to take up the position of registrar who is able to do this work in Irish.  And if the existing registrars are not able or willing to do the work, I do not think that it should be an obstacle when there are other people available to step into their shoes.

      <P>It is not possible to revive Irish in Ireland by law.  Compulsion will not do any good. If you advise the people to use Irish, very good; but if you are going to compel all and sundry to write down the names in Irish next July, the result will be that no one will know what to write down.  In the present state of the knowledge of Irish, where we have not got enough Irish teachers to go round, compulsion is no good.  It is very difficult to get every person to write his name in Irish; you would have a most extraordinary result.  To fill up the correct name of every townland is a matter of most alarming difficulty.  It is not correct for the Deputy to say that you do not require even a student's knowledge of Irish to do this.  The whole question of names is the most difficult of all, and so difficult that there are very few&mdash;I suppose there are not three&mdash; authorities on the question in Ireland. We have only one book on surnames, and the numbers on place names are very little; so the suggestion made by Deputy Mr. de Valera&mdash;that we should make it an advisory matter for the moment&mdash;is better.  It will be, obviously, the duty of any Government to get all the official forms printed in Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. J.J. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>submitted the programme for Aonach Tailteann, as follows.  It was taken as read.</P>
      <P>
        <i>An Eight-day Programme for Dublin.</i>
      </P>
      <P>August 6th to 13th inclusive.</P>
      <P>The revival of the Aonach Tailteann, or ancient games of Tara, has been mooted frequently in recent years, but no concrete step in this direction materialised until the late Cabinet, under President de Valera, conceived the idea of an Irish Race Olympic in conjunction with the Irish Race Convention. In consequence of the shortness of time and the heavy details involved, the Gaelic Athletic Association could not accede to the Paris proposal, and it was then definitely decided early in November, with the concurrence of the Cabinet, to bring off this big Athletic Carnival in Dublin on or about Horse Show Week of the present year.  The date has therefore been fixed for the second week in August, running in many different venues simultaneously from the 6th to the 13th inclusive.</P>
      <P>The original conception of Aonach Tailteann has undergone many changes.  At first it was thought that items strictly common to the Greek Olympiad, embracing the Gaelic race at home and abroad, should alone be attempted.  Subsequently, modifications to suit special Irish phases were introduced; but, finally, the following programme, which goes far beyond anything attempted at the Greek Olympiads, was agreed to:</P>

    <P>It will be seen at once that the foregoing is at least twice as comprehensive as anything hitherto attempted in foreign countries.  Such items as rowing, motor boats and motor cycle racing, yacht racing, step dancing and band competitions, are each a part of the social life of the nation, and their introduction will help to vary the attractions of the Carnival and give national colour as well as stimulus to these widely divergent forms of public amusement. Needless to say, the advancement of the essentially Irish past-times of football, hurling, rounders (the parent of baseball), handball and camogie is the primary object of this Aonach; but it has secondary, yet very important objects also.  We see in our games, through their triennial cycle, the surest means of permanently cementing the scattered units of the Gael, as well as the assertion through this medium&mdash;the Greek Olympics&mdash; of our national athletic powers; and, finally, it is intended that Ireland should be drawn closer to Europe through occasional internationals in the capitals of the Continent.  Nor do I wish to omit a reference to the national value of fencing and gymnastic development, or rifle or revolver competitions. By the inclusion of band competitions we hope to help the cultured life of the country, and through other items the mechanical and industrial phases.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that, to a greater or less extent, the States, Canada, Newfoundland, Argentine, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, England, Scotland and Wales will show up in the International Athletic event, and I have now appointed Mr. Dobbyn of Belfast, Chairman of the Ulster Council of the G.A.A., to proceed to America with a view to organisation.  This will involve a heavy expenditure but there is no alternative.  Within the next few days an organiser will also be sent to Great Britain, whilst the remoter countries will have to see to themselves. I have to say here that I have had the utmost difficulty in securing suitable men for the home work as well as for the mission abroad, and I should welcome the co-operation of members of An Dáil on the General Committee of the Aonach whose work is of an exceedingly heavy and responsible nature.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the present political difference it is, I suppose, only natural that suspicions should permeate many non-political activities. I should like it to be understood, however, that the G.A.A. does not meddle in sectional politics. It has always been sufficiently sensible to mind its own business, and An Dáil can rest assured that this will also be my guiding principle in conduct of Aonach Tailteann.</P>
    <P>Overleaf will be found an application for extra financial assistance to meet the requirements of office work and organisation, and though this amount was included in my estimates <Col N="167" /> submitted in November, this is the first opportunity I have got of seeking the approval of An Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this assembly is of opinion that the tax of one hundred and fifty pounds to be paid by each Deputy in nomination for any constituency is an unfair and unnecessary tax, and should be abolished.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the motion may be received in the spirit in which the last motion has been received.  The charge of one hundred and fifty pounds has been a serious trouble in Ireland in connection with the elections.  From a purely technical point of view and from a material point of view not only of the candidates but their constituents, in Ireland the grievance has been felt so acutely that it is only the fact that Westminster was looked upon as so remote a place to fight it, and that we were entirely dependent on our own resources, that prevented us, years ago, raising this question.  In some constituencies a few men are able to produce the sum without inconvenience to themselves.  The elections, after all, are not organised for the convenience of the wealthy, and all the poor are affected by the tax, and Labour must feel the stress very acutely.  The injury to the public service is so serious&mdash;in limiting the range of choice&mdash;that I sincerely hope that this Dáil will take this matter up and, by a resolution of the House, declare that it recognises the seriousness of the matter, and that this impediment to the full exercise of the franchise&mdash;because that is what it comes to&mdash;will be swept away.  I know that there are two difficulties in the way. One is legislative&mdash;that, I presume, can be got rid of.  The other is financial, but I believe that the financial difficulty can be got rid of equally easily.  The Dáil could express its opinion; and if there is a power behind the Dáil that can settle this question it would be hardly our business to dispute it in a matter of the kind which affects the liberty of the people.  We are not only a democratic body but we are moving to be more democratic than the constitution has allowed us to be up to this. And if we pass this resolution it would be to the convenience of the people of Ireland, and the people outside Ireland, that the democratic feeling of the people of Ireland would be emancipated. This would enlarge the field of choice, and relieve Ireland of a burden which has <Col N="168" /> been felt by individual candidates and also by the people who had to supply the money out of their own pockets.</P>

      <P>My recollection of that was that it was something for the purpose merely of establishing the bona-fides of the candidates, and that it was refunded in the event of the candidate getting one-eighth of the total vote.  I do not know exactly what can be said for the resolution, but it seems to me that, if there is any large body of opinion in a constituency in favour of a candidate going forward, that he won't have much difficulty in finding one hundred and fifty pounds to establish his bona-fides.  The mention of Labour candidates seemed to me the strongest argument in favour of the resolution. But even the Labour candidate, I understand, would have an organisation capable of backing him to that extent.  I don't know as to the possibility of making any change in the existing machinery of the election law in time for the coming election.</P>

      <P>If the candidate gets one-eighth of the total poll he gets his money back.  It will be given back to him then.  It was given back in the case of Pierce McCann.  You want to do away with the bogus candidate. We know in Dublin, at Municipal Elections, a certain man was well-known to the Dublin people.  He had to be sent out of the country because he became a nuisance.  He got nominated for every vacancy in Dublin, and people had to go round giving him five pound notes and ten pound notes to withdraw. You will have the same thing again. Anybody who can secure one-eighth of the votes is entitled to his money back.</P>

      <P>I support the idea behind this motion.  I support it because I heard so many complaints from Labour organisers or Labour Unions that could not possibly find the money.  Deputy MacCarthy feels strongly on the subject as, apparently, the money that was lodged by our party in 1918 has not yet been paid back.  I think that shows what the Corporation thinks of it. I quite agree with those who said that one hundred and fifty pounds is a small sum that any organisation can get together; that applies to city, but it does not apply to country districts at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. JOSEPH MACGRATH:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that Labour bodies in this country object to this one hundred and fifty pounds.  I know what I am talking about&mdash;the Labour bodies in Ireland don't object to it.  I believe the reason it was introduced was that certain people here in Dublin resorted to the method whereby seven candidates of the one name were deliberately nominated with a view of confusing the issue.  A party on one side or the other might be guilty of the same thing.  Labour might be guilty of the same.  Mind, politics are very dirty.  It was with a view to doing away with any possibility of such tactics that such a thing was brought in; and I think it was very necessary.  None of us can be accused of doing it if there is such a provision there.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. SEAN T. O'KELLY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree as to the necessity of guarding. I remember there were thirteen of my own name nominated against me.  Some of them had been in Glasnevin for thirteen years.  They couldn't withdraw, but we had to resurrect others to with draw for them.  Others were at the trade in the way that Deputy MacCarthy says&mdash;we had to buy them.  But I do think we ought agree that the sum should be reduced.  It might be hard on even a large organisation.  If we left the fee at fifty pounds it probably would meet all sides.  If there is any organisation that can't produce fifty pounds their candidate would not have much chance of being elected, and if a man has not much chance there is no use of putting forward his candidature.  I think a fee of some kind is necessary so that one can be assured that the candidates are bonafide. One hundred and fifty pounds is a hardship.  No doubt it was put in the spirit that Mr. MacGrath mentions, but the figure is too high, and if it was put on at fifty pounds it would meet all sides.  I would move that it be a <Col N="169" /> recommendation to this Dáil that the figure be reduced to fifty pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. W.T. COSGRAVE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is a tax; that is not a correct way to describe it.  The tax is upon a person who cannot secure one-eighth of the total number of votes polled.  If there are forty thousand cast and there are four candidates to be elected, you must divide forty thousand by four.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. W.T. COSGRAVE:</NameTxt>
      <P>Permit me to tell you what the case is.  You divide a quota of ten thousand by eight, and that would mean that the candidate who presents himself for election who, out of forty thousand, gets one thousand two hundred and fifty votes, gets his money back; if he cannot get one thousand two hundred and fifty, I think he ought to be taxed.  It is a good job to tax him; and everybody who has ever fought a strongly contested election knows that a candidate opposed to him who only gets one-eigth of the number the winner gets ought to be taxed; one-eighth of the total number of votes polled divided by the total number of members to be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinStack" hpid="MR. AUSTIN STACK MR. AUSTIN STACK">
      <NameTxt>MR. AUSTIN STACK:</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to refer to what is really the most important thing of all.  The unsuccessful candidate if he polls one-eighth of the quota gets back his money; the successful candidate, if he polls nine-tenths of the votes of his constituents, will not get back his money if he refuses to take what is an objectionable oath&mdash;as has been the case with all of us here.  We refused to go to Westminster, and our one hundred and fifty pounds is still lodged with the British Government.  That was the case at the last election.  In a future election in Ireland the same thing may apply, and you may have a body of Irishmen who may not be able to take such an oath and be elected, while if they had been defeated it would be returned to them.  This provision about the oath was not in the original Bill as introduced into the British House of Commons, at all.  But it was pointed out that the Sinn Féiners had a certain policy, and if they followed that policy, that they might not attend&mdash;so it was decided to try and induce them to attend, to offer them a bribe; and if they did not, to penalise them.  So that is how it has come about that our money was retained altogether although we were successful in all the elections.  If it were possible, I believe that the opposition would, if they could, drop this business&mdash;anyway, with regard to the form of the oath.  I am sure that they will give it every consideration, and not try to tax their opponents in the manner the British Government did.</P>

      <P>I think we should have no one hundred and fifty pounds; I think it is a relic of the old time.  There is no reason why any man should have to pay up one hundred and fifty pounds, but there is a danger, as Deputy MacCarthy has said, of bogus candidates.  But to avoid that, why not get men in preference to money?  Why not get the candidates nominated by one hundred and fifty voters?</P>

      <P>I am against that amendment.  The man who signed that nomination paper does not bind himself to vote for the candidate for whom he signed the papers.  That won't get out of the difficulty of the bogus candidate.  I don't care if you reduce it from one hundred and fifty pounds to one hundred pounds or seventy-five pounds, but there must be some fee lodged if you are going to have a properly conducted election.  Deputy Stack's point is covered all right, even under the original Act.  When you sit and take the oath you can get your money back.  Men of straight principle who didn't get their money back all along, can, when Parliament is dissolved; the Free State can afford to pay it back.</P>

The Dáil, this day twelve months, passed thirty thousand pounds for the elections on the following May.  That principle of one hundred and fifty pounds was right then.  Why is it wrong now?  No member then objected to it, although this country was in the throes of war.  They knew very well that we could do nothing, because we were using the British machine, and we were squaring our consciences in using that machine.  Yes, we were; and we have high principles now; and the national apostates now are different men to the men we had then.  I say this is a red herring driving at something else, and if we do not see that hundred and fifty pounds there you will have all sorts of candidates at the next June election&mdash;you will have seven Mooneys and one hundred and twenty-one Bolands.  You will have all those bogus candidates, and that is your only safeguard&mdash;by keeping that fee of one hundred and fifty pounds there.

      <P>I wonder would the last Deputy agree to the suggestion that we should do what we did last year because we regarded it as the way of upholding the Republic?  We decided, acting in accordance with the purpose for which the funds of the Dáil were collected, that thirty thousand pounds should be made available for the election. Perhaps if Dáil Éireann put the sum <Col N="171" /> of thirty thousand pounds now as the figure for the purpose of maintaining the Republic it would meet the case. Our attitude with regard to this whole question is this: we have used British guns against themselves; there is no reason why we should not use British machinery against this.  The present Cabinet has a policy which brings them in contact with Britain, and it gives them a certain power for arranging procedure. As their policy is the policy of the majority here in this Dáil, there is no reason why they should not be able to get any views which they strongly hold &mdash;get these views impressed on those who are devising this machinery.  If, as far as we are concerned, they improve the British gun and we can get it, I have no objection whatever in using it.  This is admitted by President Griffith and others to be an unfair and heavy tax.</P>

About this decree, then, I would say this about these elections. I do not know if we will have an opportunuity of discussing it again; I have a question to raise as to our registers; I think if you want to get the will of the Irish people you will have to get that machinery changed.</P>

      <P>One of the most frequent statements from the other side is to try to get the free will of the Irish people.  Now, this one hundred and fifty pounds was an imposition upon any candidate representing the popular view.  Everyone knows the origin of that.  It was imposed in order to prevent Sinn Féin candidates from standing at the 1921 election; it did not appear in the original draft of the Bill.  It was then put in as an inducement to us to go back upon our repeated election declarations that we would not take the oath in the British House of Commons.  It was imposed there, either to induce us to do that, or to prevent us putting forward candidates at all.  It is important that, in the coming elections, no section of the Irish people should be hindered from putting forward candidates.  There are a number of minor political parties in the country; some of whom hold opinions in favour of the Treaty, and some against it.  It is easy for those who are certain that they have behind them numerous resources to say that one hundred and fifty pounds is not a grave restriction upon the popular voice.  But those who know that this tax must be met in addition to the large expenses of running a candidate for a large constituency, know very well that it will be the last straw, as it will prevent candidates who represent certain vital opinions in Irish life from going forward.  It is simply an attempt to impose upon the Republican Party a handicap in the race. It is a repetition of what was done by England upon Republican Parties in the past.  If they were genuine when they said they were taking the Treaty as a stepping-stone towards the Republic, their very first aim would have been to secure that the coming elections should have been held in the very fairest possible way.  It is not true to say that they cannot, at this stage, alter the conditions under which the election is being held. The election is being held directly at their wish.  It is not being held, as the <Col N="172" /> Ard-Fheis conclusively proved, by the wish of the Irish people.  One thing which the President of the Republic was afraid to take a division upon at the Ard-Fheis was upon the motion which stood in the name of the Minister of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When he got up and said he was not going to stand for the trammelling of the expression of the will of the people he was met by the unanimous cry from that Ard-Fheis that there should be no election.  Now, I say to the President of the Republic, who always pretends to pay such deference to the will of the Irish people, that instead of refusing to accept this motion, it is up to him to go to the English people who are ordering this election and who are, apparently, regulating the manner in which it shall be held, and say that it must be the freest possible election that can be held in Ireland, and every political party who wants to put forward a candidate must have an opportunity of doing so, and this tax must be removed.  It only shows what we have, all along, seen in Irish history&mdash;the demoralisation of all parties in Ireland who have anything to do with the English.  The refusal of the President of the Republic to accept the motion only shows that he is not concerned with the free expression of the peoples' will.</P>

      <P>I will speak a few words on this motion.  The motive for this became revealed when the Deputy for East Clare said that the men on the other side who were in contact with the British could get the machinery changed. And if they did that another Deputy from the other side would get up and say: &ldquo;You used your influence with Lloyd George.&rdquo;  We are not going to have any more of this sort of thing. Everyone on the other side knows that this one hundred and fifty pounds is not a real impediment.  I would support anyone who moved honestly that it be reduced to fifty pounds, or I would support Doctor MacCartan's amendment. <Col N="173" /> From the speeches that were made by the Deputy from Monaghan who, of course, is not prepared to face his constituents, I would say this is not an honest motion, and that it is done for the purpose of denying the Irish people their right to their free will.  We have heard to-day that Dáil Eireann is supreme.  This Dáil Eireann is not supreme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have been anxious to support everything.  We did come to an agreement at the Ard-Fheis.  The reasons for that agreement are trotted out by the Deputy from Monaghan, who has no claim to speak for Monaghan. But those that entered into an agreement with us knew that we were not more anxious than they were.  We were not prepared to face an amendment vote or a vote in our favour; we were trying to preserve unity; we did it as best we could and for two days now we have been kept here, hearing nothing but obstruction. There has not been a single obstruction idea put forward here by the majority, and they are keeping back our work by motions of this kind.  Now, we are going to have a line up on this thing.</P>

We have been discussing this now, and I don't know whether the vote is one way or another, whether it will effect a change of machinery.  Therefore, I would suggest that, the matter having been discussed, that the question be dropped, and that we proceed to the next business.

I think it more suitable for the sixteenth or seventeenth century, and those who speak about democratic ways, and about helping to build up a new Ireland are going the wrong way about it.

He has work that will occupy him till eleven o'clock to-morrow.</P>
