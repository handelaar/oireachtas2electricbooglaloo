    <Title>CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>There are no questions on the paper, but there is private notification of two questions. One is by Deputy Darrell Figgis, and the other is by Deputy O'Connell.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I gave private notice to the President to ask the President if his attention had been drawn to the fact that all copies of last night's issue of the &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; were seized from the newsboys and destroyed, and if in view of the fact that the Government has not hitherto interfered with the publication of this sheet, and has not issued any Proclamation notifying that its sale was illegal, whether it is the intention of the Government to recompensate these lads and to issue a Proclamation for the future?</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT"><NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt><P>I got this question to-day at 1.20, and it is dated 4th October, 12.20 p.m.  I had no information up to that moment that last night's issue of the &ldquo;Irish Republic&rdquo; had been seized.  My attention has been drawn to this journal on a couple of occasions, and in a recent issue occasion was taken to publish something about a member of the Civic Guard.  I have a report here from the Commissioner of the Civic Guard, concerning the individual who was slandered.  The report says:&mdash; &ldquo;Sergt. Fox resigned the R.I.C. on the 31st April, 1915.  He immediately joined the I.R.A. and was appointed an N.C.O.  He afterwards was appointed successively 2nd Lieut., 1st Lieut., Captain, and later Vice-Comdt., 4th Battalion 1st Brigade, 4th Western Division.  His Brigadier was the late Alderman Devins, T.D.  On the formation <Col N="1104"/> of the Republican Courts he was chosen as a District Judge for North Leitrim.  He was also County Secretary for the Belfast Boycott in Leitrim, Secretary of the Manorhamilton S.F. Club, and Secretary of North Leitrim Comhairle Ceanntaiar.  He was invariably chosen as Delegate from Co. Leitrim to the Ard Fheis.  He was a much wanted man in Leitrim and after several unsuccessful raids he was captured by the Black and Tans and brought from prison to prison and detained until the general amnesty on the 9th December.  On his release he immediately reverted to his rank in the I.R.A.  He joined the Civic Guard on the 9th March and was promoted Sergeant on the 1st April.  He never held the rank of Sergeant in the R.I.C., and was never stationed in Thurles.  His only station was in Limerick County.&rdquo; Now, I mention that because certainly I do not mind what sheets like this have to say about myself in the least bit.  I rather enjoy it, but I think in the case of an organisation such as the Civic Guard it is the duty of the Government to have these men's character free from any slanderous publications like these.  It was stated in the journal that one of the Free State witnesses was Sergeant Fox, &ldquo;one of Neville's friends in Court recognised Fox as the Sergeant who had been stationed in Thurles during the Black and Tan terror, and was present and raided her home and subsequently assisted in its destruction.&rdquo; My own firm belief and conviction from any of the cases I have investigated is, that this particular sheet contains more lies than any other publication of the kind that I have ever seen or heard of.  I do not know that there is any funds out of which the Government can recompense these lads, but if I am informed of the amount of loss they have suffered by reason of this seizure, I will see what can be done.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>Arising out of that answer, I would like to say that I was not in any way questioning the suppression of this sheet, but I was merely asking the question.  I would not like it to go out to the public that I was at all questioning the suppression of this sheet by reason of the matters that the President has thought well to introduce into his answer.  I was merely thinking of the fact that these boys had <Col N="1105"/> all <i>bona fide</i> sold this journal, and had now suffered some loss, and I was desirous of ascertaining if that loss will be made good for them.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT"><NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt><P>As far as I know, practically everything in the way of allegation that I have seen in that sheet is a lie.  Now, the second question is from Deputy Thomas O'Connell, &ldquo;to ask the President whether his attention has been called to the letter which appears in this morning's paper, signed by the Rev. Joseph Smith, C.P., Vice-Rector of Mount Argus, with reference to the treatment of a particular prisoner, and whether, in view of this and many similar complaints which have been made, the Government will consider the advisability of acting on the suggestion which has already been made in the Dáil, and set up an independent Committee which will inquire into such complaints and furnish a report to this Parliament.&rdquo; I have seen the letter. I understand that the Rev. Joseph Smith is not an impartial person, and I am making, or I am going to make, inquiries into this case.  I do not know that an independent Committee would be advisable.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="TOMAS O CONAILL TOMAS O CONAILL"><NameTxt>TOMAS O CONAILL:</NameTxt><P>There is a matter about which I want your opinion, A Chinn Chomhairle.  Under Order 10 of the Standing Orders debated yesterday, or, rather, passed yesterday, it is set out that a Deputy will have an opportunity of raising a matter on the adjournment of the Dáil after 8.30 p.m. If I am in order now, I do not know whether I am in order or not, I would like to say that I would wish to raise this matter on the adjournment to-night.</P></Speaker>

    <Title>DEBATES ON ADJOURNMENT. - PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATION.</Title>
<Col N="1106"/>     <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>In connection with the first three amendments on to-day's paper, I would like to point out that, either by inserting words in Article 26 or by inserting a new Article, they aim at fixing in the Constitution the principle of representation for Universities in the Dáil.  And I would suggest that the simplest way would be to dispose of the principle of the matter first. If it is proposed that every University in Saorstát Eireann is to be entitled to representatives in the Dáil, I think it would enable the Dáil to debate the matter with greater clearness and more expedition.  If a motion to that effect is rejected, I think Article 26 will stand.  If the motion were passed then the Minister in charge of the Bill would, I presume, undertake to put forward Article 26 subsequently with any changes that would be necessary consequent on your having adopted such motion.  I understand that later on we will have from the Minister for Local Government an Electoral Bill, and when discussing that we can go into the question of the number of representatives for the University, that is, if it is passed.  That could be done on the general question of machinery.  I think the Dáil would be able to deal with the question more clearly now if it were not complicated by any question of numbers. Is that agreed?</P><P>The Dáil agreed.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS"><NameTxt>Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS:</NameTxt><P>In pursuance of the Ceann Comhairle's excellent suggestion, I move the following motion: &ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the principle that every University in the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall be entitled to elect representatives to the Chamber (Dáil Eireann), and that the draft Constitution be amended accordingly, and leave over the determination of the numbers and other conditions of electoral law, if this proposition commends itself to the wisdom of the Dáil.  I have an uneasy consciousness that University representation is unhappy in its present advocate.  Once upon a time Colonel Saunderson in the British House of Commons, condemning the sham self-government that Mr. Gladstone had proposed for Ireland, pointed with scorn to <Col N="1107"/> the Irish Parliamentary group, and cried: &ldquo;There they sit, 86 solid arguments against Home Rule.&rdquo;  History has a bad habit of repeating itself.  There is another difficulty against the present advocate.  Some members of the Dáil are aware that he has publicly spoken against the grant of the Parliamentary franchise to university graduates, and some sub-editor, by a freakish inadvertence, allowed the cardinal point of the speech to appear in his newspaper.  The point, however, against which I directed my argument does not arise here, because I was speaking against privilege, and more particularly in this case, the privilege of the plural vote.  Now, we have disposed of that already in an earlier Article.  No citizen is to exercise the dual vote, and consequently this whole question of University representation is so far simplified. We are not asking that the mere fact that a man is a graduate of the University should entitle him to vote first in his ordinary civil capacity and secondly in a special capacity. I, as a convinced democrat, am as much an enemy of privilege as any member of the Labour Party.  I have no hesitation in declaring as an article of faith, and accepting it as a dogma of democracy, that no public privilege or advantage, arising out of the accident of birth, race, sex or social standing, or any other sectional qualification, should be allowed by the State to confer privilege.  Now, it is precisely in the name of democratic doctrine that I am recommending this University representation as a specially reserved thing to the Dáil, because it is not at all inconsistent, if you reflect on it for a moment, to declare one's self the enemy of privilege and then ask for this reservation.  I am not an advocate here of any sectional advantage.  There was a time indeed, and that not so very long ago, in one of the co-equal members of this Union of Free States, when to ask for this vote was unnecessary, as it was granted.  They had then become an advocate of privilege, as universities were really a sort of clearing house for rich young gentlemen who went there to get a certain veneer, humorously called culture, and passed away either into the Army or Legislature or some high office. But the university has a different function to-day and plays a very different part in the National life.  We have not <Col N="1108"/> yet built the educational ladder in Ireland, but I trust this Dáil is going to set about that great work, by which we shall not only have compulsory, free, primary education, but that everyone shall be able, by his brains and ability, to climb the whole way up and reach the highest and fullest measure of the highest education he could receive in his day.  Higher education, it is now admitted, is the great condition to the attainment of the fullest stature of liberty, and many social problems that exist would have been solved long ago if it were not for the fetters of ignorance that lay so heavily on those responsible for the existence of the problem, and the failure to remedy the social ills with which the problem is concerned. Now.  I look forward to the time when the university graduate voter, in this University representation that I venture to claim for you, shall include every stratum of the population, when we shall have&mdash;and there is no incompatibility whatever in it&mdash;men of every walk of life, engaged in all varieties of occupation, who have received this university stamp as a result of higher studies, and of having undergone what we claim, at least&mdash;the broadening and widening influence of university study and university culture.  Consequently, the voter in this case will not be, as they would be in regard to other members, simply residents in a particular area.  It is very hard to find any doctrine that meets with the assent of a large number of men that would be wholly wrong, and in some of the Bolshevist pronouncements you have a claim made for vocational representation.  That draws attention to one of the weaknesses of the system of getting Parliamentary representation, merely by counting heads or looking at topographical areas.  If a man happens to live at one side of a street his vote becomes inoperative, he is in a hopeless minority.  If he lived on the other side of the street his vote would have carried into Parliament some great reformer. I do not, at all stand here to defend or make any plea for wholesale vocational representation, but I draw your attention to it, rather for the purpose of showing this, that whereas in a mistaken notion of democracy, and what democracy requires, you are willing to pass, and I have no doubt but you will pass the arrangements in this <Col N="1109"/> draft Constitution for representation according to areas and numbers of representation according to population, I am anxious to draw your attention to the truth, that you have here an opportunity for giving representation irrespective of the narrow boundaries and peculiar limitations of electoral areas. It is sufficient to show you that the claim for university representation is not sectional in an opprobrious sense.  There is another point.  When I read over the draft Constitution and thought of it in connection with the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, who had figured so prominently for so long in the public press, so that I became familiar from photography with every aspect of him, from every possible point of view, and thought of him as the author of a very interesting work called &ldquo;The Gaelic State,&rdquo; I looked carefully through the draft Constitution to see the elements&mdash; the germ, the nucleus&mdash;of the Gaelic State that was to evolve out of this Constitution.  I saw a great deal it derives from Teutonic Constitutions, many novelties from Switzerland, the new Constitution of Germany, the Constitution of the United States and the old Constitution of Great Britain, but I looked in vain&mdash;I hope I am wrong &mdash;for the traces of Gaelic civilization or the influence of Gaelic ideas.  Now you have in this, the University representation, an opportunity to go back to an earlier conception of the social fabric, in alignment of its elements.  In the old Gaelic days an t-ollamh&mdash;the professor&mdash; was next to the King.  I think without asking for social privileges such as were attached to that office, that we might at any rate do something here in our institutions that would mark a public sense of the Gaelic spirit's desire to honour education&mdash;the great spiritual, the great vitalizing influence.  It is an unfortunate thing for which our country is not to blame&mdash;yet the fact is there&mdash;that education is not respected in this country. It is only a sort of technical education that has a money value, that has a bread and butter value, that is regarded with any degree of esteem and the pursuing of knowledge for its own sake is commonly regarded as a species of folly, and culture is sneered at; even agriculture as a University study has been sneered at already in this Dáil.  I think it is not contrary to public <Col N="1110"/> policy, but very much in the line of public policy to use every device devisable to imprint on the public mind, in Ireland, the fact that we do hold the pursuit of knowledge and the dissemination of education in high esteem, and that we do attach spiritual values to elements of life, in modern Ireland, as pronouncedly as they did ages ago.  I feel that this is one of the disabilities of education in Ireland, that the popular view of the professor&mdash;the professor usually, though not always the University representative, is that he is an incompetent person, a strange and subtle blend of imbecility and scholarship.  There may be some truth in that, at times, but I think if you have an agency for putting the professors as representatives of the University into close and continuous contact with the representatives of other activities of the Nation it will improve the Universities through their representatives. That is a decided practical advantage, and I think that would appeal to the utilitarian spirit.  You may say, why not adopt the expedient of sending the professor out to the hustings and let him stand for a Constituency, like any other citizen.  That may not always be desirable for the University. I need not labour that point.  Even if the professor were likely to be regarded with favour by the Constituency, I am afraid he should have to become a partisan and espouse some political programme or stand upon some plank, and forget for the moment his desire to represent the attitude of attempting to take broad views and to relate things dispassionately.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON"><NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt><P>I do not support this motion, A Chinn Chomhairle, in the interests of any constituency or minority, or class, or creed, and I am not standing here to afford my fellow-countrymen any pretext for offence by asking them to give University representation as a safeguard against any anticipated oppression of the minority in this Dáil.  As far as I am concerned, as this proposal should stand or fall, its supporters may succeed or fail in satisfying you that it is in the interests of the country as a whole and not of any section or any individual in it, that its Universities should be permitted to send representatives to the National Assembly. One has only to look at the <Col N="1111"/> amendment on the list, which stands in the name of the leader of the Labour Party, to see the kind of legislation that this place is going to be faced with as soon as we have got rid of the Constitution, and that its successors are going to be faced with legislation of every kind: housing, transport by road, rail and water, development of the resources of the country, and, most of all, education. And what representatives are you going to have in this Assembly to deal with that?  I am afraid that Irish history shows and the experience of other countries shows that once a country is cloven into political parties that only the determined representatives of those parties have any reasonable chance of finding a place in the Legislative Assembly.  Canada is now dominated so far as the prairie provinces are concerned by a Farmers' Association. I have no doubt there will be a very large increased representation of the farmers here after the next election.  You will find in a country like Ireland, where agriculture is the great industry, that the rural constituencies will send up either farmers or those who are interested in the farming industry, as tillers of the soil.  That is to say, the owners and the workers upon the land are the two classes that will come here from the rural constituency; that is only human nature.  A professor, often of the highest branch of metaphysics, even though he sits next to a king, has small likelihood of finding a farmers' constituency that will return him to this Assembly.  The farmers know where the shoe pinches and they send the men that know their own interests to represent them here.  It will be the same thing with the Cities.  The fight there will be between the representatives of organised labour, on the one hand, and business, commerce and finance, I suppose, upon the other, and you will find the urban constituencies sending up representatives of that type and that alone.  Now, when you come to deal with the legislation everybody here who has had any experience, whether as Lord Mayor or Alderman, or Town Councillor, or County Councillor, or even upon the Councils of a Trade Union, or the Council of the big Chambers of Commerce, or any other public body, knows perfectly well that the work of legislation goes <Col N="1112"/> on in committees.  In a big assembly like this you debate the general question, but it is ten or twelve men sitting round a table that really deal with legislation. And as you in this Dáil, who framed our Standing Orders know perfectly well, it is round the table that the work is done, and it is during that work around the table when you hammer out the details of the principle of the Bill agreed upon here, that you will find the university representatives if you admit them, I prophesy, of invaluable services to the country.  When you come, for instance, to harness the Liffey, or the Shannon, or the Lee, later on, to provide electrical power instead of the coal that nature has denied to Ireland, it is there the professor, the engineer, like my colleague, Professor Thrift, or Professor Purcell, of the National University, if he were here, and men of science like them, that will be able to do the work of these matters in committee.  Similarly, when you come to deal with questions of housing, food and drugs, and matters of that kind, do you think that the leading members of the medical profession, the President of the College of Physicians, and men like that, would not be able to give valuable assistance, with their vast experience of this kind and their medical school education, and would not they be able to evolve great and valuable schemes? The thing most important of all in this country&mdash;and no one knows that better than the Labour members, and no one has pressed it more strongly upon the country than they&mdash;is the need for education.  Every man sent here from the universities, with the solitary exception of myself, is a man who has devoted his life to education.  Even Sir James Craig&mdash;though medicine is his profession&mdash;has been a teacher in that profession from the time he took it up. All these men are trained masters of education by profession, and when you come to frame what will be the most vital need of this country&mdash;Bills dealing with education&mdash;it is from the representatives of the universities that you will be able to get the greatest assistance of all that you can get to deal with that matter in committee.  And that education is of vital importance to this country I do not think anyone will deny. Whether it is the system or the administration of the system that is at <Col N="1113"/> fault, I do not know, but one or other must be at fault, and one or other must be dealt with at once, now that we have a Parliament of our own, to frame a system of administration, suitable to the needs of our country.  That there is something wrong I do not think anyone will deny, because it certainly is not the fault of the people, that you find 20 per cent. of the population of a large county illiterate, because no one has ever suggested that the Irish people are not the equals of any nation on earth, so far as intelligence goes, and if you find a percentage of ten, fifteen, or twenty&mdash; on an average 10 per cent., in more than half the counties of Ireland, illiterate, you may conclude that there is something wrong in the administration of the system, and it is when you come to reform that that men who have devoted their lives to education, who have seen people going out from the primary and secondary schools up to the universities, will be able to put their fingers upon the blot and tell you how to reform it.  And as I told you you will not get these people from the other constituencies&mdash; you will not get many from the universities&mdash;three or four at the outside, but it is not numbers that count in that matter, but these men sitting round a table will be able to give to the others all the assistance they require in coming to a proper conclusion and in framing the details of their Bills.  These are the grounds upon which I commend University Representation as essential to the Dáil.  There is one other matter, which is a matter of expediency and not of principle.  I do not suppose there was any speech delivered here since we met that struck the whole Dáil more profoundly than the speech of the Deputy for Cavan on the second day of our sitting, when he was dealing with the six counties, where there are people watching you with unfriendly eyes, and I am afraid if you reject this motion&mdash;I have not asked for safeguards &mdash;there are people who will say it is done because you are determined to eliminate the last vestige of minority representation.  It will not be so construed by me, but it will fan the flame of mischief blazing up too brightly already. On the other hand if you pass this motion, I have no doubt whatever you will be putting a very powerful weapon in the hands of those&mdash;and they <Col N="1114"/> are neither few nor confined to the 26 counties&mdash;who are doing all they can to break down the barriers of misunderstanding and misrepresentation that keep Ireland divided to-day, and you will give those who are working for union&mdash;and the only union we are working for is the union of Ireland&mdash;a very powerful lever to try and bring that about.  This is not a question of principle, it is more a question of expediency, and if there are any members in this Dáil wavering on that question, I think that argument might go far to turn the scale in favour of this proposition.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG"><NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG:</NameTxt><P>I desire to support the motion.  The case has been put so clearly and forcibly by the speakers who have already spoken that I am sure the members of the Dáil have already made up their minds that the motion should be adopted.  I do not think it can be denied for a moment that the University representatives have been of signal service since their entrance into the present Dáil.  In your wisdom you have chosen a Speaker who is most impartial, but who has an iron hand beneath the velvet glove.  You have elected the second of the National University representatives as your Minister for Education.  A few days ago a London paper announced that Deputy MacNeill was the most distinguished and the most regarded member of the Dáil.  I do not think anyone in this Dáil is going to deny the accuracy of that statement; and surely you are not going to reject this amendment and send Deputy MacNeill to the highways and byways of Donegal and Antrim to canvass for votes so that he may be present at a future Dáil.  You have the much easier course here of adopting this motion and getting him in by an easier and surer method.  The third representative of the National University, Deputy Magennis, has proved himself a fluent speaker, an able critic, a constitutional lawyer, and a great metaphysician. We could ill do without many of the criticisms that he has offered on the work of the Ministry.  With regard to the members for Dublin University, for a long time Dublin University had the reputation of being the silent sister, and we who represent the University here have perhaps done our best to maintain the reputation of silence. <Col N="1115"/> However, Deputy Fitzgibbon has shown that he has been able to be of signal service in the Dáil, when opportunities arose in which his legal training and his legal knowledge revealed themselves. With regard to other members, I have not the slightest doubt when the occasion arises upon which our interests are centred, and upon which we think we have some special knowledge, we too will be able to give some service, at all events, to the Dáil.  You have here experts in various directions.  You have experts on labour, you have agricultural experts, you have rhetorical experts, you have experts on Constitutional law, and you have expert men on practically everything.  Well, I do not see why you should not be greatly helped in this Dáil by the addition to it of men who have had the advantage of a University education and a University training, because if a University training and education does anything for a man it must broaden his views; that is, unless he becomes a mere book-worm.  But, as long as the man remains in contact with his fellow human beings, I hold that a University education must not only broaden his views on every question, but greatly widen his sympathies with his fellow human beings.  I remember reading somewhere an anecdote of a business man who, in conversation with a University Professor, said: &ldquo;I have had the greatest success; I have made money; I have attained to great honour. Everything that I wanted has been pressed upon me, and what good would a University education have done me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the University Professor, &ldquo;It might have had the effect of not making you boast so much about these things.&rdquo;  I say that if you adopt this motion and bring the University representatives here, at all events you will not have men coming here to boast about their wealth, because I am quite confident no University Professor ever has any wealth.  They have one of the worst paid jobs, perhaps, in the whole Kingdom.  I sometimes wonder when I find myself sitting here why I am not sitting on the opposite (Labour) benches.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL"><NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt><P>Come over here.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG"><NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG:</NameTxt><P>A previous teacher of mine, a very distinguished man, <Col N="1116"/> had a class of students around a bed on one occasion, and he said to the patient in the bed: &ldquo;What occupation have you?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I am a labourer,&rdquo; was the reply.  &ldquo;But what kind of a labourer,&rdquo; asked my teacher.  &ldquo;I am just a labourer,&rdquo; said the patient.  &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; pursued my teacher, &ldquo;there are various kinds of labour; surely you know what particular kind?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; said the patient, &ldquo;I am just a labourer.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the teacher, &ldquo;you do not teach medical students, do you, because that is the hardest labour in the world.&rdquo;  If it is the hardest occupation, I have been engaged in that occupation for the last 35 years.  I think it has been pointed out that the adoption of this motion would not over-ride any of your democratic principles.  I do not think anyone of us would come here to ask you to do so.  I ask the Dáil to unanimously adopt the recommendation, because I am sure they are doing a right and proper thing, and they are going to do something that will bring credit to themselves.  I had no intention of referring to it, but my colleague, Deputy Fitzgibbon, has alluded to the question of the union of the 26 Counties with the 6 Counties in the North.  This is a point upon which I hardly feel called upon at the moment to speak; but I want to say this: Perhaps of any member in the Dáil, I have the most intimate knowledge of the mentality of the North, and of the mentality of the South.  I think I can appreciate more clearly than any member of the Dáil the differences that exist between the two.  It was my greatest hope when coming here, in addition to supporting the Government in carrying through the Constitution, to think that I might be of some use in trying to bring about good fellowship between the North and South.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>I listened with a good deal of interest and attention to the speeches advocating that the University should have special privileges of representation in the Dáil.  All the arguments that have been adduced have been directed, not to giving University representation, not to giving special Franchise to University graduates, but to ensure that the University Professors should be selected as the representatives of these universities, but, judging by past experience, I do not think that we <Col N="1117"/> can say that University graduates have been particularly careful in the choice of representatives from their educational standpoint, from specialised knowledge on any particular subject&mdash;I am not referring to this Dáil.  We know as a matter of fact that University representation in the past has followed the same course as representation of any other constituency.  Men have been put forward on their political characters, and so far from the practice having been that men who specialised on particular subjects and men who would be of special use in the discussions on the particular subjects being selected, the great majority of those selected by universities in this country and other countries have been lawyers, not because of special ability to discuss political, social or economical questions, but because they happened to be anxious for legal preferment, and they considered that by their hold upon a University Electorate it was the easiest way to get that preferment.  It may possibly be that following upon the carrying of this proposal members for the Universities would put forward a further proposal limiting to particular sections the University graduates who will have a chance of election to the Dáil.  I do not know, but all the argument adduced so far has not been upon the character of the electorate but upon the qualifications of particular persons who would necessarily be elected.  We have no assurance that the electors are going to elect these particular persons.  We know in the last Dáil there were certain persons chosen to represent University graduates, who would not conform to the test put forward here.  However, it may be said that is not a fair criterion of the future, but it is as good a criterion as anything that has been put forward yet.  We know that party organisation has just been as effective in the selection of University representatives as in the other constituencies.  The education test is put forward, but I maintain that the fact that men or women have graduated in a University does not fit them any more for the selection of representatives than the fact that men have become fathers, and women have become mothers, or men have done military service, or men have gone to sea.  Far less does their experience under a tutor fit them for the selection of representatives <Col N="1118"/> to the Dáil than the ordinary experience of life of an ordinary citizen. I think Deputy Fitzgibbon or Deputy Professor Magennis, or both, argued that this is something in the nature of vocational representation, and it was in harmony with the amendment that is suggested to be considered after this is disposed of, but it is far from being vocational.  You might say that children in the elementary schools are fitted by their particular experience under teachers to select representatives in some assembly and call it vocational, but it is not vocational, and it is no use trying to get the proposal carried on that ground.  The facts are, it is an attempt to perpetuate a privilege of a particular section in the community.  Perhaps it may not be in the minds of the advocates, but that is its effect, and will be its effect until you have built that ladder and make it available for all citizens to go through Universities, but even then it would not justify special representation for representatives of Universities in any Legislature. Again, my argument applies equally to preferential consideration that is proposed to be given to the Universities in the Senate.  The proposal now is to add to the preferential representation of the Senate special privileged representation in the Dáil.  I think that the case has not been made out, and I honestly listened attentively to find out if a good case could be made for special representation.  It has not been made, and I for one will not support it.  I may say this with regard to the suggestion about minority representation: that it is not going to avail anything, because the great majority&mdash;the majority of the representatives on any reasonable system of representation&mdash; would not be for supporting or giving benefaction to the minority, but I do not think that is worthy of any consideration at all.  If people are going to be afraid to join hands with the majority of this country, and are going to be repelled by the fact that the Dáil is not going to give privileged representation, then I don't think any attempt should be made to invite them, and I am as willing as anyone to go a long distance to make it easy for our friends in the North to join with our friends in the South, in the Midlands and West, and the North-West.  Unless a much <Col N="1119"/> stronger case is made by later advocates I propose to vote against the proposition.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WM. SEARS Mr. WM. SEARS"><NameTxt>Mr. WM. SEARS:</NameTxt><P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that most of the arguments put forward in favour of this motion fail to bring conviction.  Now, the teaching body in Ireland, or in any country in the world, is a very important body, and deserves every consideration, but already every teacher and every graduate of a University has a vote, and if you give the teaching profession and graduates an extra vote you will be doing an injustice to other great interests and great professions.  Education is a very important interest.  Religion is another important interest, and if you give an extra vote to the Universities, could not the different Churches in Ireland come here and say they also are entitled to special representation? Might not the farmers say that they as a body representing a most important industry in Ireland&mdash;might not the Farmers' Executive claim that they are entitled to additional interest?  Then the labourers' unions would next claim that they were also entitled to additional representation in the Dáil.  It cannot be put forward on the grounds of vocational representation that it is a representation for vocational interest.  If it was I think there would be a great deal to be advanced in favour of it.  If the teachers of Ireland&mdash;University, Secondary and Primary&mdash;that is a very important body, and they alone are entitled to speak more than any other section for education&mdash;if a poll could be taken of these three sections of teachers I would say they would have a great right to come in here whenever the other great interests would be specially represented, but not till then.  Now, the argument is made that when the great schemes would come to be deliberated upon by this assembly it would be of interest and advantage to have representatives of the Universities here.  That is not to me a very strong argument.</P></Speaker>
<P>This motion could not be made at a more favourable moment, because we have very popular Professors here, but I think to place a strong claim because Professors have proved sometimes to be useful politicians is a very unfortunate thing, because in this Dáil we have very short memories.  One Professor <Col N="1120"/> could do as much damage as it would take one million Professors to make good in twenty years.  It is a most unfortunate thing, but a Professor is a masterhand at wrecking.  We are not to consider the motion on that ground anyhow; but there is one ground upon which this motion has been recommended, and it appeals very strongly to me, and I am sure it appeals very strongly to every man in this Dáil.  There is a certain interest in Ireland for which three or four members here spoke, and they have spoken very eloquently and very persuasively on certain questions that have come up in this Dáil.  We are all looking forward to the day when the twenty-six counties and the six counties will be amalgamated.  I am sure that that small representation in this Dáil will be of the utmost advantage in bringing about that desired union between the North and South, and although it has been advanced that this motion has been recommended upon grounds that are opposed to all democratic principles, and I am strongly opposed to the motion for that reason. I say Professor Magennis's arguments are not convincing.  Professors of the Universities are no more entitled to special representation than the other interests I have mentioned.  If this special representation for which Deputy Fitzgibbon speaks would hasten by one day the time at which North and South will come together, then I think we should keep this representation here. For that reason, and although I have no great faith in political professors, I support this motion.  The great movement that was brought to a success in Ireland in recent years&mdash;that great movement that culminated in this Dáil&mdash;was not brought about by professors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. SEAN MILROY Mr. SEAN MILROY"><NameTxt>Mr. SEAN MILROY:</NameTxt><P>I do not want to give you a dissertation upon the capacity of the University Professors, but I want to say that I am not going to give a silent vote.  I am going to support this motion as emphatically as one voter can.  Universities stand in an unique position, and should be, I think, the well-springs from which the whole vital springs of national intelligence flow.  I have no doubt that some <Col N="1121"/> of our educational institutions in Ireland have a record in history that is not perhaps ideal; but I believe that, in the new Ireland that is now in the making, there will be a change of the most profound character, both in the outlook and influence of educational institutions that hitherto have been, to a certain extent, estranged from the national ideal.  I think that it is not paying any compliment to say that the representation at this Dáil of, shall we say, the oldest existing University in Ireland has given us a very definite indication that there is a change in the outlook and the attitude of that institution. I do not think that there is any analogy between the position of the University and the other interests in the country.  The other interests can secure their representation through ordinary common or garden politicians, such as myself, but I do think it is important that educational institutions, such as universities, should have a very definite and individual voice in such an assembly as this.  I do not know&mdash;I have been somewhat at sea&mdash;as to whether, the suggestion is that university representation should be abolished.  I gather that was the trend of the argument of some of the speakers.  If so, I want to say that I, for one, am utterly opposed to that.  I think it would be a reactionary step.  I think it is not giving a privilege to what is a certain interest in the community, but it is securing that in the sovereign assembly of the nation, there shall come that particular phase of the national life which has a most profound, vital and far-reaching effect and influence upon the future and the present of the nation, securing from that particular phase of the national life an effective voice in the deliberations of the Assembly that is regulating the affairs of the nation.  For that reason I strongly support the motion.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins"><NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins):</NameTxt><P>Deputies will probably hear with a certain relief that there is no official attitude on this particular question, and that, in fact, there is no unanimity about it within the Government itself.  It is simply a question that Deputies should consider carefully and decide absolutely on its merits.  I would point out one thing&mdash; that, in the event of this motion <Col N="1122"/> being passed, certain amendments will probably be necessary in the provisions of the Seanad, because there is a rather liberal University representation provided for in the Seanad, and it would probably be necessary to alter that in the event of this motion being passed, but I anticipate that could be altered by agreement.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>There is an amendment in to alter that.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>Yes, but we would not consider ourselves absolutely free to alter the Seanad provisions without some consultation, at any rate, with the people who are parties to the agreement. Now I find it rather difficult to come to any definite decision on this matter.  On the one hand you had the very able and very eloquent speeches of the University representatives here, and on the other hand, you have what is a general hope that in a very few years time you will have the spread of University education, so that within this Assembly you might expect to have many graduates of the University, graduates whether it be in medicine, law, engineering, science or agriculture.  And remember that a good deal of the force of the arguments that were put forward by the University representatives disappears. Remember, too, that we must not, in considering the Constitution, take into consideration only the actual state of affairs in the country.  The National University may, for instance, break up into several Universities.  Are all these to have representation in this Dáil?  Any Universities that come into existence in the future in Ireland, are we to be bound by the Constitution to provide representation for them too?  In the Seanad, which has been described very correctly, I think, as a cooling Chamber, all those qualities that were claimed for a University representative get ample scope in the work of revising the measures that are passed here.  These qualities come into play and will be.  I have no doubt, most useful, as I think we all agree they are most necessary. The main objection to University representation was the plural voting, and I think it will be seen that one Deputy that spoke did not give consideration to the fact that plural voting of any <Col N="1123"/> kind is gone under an Article of this Constitution.  A University graduate would have to decide whether he would prefer to vote in his constituency as a citizen or in his University as a graduate.  It was largely with a view to emphasising the neutral attitude of the Government on this question that I rose at all, and I postpone giving my own decision on the matter until I hear further about it.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P.J. McGOLDRICK Mr. P.J. McGOLDRICK"><NameTxt>Mr. P.J. McGOLDRICK:</NameTxt><P>Ba mhaith liom focal a rá ar an rún atá os comhair an tighe.  Sílim go raibh an rud sa ceart ach nílim sásta go raibh. sé ráite i mBéarla.  Ba choir don Teachta na rudaí seo do chur i nGaedhilg.  This is not a preference for Professors as I see it.  This is a preference to education, and I think surely if we are going to proceed on the way that the people of Ireland would expect us to proceed we should not hesitate to give certain preferences to education.  I think if there is any interest in the community that should get a preference, or if there is any preference to be given, it should be given to education.  I would not be prepared to give any preference to Professors, notwithstanding the very able arguments adduced here.  They may be very valuable in their own sphere and very useful, but when they come into a body that is not, perhaps, able to view things as they view them, and not so absolutely and precisely stuck on every formula and symbol as they are, I think they might find they would not be so valuable to the body themselves, and the body would at least in this agree with them.  These would be matters for those who elected them, and in the election they should get selected not on account of their particular ability, as in view of the assistance they could render to the legislative body. Now, as to the Ulster argument, there is no Deputy here more firmly convinced that every effort should be made to secure National unification; but I would ask the gentlemen who put forward that argument do they really think that the area which at present stands aloof would be very much influenced by any preference given to education?  I don't think they are concerned about progress on that road.  They are much more concerned about progress on a different <Col N="1124"/> road, i.e., the road of moneymaking and development and all those things.  These are interests which obsess them, I think, much more acutely than other such things as spiritual advancement, a Gaelic civilisation, or anything else like that for which education should stand.  At the same time, there is, I think, some importance in the argument put forward that the additional representation this might secure would be accepted by them as a token of our desire to try and meet, as far as we can, all the interests that are in the whole community, and would show them we are disposed, here, to give any encouragement we can to them to try and fall in with their national requirements and the requirements of a united Irish Nation.  Now this proposal is said to be undemocratic.  I have never heard that education was not a democratic asset.  It should be a democratic asset and should never be ruled out as undemocratic. If there is anything at all to be encouraged in the general interest of the community it should be education, because it is a democratic asset, and no man should otherwise regard it.  It must only be deemed aristocratic in so far as the democracy may not be able to avail themselves of it to the extent that would sufficiently satisfy them.  But in the future every element should have it as well as the aristocratic element, and it should be our desire to assist them. All the same we cannot afford to despise the ability of the Professors. From the skilful way in which they put forward this amendment I think they proved themselves men of ability, and I think they are men who, if they have any special interest to advance, would be well able to assist themselves. If they apply themselves to the general interest of the whole community and not to any particular departments, their assistance would be valuable, if they apply it in that way, and so I am going to support the amendment.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J.B. WHELEHAN Mr. J.B. WHELEHAN"><NameTxt>Mr. J.B. WHELEHAN:</NameTxt><P>I wish to support the general principle that Universities be represented in the Dáil, and, following the debate, I feel convinced that a great weight of opinion in this Dáil&mdash;indeed, to my mind the argument in this Dáil&mdash;is entirely in <Col N="1125"/> favour of representation of the Universities. Deputy Johnson made the only contribution to the argument against representation of the Universities, and he based his argument particularly on the fact that University representation in the past was of a mere political character. I would remind him that all representation in Ireland in the past, was of a political character.  What applied to University representation applied to every Constituency in Ireland. But in the new Ireland which is coming, representation of constituencies will not be so much representation of a political character, but representation of class interest as far as I can see.  The Labour Party is organising, and rightly so, that the Labour interest should be represented in the supreme authority in the country.  The farmers are also organising, and they intend to do their utmost to be fully represented in the Dáil, and so on, with the trade and commercial interests.  I hold that education will have a great need of representation in the new Dáil, because there is a possibility that with great class interests at stake, and keen class fights in the new Ireland, education may not be thought so much about, or not loom so large in the future Dáils.  Another point was, that the Universities were the happy hunting grounds of lawyers.  Well, I would only point out to him, that out of eight representatives in the Dáil, we happen to have only one lawyer, representing a University.  In the past Dáil, I think it was something similar.  And I do not think, judging by the valuable assistance which the representative of the legal profession in this Dáil has given us, during Committee here, that lawyers are altogether undesirable in the Dáil.  I would submit to him that in view of the fact that the general principle of one man one vote is a matter of Constitution in the Saorstát, that he would accept the principle of University representation, and would submit to the Dáil that the principle be unanimously accepted, provided that Universities shall have four representatives for the whole country&mdash;four representatives only for the whole country.  I think that it would meet the point raised by the Minister for Home Affairs, when he said that every new University that would crop up ought to have new representation. Proportional representation should work <Col N="1126"/> as well for the Universities as for the general body of constituencies.  I warmly support the principle, the general principle, that Universities be represented in the Dáil.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>What exactly is being discussed is the principle of any University representation&mdash;it being understood that the numbers and any other detail connected with the matter can be discussed when the Electoral Law is under discussion.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAL O'SHANNON CATHAL O'SHANNON"><NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON:</NameTxt><P>It is in opposition to the principles of University representation, that I rise.  An attempt is being made to represent to the Dáil, that the object behind those who are advocating the representation of Universities in the Dáil is in order to give Education representation in the Dáil. Of course, that is not really the position at all, because, distinguished as are the University Members of the Dáil, and distinguished as are the graduates and professors and everybody else connected with the Universities, they are not the sole repositories of Education at all.  I would be agreeable, if the Dáil were agreeable that there should be such a thing as vocational representation, and I would be agreeable that in such a thing the whole educational body of the country should be considered.  But in that whole educational body, I would want to insist that everybody connected with education activity throughout the country should form the Constituency for representation.  Some point was made a few moments ago, about votes, dual votes, and that sort of thing.  I am not at the moment so much concerned with that sort of thing at all.  What is at stake is the Constituency, and I object to the Universities as Universities being Constituencies, or being a number of Constituencies for representation in a popular or democratic Dáil.  A Deputy says there is nothing objectionable from the democratic point of view of Education being represented.  But it is not Education and it is not the Educational body that representation is claimed for here at all.  Representation is claimed for the Universities.  There is no thought at all about the Secondary Educational Establishments or the Primary Educational Establishments.  Nothing but the <Col N="1127"/> University Educational Establishments. I do not know in any other country except Britain is there such a thing as a University claiming representation or getting representation.  I cannot find a single reason why the Belfast University, the National University or Trinity should get representation that is denied to a similar party or bodies of people, of as much national importance to the country as they are.  And as to the argument that, if this thing is done, it would persuade some people up in the North that this Dáil is a tolerant body, and that it is not going to bite their heads off if they come into the Free State, I do not think any consideration should be given to that argument at all; because the ordinary point of view of Irish Nationality in the North of Ireland is not on these lines. It will not persuade the ordinary opponent of Irish Nationality in the North of Ireland.  Their argument is that the Irish people are not fit people for them to obey the majority or to live with.  Representation in the Universities will not do away with that objection at all.  A great deal will have to be done before that is brought about, because the opposition does not come so much from people in the North who have got University education.  It comes from a big, solid body of people in the North who, from our point of view, are very much prejudiced and ignorant of facts; and if we adopt in principle this motion, it will not change those people at all.  There is no valid argument advanced here to-day why Universities as Universities should have representation. I might as well claim that the Port of Dublin, and the Port of Cork and the Port of Galway and other places should have separate representation because they are ports.  Now, I do not claim it.  I am an advocate of educational representation in the National Legislature, but I do not claim that a particular number of people in a particular port or in a particular number of ports should have representation, and there is no reason in the wide world why graduates, any more than anybody else should have representation.  Deputy Whelehan points out that it is true that in Ireland all representation was decided upon party lines.  That was quite true, and to a large extent it will be true in the future, and as true of Universities as of every other constituency.  He says that in future representation, will be decided on the issue between class and class. <Col N="1128"/> That to some extent will be true; and that is the very reason why we, at least I, am opposing and am opposed to representation of Universities, because the representation of the Universities in present circumstances will give special representation to classes or castes.  It is not any use turning round and telling us, as some Deputies tell us, that the working people of the country ought to have as good an opportunity of getting into the University as anybody else.  That does not affect the matter.  You must take the position as it stands, and there is no particular reason why Universities as Universities should have representation.  Now, if I want to suggest compromise that would meet some of the objections, I might suggest that all the Universities in Ireland might form one constituency for representation in this Dáil or some other Chamber.  But that, of course, would not meet the views of the advocates of University representation, and it would not meet the views of people who claim that this would be an argument for bringing the North into the Free State; but I am not willing to go into compromise on this thing at all.  I am definitely opposed to the representation of the Universities as Universities. There is not a single argument for it, and it is vain for them to get up and say they are working in favour of the representation of education, because they are not.  They are working in favour of the representation of one out of several educational bodies.  There is no reason at all, if Universities as Universities have special representation, why secondary schools should not have representation, and there is no reason why technical schools should not have representation.  And if it went to that, I really could see no argument for representation of Universities.  There is a certain type of school or college in Ireland which I think is much more entitled&mdash;I do not say any one or type that I may mention is entitled&mdash;but if I said any one was entitled this particular class would be much more entitled than Universities, in my opinion.  The educational activity I mean is a number of Irish Colleges that are making an attempt to revive and extend the National language of the country and the National culture, literature, and everything else.  They, in my opinion, would be much more entitled to representation if <Col N="1129"/> any special educational body was to get it.  I do not say they are entitled to it, but I do say Universities are not.  Another argument, if I was arguing in favour of these establishments, would be that Irish Colleges, Colasití Gaedhilge, would bring into the Dáil an element which I would like to see in it, an element that would not consider the National language a Constitutional or legal fiction.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor WM. MAGENNIS Professor WM. MAGENNIS"><NameTxt>Professor WM. MAGENNIS:</NameTxt><P>Deputy O'Shannon is usually so well informed as to his facts that at least we can, as a rule, accept them even though we reject his doctrine.  To-day he has been sadly astray, inasmuch as his facts are based on his doctrines and not upon observation.  He has misconceived the whole nature of the University and in doing so quite naturally rejects my motion.  If my proposition to retain University representation in the Dáil were what he has represented, I should vote against myself, because what would it be but a demand for representation for one section, and that a very small section, of the National community. He spoke about other teachers as if the claim were for a certain type of teacher&mdash;the University type.  Why, he forgets that the University is in the whole educational organism, the brain and nervous system, and he would not talk about dividing the man.  Why, should he talk about dividing the educational organism?  The graduates are largely the very teachers he wants sectional representation for.  If we had a properly organised system of education, everything co-ordinated, and everything working harmoniously in one splendid machine, no one would be allowed to teach in a secondary school who had not a University diploma.  At the present time one of the blighting influences of education is that anyone can start a school in Ireland, and there is no authority to demand a diploma, and the children may be destroyed.  He is simply a dangerous and unlicensed practitioner. Primary as well as secondary teachers ought also to be graduates.  In every properly civilised country the whole educational system there is not merely downwards but upwards right through the whole body.  I am not standing here to ask representation for a class, nor do I greatly care whether professors are returned or not&mdash;presumably <Col N="1130"/> they may, presumably they may not&mdash; but probably the majority at least of University representatives will be professors. What ground is there for the assumption used by our friends on the Left that because a certain University that had representation in the Imperial Parliament long ago had its franchise utilised for the professional advancement of lawyers&mdash;what ground is there to assume that in the new Ireland, with an absolutely different condition, a healthier and more National condition, that the same result will follow?  We had it pursued even at the initial stage of the Constitution.  I would retort to the argument of Deputy Johnson, who would not have professor-politicians, and would not have lawyer-politicians; but he would have workingmen politicians.  He wants a large representation here, and, what is more, has secured it by our passing the Universal Suffrage Bill a few evenings ago, so that plumbers, bricklayers and carpenters and the rest, shall through their unions, have representation. We know what Trade Unions can do in securing vocational representation, even though it is not called by that name.  We know very well the political strings that can be pulled, and how they are pulled.  We are not children in this matter.  A suggestion made by Deputy Sears seems rather astonishing because one man he ventures to think was a Professor has misled the country so woefully that Professors are apt to be objectionable. Why, the individual to whom he refers was never a Professor.  He was a candidate for a Professorship in the National University on one occasion.  I do not remember how many votes he received, if he received any.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS"><NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt><P>Quite so.  The politicians were able to do that, but it does not become some people here to reproach them for what they did.  I base the argument for University representation on the desire to get back to Gaelic conditions. Are you going to make Irish Ireland a phrase we hear so much about and forget when it comes to practical construction? Where can Deputy Darrell Figgis or whoever is responsible for the Constitution, show me the trace of the influence of Gaelic civilisation in any <Col N="1131"/> Article of the draft Constitution?  It is the most British production we have ever seen.  I want to introduce into it a little leaven that will leaven the whole mass.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAL O'SHANNON CATHAL O'SHANNON"><NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON:</NameTxt><P>In answer to the Deputy may I point out that we argued that in the past University representation was largely a matter of political position and that it was used by lawyers for preference.  We do not mean to suggest that because lawyers take advantage of it more than other people do, that therefore we were opposed to lawyers coming into the Dáil.  Not at all.  Deputy Johnson said, and I thoroughly agree with him, that the more lawyers we have in the Dáil sometimes the better. But as regards that argument about Trades Unions getting vocational representation, they do not get vocational representation. I know perfectly well that Deputy Magennis knows the difference between vocational representation and the getting of representation through the ordinary constituency.  The present constituency is theoretically returning the representative of the whole constituency. He may be a bricklayer, a lawyer, or somebody else, but theoretically he is the representative of the whole constituency. Those who are advocates of vocational representation would rather take a constituency not confined to a small geographical area, but one confined to a number of people engaged in pretty much the same vocation; but those members returned by that constituency would rather be in the nature of delegates than the representatives of citizens&mdash;they would rather be in the nature of delegates or Deputies representing people in that vocation.  Deputy Professor Magennis, of course, knows that perfectly well. He sees the whole logic of our argument against his motion, but he must make a case, and therefore he makes the best case he can.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I do not propose to answer the challenge that has been made by Deputy Magennis here. because if I did I would not go very far before you would call me to order.  Therefore, the challenge was perfectly safe to put here.  But I will be quite willing to meet Deputy Magennis in some other place, and to point out to him that it is <Col N="1132"/> an entirely Gaelic production.  I only take this opportunity of saying that I have long been of opinion that Universities should not be represented here in this Chamber.  Analysing my reasons for it, I found that the fundamental reason was that it would be, in the ordinary meaning of the word, an undemocratic procedure to allow electors to exercise more than one vote, accepting the principle of one vote one person.  The Constitution perfectly clearly defines that, and it is not possible under the Constitution, even with such amendments as will be now put to the Chamber, to allow any one voter to exercise more than one vote.  Consequently that goes.  I have not only listened to the arguments in this place, but I have been privileged to share certain arguments that went to the making of these amendments, and I am prepared to vote for them.  The reason that I do so is this, that I realise that more and more in the future people will become more and more specialised representatives in a legislative Assembly.  In spite of the fact that the constituencies for the Chamber of Deputies under this Constitution are chosen by topographical and geographical definitions, more and more, you will find under the influence of the kind of legislation decreed in this Constitution, the representatives who are returned will be representatives not of districts, but of certain kinds of vocation, and therefore there will be in the ultimate result a certain kind of person &mdash;you can call him a Professor, or whatever you like&mdash;a certain kind of specialised representative for whom no place would be found unless Universities found a refuge for him.  It is because I think that that kind of person would give valuable help in making legislation efficient by technical service and expert experience, that the question of University representation here might be tried. Nevertheless, I believe that a number of Deputies in this Dáil who will vote for the motion will vote for it with a certain measure of reserve, that their conviction, while still being at this moment a conviction, will not be to the extent of one hundred per cent.  I believe Deputy Fitzgibbon, with whom I have spoken on this matter, would agree with what I am about to say, that if it should be proved that the kind of person whom it was intended to bring into <Col N="1133"/> the Chamber by reason of University representation should not be returned now, but that the same kind of person would come in through the ordinary constituencies, then, at some subsequent time, a decision might be taken that the Universities were not suitably acquitting themselves of the responsibilities placed upon them, and that the representation might be removed.  If that were so it would mean a certain alteration or amendment of this Constitution in one important feature.  That will be coming on later on, and therefore in mentioning the fact that I intend to vote for the motion I would like to take the opportunity of mentioning that it would be well if Deputies were to look ahead in this Constitution and give some attention to the Article that will appear, a great deal later, respecting amendments to this Constitution.  I think that the process of amending or revising the Constitution might be made simpler than it is now in respect of such matters as this.  We know very well that the experiment in this Dáil was a very excellent and successful experiment, but it might not always prove so.  I would like also that the Ministry would consider the matter that has been mentioned by the Minister for Home Affairs, because, if one looks down through the list of amendments consequential upon the adoption of this motion now under the attention of the Dáil; it will be found that the mover of this motion proposes that University representation should be removed from the Seanad.  I believe that it would be unwise to have University representation, in any case, in both Chambers.  If it is to be introduced into the Chamber it should be removed from the Seanad, and I imagine that there would be hardly any difficulty in respect of contractual obligations undertaken by the Ministry to remove such representation from the Seanad.  In view of the nature of the persons who have advocated the motion now under the consideration of the Dáil, and for the reasons I have given, with such guarded provisos as I have thought fit to make, I will vote for the motion.</P><P>Question put and carried.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>Yes, and any further consequential changes which will arise.  It does not seem to me disorderly to have a discussion of Article 26 for instance, three days hence.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>I think the consequential changes will be slight.  They consist largely in arranging to remove University representation from the Seanad.</P></Speaker>
<Col N="1135"/>     <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>There will be some consequential changes in Article 26.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>Yes, Article 26 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The Chamber/Dáil Eireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies determined by law.  The number of members shall be fixed from time to time by the Parliament/Oireachtas, but the total number of members of the Chamber/Dáil Eireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty-thousand of the population: Provided that the proportion between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as possible, be identical throughout the country.  The members shall be elected upon principles of Proportional Representation.  The Parliament/Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every ten years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population, but any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of the Chamber/Dáil Eireann sitting when such revision is made.&rdquo;</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>The suggestion is that the consequential amendment should be taken later on.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON"><NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt><P>Would not my first amendment meet all the requirements in Article 26: &ldquo;That the number of members shall be fixed from time to time by Parliament, and that the total number be exclusive of University members&rdquo;?  Then there is the clause we paused, that Universities shall be entitled to send representatives, and then the Minister for Local Government's Electoral Bill will provide how many there is to be, and on that we will debate the principle and qualification of the elector.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>That would be dangerous, surely, because the Bill may be easily amended by a later Dáil which might increase the representation.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON"><NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt><P>That was in my mind as a real answer to Deputy <Col N="1136"/> Johnson's objection.  My view is, that if Universities are given the franchise, and they choose to send here politicians or place-hunters, or people who may get in from anywhere else, they ought to be disfranchised.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>I understood the matter was agreed that the details of representation would come on when we were discussing the electoral law.  It is clear it is the right of any particular Dáil to make a change.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS"><NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt><P>May I point out that my original amendment was to delete Article 26, and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann (the Chamber) <i>(a)</i> shall consist of members representing constituencies to be determined by law; and <i>(b)</i> members representing the Universities in the Saorstát Eireann/ Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P><P>All you have to do to meet what we have done is to leave out the next sentence: &ldquo;Every University in the Saorstát Eireann/lrish Free State shall be entitled to elect four representatives.&rdquo; Omit that.  What I wish to come to is that all members of Dáil Eireann, that includes University representatives, how few or how many, shall be elected according to the principle of Proportional Representation to be determined by law. You will observe that reads differently from the wording of the original draft, which is according to the principle of Proportional Representation.  It occurred to me it is just possible, because at the time the Constitution is being enacted there is only one type of Proportional Representation before us, that that might be deemed to be the acceptance of the single transferable vote, whereas it is just quite possible we may adopt the Belgian system or the German system, or evolve a system of our own.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>That amendment is not before us now, and we cannot have a discussion at the moment on that point, as it will be left to the Ministry to amend this particular clause in the light of what the position is and bring it up at a later reading, and the question is whether we shall amend it here now or postpone the discussion on Article 26 to a later date.</P></Speaker>
<Col N="1137"/>     <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I think it would be better if left to the Ministry to draft any amendment or suggestion made by Deputy Johnson, and it should be reported back to us after we had finished with the clause on the Seanad.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>That was what I suggested.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>It would be better, I think, if the Amendments 2 and 3 on the Orders of the Day&mdash;either that or No. 1&mdash;were to be accepted as the general line of the changes necessary to be made.  The only reason I bring this about is, I happen to know, because of previous experience of this Article, that it is already sufficiently cumbersome as it stands, and I think it removes University representation altogether from it, save in one single sentence by way of proviso, and to remove it in an entirely new article would be simpler and clearer in the general body of the Constitution.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>We propose to amend Article 26 in view of the decision the Dáil has given by accepting Deputy Fitzgibbon's amendment, and further down to insert after the word &ldquo;members,&rdquo; in line 4, the words &ldquo;exclusive of members for the University,&rdquo; and we would deal with the question of University representation in a separate Article.  As regards any deletion that will be necessary because of the decision that is come to, it seemed to be provided for in the contingent amendments upon the paper.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>Yes, but the Minister now moves this clause subject to certain amendments.  That practically points to the form in which it will come before us.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>It does not seem to be very vital, but what is proposed is exactly what was agreed to at the beginning.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>I formally move Article 29, which is as follows:&mdash; &ldquo;The Senate/Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who have done honour to the Nation by reason of useful public service, or who, because of special qualifications or attainments, represent important aspects of the Nation's life.&rdquo; One might say that that Article contains nothing of value or importance that would justify its existence in the Constitution; but at least it is a useful headline. &ldquo;Citizens who have done honour to the Nation by reason of useful public service.&rdquo; You could not imagine a man being compelled to defend his title to membership of the Seanad, say, in the Law Courts, and a Judge sitting solemnly to decide whether he had done honour to the Nation, or useful public service; but as an indication of the kind of body we would wish Seanad Eireann to be, I think the Clause might remain.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>I agree with the Minister that this particular Clause is quite useless in the Constitution, because there is nothing to guarantee that the electors who will elect these various Senators, will follow the advice given in the clause and elect citizens who have done honour to the nation. My amendment deals rather with the principle of this whole series of clauses as to the composition of the Seanad.  I would prefer, on the whole, a Single Chamber, but the Dáil is agreed that the Legislature shall comprise two Houses. Therefore it is desirable that the Second Chamber should be the best possible. One of the reasons for the particular form of Seanad that is being devised in the <Col N="1140"/> Constitution has passed, because the Universities are now going to have representation in the Dáil, and therefore thsir particular plea for special representation in the Seanad does not arise.  I put forward in this amendment a proposition; I am not going to stand by it in every detail; I am not pretending that it fills the bill entirely.  I desire to raise the principle, just as the principle of representation of the Universities in the Dáil was raised in the last amendment. The proposition is that, instead of having a small correctional Chamber, or a cooling Chamber, as the Minister described it, we should have an active Second Chamber selected by the whole of the electorate on vocational lines.  The suggestion is that all voters should be qualified to vote not only for representation of their locality&mdash;territorial representation&mdash;but should also be qualified to vote for the representation of their particular vocations or occupations.  The suggestion is that the whole of the community may fairly well be divided into ten, twelve, or fifteen main constituencies, based upon occupation.  The elector would choose the occupation in which he desired to have his name registered, and in the election for the Second Chamber he would use that particular qualification. The advantage lies in this, that you would get away directly from mere territorial politics, and for very many subjects, especially subjects affecting the economic and social life of the community, you would have representatives who would possess expert knowledge.  If such a Seanad were elected, it would naturally follow that when agriculture, say, was being discussed, the members elected by the agricultural constituency would have a special voice in the discussion of that particular subject.  It would be an agricultural committee of the Chamber, and it would revise the particular measure under discussion, would promote measures affecting the industry, and be able to expound thoroughly upon all agricultural matters, having had them fully discussed by all sections in the agricultural world before coming to the Chamber.  Similarly, the same procedure could be adopted in regard to other occupations, such as transport, education, law, etc.  I believe by frankly accepting this principle we would be going a long way to obviating very many difficulties that will arise in <Col N="1141"/> the future, and we would make the Legislature very much more influential in the actual social life of the people. It will then become a thing closely associated with the living organism called the community.  One argument was used in the last discussion which, I think, might be much more effectively used in this discussion.  That is in regard to the invitation to our friends in the North-East.  Supposing you have a textile constituency, a constituency representing all the workers in the textile industries, that particular representation will have a chance of going through, closely and effectively, any scheme or proposal that might be brought before the Legislature.  You would then have in that Legislature a body of men who were elected by virtue of their special knowledge in that particular subject, and inevitably, as things are to-day, they would be drawn from the North-East corner.  In so far as there is any genuine basis for fears in that corner of the country, it lies in the belief that shipbuilding, linen and textile industries would be unfairly dealt with by a Parliament which would be predominantly agricultural.  Here you have one means at least of getting over that difficulty, but apart from that I believe it would be found inherently valuable as a working machine to have a Chamber composed of men elected by constituencies based upon the day by day occupation of the people.  I beg to formally move this amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;To delete Articles 29 to 33 inclusive, and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;The Senate/Seanad shall be composed of one hundred and fifty members representative of all the principal economic functions in the Saorstát and elected directly by the citizens. For the purpose of this election every citizen shall be entitled to have his or her name entered upon the register of voters in one or other of the following Industrial or Service Constituencies, viz.:&mdash;</P><P>Agriculture, Horticulture, and other Land-working Industries.</P><P>Domestic and Personal Services.</P><P>Land-transport and Communications.</P><P>Water-transport, Docks, Harbours, and Fisheries.</P></Speaker>
<P><Col N="1142"/> Commerce, Distribution and Exchange.</P><P>Constructional Works&mdash;Building and Civil Engineering.</P><P>Engineering and Shipbuilding Industries.</P><P>Food Preparation Industries.</P><P>Textiles and Clothing Industries.</P><P>Education and Health Services.</P><P>Public Administrative Services.</P><P>Law and Religion.</P><P>Miscellaneous Industries.</P><P>Miscellaneous Services.</P><P>The methods of election to the Senate/Seanad, and the delimitation of constituencies, shall be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe"><NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Blythe):</NameTxt><P>Although for reasons, which I think are good reasons, I am opposed to this amendment, I am very glad that Deputy Johnson brought it forward, and that it is to be discussed here.  Proposals, such as these are being canvassed in many countries at the present time, and I think the underlying idea is a good and sound idea, and one which is very likely to be adopted eventually, but it is an idea which has not been considered in this country, and an idea which very few in this assembly have given sufficient consideration to.  It is one which would require a detailed scheme to be considered very carefully and submitted to the people before, I think, we would be entitled to adopt it.  This is the sort of amendment which, I think, might come on in a year or two as a constitutional amendment to go before the people. Obviously, if it were to be adopted now, apart from the risk there would be in adopting a principle which had not been considered by the representatives of the people to any great degree, and, I should say, scarcely considered seriously by any considerable section of the people, there would be an objection that we could not get through this business of Constitution-making in any reasonable time, that we could not have the Seanad in any reasonable time, and be able to get on with the work, and that we would also be involved in a breach of certain arrangements which the Ministry have made. Those are reasons which are sufficient to indicate that this is not really the time to rush into the adoption of this thing, <Col N="1143"/> and it would properly come on later in the Dáil as a proposed Constitutional Amendment.  I believe it would be a very good thing to give us a second Chamber, which would be elected on a different basis, and which would view things from an entirely different angle from the first Chamber.  On the other hand, the adoption of a principle like this might involve very considerable consequential changes.  This could only be accepted, if ever, as a scheme for a second Chamber.  It could never be adopted where there would be two Chambers.  It seems to me, to make this scheme work, it would be necessary to abolish Proportional Representation in the first Chamber.  Under Proportional Representation you do get, to some extent, a vocational representation in an indirect way, but you do get it; if you were to have a pure or citizen representation as distinct from vocational representation it would involve, in my opinion, an abolition of Proportional Representation.  That is another consideration, to my mind, for holding that the subject of the proposed amendment could not be adequately considered now, and is, in that sense, a premature thing. I think that nowhere has there really been a scheme worked out yet.  The whole matter is rather in the germ stage, but I think it was a very good thing that it should, at least, be mentioned.  I do not know that it could ever involve us in one of those pious aspiration clauses, but, in a sense, to have it brought forward as a pious aspiration, it is good; even though it is not embodied in the clause.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I am very glad to see this amendment here, proposed by Deputy Johnson, because it reminds me of many excellent discussions that he and I had on this very subject in respect of certain commercial matters and inquiries made during the past two or three years.  I rather expected to see such an amendment proposed by him. I gathered from a certain comment made by him on one occasion that he rather expected to see something like this proposed in the Constitution.  I would like to point out to him that in the Seanad provisions as they stand these industrial, vocational, or occupational constituencies are given an opportunity for creating themselves.  This matter of <Col N="1144"/> occupational representation was very carefully considered.  Deputy Johnson has made a list of many occupational constituencies.  It is optional for any citizen to permit himself to be registered in respect of any one occupation.  He states he does not claim, any finality for any such list as he proposes, and very rightly, because once one attempts to make out a list with that kind of finality that is really required you discover that ultimately it is impossible to segregate them into their proper categories. It is as a pious aspiration this is to be welcomed, but when that pious aspiration is put down in actual practical detail with the intention of adopting it in a Constitution in such practical detail, without which it cannot be considered in any Constitution, it is at that moment that one discovers that the whole thought in this country, or any other country, has not yet achieved that clarity which is required, and that clarity will never be achieved until it follows after the actual practical work of experimentation in social or political experiments as the case may be.  Therefore, seeing that circumstances being as they are, it is impossible to adopt any such proposition, or to embody any such proposition in the Constitution, I suggest that the next best thing to be done has been done.  I suggest by making the whole Free State one constituency for the election of the Seanad in effect and in practice, in the course of two or three or five or six years it would mean that in the election to the second Seanad you will get the nation practically working as one whole, and different parts of the nation will cohere in their natural formation, and so be created one large constituency, and remove that particular local appeal from regional association.  You are creating associations that are not local, and that are not regional, and that must of necessity become functional and occupational. I suggest to Deputy Johnson that to anyone who has thought over this the proposal he has put forward must commend itself to the deepest interest and sympathy, but that the time is not ripe enough for the practical working out in detail, and that the Constitution has provided for the Seanad some method by which these provisions he has put down here may be worked out in practical detail.  The general outline is put up, <Col N="1145"/> and the filling up of that outline is left to the experience of the future.  I hope that functional and occupational representation will become a living factor in the Seanad; I go further, and I say that I think it must needs be so.  I think that the best thing would be in any Parliament for any Nation you ought to have two Chambers, and I believe that both Chambers should function.  Perhaps the two Chambers will function more completely than in this Constitution; that can be a matter for amendment in the future, as the Seanad becomes more and more a living reality.  If it can be proved to be the case, I cannot conceive any transitory construction of powers which, after all, are mere matters of intellectual abstraction.  Those matters have to wait for living experience!  I can imagine no better consideration than, first, to have two Houses&mdash;one House representative of the geographical areas, and another representative of the functional or occupational services.  For that reason I suggest that the amendment might be withdrawn, inasmuch as the substance and body of the amendment are present in the Constitution as it stands. I do not think it quite true to say, as its advocates have said, that Article 29 as it stands is quite so pious as it appears.  I merely suggest that those who read the provisions for the Seanad should read those provisions without the statement in Article 29, and then read the provisions with the statement. Although it is actually the case that no one Senator can be held in law&mdash;because he, in your opinion or mine, may be&mdash;to be a person held to possess all the necessary qualifications, notwithstanding the provisions that fare set out in their actual working, and giving a headline, and qualified by that headline to have a certain meaning, and if that headline be withdrawn the meaning would be lacking. If that headline was withdrawn and the meaning, the practical working of the Constitution might be entirely different from what it would be without the meaning.  For these reasons I vote against the amendment, because I think it premature and unnecessary, and I shall vote for the Article, not because I think it necessary, but because I think it is a very useful headline.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAL O SEANAIN CATHAL O SEANAIN"><NameTxt>CATHAL O SEANAIN:</NameTxt><P>Aontuighim leis an leas-rún.  An lá fé dheire dubhart <Col N="1146"/> nach maith liom dhá thigh a bheith san Oireachtas, ach má tá sé raichtanach go mbeidh dhá tigh ann b'fhearr liom an dara tigh seo atá sa leas-rún ná an dara tigh atá sa Bhun-reacht.  In supporting Deputy Johnson's amendment I should like to specify one of the points he made in favour of it, and that is this: It is well known that the economic or, if you may put it that way, the material things that bind certain people in one part of Ireland with certain people in another part of Ireland are a far stronger and in a way more intimate than the political things that bind them, and while I do not want to enter into anything like controversial or Party matters in this thing, I think we all have experience that, for instance, the agriculturist in the North, as an agriculturist, has a great deal more in common with the agriculturist in the South than he has as a citizen in the North with a fellow agriculturist as a citizen in the South, and so through the various categories of the people of whom the amendment speaks as carrying out the principal economic functions. For that reason I think I am in agreement with Deputy Johnson that this will give a fairer chance of a natural combining of the strata of society, if I might put it in that way, of combining the North with the corresponding strata in the South, because the political differences have been largely artificial, but the economic common interest is not artificial but is a deep and inevitable thing in nature.  If provision were made in the Constitution for some such object as this I think it would help to bring together the different categories now divided in Ireland, the farmer with a farmer, textile people with the textile people, and the same with people of similar industry in the rest of Ireland, and right on through the fourteen or fifteen sections enumerated in the amendment. Besides that I think it would be quite a strong safeguard, a stronger safeguard than any paper safeguard that could be put up for minorities of all descriptions without any exception, whether political, religious, industrial or any other kind of minority, because it would give them their value and nothing more than their value in this Dáil.  As I said the other day, I am opposed on the whole to two-Chamber Parliaments. I prefer a single-Chamber Parliament, indeed my whole inclination is in favour <Col N="1147"/> of a single Chamber.  Perhaps it is premature at the present stage to look for the complete abolition of the territorial or political representation, but I think this might meet the fears that have been expressed, because I do not want the second Chamber merely to be a cooling one, and apart altogether from the controversial or party, or class arguments, that I might have against the second House as in the Constitution.  I want&mdash;if there is to be a second Chamber&mdash;that Chamber to perform certain definite and essential functions, to reflect the most important things in modern life.  Now we all know that there has been an evolution in the system of representation.  We know generally the origin and the purposes and the reasons for territorial representation.  We know, too, that the causes that gave rise to that kind of representation have very largely passed to here.  You have, in modern life, a new demarcation, so to speak, of functions.  That is a real thing, and these classes are performing real functions and exercising real powers. We would want to put that in a framework or machinery in which they realise those powers to the utmost.  The Minister, and, perhaps, some others, may think that this would interfere with this system or agreement as to Proportional Representation in the first Chamber.  I do not think that, and I do not agree with him, that under Proportional Representation we get representation in an indirect kind of way.  I do not agree that we do, but we would have it distinctly and clearly if we had a second Chamber on those lines, because, as I said at the previous debate, when you have an election with a five or six-member constituency at the present moment, the voter does not vote, except a few, for a candidate because he happens to belong tc a particular avocation or occupation, or industrial service.  He votes for him as being representative of a definite body of political thought.  That is what we call party representation.  That is what we have in the present system.  This would do away with it in the second Chamber.  In your second Chamber, as outlined in the Constitution, you would have the same thing.  People will not vote because of occupational or professional qualifications or anything like that.  They will vote because a particular <Col N="1148"/> candidate stands for a particular body of political thought.  We want to get away from that thing.  I do not see that that is provided for, although Deputy Figgis makes out it is in the arrangements for the Seanad as in the Constitution, because, even that the Constitution makes the Free State a constituency, and even though it may be that that gets the same effect, what it gets is a political or citizen representation, and so far as it deals with legislation, legislation from the citizen or political angle.  What we want to get is a view-point from another angle, that is, the functional or occupational services.  That is, to my mind, of greater importance and greater power in Ireland and everywhere else than the political one.  I don't think the arguments the Minister used that because this is not being considered by many people in the Dáil it should be rejected are right.  It is a reason why it should get a thorough good discussion, and it really shows the fact that many members of the Dáil have not been thinking of, or discussing, things like this.  It shows that we have to go a long way in the Dáil before we will be able to draft a Constitution which will be a framework of our whole future.  I support the amendment.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. T.

I accept that at once.  I would argue the same with many other provisions of this Constitution.  It is a very sad thing that so momentous a document is being passed through this Chamber without having an adequate discussion in the country.  I am not going to be guilty of some of the things the Ministers are guilty by asking to embody this clause without adequate discussion.  I hope it will be found possible at later stages to provide for easier amendments in the Constitution than has been anticipated, and with that in view I have proposed the amendment as a sort of First Reading, then to leaye it over for future discussion.  With the permission of the Chamber I withdraw this amendment.</P><P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P></Speaker>
<Col N="1149"/>     <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>The proposition with regard to Article 29 is, that it should be deleted.  I anticipate that the following amendment may be accepted by the Ministry, and, therefore, I prefer to withdraw the clause insomuch as the Ministers have indicated that there is some value in Article 29, which I cannot see, but which they may be able to see better.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. K. O'HIGGINS Mr. K. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. K. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>The only little value I see in Article 29, as it stands, is that it is a headline for the election of Senators in the future.  It is not as ideal as if the Senator would be selected directly from the people.  There would be no person elected to the Seanad&mdash;after the first Seanad&mdash;who has not been placed upon a panel as eligible by Dáil Eireann, the voting to be upon Proportional Representation.  As an indication of the line future Parliaments should take in selecting people to go on the panel for election to the Seanad, that Article may have some utility.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY"><NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY:</NameTxt><P>I think that the amendment that I am proposing to Article 29 will be acceptable.  I propose this innocent little amendment with the object of safeguarding the dignity of the Oireachtas.  The Article, as it stands, says: &ldquo;The Senate shall be composed of citizens who have done honour to the Nation by reason of useful public service, or who, because of special qualifications or attainments, represent important aspects of the Nation's life.&rdquo;  Now, every lawyer in this Assembly will agree with me that there is no doubt whatever that any one of those tests of the right to stand for the Seanad might be dragged before the Law Courts.  And it will be a very humiliating thing for our Parliament if, because an unpopular or, even say, an undesirable person managed to get elected, you could have his record canvassed in the Law Courts with a view to getting rid of his election.  It would be <i>infra dig.</i>  Take the case of the next election, you are going to have people elected, and you are going to have people nominated.  One of the elected men, or one of the nominated men, may be, to many people, an objectionable person.  Whether a man is a person who has done honour to the Nation is very often a matter of opinion. Whether a man is a man who has given useful public service, or who, because of <Col N="1150"/> special qualifications or attainments, represents important aspects of the Nation's life, is very often a matter of opinion.  And I think it would be deplorable to have that matter fought out in the Law Courts because some crank objected to the person who was elected to the Seanad.  Suppose, for example, that I was a very cantankerous person, and supposing my pet aversion got elected to the Senate, and supposing I got a glorious opportunity of exposing the record and the past life of that pet aversion&mdash;&mdash;</P></Speaker>

Well, under this Constitution as it stands I, being a malignant person who would take pleasure in doing this, would have a perfect right under this Article as it stands to create all the mischief and create all the unpleasantness I could by challenging the right of this gentleman to get elected to the Seanad.  I do not think it would be the proper way. I think the fact that Mr. So-and-So was elected should be sufficient.  It is better, even if the wrong man got in, than that the qualifications of Senators should be made the butt of private malice or, if you like, of anyone who objects to any particular individual. That should be out of the reach of the Law Courts.  It will not do any good to have that dragged into the Law Courts. Therefore, I add this provision in my amendment and I move after the words &ldquo;Nation's life&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;provided that the eligibility as a Senator, within the terms of this Article, of a citizen who shall have been elected a Senator, shall not be questioned at law.&rdquo;</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>With reference to that amendment, we do not feel that there is any grave danger, even under the Article as it stands, of the eligibility of Senators being questioned in a court of law, but I wonder, after what has been expressed, if this alteration in the wording of the clause would meet with general approval.  It is: &ldquo;The Senate/ Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens, who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the Nation by reason of useful public service, or that, because of special qualifications or attainments they represent important aspects of the Nation's life.&rdquo;</P></Speaker>

I do not represent anybody calling themselves Southern Unionists, or anything of that sort.  The people who purported to represent Southern Unionists when they were discussing certain matters with the Irish representatives in London&mdash;I do not consider them as representing me.  I represent the constituency that sent me here, and I am satisfied, and take on my own shoulders the responsibility of deleting University representation, or moving that it be deleted, in consideration of the great concession this House has made in placing University representatives in the Dáil, to assist in the legislation, instead of being put into a cooling chamber.  So far as I and those who represent the University here are concerned we will, as far as we can, absolve the Government of a charge of breach of faith with these people with whom they made arrangements.  The Ministry said at the beginning that they put in the clauses in deference to people who negotiated with them.

On behalf of that University I associate myself with him in saying that I am prepared to accept the withdrawal of this clause.  I quite clearly imply that I cannot speak for the other representatives, but, on behalf of one representative, I can tell you he is also prepared to accept the withdrawal in consideration of the concession made giving University representation in the Dáil.  But I would suggest to the Minister for Home Affairs to notify the three gentlemen who claimed to represent Southern Unionists, and see if they are satisfied with the alteration.</P><P>The following amendment stood in the name of Deputy Darrell Figgis to Article 30:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;To substitute in the second sentence, instead of the following words, &lsquo;The number of Senators exclusive of University Members shall be fifty-six&rsquo; the words &lsquo;the number of Senators exclusive of University Members shall be forty-four.&rsquo; &rdquo;</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>The amendment I am proposing for Article 30 may <Col N="1154"/> appear at first sight to run into conflict with a paper circulated amongst us scheduling a certain agreement made, to which the mover of the previous amendment has already referred.  If that were to be made a case by those with whom the Ministry have contracted I would not propose the amendment.  I think they will be able to point out that it is not a case&mdash;that it does not come into the contract actually&mdash;no matter how much it may appear to do so at the first-glance. I wish to repeat it is not my desire that we should violate any of these contracts, and I am entirely in support of the Ministry in fulfilling them in the letter and spirit.  The Article itself reads: &ldquo;The number of Senators, exclusive of the University Members (that having been deleted), shall be fifty-six.&rdquo; At the time that these proposals were first considered they were considered in respect of an entirely new proposal, making the whole territory of Saorstat Eireann one electoral constituency.  It was perfectly well recognised that for so wide a constituency the holding of one single election imposed mathematical and arithmetical difficulties, not merely organisation difficulties actually, but simple computation.  Certain expert advice was sought on the matter, and the arithmetic of the whole thing was gone into very carefully, as well as the fact that the electoral machinery involved, and as a result of that the figure was not fifty-six.  It was increased, I take it, to fifty-six, as the Minister for Home Affairs indicated to us on a previous occasion speaking in this Dáil, and he inferred, if he did not actually state, that the intention to remove the number from the original forty to fifty-six was in the hope that the two bodies might not merely sit together in case of conflict, but vote together.  It was finally resolved, however, that if the two bodies came into conflict they should be allowed to sit together and debate together, but not to vote together.  And I think he said on that occasion strong pressure was made that they should be permitted, not merely to sit and debate together. but to actually vote together, and I suggest it was in view of voting together the number was increased from the original figure to fifty-six.  I suggest further, inasmuch as that intention failed, that the reason for increasing the figure to fifty-six also went by the <Col N="1155"/> board.  I suggest to the Minister for Home Affairs that he should consider himself, and the Ministry should consider itself, free to reconsider the whole question in face of the difficulties of organisation and computation involved in this method of election.  If you are going to take electors&mdash;and at the present moment there are about 2,000,000&mdash; you are imposing certain difficulties, very considerable difficulties, and difficulties that when these proposals first came under attention were very carefully examined.  Clearly you are going to have fifty-six members elected.  As to one-quarter for three years, that means that every three years there are to be fourteen members to be elected.  And if there are to be, as is provided in the Constitution, three times as many candidates put forward as there are members to be elected, you are going to have forty-two persons, of whom only fourteen can be elected.  That means that every three years all the voters in Ireland will receive, not a convenient list of candidates, which they can study at a glance, and of whom they may know something, but they will receive something like a small book of candidates' names against whom they will have to vote.  It has been the experience in Proportional Representation that when you get much beyond the tenth or eleventh candidate you are increasing the difficulties very considerably&mdash;difficulties inherent in the mind of the voter when he or she is actually registering his or her vote, as well as being inherent in the mind of the computer or calculator of the total result.  Therefore it was originally decided that the number should not he as great as it is here.  Seeing that the reason for increasing the number from forty to fifty-six has ceased to have any effect, having failed in its intention, I am proposing that it be brought down from fifty-six to forty-four.  That means to say that there will be eleven persons to be elected every third year, instead of fourteen.  The difference may not seem to be very great, but every one that can be shed should be shed in order to get the electoral problem stated as simply ae possible, both from the point of view of the computer and from the point of view of the elector.  Consequently, I am suggesting forty-four instead of fifty-six, giving eleven persons to be elected every third year instead of fourteen.  And <Col N="1156"/> instead of having three times as many to be elected&mdash;forty-two&mdash;I am stating twenty-five.  Consequently you get this difference between the two proposals. In the proposal in the draft you have fifty-six persons, fourteen to be elected every third year, and forty-two candidates to be put before the electors. Under the proposal I am now suggesting, with certain consequential amendments and revisions, following the sequence of Articles, you will get a Seanad of forty-four, eleven persons to be elected every third year, and not more than twentyfive candidates' names to put forward, and it is because I believe that that change will make the whole conduct of election more practicable and simple, as well as presenting a clearer and more succinct problem to the mind of the elector, who is a factor in the whole question, that I suggest this amendment should be made.  I only point out further that, if it be adopted, there are certain slight consequential alterations that would require to be made in subsequent Articles.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>So far from accepting this amendment, we would be prepared, if those who were parties to the agreement so wish, to substitute sixty for fifty-six, to make up for the University Representation that is now disappearing from the Seanad.  I want to say about that Memorandum that we circulated, as a Green Paper, that it should not have been circulated, and that it is not the text of any agreement, but some notes on that agreement that were sent to the President and myself for our information and for our use in the course of the debates here.  In the absence of the President I can make bold to say, after careful investigation of this matter, that we have discovered the fault to be his.  The text of the agreement would have been issued, and there would not have been any objection to issuing it, but this Memorandum is a matter that might be misleading, if people took it that the wording of the agreement is exactly as it stands here. I think the President himself intends to make a statement on that matter shortly.  There was considerable importance attached to the numbers of the Senate, and sixty was the figure arrived at after a discussion, and we do not propose to reduce that, if the parties to the agreement hold out for their sixty, <Col N="1157"/> but we certainly would not be inclined to bring the number down any lower than fifty-six.  We are reluctant to make use of the closure, on the discussion of any Article of the Constitution, but we would ask the Deputies to remember the value of time, and having regard to external circumstances, and even at the sacrifice of a little grace and style, to put their arguments briefly and bluntly to the Dáil, and I think it will assimilate them just as readily as when they are served up with all the sauce and dressing of eloquence.</P></Speaker>

    <Title>DEBATES ON ADJOURNMENT. - ARTICLE 34.  SECTION 2.&mdash;LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS.</Title>
<P>The Chamber/Dáil Eireann shall in relation to the subject matter of money bills as hereinafter defined have legislative authority exclusive of the Senate/ Seanad Eireann.</P><P>A Money Bill means a Bill which contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on public moneys or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them.  In this definition the expressions &ldquo;taxation,&rdquo; &ldquo;public money,&rdquo; and &ldquo;loan&rdquo; respectively do not include any taxation, money or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.</P>
<P>The Chairman of the Chamber/Dáil shall certify any Bill which in his opinion is a Money Bill to be a Money Bill, but if, within three days after a Bill has been passed by the Chamber/Dáil, two-fifths of the members of either House by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the House of which they are members so require, the question whether the Bill is, or is not, a money bill shall be referred to a Committee of Privileges consisting of three members elected by each House with a Chairman, who shall be the senior judge of the Supreme <Col N="1161"/> Court able and willing to act, and who, in the case of an equality of votes, but not otherwise, shall be entitled to vote.  The decision of the Committee on the question shall be final and conclusive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>In moving the adoption of this Clause I might state that the need for all that detail in the Clause with regard to a Money Bill arises from the fact that there is considerable dispute and controversy about the question of what is, and what is not, a Money Bill between the British House of Commons and the House of Lords, and it is to provide, so far as we can, against any friction between Seanad and the Dáil in our Constitution that this particular Article is so detailed.  First of all great trouble has been taken to define, so far as it can be defined, what is a Money Bill, and there is provision in case of a difference of opinion for arriving at a decision. The matter would be referred to a Committee of Privilege, consisting of 3 Members elected by each House, but the Chairman shall be a Judge.  The Chairman shall only exercise a Casting Vote in case of a division.</P><P>Motion made and question put: &ldquo;That Article 34 be added to the Constitution Bill.&rdquo;</P><P>Agreed.</P></Speaker>

    <Title>DEBATES ON ADJOURNMENT. - ARTICLE 37.  BILLS.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>Article 37 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Every Bill initiated in and passed by the Chamber/Dáil Eireann shall be sent to the Senate/Seanad Eireann and may, unless it be a Money Bill, be amended in the Senate/Seanad Eireann and the Chamber/Dáil Eireann shall consider any such amendment: but a Bill passed by the Chamber/Dáil Eireann and considered by the Senate/ Seanad Eireann shall, not later than two hundred and seventy days after it shall have been first sent to the Senate/ Seanad, or such longer period as may be agreed upon by the two Houses, be deemed to be passed by both Houses in its form as last passed by the Chamber/ Dáil: Provided that any Money Bill shall be sent to the Senate/Seanad for its recommendations and at a period not longer than fourteen days after it shall have been sent to the Senate/ Seanad, it shall be returned to the Chamber/Dáil, which may pass it, accepting or rejecting all or any of the recommendations of the Senate/Seanad, and as so passed shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses.  When a Bill other than a Money Bill has been sent to the Senate/Seanad a Joint Sitting of the Members of both Houses may on a resolution passed by the Senate/Seanad be convened for the purpose of debating, but not of voting upon, the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo; The purpose of this article is to keep the power of the purse <Col N="1163"/> absolutely with the Lower Chamber, absolutely with Dáil Eireann.  One might say there is not the same reason for doing so under our Constitution as under a Constitution where the Upper Chamber is not an elected body.  But the power of dealing with Money Bills in the Lower Chamber, and the importance of it, is so generally recognised, that even with the comparatively democratic Upper House that we have under this Constitution, it has been thought best to reserve it.  At the same time, it is agreed that you are likely to have in the Seanad men of considerable capacity and men of financial experience, and the discussion of Money Bills in the Seanad might be of considerable advantage both to the Dáil and the country.  A Money Bill comes along to the Seanad, and for a period, which is stated here as 14 days, it may be discussed there, and it shall then be returned to the Dáil with recommendations. The Dáil is not obliged to accept all or any of those recommendations.  It can pass the Bill in its original form, and when so passed it shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses.  It is thought useful that recommendations should come back to the Dáil from the Upper House.  The last paragraph deals with Bills other than a Money Bill. &ldquo;When a Bill other than a Money Bill has been sent to the Senate/Seanad a Joint sitting of the Members of both Houses, may on a resolution passed by the Senate/Seanad be convened.&rdquo; That is, the Seanad may ask for a joint sitting and there can be a joint debate on a Bill, but not joint sitting.  Joint voting was pressed for by some of the people we met in London, but it was not conceded. There may be very weighty measures considered here and sent along to the Seanad, and there may be a discussion in both Houses, or, say, a selected team from the Seanad would put certain, views before the Lower Chamber, that might be of considerable advantage.  The period for which the Seanad might hold up a Bill is 270 days. That is the extent of their power to check legislation.  The nine months is obviously a compromise between twelve months and six months.  Seeing that that is the chief purpose of a Second Chamber, it is intended as a check on hasty legislation.  Nine months does not seem excessive, and in the ordinary way it will be found an Upper House will be <Col N="1164"/> slow to exercise that delaying power and will only exercise it where the matter is a gravely controversial one, and one on which there will be considerable difference of opinion through the country. In cases of that kind nine months' reflection or nine months' controversy may lead to useful amendments or perhaps to wiser counsels; but in any case, if cannot do any very serious harm. That is the purpose of that portion of the article.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY"><NameTxt>Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY:</NameTxt><P>Before Deputy Figgis moves his amendment, may I say something on the motion? I think the 270 days is a great deal too long a time, but this, I take it, is one of the things put in to satisfy the apprehensions of those whom we have known as Southern Unionists, and one is so anxious to see them coming in, and taking their proper part in the building of the Nation, that one is reluctant to stand on small points.  Therefore, I do not press that, but I think it is a pity. I would, call the Minister's attention to two points that arise in this Article, which I would suggest are worthy of consideration for amendment before the next reading.  You provide that a Money Bill must be sent to the Seanad for its recommendation and that at a period of not more than 14 days after the Seanad gets the bill, it must be returned; but you do not say what is to happen if the Seanad should be obstreperous and refuse to return the bill.  That may not be likely to happen, but on the other hand it is a thing to bear in mind.  You may have a row between both Houses over a particular bill, and a slight change in wording now would make it perfectly clear that the Seanad is not entitled to hold up the passing of a Money Bill by refusing to return it.  If you provide that the Seanad may retain the Bill for not more than 14 days, whereupon the Dáil shall proceed, or something to that effect, instead of using the words &ldquo;shall be returned,&rdquo; you get over the difficulty.  There is another point.  I think, in view of the provision in Article 46 for a referendum, which may be petitioned for within a period of 90 days from the day on which a bill is passed, or is deemed to have been passed, it is essential that one should be quite certain as to the date on which the bill is passed, or is deemed to have been passed.  You will find in Article 37 <Col N="1165"/> that in certain events a bill is deemed to be passed by both Houses in its form as last passed by the Chamber.  I suggest &ldquo;deemed to be passed at such a date as the Dáil may decide,&rdquo; or words to that effect, would be more suitable. The same thing occurs in Article 39, and I think it would be desirable to make it perfectly clear exactly at what date a bill is deemed to be passed. Where a bill is deemed to be passed, unless you make your wording quite clear, nobody will know from what precise date the ninety days start running. I would like the Members of the Cabinet to look into this matter and to make these points clearer.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>My amendment is:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;To substitute instead of the words &lsquo;at a period not longer than fourteen days after it shall have been sent to the Senate&rsquo; the words &lsquo;at a period not longer than one calendar month after it shall have been sent to the Senate.&rsquo; &rdquo;</P><P>My reason for that can be very simply stated.  There will be persons in the Senate who, if the Senate fulfils its hopes, will be of special financial corn petence, or, at least, the Senate may hold persons of special financial competence and there is no special advantage gained by hurrying the Finance Bill through one fortnight.  There may be in the Senate some congestion of business, and it would be just as well to give every opportunity for getting as full consideration of financial matters as would be possible If the Senate is to be a cooling chamber there are few matters that require greater cooling, or where cooling would be of greater service than a measure affecting the expenditure of money.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>I would like to say, not touching the amendment, but touching the Article itself, nine months of a delay in the Seanad may immediately be followed by another three months That is a considerable time for the Seanad to be allowed to hold up a Bill, unless there is very specific reason to be adduced.  I think we should reduce that 270 days to six months, if that would meet with agreement.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT"><NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt><P>I do not think, unless the Dáil particularly requests it, that there is much reason for accepting <Col N="1166"/> the amendment.  If a Money Bill sent to the Seanad for recommendation does not take precedence of any Bill which may happen to be before them it cannot be of very great importance, and while it might be well in some cases to give very careful consideration to Money Bills, there are other occasions upon which it may be necessary to impose taxation, or something of that sort, immediately, and one loses a fortnight of valuable time.  Fourteen days is a long time, and I think any Money Bill could be discussed in that time, even allowing for any other business on hands.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>Normally I do not imagine more than a fortnight would be required.  A Money Bill might go to the Seanad dealing with some complicated question of finance, where a fortnight would not be adequate for its consideration and discussion.  Normally I would imagine it would take under a week, or not more than ten days, but exceptional circumstances have also to be provided for.  Clearly some financial question might be so complicated as to require more than a fortnight.</P></Speaker>

That would leave it in the power of the Dáil to make arrangements; if the Dáil came to the conclusion that another week would be necessary they could enlarge the time. It would take away the peremptory fourteen days.  I am certainly of opinion that power ought to be kept in the hands of this Dáil.</P></Speaker>

As to Deputy Gavan Duffy's point, I do not agree there is that vagueness which he suggests.  The Article provides &ldquo;and at a period not longer than fourteen days after it shall have been sent to the Senats/Seanad it shall be returned to the Chamber/Dáil. which may pass it, accepting or rejecting all or any of the recommendations of <Col N="1167"/> the Senate/Seanad, and as so passed shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses.&rdquo;</P></Speaker>

<P>&ldquo;So soon as any Bill shall have been passed, or deemed to have been passed by both Houses, the Executive Council shall present the same to the Representative of the Crown for the signification by him, in the King's name, of the King's assent, and such Representative may withhold the King's assent, or reserve the Bill for the signification of the King's pleasure.

It is recognised as such by all those who claim to be authorities on Constitutional matters <Col N="1169"/> and to be accepted as writers on Constitutional matters.  The veto is as dead in the Dominions as it is in England, where ordinary domestic legislation is concerned.  It could be exercised in matters affecting either England or any of the Dominions, but to say that the Veto is entirely obsolete, and to suggest that it must be automatic on the advice of the Executive Council, is not accurate, inasmuch as the most forward of the Dominion statesmen say that if an Act were passed repealing this Treaty or an Act were passed repudiating the Crown, you cannot write it down as part and parcel of the function of the Representative of the Crown to signify the King's assent to that, but there may be no real fear of this Veto.  This is a nominal and theoretical veto, and there need be no tendency to take what is set out here in this Article at its literal or face value.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I move an amendment to Article 40:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;To omit in the first paragraph, after the words &lsquo;provided that the Representative of the Crown shall in the withholding of such assent to or reservation of any Bill act&rsquo; all further words and to substitute the following, &lsquo;on the advice of the Executive Council.&rsquo; &rdquo;</P><P>It is not suggested there is any difference in meaning between the two; the law, practice and constitutional usage in Canada is that there shall be no disallowance except on the advice of the Executive Council and that where any difference should occur it is not to be over the reservation or disallowance or veto, but a question for the determination of the Courts.  In that connection I would like to read the words respecting this that it should be on the records. Sir Robert Borden says the following on the Canadian law, practice and constitutional usage:&mdash;</P></Speaker>
<P>&ldquo;It appears that but one Act of the Dominion Parliament has been disallowed. It was passed in 1873, and empowered any committee of the Senate or House of Commons to examine witnesses upon oath when so authorised by resolution.  There was confusion of opinion as to the competency of Parliament to enact it. The law officers of the United Kingdom eventually advised that the Act <Col N="1170"/> was <i>ultra vires</i>, and it was accordingly disallowed for that reason and not upon considerations of policy. Disallowance of either Dominion or Provincial legislation on this ground is practically obsolete.  Such questions are properly for the Courts.  Several Acts, however, have been reserved, and some of them have not gone into operation as they did not receive the assent of the Queen in Council.</P><P>&ldquo;Probably this course was taken with the consent, if not at the instance, of the Canadian Government. The power of disallowance has not been exercised by the British Government for more than fifty years, and while it still has a legal existence, it may be regarded as constitutionally dead.&rdquo;</P><P>I need not stress these words because they were written by a man who was at the time Canadian Premier, and he had access to the records in that particular instance.  He would not have used words so grave if he had not very good reason for it.  Having stated that the power of disallowance may be regarded as constitutionally dead, he proceeded:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;Similarly the power of reservation has been little used in recent practice, as a suspending clause is usually inserted in any measure, the provisions of which require negotiation with the British Government or further consideration or action by the Dominion Government before they may properly become operative.&rdquo;</P>
<P>There are other quotations one could give.  Quite clearly it is laid down that the law, practice and constitutional usage in Canada, according to the authority of the Canadian Premier at the time he wrote that book, is that no such withholding of assent and no such reservation should proceed in the law, practice and constitutional usage in Canada except on the advice of the Executive Council.  It may be asked if there is no difference, why ask for the substitution of one form of words if they both mean the same thing.  That would be a reasonable objection to make to the amendment except for one little matter.  The question may arise where urgency was the very essence of the problem.  If we had it exactly in these words which define the usage in Canada <Col N="1171"/> to-day it would not be possible that an urgent question of that kind could be held up while negotiations were proceeding across the Atlantic to discover what was the usage.  In any case, knowing what the usage is, it is better to put it in the Constitution clearly and definitely what that usage is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY"><NameTxt>Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY:</NameTxt><P>I support this amendment very strongly, or alternatively one that is down in my name, namely, to the &ldquo;law, practice, and Constitutional usage, etc., of Canada,&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;where the power of veto is obsolete.&rdquo; I think that it will be more profitable to discuss this matter on the next Reading than now, because I realise this is a Clause which Ministers will have to consider very carefully before they agree to alter and it is one that is worth considering carefully.  I think the view expressed by the Minister just now understates the rights ths Dominions have.  One of the troubles in dealing with this question at the moment is that the Constitutional Conference has not met.  I maintain the veto is dead literally, and where there is a dispute between Downing Street and the Dominions, that dispute must be settled by arbitration.  It may be by the Dominion Council or other arbitration. But the veto is definitely gone, and arbitration will take its place.  Now, if that be so, and if Ministers do not see their way to meet some of us in this matter we will have to press it later on, and give chapter and verse for that assertion. If that be so it is obviously dan gerous to insert words which imply the existence of a real live veto &ldquo;Provided that the Representative of the Crown shall in the withholding such assent to or the reservation of any Bill.&rdquo; Referring to the withholding or reservation as a thing he intends to do, as a real live thing in constitutional usage, as a real live thing that is going on to-day, these words are extremely objectionable, because they give colour to the suggestion that is put forward in certain quarters in England that this veto is not dead, or, at least, is not dead for certain purposes. I should like to see these words changed or qualified.  Here you have a case where the old law has gone in, which we want to get rid of.  If England is en titled to say &ldquo;we must have the law there,&rdquo; we are entitled to say, &ldquo;well, <Col N="1172"/> then we must have the constitutional usage.&rdquo; Deputy Figgis suggests the addition of that.  My motion suggests, if you must put down the law, at least tell us the law is dead.  Be clear and explicit in cases like this.  Either the veto is dead or alive.  If it is alive we should know how far it is alive.  I think that we can satisfy the Dáil that it is no longer exercisable.  Even in the case of Queensland the other day two Bills were withheld from Royal assent because they were confiscatory.  These Bills appeared to be unfair.  Nevertheless, Downing Street was compelled in the end to agree to these Bills, and the Royal assent was given, because even in the case of a Colony, not a Dominion, the veto is dead. There is another objection I should like to point out before passing from this Clause Every time you mention the Crown you are mentioning something which will be apt to be interpreted in practice in London if you have a reactionary. Ministry, as the equivalent of Downing Street.  One knows it is Downing Street decides these things.  Where you propose to put down an explicit power given to the Crown as a real thing, you are putting down something which British statesmen will only be too glad hereafter to translate as another power for Downing Street.  The people who will function and exercise the power of veto will not be an Irish Ministry, but the Ministry in Downing Street.  That is why I am very anxious to see these words changed, so as to express what is, in fact, the present right of veto.  If the veto is dead let us say so.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS"><NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt><P>I rise to oppose the amendment, and in doing so I shall be very brief, because I agree that the Third Reading is the proper place for a full discussion.  It seems to me that Deputy Figgis's amendment substitutes one form of words for another, of which in the resolution they are the equivalent, and does not leave it any better; in fact, I venture to suggest it leaves us a great deal worse, because in all this debate, wherever the phrase &ldquo;In accordance with the law, practice and Constitutional usage of Canada&rdquo; comes in, Deputy Gavan Duffy has been meticulously careful to insist that we should take these three together, not as separate factors, but as conjoint factors, so that whatever Canada has achieved <Col N="1173"/> in its Constitutional development, is to be ours.  Supposing that view prevails which is the most favourable view of the Irish interpretation of the Treaty? In Article 40, it is provided:&mdash;&ldquo;So soon as any Bill shall have been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses, the Executive Council shall present the same to the Representative of the Crown for the signification by him, in the King's name, of the King's assent, and such Representative may withhold the King's assent or reserve the Bill for the signification of the King's pleasure; Provided that the Representative of the Crown shall in the withholding of such assent to or the reservation of any Bill, act in accordance with the law, practice, and Constitutional usage governing the like withholding of assent or reservation in the Dominion of Canada.&rdquo; The result of Mr. Duffy's amendment is that the King is to act through and by the advice of his Ministers.  The speech of General Smuts in the Union Parliament on September 18th, 1919, declares in unmistakable language the veto is dead, the veto is obsolete; and again in connection with the third passage he says the veto is dead.  We have the declaration of Sir Robert Borden&mdash;&ldquo;The veto is dead.&rdquo; That, I know, was in the minds of many Deputies here when discussing the relations of the King and our Legislature. Now on yesterday in regard to the oath we again had the idea here that the King is the British King and under the English Constitutional usage is pledged to act by the advice of his Ministers; but we must not lose sight of the fact that the King in relation to the Dominions is obliged to act on the advice of his Ministers, and our status, in the Union of Free Nations, is the status of Canada.  Therefore, taking that view, it seems to me that Deputy Darrell Figgis' amendment is really puting us at the best in the same position as Article 40.  So long as the words of the Treaty are retained we shall be able to look round at the Canadian practice and the practice in other Dominions and say, &ldquo;Good, this being so, that is what Ireland is entitled to,&rdquo; whereas in the words of Deputy Darrell Figgis they are merely a declaration on the part of this Dáil, apparently detached, speaking for itself, and with no authority, but an authority that the <Col N="1174"/> British Cabinet in Downing Street would not recognise.  Then, he put forward on the part of Ireland a claim to the fullest extent of sovereignty.  I therefore think the amendment is objectionable on one interpretation, and is undoubtedly uncalled for.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>There are two amendments under discussion.  It seems to me that the second is much more desirable than the first.  If the first were adopted we would be in this position, that the withholding of assent is to be on the advice of the Executive Council, which is a body subject to the Dáil or to the Oireachtas, which has passed the legislation, and it would mean that the Executive Council is going against the will of the Oireachtas in advising the Government to withhold assent.  I don't think that is intended.  On the other hand, the second amendment asks us to insert the words &ldquo;where the power of the veto is obsolete.&rdquo; I take it that the implication there is, that there may be a withholding or a reservation of assent, but that there is no veto.  That seems to me to fill the bill fairly well, but I would repeat the argument that I used, and I think I was called over the coals for in another respect, that this Clause as it is framed practically invites the British Parliament to put down in an Act at the start of Saorstát Eireann the contention that there is a power of veto over Canadian legislation.  And in this matter I think we ought to range ourselves alongside the more forward and independent statesmen in the Dominions rather than on the side of those members of the British Government who maintain that the King's veto is still prevalent.  And, touching the argument of the Minister in introducing this Clause I also remembered the quotation from General Smuts, which was read by Deputy Magennis a few days ago.  It was Smuts declared that there was no veto in ordinary legislation.  The only veto that prevailed was that if they desired to secede, the King would then be bound to stand by the Constitution. And the Minister for Home Affairs suggests that that is the effective veto that is still held, and that will be held by the Crown in the case of the Irish Legislature.  But you are safeguarded from any risks of that kind by your preliminary <Col N="1175"/> Clause, by your statement of the fact that nothing in this Constitution will be repugnant to the Clauses of the Treaty, so that there is no necessity for putting this particular clause in regard to the reservation of the Crown in the body of the Constitution.  If the veto is obsolete in ordinary legislation the introduction of the phrase to the effect that it is obsolete cannot do any harm, and would support the contention of those Ministers of Canada, South Africa, and Australia that there is no ground of veto from the legislation of these Dominions; and I think we ought to support those contentions by our conduct in the draft of this Constitution, because we are led to believe that that Constitution will have to go through the British Legislature, and if they in formulating it or confirming it confirm a clause to the effect that the law, practice, and constitutional usage in respect of the Dominion of Canada includes the withholding of the assent, you are practically denying the contentions of those Dominion Ministers.</P></Speaker>

<Col N="1176"/>     <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>Deputy Gavan Duffy speaks of the Imperial Conference which is to bring the millennium.  In his mind he set more store on the writen word than on the fact.  I do not know about these conferences.  I saw a letter from Mr. Harrison in the papers which said that that conference sat last year and decided to do nothing.  We do not know whether the conference which Deputy Gavan Duffy has his eye on will ever meet, and I really do not care.  If you have the fact, that is the thing that matters, not the ink and the paper. Now, we are told that the fact is such and such in Canada, and you have set down here that this business was to be carried out in accordance with the law, practice and constitutional usage of Canada, and you get from this position that if there be any attempt to claim a right here that is a challenge to Canada and to every other Dominion, and you get that kind of joint interest and joint protection because of the common challenge that you would not get if you stood on your own footing by accepting this particular amendment of Deputy Darrell Figgis.  England could not claim to assert a right of veto here that would not be a deliberate and cold-blooded challenge to the Canadian Constitutional position.  I think that particular formula there is the formula we are aiming at, and, if possible, we should have in every matter affecting our relations with Great Britain.  The challenge here or the attempt to advance here is a challenge all round and will be resented all round.  That is the position.  Deputies ought not to run away with the idea that only they appreciate these things and only they realise their importance, and that some brain wave they had to-day, or yesterday, or the day before on this matter deserves consideration by the Government.  This Constitution was carefully considered by the Government, and any important matters in it were carefully discussed with the help of people who were undoubtedly experts, and any point that was considered of importance here was pushed as far and as hard in our relations with the British as we deemed it in the interests of this country to push it.  If people are not satisfied with the result, if they think we made an error of judgment, then let them take on, in God's name, and push it further if they can.</P></Speaker>
<Col N="1177"/>     <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>There are one or two matters I would like to urge still further on these points&mdash;just three issues.  The argument of Dominion Ministers has been quoted by Deputy Magennis and also by myself.  Sir Robert Borden and General Smuts have been brought in, and it is just as well to recognise the protestations they have made are not protestations which are admitted in Downing Street.  That is the essential fact.  Downing Street does not admit what Sir Robert Borden says on the veto, and the objection to the amendment is that we should align ourselves with regard to the arguments of the majority of the Members to the coequal members of the community rather than with the minority.  I do state here that this form of wording has aroused a certain amount of criticism in Canada&mdash;governing the withholding of consent in Canada.  That is the point of view in Downing Street.  The point in Canada is that there is no such withholding. Since Deputy Gavan Duffy's amendment has been urged as being preferable to mine, it is a matter of indifference.  But on the veto, using the word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; in this connection in reference to &ldquo;reserve,&rdquo; I believe it is applicable to veto, but not to &ldquo;reservation.&rdquo; It has occurred&mdash;and Sir Robert Borden gives an instance&mdash;when the Executive Council has advised that certain matters be reserved.  It has been suggested that that might bring the law of one community into conflict with the law of another community, and thereby create a certain amount of friction.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAL O'SHANNON CATHAL O'SHANNON"><NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON:</NameTxt><P>Although I do not like the form in which Deputy Figgis puts his amendment&mdash;I prefer Deputy Gavan Duffy's&mdash;but actually I agree, in essence, perhaps, that the Article as it stands may express the position.  But I think consideration should be given to the argument.  Deputy Figgis has mentioned now that, while Constitutional Authorities in the Dominions, like Borden and Smuts, and their Governments and peoples take one view, it is perfectly true that Downing Street does not take that view, and outside what I may call the theoretical constitutions that are mentioned those who in England occupy positions, such as Borden and Smuts in Canada and South Africa, you will not find Lloyd George, or Curzon, or Churchill, or any of these <Col N="1178"/> who are the actual powers, taking or expressing, at all events, the views expressed by Borden and Smuts.  Now, in my opinion, the veto is certainly dead and damned.  The power of reservation may not be dead; but if we have got to take the exact constitutional position as it is, let us remember, as far as Canada is concerned, the thing might be made clear long ago.  There is no power in the Canadian law and the Canadian Constitution of amending the Constitution. There is the power in this Constitution before us, and there might be in another form I can foresee, and I should like to know if the Government is going to stand up for the position that if we do things here Britain does not like, and that Britain's interference with these things constitutes a challenge to the Dominions, well and good; well, I think my friends and myself would be with the Government in that.  This amendment is one of the things on which I think we ought to stand up and have it out with Britain. There is no use in throwing in the face of the Dáil that if we do stand up Ministers here will chuck office and let ourselves carry on.  You know that is childish, and not at all in keeping with realities as this is.  Now, if the representative of the Crown with his power is going to be the real thing, and if it is going to be of any effective use, it seems to me where it can possibly be of effective use it would be as a kind of referee as between one constituent State of this Commonwealth and the others.  And the form, or something in the Article to this effect, might suit. Supposing that during the passage of a Bill, or a certain length of time after the passage of a Bill, one other Member of the Commonwealth, or even Great Britain, expressed misgivings, and said that Bill, or something in it, affected very vitally some interest of other members of the Commonwealth, I think it would be a fair thing if the Representatives of the Crown&mdash;if you take the Crown as a link between the States&mdash;thereupon withheld assent from this measure for the time being in order that the State that brought about the intervention of the Representative of the Crown might have time to settle to mutual advantage the point raised.  I think there could be no reasonable objection to withholding that assent for a certain time, maybe for days or months.  I do not think the withholding <Col N="1179"/> of consent in such case could be very well objected to. In that case, and this is a most important thing, the co-equality of this State with the other States, even with Britain, would be asserted.  I think that would be a most important thing to have asserted, and I would suggest, if the Government is at all willing to consider this thing, that that is a consideration that it might well take into account, if it does not accept the amendment and re-draft it in such a way that the arguments that have been put up might be met.  We would have here these definite things in allying ourselves with other peoples.  There are many people in the Dáil who think that we are quite good enough to go on on our own.  Give us a decision or test.  It would not only be a test, but a re-assertion of our co-equality. If the Government would stand up on a thing like this I think they would get a good deal of support in the Dáil</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS"><NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt><P>May I intrude myself, for one moment, in reply to what Deputy Darrell Figgis said just now?  I think I could provide him with quotations to show he is not quite correct in saying that while these declarations of the Dominion Ministers are good enough they do not represent what Downing Street accepts.  One quotation&mdash;I cannot give the exact words&mdash;is from a speech of Mr. Lloyd George, in which he said there was a time when Downing Street controlled the Dominions, but now the Dominions control Downing Street.  At that Imperial Conference, which was of such vast importance&mdash;the first time the Representatives of the various Dominions were called upon to confer on external policy and relations&mdash; the representatives of Canada distinctly declared, in the most unmistakeable way, the very thing which we are attempting to formulate here, and it was not contested.  It is true, as a piece of law that because another man does not contest my claim specifically, or at the moment, it is not tantamount to an acceptance of it, but in a matter of high politics like this I think it would be taken to be an estoppel.  With regard to Deputy O'Shannon's remarks just now, I would like to say the King is the link and bond and outward symbol of unity.  There is a power of reserved legislation in one Dominion if it is <Col N="1180"/> thought likely to interfere with, or destroy, or impair, the interests of another Dominion, until a conference can be held upon it.  That is a sort of reservation that hurts no one, because as the Deputy put it, it is really acting like an arbitrator or referee, and it is a most useful thing to have.  It seems to me, that as regards Deputy Darrell Figgis's amendment, that we are better off with the wording of the clause as it stands, because we have the wording of the Treaty, and that is a most decided advantage. If someone complains that the wording seems to imply that there is a reservation, I think that it is forcing the thing unfairly.  Surely to say that the reservation shall be on the advice of the Ministers of the Free State does not commit us to the doctrine that there shall be such a reservation.  Such a situation may never arise.  As a piece of history, between the passing of the British North America Act in 1867 and 1877&mdash;about 10 years&mdash;a large number of Canadian Bills were interfered with from Downing Street until the Canadians determined to stand it no longer.  They put in a protest, and ever since nothing of the kind has occurred.  You must notice this, that while the Constitutions of Australia, Canada, and our own Constitution, will be written Constitutions, yet in the case of the oldest of the Dominions there has been allowed on the part of Downing Street to grow up the development of an unwritten Constitution, and it is because that is so&mdash;and that is a very important historical fact&mdash;that this thing takes on a new significance.  All the relations of the Irish Free State to the British Crown shall be regulated by law, practice and constitutional usage.  If the law stood alone, we should be governed by the written Constitution, but with the practice and constitutional usage we get the benefit of the new development of the unwritten Constitution.  Therefore, I think there is much virtue in the words of the Treaty, even though retaining them also involves a retention of some verbiage.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAL O'SHANNON CATHAL O'SHANNON"><NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON:</NameTxt><P>With reference to what Mr. Lloyd George said, Deputy Magennis knows that that was a generalisation Mr. Lloyd George was making, as to the relations between the Dominions and Great Britain.  It was not with reference to the specific power of withholding, or reserving, or vetoing. <Col N="1181"/> I doubt if Deputy Magennis, or any other Deputy, can show an authoritative statement on this specific point from a British statesman, such as the statements we have heard from Borden and Smuts.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I am pressing this amendment, but if it is not going to be accepted by the Ministry, I would like the Minister, in any remarks he makes, to deal with the wording of this &ldquo;Provided that the Representative of the Crown shall in the withholding of such assent to order reservation of any Bill, act in accordance with the law, practice, and constitutional usage governing the like withholding of assent or reservation in the Dominion of Canada.&rdquo;</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE"><NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt><P>In reply to the question or suggestion of Deputy O'Shannon, the second last time he spoke, I need only say we will not accept the amendment, we will not withdraw the clause for consideration or amendment, and we do not think that the arguments put forward have any great weight.  Much has been made of the alleged difference of view between Downing Street and the Dominion Ministers.  If such differences existed, then it is rather an argument for retaining the clause as it is than an argument for accepting either of the amendments.  A few days ago Deputy Gavan Duffy made a very lengthy plea to us to wait for this Constitutional Conference, and not to attempt to define what was the practice and Constitutional usage of the Dominions.  Now we have Deputies upon the other tack, and the suggestion is that we shall here set down what is the practice and Constitutional usage of, say, Canada.  In the Treaty we accepted the law, practice and constitutional usage of Canada, and we are bound to it, except in so far as the other side might agree to vary the strict interpretation, and except in so far as the law might not he applicable.  In this clause we have the law set down in the first part&mdash;the clause beginning &ldquo;provided&rdquo; gives us the Constitutional usage.  It does not attempt to define precisely what the Constitutional usage is, and any statements as to that being in dispute are only arguments for retaining the clause as it is, and not for taking sides in a matter which is not in dispute.  It does not really fall upon us to fight the <Col N="1182"/> battle of the Canadians.  We know that over all domestic legislation the veto is obsolete.  In the case of Queensland&mdash; the case referred to&mdash;it was admitted that no matter how objectionable some people may feel certain legislation to be, legislation dealing with domestic matters was not by Constitutional usage subject to the veto, and assent could not be withheld.  As to this clause giving offence to Canada, I do not think that that is a matter to be taken at all seriously.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>As a question of personal explanation, I simply refer to the offence to indicate that there was a discrepancy indicated in the wording.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE"><NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt><P>It has been stated here that reservation of Bills does take place, and might rightly take place. There are cases in which I believe myself it would be the duty of the Representative of the Crown to withhold assent; for instance, in the case of a law which proposes secession or the abolition of the Crown.  Consequently there is nothing objectionable from our point of view in the assertion of the words here &ldquo;or in withholding such assent or reservation of any Bill not in accordance with the law and practice.&rdquo;  These words are not, from our point of view, objectionable, and we are not concerned with any Canadian point of view.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY"><NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY:</NameTxt><P>I think it is necessary to point out where the Minister spoke of the importance of our not taking sides in these international questions that the feeling that motived my amendment and Deputy Figgis's amendment is the fact that in the Clause we do purport to take sides&mdash;the side advocated by Downing Street&mdash;against the side advocated by the progressive Dominions.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT"><NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt><P>I must say we dispute that point absolutely and entirely. The position we take up in regard to this is exactly what is in the Treaty. We know, as Deputy Figgis, Deputy Gavan Duffy, and Deputy O'Shannon know, that the withholding of assent is practically obsolete.  We may say it is entirely obsolete.  Deputy Figgis mentioned one incident in forty years, or something like that, in Canada.  That is your guarantee.  If I was to sign a document <Col N="1183"/> to say I would pay a man an annuity the same as I had paid him for the last forty years, and had not paid him a fraction in forty years, would he be entitled to get an annuity from me?  I do not think he would.  And that is the position with regard to this matter here.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I beg to move as an amendment to delete the second paragraph of Article 40, and to insert instead thereof the following paragraph:&mdash;&ldquo;The King's pleasure in respect of any Bill reserved shall be made known within one year.  If the King's assent is withheld, and a similar or substantially similar Bill is presented within three years thereafter, the King's assent may be withheld only on the advice of the Imperial Conference.&rdquo;  Now, in the amendment as it stands here I have deliberately adopted a certain form of wording which admittedly is not very pleasing, but it is the wording of the original Article.  I think it is not very pleasant to talk in any democratic country of the King's pleasure, but the wording is the same as that of the original Article I recommend this amendment to the President because it raises a matter of very great importance.  There is nothing so far as the form of words is concerned very offensive, and I believe this form of words would be accepted on the other side instead of the second paragraph of the Article as it stands.  The recommendation was made by one who had some experience in these matters, in another place, and he proposed that this form of words would prevent a deadlock in the future.  Very often it did happen that this royal pleasure was withdrawn for over a year, and it was used to facilitate motions which are frequently put down in the English House merely as blocking motions, <Col N="1184"/> namely, to prevent all such business in the future.  The kind of legislation to which this applies is legislation which comes within the ambit of the review of what is known as an Imperial Conference, that is to say, that matters dealt with by one member of the community of nations is not its sole and only concern, but is the concern of other members of the community of nations.  Just, for example, as such questions as emigration from one part of the community to another part, or a prohibition of such emigration, are matters that will arise, not between ourselves and Australia, say, but between ourselves and England, as two co-equal members, and it would impede progress and be destructive of harmony, if Bills of this kind are going to be held up indefinitely. I urge that the President might consider this article, because I believe it would be accepted in other places and it would lead to more rapid and smoother working.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE"><NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt><P>The view of the Ministry in regard to this amendment is that it is distinctly a weakening amendment, and that the likelihood of any trouble in this respect, or of any attempt to withhold assent from a Bill, will be less with the clause as it stands than it would be if we were to provide brand new machinery to advise the King to withhold assent.  I think Deputies reading the clause will be of that opinion, and it is not necessary to labour the point.</P></Speaker>

The amendment runs:&mdash;&ldquo;Estates and interests in the lands, waters and natural resources of Ireland now or hereafter vested in the Free State/Saorstát Eireann, other than rents or rent charges created prior to the adoption of this Constitution, shall not be alienated in perpetuity, but they may, in the interests of the general public, be leased under the authority and subject to the control of the Parliament/Oireachtas: Provided that no such lease or leases may be made for a term exceeding ninety-nine years beginning <Col N="1186"/> from the date thereof, nor shall any such lease or leases be renewable by the terms thereof.

At the time it will be recollected by Deputies that the Minister asked me to leave the matter over in order that the two original articles might be considered by the Ministry.  I am just now informed by the Ministry that these two Articles should be dealt with in the same way, by themselves, and therefore I withdraw them at the present moment as I understand the Ministry will be dealing with them in Articles covering the same matters.  I would like to take this opportunity to stress particularly Amendment 20 (for Article 42), dealing with the question of the utilisation of water power and the production of electrical energy.  This is a matter that was drawn to my attention in connection with some other work, and the wording here is of some importance. I would suggest it might be adhered to as nearly as possible.  It did happen in a certain country in Europe. There it was found water power was being developed at 6's and 7's all over the place, and obstructing future development, and it also got into the hands of alien and unfriendly corporations, much to the detriment of National interests.  In drawing these two Articles in Amendment 19 to the attention of the Ministry, I would like to stress No. 20 particularly.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>I move Article 44:&mdash;&ldquo;The Parliament/Oireachtas may provide for the establishment of Functional or Vocational Councils representing branches of the social and economic life of the Nation.  A law establishing any such Council shall determine its powers, rights and duties, and its relation to the Government of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON"><NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt><P>I wonder whether the Minister would accept the introduction of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I failed to put in an amendment, but I intended to do so.

I suggest <Col N="1188"/> it would be desirable to lay it down now as an imperative enactment.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>I might point out to Deputy Johnson that it does not make much difference in regard to the obligatory sense by using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or by saying it &ldquo;may,&rdquo; because it could still be postponed from Oireachtas to Oireachtas and from Dáil to Dáil, and yet never get attention.  I can give Deputy Johnson a list of a large number of cases in Europe where such words have been put into a Constitution; in one case eighty years ago, and the majority of the provisions have not yet been given effect to.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>I am inclined to adhere to the text as it stands. It is to provide for a possible development along these lines.  When this Article is inserted, judging by the debate to-day, the whole thing is in a rather immature and half-baked condition, and there does not seem to be any definite crystallised thought or any definite schemes evolved.  In the event of such schemes being evolved, this Article clears the way.  But to put the definite duty on, say, the first Parliament of the Irish Free State to set up these Functional Councils and define their relations, and so on, is something we did not consider it wise to do, and we stand by the text of the Article.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS"><NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt><P>Before I touch on Amendment 23, I wish to state it is my intention to withdraw Amendment 24, which reads:&mdash;&ldquo;To insert after Article 43, and to conclude Section 2, Sub-section (<i>d</i>), the following Article:&mdash; &lsquo;The Articles of Agreement between Great Britain and Ireland set out in the schedule hereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Scheduled Treaty&rdquo;) are hereby given the force of law.  Any amendment of or any law made under this Constitution repugnant to any of the provisions to the Scheduled Treaty shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative, and the Parliament and the Executive Council of the Irish Free State shall, respectively, pass such further legislation and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty, <Col N="1189"/> provided always that the Scheduled Treaty shall be deemed to include any modification or extension thereto by mutual agreement or acceptance since the making of the Treaty, and also any further development or extension of the constitutional status or usage and of the self-governing rights and privileges of the Dominions mentioned in the first Article of the Treaty.&rsquo; &rdquo;  Amendment 23 is as follows.&mdash;&ldquo;To insert after Article 43 the following Article:&mdash;&lsquo;The laws of the Parliament/Oireachtas shall, save where otherwise provided in any Act, be in force throughout the territory and the territorial waters of the Free State/Saorstát Eireann, and all ships registered in the Free State/Saorstát Eireann; and, save where expressly so provided in any Act. they shall be binding on Irish citizens when beyond the limits of the Free State/Saorstát Eireann, or on any ships not registered in the Free State/Saorstát Eireann.&rsquo; &rdquo;  I suggest that amendment dealing with this new Article should be inserted.  I thought at one time of bringing up certain important cases that have occurred in different parts of the Community of Nations dealing with this important question of extra territory.  There are few questions of more vital importance. It has practically been taken up amongst the different members of the Community of Nations, and it has been decided in the, terms such as are adopted in this amendment.  It might be possible without such a clause, if this Dáil, or any subsequent Dáil, were to pass legislation respecting Irish citizens, to find Irish citizens going across to Holy head and perpetrating acts there, and then coming back to live in Ireland, and taking advantage of the fact that the acts were committed to purchase immunity. My attention was drawn to this matter as being a very grave omission in the original Act.  I shall have some hesitation in giving the names in this matter, but I think I will decide to do so.  The one person who, I think, knows more about this than possibly any other, and who has just recently dealt with them in the new edition of &ldquo;Dicey,&rdquo; and who is known as the chief authority respecting the relationship between one person and the other, is Professor Keith.  I have been in correspondence with him, and, at his suggestion, this form was adopted. The form of amendment was, with the <Col N="1190"/> exception of one or two changes that I have made, that which he himself suggested, as meeting the case in point and embodying the law on this matter in the Commonwealth of Nations.  It is argued that his Article would meet the case as being satisfactory from his point of view to all the co-equal members, and also as being a very necessary Article to embody in the Constitution, if this important question of territorialty is to be dealt with as it certainly and urgently requires to be dealt with.</P></Speaker>

As members know it used to be the theory that you cannot legislate for your own citizens outside your own jurisdiction.  This extra territorial jurisdiction they have acquired is one of the things that marks the definite advance of the Dominions again.  To-day there can be no dispute as to the right and desirability of a clause like this.  I hope the Ministry will see no difficulty in accepting the amendment or similar words.</P></Speaker>

I withdraw that amendment.  I sent it at the time of the postal strike; it was very difficult then to get into communication with people outside in spite of the efficient service that was being maintained.  When the postal strike ceased I received a letter from Sir B. Keith, and he suggested this form of wording as meeting the case better and more fully than the form I suggested.  I think frankly it is very much better, and I think I will hand over to the Minister a copy of the letter received from him advocating the form of wording and giving a reason for it, if that will assist him in any way.  He knows more than any other person about it, because he has studied it.</P></Speaker>

    <Title>TREATMENT OF PRISONERS.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL"><NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt><P>This afternoon I gave notice of the following &ldquo;To ask the President whether his attention has been called to the letter which appears <Col N="1193"/> in this morning's papers signed by Rev. Joseph Smith, C.P., Vice-Rector of Mount Argus, with reference to the treatment of a particular prisoner, and whether in view of this and many similar complaints which are being made the Government will consider the advisability of acting on the suggestion which has already been made in the Dáil and setting up an Independent Committee which will inquire into such complaints and furnish a report to this Parliament.&rdquo;  The President, I understand, did not see the question until he came into the Dáil, and therefore had no time to consider a definite answer, and accordingly I have availed of the privilege which the new Standing Orders give me to bring the matter before the Dáil.  I might say at the outset that I hold no brief for anybody in bringing this before the Dáil. I have had no communication from anybody. It is not at the request of any of the interested parties that I bring it forward, but in support of the general principles of fair play.  It is a matter of common knowledge to this Dáil that widespread complaints have been made with regard to the treatment of prisoners. I need not mention specific cases. Instances of specific cases have been sent to us and sent to most of the members of this Dáil, I understand, and I am prepared to believe that many of these complaints may be exaggerated and that some are trivial.  The majority of this Dáil have been, I understand, in prison at one time or another.  I have not had that honour, and therefore I am not able to judge very well as to most of these statements and the value to be placed on them, but we have in to-day's paper a letter signed by a clergyman of some standing, in which definite specific charges are made.  Although he refers to one specific case he implies quite clearly that it is not a single case.  The President speaking to-day said that the writer of this letter cannot be regarded as impartial. If the President says that, I am prepared to accept his statement as I do not know the writer of the letter or the prisoner, but I take it that a man of the standing of the Rev. Joseph Smith would not state over his own name what he has stated in this letter unless there were good and substantial grounds for it.  I think it is most essential that the matter of which he speaks should get the fullest and <Col N="1194"/> most public investigation possible.  We know the use that is being made of statements of this kind, and we know the propaganda that is being made out of them. What I will say with regard to this letter is, that the writer appears to have made a <i>prima facie</i> case which is deserving of the fullest investigation, as well as the general question of the treatment of prisoners.  These statements are either true or untrue.  If true the indiscipline is such as to deserve the attention of the Government, and it is in the interests of the Government themselves, and the interest of the people of the country as a whole, that if these allegations are true the people responsible for them should be punished.  If they are untrue, then it is even more in the interest of the Government and the people of the country and the Army that the untruth of these allegations should be exposed.  That is why I urge most strongly on the Government the advisability of setting up an Independent Inquiry into these allegations to report to this Dáil as to their truth or untruth.  That I hold is a proper way of going about this matter, and it is a proper way to stop the propaganda that is being made out of these complaints. If the Government refuses to do this, we know that their refusal will be used still further by way of propaganda.  I do not raise this matter with any intention whatsoever of embarrassing the Government in any way.  It is rather the opposite.  I think that the interests of the Government and the interests of the Army itself will be served by an independent investigation of all the complaints that are being made.  And I most strongly urge on the Government the advisability of setting up this Committee.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT"><NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt><P>I read this letter rather hastily this morning.  Having heard something of the writer this week, I did not attach very much importance to it, but I intended to make inquiries. Now as the members of the Dáil may not have read this letter, I think it would be wise to give some extracts.  It describes the visit of a clergyman to Wellington Barracks.  That is to say Father Smith, or Father Joseph as he is better known describes a visit which one of the clergymen in Mount Argus made to Wellington Barracks.  On the face of it it appeared to me strange that the rev. gentleman who made the visit did not himself write <Col N="1195"/> and give his opinions or experience, rather than allow Father Joseph to write it&mdash;the priest who was sent in answer to the call, which was that one of the prisoners&mdash;Fergus Murphy&mdash;was wounded and required the attendance of a priest. The letter states &ldquo;the priest who was sent in answer to the call on presenting himself to the barrack was met by the authorities there, including the Medical Officer, with a blank denial that any prisoner was wounded... On his asking the prisoners whether Fergus Murphy had been wounded, many of them cried out that he had been almost beaten to death the previous night by Free State soldiers with the butts of their rifles.&rdquo;  On reading the letter down I was unable to find that this clergyman, who visited Wellington Barracks, rendered any spiritual aid to Murphy.  He may have done so, but it is not mentioned.  In another part of the letter it is mentioned concerning Murphy that he appeared dazed and almost unable to stand.  The next point I mention in connection with that letter is, that it is dated the 2nd October, and the incident described occurred on the 30th September.  It appears to me that from purely humanitarian motives the writer of the letter should have taken more prompt steps to investigate and bring to the notice of the responsible persons the charges outlined in the letter.  Possibly he does not recognise the Government.  I quite appreciate Deputy O'Connell's statement that it is purely with a view to getting this question raised that he has brought it forward, and that he knows nothing about it but what has appeared in the paper.  Now the letter is largely the comment of a second person.  I suppose we would be entitled to conclude that if such things are done with our connivance, it is all right.  Now, I will say nothing about this reverend gentleman.  I know him personally.  I am informed that he made some references to me in the Church.  I do not know whether it is true or not.  I am making enquiries.  The report I have got from the Army authorities in connection with this matter is that the statement made in the letter was altogether exaggerated. The prisoner was suffering from a slight superficial wound on the left side of the head, about two inches above the ear; the left eye was blackened and there was a slight mark on the throat which, it is suggested, was caused by a nail.  With <Col N="1196"/> reference to the other men being in bandages, the medical officer states that &ldquo;this man came into the barracks suffering from old wounds.  There are no prisoners in the barracks suffering from the effects of ill-treatment.&rdquo; Now investigation is taking place in this case, and disciplinary action will be taken if any charge is proved.  There is one other matter in the letter.  I will just read it, and the Dáil should know of it:&mdash; &ldquo;I would not trouble your readers with all this if I had not a specific instance of cruelty for which I can certainly, vouch.&rdquo; Now I do not know whether Father Smith was the priest who came along to Wellington Barracks or not, but he makes mention of a priest and he describes the priest, and I concluded from the first reading of that letter that it was not he.  But he says &ldquo;I can personally vouch.&rdquo;  Then he continues in the letter:&mdash;&ldquo;I rely on this simple instance to prove that tortures are being inflicted on prisoners in Free State keeping (call these prisoners &lsquo;Irregulars&rsquo; or &lsquo;Intransitives&rsquo; or what you will) which no decent pagan would inflict on a dog or a rat.  If this instance I have here outlined fails of proof, then, so far as I am concerned, the case for the alleged torture of prisoners falls to the ground.&rdquo; I would say Father Joseph is a poor logician.  I enquired of the number of prisoners in the barracks, and I was told there are one hundred and forty there. And according to his logic, if this one case is proved, we are responsible for torturing one hundred and forty prisoners instead of one.  Now, as I have said, disciplinary action will be taken if it can be proved that any of our soldiers are guilty.  There are cases where it is quite possible that with a very large number of prisoners, some excesses should occur. We all understand that.  The circumstances in which some of these men were taken, the charges against them, and the general effects of warlike operations, are well known.  We know what they are and we know the provocation that our men have received.  But the Government and the Army are not standing over any maltreatment of prisoners, and they will take disciplinary action in any case where we can bring it home to those who are responsible.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WM. O'BRIEN Mr. WM. O'BRIEN"><NameTxt>Mr. WM. O'BRIEN:</NameTxt><P>The President and the Dáil generally may take it that Deputy O'Connell in bringing forward this one case did not mean to rely <Col N="1197"/> entirely upon it.  He brought it forward because there has been a campaign for a considerable time&mdash;widespread references are being made&mdash;to the ill-treatment of prisoners, and it seemed to him that the making of this specific complaint over the name of a responsible clergyman would afford a convenient opportunity for bringing this matter to a head and investigating this complaint in order to see if it is well founded.  Now, Deputies are all aware that these allegations are being made, and we can quite believe that many of them are being made and exaggerated for propaganda purposes.  But, making full allowance for all that, we cannot doubt that there must be some grounds for many of these allegations.  I know myself certain prisoners have been arrested and whose innocence has been subsequently admitted and established&mdash; men who were not in sympathy with the forces in arms against the Government. These men were ill-treated and felt themselves in great danger because of the attitude and conduct of the soldiers, and I would join with Deputy O'Connell in urging that it is to the interest of the Government themselves to do something to meet this criticism and to establish that there is no widespread foundation for it, or to deal with them in a disciplinary way if the charges are well founded.  It has been made clear from these benches that the Labour Members have no sympathy whatever with the war that is being waged or the ambushes that are taking place daily in the streets&mdash;ambushes inflicting far more damage on the citizens and the economic life of the country than upon the Army.  We want to make that quite clear, and I would impress upon the Government that they ought not to allow these allegations to go on and that they ought to take an early opportunity of setting up an enquiry and probing these charges thoroughly, and so set at rest as far as they can all doubt as to whether these allegations are well founded or not.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS"><NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt><P>There has been a campaign, as Deputy O'Brien remarks, on this question of prisoners.  And he used and I use, the word &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; advisedly.  The charges fall roughly under two heads&mdash;congestion and ill-treatment. That is congestion and actual physical ill-treatment.  Now there is <Col N="1198"/> congestion, and it is surely to be regretted that so many people are in arms against this&mdash;the first Irish Government&mdash;that congestion in the prisons is the inevitable result.  It is the opinion of this Dáil, and it is the opinion of the people of Ireland that there are more men in arms against this native administration at the moment, in one county, than there were in arms against the British throughout the length and breadth of the country when the British were here.  And so there is congestion.  And if they had succeeded in burning Maryborough Prison, there would be more congestion.  But, as the Dáil knows, we are taking steps to deal with that congestion, and to deal with it in a very effective way.  Now as to the question of physical ill-treatment&mdash;you see, we are children in some matters, but not in matters of this kind&mdash;in a matter of just what takes place in a gaol. Some of us were there ourselves and some of us were through what we call prison-rows ourselves, and we know, we always considered it good business to force our guards to take action against us which we could use as propaganda against the Government that the guards were responsible to.  That is going on now. The men in the jails consider it a point of honour and principle and other high-sounding things to regularly force their guards to take measures against them, which their lady-friends outside can write up on the walls.  These men are prisoners, military prisoners, many of them military prisoners where the fight is raging, and it is the duty of the guards to take strong measures to enforce discipline, to enforce prison regulations, and above all, to prevent escape.  Lately, some men escaped from Cork prison, and it was necessary to search the prison to find out just where and how they escaped, and because the remaining prisoners were not allowed out of their cells promptly, on the stroke of 8.30 next morning, they proceeded to raise the good old-fashioned prison row.  They smashed and yelled and so on, and some poor man who was in there formed a rather highly-coloured impression of the whole thing, and wrote a rather hysterical letter to a member of this Dáil about it.  He was in for a day and a-half.  He was arrested on a Thursday evening and released on a Saturday morning with an apology.  During his short time, he had the misfortune to be there for the good old-fashioned prison <Col N="1199"/> row and formed a very highly-coloured impression of what took place.  Now, I do not know really what Deputies here or people outside think of the present Government and the present Army Council, but we assure Deputies and the people that we do not stand for cruelty to prisoners, that wanton cruelty to prisoners, wherever it is traced, will be dealt with in a disciplinary way.  But on the other hand, we do not stand for allowing prisoners to force a situation where discipline or all rules within a prison can be smashed so that they can escape.  The soldiers and guards may be confronted with a position where they have to deal very strongly and very sternly with the prisoners or else allow discipline in a camp or a prison to disappear. They cannot allow that.  Neither can they allow prisoners to escape or do things which, if continued and enlarged, would lead generally to their escape.  If prisoners in the camps and jails settle down and obey the rules of the camps and jails, you would hear very little talk about dark deeds and ill-treatment and all the rest.  The President has given an assurance that this particular case will be investigated.  Any case referred to us will be investigated and promptly investigated, and if there be a wrong done, it will be dealt with firmly in an official way.  But there will be no independent enquiry.  What is meant by an independent enquiry?  50 per cent. irregulars and 50 per cent. supporters of the Government. As long as we are the Government we will enquire into any allegation of that kind.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WM. DAVIN Mr. WM. DAVIN"><NameTxt>Mr. WM. DAVIN:</NameTxt><P>I assume that the Minister for Home Affairs when he says we are the Government means this Dáil. Arising out of that, I would like to know, as a result of recent experience, whether or not a member of this Dáil has the right or if you wish, the privilege, of visiting any jail in his own area.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN"><NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN:</NameTxt><P>However, I rise to make more or less a personal explanation arising out of an incident so far as I am concerned which occurred in this Dáil some time ago.  During a debate on a motion raised by Deputy Gavan Duffy, the Minister for Agriculture was harping and laying stress on the recent deplorable ambush in Leix&mdash;a division which I <Col N="1200"/> happen to represent.  In the course of the debate, I happened to ask what had become of the leader of that ambush. In asking that question I was merely concerned, whether he was going to be tried and the charge which might be made against him.  When I visited the constituency during the week, I met some officers of the Government and subsequently interviewed the Commandant of the jail and I gathered from what they said that I had inferred in the Dáil that the prisoner had been done in by National troops.  I am taking advantage of the debate to say that no such thing, and no such idea was in my mind.  I am satisfied where that particular individual lies at the moment.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE"><NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE:</NameTxt><P>As there appears to be two sides to this particular question at the present moment, would it not be well if the Government for the sake of the honour of this Dáil, did appoint a small commission, to enquire into these special cases before us?  In the interests of the troops outside I think it is essential some enquiry should take place.  I am aware of several cases where mothers have sons, both in the Free State troops and also members of the Irregular forces. These people are keenly interested in this question, and arising out of the point raised by the last speaker, asking if any member of this Dáil would get a pass to investigate special cases himself, I think that concession ought to be given them, so that they might know exactly what state of truth was in it?  In the past, I remember myself getting a special pass from the Government to visit English prisons.  I think this Government would do a gracious deed, where a particular member is interested in a special case, by allowing him to get in and see the prisoner, and find out for himself the exact truth.  If this thing is allowed to go on, you will have individual cases arising every day.  You will have members on the Ministerial bench on one side, and members interested in cases sent them by their constituents giving a different complexion. I hold that the only way out is the point raised by Deputy O'Connell, that a small commission should be appointed. If not I should say the right referred to by Deputy Davin for a member to go and interview the prisoner, who may happen to be a constituent should be given.  For the sake of the honour of <Col N="1201"/> the Dáil something like that should be done.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE"><NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt><P>It would be quite impossible to agree to have a member of the Dáil or people outside the Army, investigating what would be a case of army indiscipline.  The thing would be entirely inadmissible and produce bad results, instead of any good results that might be hoped for.  This case has led to a discussion on prison treatment and gentlemen will, I think, in regard to that, with a Dáil like this&mdash;&mdash;</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE"><NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt><P>I was not referring to you at all.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes"><NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt><P>That was quite clear.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN"><NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN:</NameTxt><P>The Minister responsible is getting away from the point I raised. I wanted to know if it is the right of <Col N="1202"/> a member of this Dáil to go in to see a prisoner.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE"><NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt><P>Certainly not.  Prisoners are not allowed the right of visits and there is no reason why an exception should be made in the case of a member of the Dáil.  In regard to the treatment of prisoners, apart from acts, such as have been alleged in relation to this case, the Dáil constituted as this Dáil is, will not give more weight than is due to these allegations.  We all know, in the case of prisons, that the stories which come out from the prisoners themselves are 75 per cent. of them absolutely untrue and without any foundation whatever. The other 25 per cent. are usually grossly exaggerated.  If there were anything to be said about the treatment of prisoners, apart from&mdash;</P></Speaker>
