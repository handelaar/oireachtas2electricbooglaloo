      <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Your summons to attend the session of Dáil Éireann, which opens on Tuesday next April 25th, has been duly received and we notice <Col N="232" /> that it is proposed to hold this meeting in the Council Chamber of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On behalf of the Republican Party, we wish to remind you that the holding of the meetings of the Dáil in the University building was vigerously protested against at the last session by a large body of members and the opinion was generally expressed that that building was quite unsuitable for Dáil meetings and that arrangements should be made with the Lord Mayor to hold all future meetings in the Round Room of the Mansion House as heretofore.  On account of your absence during the last session, no satisfactory explanation was given as to why the University building was selected as the venue for that meeting but the Rúnaidhe stated that arrangements to that end had not been made in sufficient time.  We, writing on behalf of the Republican Party, inform you that in view of the absence of verbatim reports of each day's proceedings, we consider the holding of the meetings of An Dáil in any building which does not permit of the attendance of the public is prejudicial to the public interest&mdash;against which we renew our protest.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, therefore, call upon you to arrange with the Lord Mayor of Dublin for the use of the Round Room, Mansion House, for this meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sinne, le meas,</P>

Mar adubhramar 'sa leitir a chuireamar chughat indé, tá fáthanna eile seachas cúnntas <i>verbatim</i> ar chúrsaí na Dála a bheith le fághail againn ag cur i n-aghaidh na gcruinnithe a bheith: dTigh Coláiste na h-Ollsgoile Baile Atha Cliath.

    <P>Some of us on this side of the House &mdash;I don't know that there may not be some on the other side of the House also&mdash;feel that it is a serious inconvenience to the members and to the public that our meetings are held in this building.  On the first occasion, there was good and sufficient reason but neither on the last occasion was there nor on this occasion, I submit, is there sufficient grounds for calling the Dáil <Col N="233" /> meeting in such an unsuitable place as this is.  We maintain, as long as there are buildings available, it is improper to hold the meeting of the Dáil in a building where a sufficient number of the public cannot come in and hear the discussion that takes place.  We know that the Press, from the protests they have been obliged to make from time to time, cannot properly report the proceedings owing to the unsuitable accommodation for them.  We on this side of the House, in particular, have a serious grievance owing to the manner in which, if I might say so, our words are unofficially censored by the Press.  You, A Chinn Comhairle are not responsible for that but we maintain, as a minority here, that we ought be able to claim your protection in matters of that kind.  We have rights as a minority and, with all respect, we believe that the first duty of a President of a gathering such as this should be to protect the rights of the minority.</P>
    <P>We complain that we are not properly reported and that very frequently we are misrepresented in the Press.  We have no way to meet this misrepresentation if we have not a guarantee that the public, under your auspices, should be allowed in to hear these discussions.  We say that you should make it your duty to see that the verbatim reports of our proceedings should be published as soon as possible after these proceedings are over.</P>
    <P>The reports of last August and September have been for some unaccountable reason held up and have not been published.  That is as much against one side as the other but I think we have not had any justifiable explanation for the unaccountable delay that has occurred. The publication of these reports would be a guarantee of some kind that we could answer the misrepresentations in the Press.  On these grounds, I submit that you should arrange for a more suitable and more convenient place of meeting.  I suggested in the letter that you should ask for the Round Room in the Mansion House&mdash;a place where public meetings have been held.  I know that the Mansion House is available and I know that the Mansion House was kept specifically available for this gathering, if we cared to ask for it so there is no reason for saying that no other building was suitable or available.  I move that further meetings be held in a more suitable building.  You yourself, A Chinn Chomhairle, could arrange whatever details would be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. MICHAEL COLLINS (MINISTER OF FINANCE):</NameTxt>
      <P>Seumas O Riain, Loch gCarmain, asks the Minister of Finance&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether monthly payments have been made to Deputies of the Dáil since the last Session; by what authority were these grants made; under what estimate have they been voted or will a supplementary estimate be introduced; what are the names of the Deputies who received these grants?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Answer:&mdash;It will be observed from the Finance Report that a total sum of £1,500 was paid to Deputies in the period January 1st to April 10th.  The amount paid for the month of March was £125.  The items appear on page 3 of the report under the heading of &ldquo;Special allowances to Deputies.&rdquo;  No estimates have ever been introduced for these payments. They are made under the resolution of the Dáil of the 24th September, 1920, to the effect that Deputies may, on application, receive a monthly allowance at a rate not exceeding £250 per-annum. Application is made to the Finance Department according to that resolution and the payments are made without any question.  In view of the understanding there was at that meeting of the Dáil, that there would be no divulgence of the private position of members I do not propose to give the names of the members to whom these payments were made, unless the House desires it.</P>
      <P>The next question by Seumas O Riain is&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether Deputies have been allowed any expenses other than those incurred in attending meetings of An Dáil since the Articles of Agreement were approved; if so, what are the names of those Deputies and in what connection were those expenses incurred?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The answer is that, with the exception of the amounts mentioned in my reply to the previous question, I have no knowledge of any expenses having been paid. It is, of course, possible that payments of expenses may have been made in different Departments.  That would be an accounting matter and it would be necessary for me to have more definite details before I could make the required examination into the accounts.</P>
      <P>The next question is by Seán Etchingham&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether a special compensation grant has been made to the staff of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> out of Dáil Funds and, if so, of what amount; what estimate passed at the last meeting of the Dáil provided for such expenditure, or whether a supplementary estimate will be introduced and whether the writer of the scurrilously insulting article in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> of January 5th on President de Valera received compensation?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Answer: The Dáil Ministry, at its meeting on the 10th April, passed £2,692 18s. 2d. to the Minister for Labour to enable him to pay the full wages bill of the unemployed staff of <Col N="235" /> the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> for a period of two weeks.  This payment appears in the accounts submitted and it will be observed that the money was used entirely for the payment of the unemployed staff.  As to the latter part of the question, there was no payment made to any writer of any article in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> out of Dáil funds. It is not necessary for me to specify the reason for which that was brought in at the end of that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="PRESIDENT GRIFFITH PRESIDENT GRIFFITH">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT GRIFFITH:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, the first reference I should think would be to the death of one of our colleagues since we last met, Mr. Frank Lawless, whose tragic death I am sure all the members here who knew him most deeply regret.  I knew Mr. Lawless&mdash;for I worked with him&mdash;for over 30 years.  He was the first man who pioneered Sinn Féin and the Gaelic League in Fingal.  He was a man who stuck by his country all through.  He feared nothing&mdash;neither physical fear nor the fear of obloquy&mdash;and his death has left a gap amongst us that will not easily be filled.  I am sure this Dáil will extend to his relatives our deepest sympathy and place on record our appreciation of a noble man, a fine patriotic Irishman. With his name I would link the name of the man who was foully murdered yesterday, Commandant General Adamson, a man who has died for his country as truly as any man ever died for it.</P>
      <P>When I was elected President of Dáil Éireann, I undertook to keep the Departments functioning until the voters of Ireland had an opportunity of deciding for or against the Treaty.  The reports of the various Departments now before you will show that the undertaking has been fully honoured, although the authority of Dáil Éireann has been obstructed, and flouted by a section of the opposition, which agreed it would act in a constitutional way and which has broken its agreement.  Attempts to suppress the Press, to abolish the right of free assembly and free speech, to seduce the army and to terrorise the citizens, have been frequent since the last meeting of the Dáil, and the language of menace and incitement has been deliberately used, with consequences of bloodshed and attempted bloodshed.  Were it not for this unconstitutional and unscrupulous opposition to the Government, the position of the country would be peaceful and prosperous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> The Act of Union is gone, the British troops are evacuating the country, and the Irish troops are entering into possession. The Irish exchequer, after 105 years, is re-established and the revenues of Ireland are once more restored to Ireland. The power to develop their own resources to the uttermost is again in the hands of the people of Ireland, and, but for the attempt of the minority to set up anarchaic conditions, the country to-day would have full employment for all its people.</P>
    <P>The position in North-East Ulster has been aggravated by the action of those who have placed themselves in opposition to the Dáil.  Within eight days after the pact making for peace and unity had been signed, an effort was made to smash it by the opponents of the Treaty.  Forty-five seizures of Belfast goods were made within those eight days on the Great Northern Railway by unauthorised persons who pretended to re-impose the Belfast Boycott.  The murderous elements in Belfast, from whom our people have suffered so much, resumed the pogrom, and many horrible atrocities have been committed.  The prospect is not hopeful but it is our duty to try to the last moment for peace and protection for our people.  In this regard, Mr. D. McCullough has been sent to the United States to inform American public opinion of the facts of the North-East Ulster situation.</P>
    <P>The Provisional Government, which came into existence as a consequence of the approval of the Treaty, functions in complete harmony with, and by the authority of Dáil Éireann.  As agreed at the Ard-Fheis of Sinn Féin, the constitution of Saorstát Éireann is being drafted, and will be published before the elections in June.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the principles of freedom and democracy, on which the Dáil was founded, whatever measures are necessary will be taken to ensure that the electorate of Ireland, which created Dáil Éireann, shall be free to vote for or against the Treaty which the plenipotentiaries of Dáil Éireann signed and which Dáil Éireann has approved.  At the invitation of the Archbishop of Dublin, the Minister of Finance and myself have met members of the opposition with the object of securing a peaceful election.  There is, so far, no result.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that as the Irish nation consists of the living Irish people, and they, and they alone, are sovereign in decision, Dáil Éireann, as their trustee, will uphold and assert their right to free expression of opinion and freedom of election.</P>

    <P>
      <i>New Appointments.</i>&mdash;Since August last, a number of changes have been made in the diplomatic staff.  Last summer an Irish Bureau was opened in Geneva under Mr. Michael MacWhite. In November, Count P.J. O'Byrne became our Envoy Extraordinary at Rome.  Latterly, Prof. T.A. Smiddy has taken up the diplomatic office in Washington.  Mr. John Chartres has been appointed temporarily to Paris, Mr. O. Grattan Esmonde has gone to Madrid, and the London Office is now being overhauled. Mr. Joseph Walshe has been seconded from Paris to become UnderSecretary at Home.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Extraordinary Missions.</i>&mdash;Since the last report, Dr. P. McCartan has concluded a voyage to Russia, Col. Maurice Moore has come back from a diplomatic visit to South Africa, Mr. O. Grattan Esmonde has finished an Odyssey which took him as far as Australia and New Zealand, Mr. P.J. Little has returned from an extensive tour in South Africa and South America, Mr. Lawrence Ginnell has completed a mission to Argentina and is returning home, and Mr. Denis McCullough has been dispatched on a special mission to the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I may say that good work has been done by our Foreign Representatives generally, under trying conditions, as well as by the Envoys entrusted with special missions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Publicity.</i>&mdash;The <i>Bulletin</i> has been continued in Paris, Berlin, Rome and Madrid, but under considerable difficulties, and the Libraries in each Delegation are being supplemented to bring them up to date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Foreign Office.</i>&mdash;The Foreign Office at home is being gradually equipped with the materials to enable it to carry out its functions in every direction competently, and to transform it from the quite inadequate establishment with which the circumstances of the War compelled us to be satisfied during recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Co-Ordination of Work Abroad.</i>&mdash;It is intended to bring our diplomatic and consular representatives into closer collaboration, in order to secure greater efficiency.  There is a wide field for both sets of representatives, but really suitable men are scarce.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Training of Candidates.</i>&mdash;A scheme is under consideration for training young men for foreign service by sending them abroad for a period to study the language and the people of particular foreign countries and familiarise themselves with the conditions and outlook in the principal centres where we shall require permanent representation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Paris Meeting.</i>&mdash;I make no report upon the Irish Race Congress in Paris, since it is the subject of a special report by an independent committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" />
      <i>Russian Famine.</i>&mdash;A sum of £1,000 has been contributed, through the Saor an Leanbh Committee, towards the Irish effort for relief of the famine victims in Russia; this effort is attached to Dr. Nansen's admirable organisation in South Russia; unfortunately upwards of six million lives were lost before help arrived.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;<i>The First of the Small Nations.</i>&rdquo;&mdash; No country ever started its international career with better prospects than were ours after the war, for our soldiers had won us warm friends everywhere, and we had no enemies to speak of throughout the Continent of Europe.  Ireland had every reason to expect rapidly to become recognised as the First of the Small Nations.  It would, however, be idle to gloss over the fact that we have lost our prestige in recent months.  The spectacle of fierce disunion at home, its manifestations abroad, particularly in the United States of America and at the time of the Irish Race Congress in Paris, the publicity given by the foreign Press to reports, true and false, of violence in Ireland, have deeply shocked many friends of this country abroad and have given an appearance of justification to the persistent propaganda done by England during the War.  If we are to retrieve the splendid position we held, we must take steps at home without delay to prove that we are a Nation and not a rabble.</P>
    <P>I am not overstating the damage already done in describing it as a cause of <i>grave anxiety</i>, and I commend these considerations very seriously to those Teachtaí in particular who realise the importance of our foreign relations and the far-reaching effects of the loss of World opinion and of our World position, with which we are undoubtedly menaced at the present time.</P>

    <Title>DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="MR. EAMONN DUGGAN (MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS) MR. EAMONN DUGGAN (MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS)">
      <NameTxt>MR. EAMONN DUGGAN (MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS)</NameTxt>
      <P>read the following report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately on my appointment to the Ministry I took over charge of the Department of Home Affairs from my predecessor, Mr. Stack.  The activities under control of the Department included Courts, Police, Enforcement of Decrees against Emigration, and Relief Bureau. I interviewed the heads of these subdepartments and instructed them that they were to carry on as before.  No change was made by me in the personnel of the staff, but several have since resigned.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Republican Courts.</i>&mdash;Since the date of submitting last report&mdash;16th August, 1921&mdash;the causes therein outlined which retarded the working of the Courts, have altogether disappeared, owing to the Treaty and consequent non-interference by enemy forces.  The Courts are now functioning throughout the country generally.  The holding of Circuit Courts on a large scale was hitherto a difficult matter but owing to the altered circumstances, the Department has been in a position to meet the requirements of all districts in this regard.  The Spring Circuit is now being brought to a conclusion.  An elaborate list of this Circuit was prepared and circulated through the various Districts&mdash;a copy is attached hereto.  It will be observed from the time allocated to the various sittings, as set out on this list, that the volume of business to be dealt with was very large.</P>
      <P>
        <i>District and Parish Courts.</i>&mdash;The District and Parish Courts are functioning throughout the country but in some cases grave complaints have been received by the Department as to the personnel of these Courts.  Labour representatives protest that prominent farmers and officials of Farmers' Unions have adjudicated in questions concerning disputes between Irish Transport Union and Farmers, and, in other cases, complaints have been received that labour predominates on the local bench.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Decrees.</i>&mdash;There is considerable dissatisfaction regarding the non-execution of decrees.  In many cases decrees made up to a year ago have remained unexecuted. In the present unstable condition of the country this matter cannot be satisfactorily dealt with.  I regret to state that armed interference with the Republican Courts has taken place recently, in a few instances.  Court offices have been raided by bodies of armed men and Records, Court Registers and important documents carried away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Police Department.</i>&mdash;From the date of taking over by me, this Department continued to carry out its duties as <Col N="240" /> before, under the then Chief of Police, Mr. Simon Donnelly.  In view of the altered condition of affairs, due to the evacuation by British forces, the taking over of Barracks by the Irish Republican Army and the unsatisfactory state of the organization of the Republican Police Force, a conference was held on the 24th February last at which there were present the Minister of Defence, the Adjutant General, the Chief of Police and myself.  It was decided that the men engaged on Police work should revert to their Volunteer Units, and that police work would henceforth be done by the Army as a whole, in co-operation with the Brigade Police Officers, who should continue to carry out their duties as before under the Chief of Police who should be transferred to General Headquarters staff and act under the Adjutant General for purposes of administration.  This decision was accordingly carried into effect and the Chief of Police was accommodated with new headquarters in Gt. Brunswick Street.  At his request, the enrolment of twenty additional police for the Dublin District was sanctioned, in order to cope with the greatly increased volume of Court work, and to assist in dealing with ordinary crime.</P>
    <P>On the 27th March, Mr. Donnelly wrote me enclosing copy of a letter which he had written the Adjutant-General as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not wishing to sail under false colours, I wish to inform you that I attended the Army Convention on Sunday, 26th inst.  According to the statement of the Minister of Defence last week, any man attending same was to be suspended.  I await the official suspension or dismissal.  I am sending a copy of this to the Minister for Home Affairs.  (Signed) S. O Donghaile.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I replied on the 30th March informing him that he has been dismissed, as from the 27th March, from his office as Chief of Police, and directing him to hand over all books, property and records connected with the Police Department to Captain Peter Ennis who had been appointed in his place.  Mr. Donnelly replied on the 3rd instant that he was carrying out his duties under a person whom he described as &ldquo;the Adjutant-General responsible to the new Executive&rdquo; and that he was retaining the books and records in order to enable himself and his staff to carry out the work.  Captain Ennis attended at the Headquarters in Brunswick Street on the 30th ultimo to take over, and found that all books, papers, records and property, including two typewriters, had been removed, and that the office staff, including three clerks and two typists, had left.  Mr. Donnelly having taken away all the files, the new Chief of Police is now faced with a position of considerable difficulty in carrying out his duties.  He has, however, already circularized all the Brigade Officers and has up to the present received communications from 32 Brigades.  Mr. Donnelly has also circularized the Brigade Officers asking them to give their allegiance to the work under a body which he describes as the &ldquo;New Executive.&rdquo;  It will, therefore, be seen that at the moment the position is unsatisfactory, but every effort will be made to overcome the difficulties.</P>
    <P>The peace of the country is at present menaced by the operations of armed bands engaged in robberies of Banks and Post Offices; armed interference with public meetings, suppression of free speech, and of the Press.  Trains are being held up and goods stolen; business premises are being raided and large quantities of goods removed by force; and large money levies are also being made on proprietors of business premises.  Irish credit is being injured by these illegal acts and the entire financial loss involved will have to be borne by the Irish people.  Whatever differences of opinion may exist on other matters, everyone must agree that it is in the public interest that order should be restored, and life and property respected.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for these acts must be fixed and steps taken to deal with those responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Emigration Report.</i>&mdash;Since 1st June, 1921, 2,974 applications for permits to leave Ireland have been received at the Department of Home Affairs.  Of these 1,396 have been granted and 1,578 refused.  A large proportion of the permits granted have only been for short periods, and the bulk of the persons receiving permits were those <Col N="241" /> who wished to leave for one or other of the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Ill-health.  (2) Studies (Lay or Clerical).  (3) Missionary Work. (4) Visits to relatives.  (5) Short business or pleasure trips.</P>
    <P>During the same period 5,669 emigrants have, according to the returns of the Registrar General at Charlemont House, left Ireland.  This shows a considerable decrease compared with the corresponding period in the previous year.  The effort to enforce the Decree has undoubtedly caused a decrease in emigration, but it has not succeeded in accomplishing its aim, viz., the complete stoppage of emigration.  Many of the applicants for permits are known to be such as were genuinely suffering from unemployment and were resident in districts where no immediate remedy for unemployment is available.  There is a strong feeling that the rule in this regard should be relaxed somewhat in favour of this class of applicant.  There is no doubt that, if order were restored, the improved economic conditions that would arise would be such that legislation against emigration would no longer be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. MICHAEL COLLINS (MINISTER OF FINANCE):</NameTxt>
      <P>These accounts cover the period from January 1st to April 10th and, with your permission, a Chinn Comhairle, I will only read the first page.  The figures given after that will be very much plainer if you go into them yourselves.  The first page of the report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>INTERIM ACCOUNTS, JANUARY 1ST, 1922, TO APRIL 10TH, 1922.</P>
      <P>The Drawings of the Departments for the period amount to £113,244 2s. 0d., of which the Trustees advanced £82,315 14s. 10d., and the Department of Finance the balance, viz., £30,928 7s. 2d.  The Cash Summary of the Department of Finance shows Receipts as follows: Refunds, £10,955 19s. 3d.; Revenue, £6,593 1s. 9d.; Other Receipts, £1,113 12s. 4d.&mdash;£18,662 13s. 4d., which with £12,265 13s. 10d., amount of temporary Bank Overdraft, equals the Cash advanced on behalf of the Trustees.</P>
      <P>Whilst the Departments, generally speaking, have kept within their Estimates, the following remarks will apply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Belfast Boycott Expenditure</i> includes £1,660 for compensation to the members of the staff whose services were discontinued.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Irish Race Conference.</i>&mdash;£4,700 charged in this period, with £1,513 paid out up to 31st December last, brings the total paid out to date to £6,213, against which the following Refunds have been made, viz.:&mdash;£250 and £184 4s. 4d. The disbursing of this Fund has been in the hands of several people, and an effort is being made to get the accounts consolidated and put in order.  £250 has been received from South Africa as a subscription in this matter.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Local Government Department.</i>&mdash;An increase in the rate of pay to the Auditors and Inspectors has been in force since 1st February, 1922.  This increase was not provided for in the Estimates presented, but has been sanctioned by the Cabinet.  The Departmental Expenditure includes a sum of £258 0s. 0d. towards the relief in Tory Island, and £750 0s. 0d. towards the cost of the recovery of Rates in County Sligo.</P>
      <P>
        <i>President's Department.</i>&mdash;A sum of £400 0s. 0d. included in the outlay for this period is in respect of expenses previously incurred, of which sum £150 14s. 0d. has been refunded, as shown in cash account.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Ministerial Salaries.</i>&mdash;Attention is drawn to the Refunds from the following Ministers, included in the Department of Finance Cash Account, viz.:&mdash;L.T. Mac Cosgair, Micheal O Coileain, Caoimhin O hUigin, Seosamh Mag Craith, and P.S. O hOgain.  These Ministers have not drawn any salaries since 15th January last.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Ministry of Defence Expenditure.</i>&mdash; With reference to a question which was asked on the Estimates for the half-year regarding debts due by the West Mayo Brigade, it is to be noted that a sum of £3,900 was paid under the Defence Expenditure in discharge of the debts due by that Brigade.  In the return made by the Defence Department, it appears that this sum was the total amount claimed by the Divisional Adjutant. I understand the matter is being more fully dealt with by the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Trustees' Account.</i>&mdash;The Balance in hands, £201,944 8s. 4d., includes £1,660 7s. 5d.&mdash;being balance on current account with the Sinn Féin Bank (now in Liquidation) and the balance at the London Office.  The Auditor in reporting on the Accounts to 31st December last stated he had not been able to vouch London Office Accounts, and I had arranged that he should go to London on the 20th instant, but this arrangement has had to be postponed by the Auditor owing to the death of a near relative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Final Summary.</i>&mdash;This includes Balance in U.S.A.  The last Account received from U.S.A. is written up to 28th February, and the balance on hands there on that date was $2,457,223 .18, from which I have deducted the following:&mdash;General Reserve, $500,000 .00; Bank, $100,000.00; Reserve for Loss on Securities, $48,769.05; Reserve for Second Loan, $122,967.54&mdash;(Total Reserve Funds, $771,736.59), and a sum of $30,000.00 for the Estimated Outlay in U.S.A. for the period since 28th February, leaving a Balance of $1,655,486.59, which, calculated at $4.50 to the £, gives £367,885 18s. 0d. available in U.S.A.  I have recommended <Col N="243" /> to the Trustees that the Cash in U.S.A. should be kept in the Federal Banks in the names of the Trustees jointly, and I recommend that the &ldquo;Bearer&rdquo; Certificates should be converted into Registered Stock or Certificates, where possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Seizure of Dáil Property.</i>&mdash;I have to report that furniture to the value of £42 (Typewriter, £32, and Typist's Table, £10) was taken from the office of the Minister for Fine Arts.  No satisfactory explanation was received by this Department. The Minister responsible treated the matter most casually, and did not appear to be willing to give any real assistance in discovering the reason for the disappearance of the furniture.</P>
    <P>Furniture to the value of £139 7s. 6d. (3 Typewriters and 1 Gestetner Rotary Machine) was taken from the Commission of Inquiry under the Department of Trade.  This seizure took place on the 31st March, when the furniture was being removed to the office of the Canal Commission; three armed men seeing one of the typewriters on a cart seized it and demanded to know where the other two typewriters and the Gestetner Rotary Machine were; they subsequently located the machines and seized them.</P>
    <P>A bicycle, the property of the Department of Trade, was taken by the Messenger of that Department on his leaving to join the forces in possession of the Four Courts.&mdash;Mícheál O Coileáin, Aire Airgid.  21adh Aibreáin, 1922.</P>
    <P>I may remark about this Irish Race Conference that of course the accounts must be in order before the end of the half year.  I did not unduly press them as these are only interim accounts.  The difficulty arises from the fact that money was paid to several persons.  Some of these people took longer time to furnish accounts than others.</P>
    <P>The particular reason for mentioning Ministry of Defence Expenditure here is that it arose out of a question at the last Session.  As regards the reference to the Trustees account, that should be read in the light of the reference at the last session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is one reference I might make to the Sinn Féin Bank.  I mentioned it as being in liquidation.  On a former occasion I made reference to the Sinn Féin Bank.  The Liquidator has supplied me with an interim report and when the matter is completed a full report will be furnished.  I have also a report which it was not possible for me to have incorporated in my general reports owing to the death of a near relative of our official auditor.  I will read it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>SUPERVISOR REGISTRAR OF FRIENDLY SOCIETIES.</P>
    <P>This Office was created on 1st January 1922 for the purpose of receiving and registering the annual Returns of Societies formed under the Friendly and Provident Societies' Acts, and of sanctioning the formation of new Societies if their objects were approved and their prospects considered satisfactory.  The duties also include an examination into the financial conditions of each Society as shown in the Annual Return&mdash;its stability, working expenses, allocation of funds, investments, etc.  The financial year of all Societies ends on the 31st December in each year, and the Annual Return is to be filed&mdash;in some cases any time prior to 31st March, and in other cases 31st May in the succeeding year, but penalties were hardly ever imposed for default in filing returns at proper time.  At time of writing only one Annual Return has come to hand.</P>
    <P>The Societies for which supervision is required more particularly are those relating to Life Insurance, as in the case of mismanagement or financial instability it is the poorer members of the community who suffer.  These persons require protection, as individually or collectively they are unable to alter the conditions of affairs existing in the Society which they joined from motives of thrift, canvassers of rival collecting societies help to bevilder them by inducing them to leave their original society and join a new one, and it is often found afterwards that the change made has been to the disadvantage of the assured. The Societies themselves who permit this canvassing to take place are doing so to their own detriment&mdash; they accept onerous risks, their working expenses are increased, and <Col N="244" /> their financial position impaired. This Department has recommended that fresh legislation to deal with matters regarding Life Assurance be passed, and notes of the recommendations have been forwarded to the Legal Advisers.</P>
    <P>The financial statements attached to Mr. Collins' Report were as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. R. MULCAHY (MINISTER OF DEFENCE):</NameTxt>
      <P>My report has not been printed and circulated, not so much because of precedents in the matter of Defence reports but because of pressure of work up to the last minute.  If the House desires it, it can be copied and circulated.  The report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>26th April, 1922.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Policy.</i>&mdash;Since the inception of the new Ministry, the policy with regard to the Army has been to strengthen it in every possible way, in arms and equipment and in the solidification of the material and organisation that existed.  It was arranged with the Provisional Government that all evacuated military and police posts passing into their hands as a result of the Treaty would be taken over by the Army for purposes of their maintenance and safeguard; the expenses entailed by such occupation being charged to Provisional Government funds.  Volunteers were asked for to undertake to give full-time military service for a period of 18 months.  By the utilisation of these barracks for organisation and training purposes we have been able materially to increase the strength of our organisation and the efficiency of our forces.  By the employment of those buildings we have been able to relieve to some extent unemployment existing among Volunteers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Interferences with Policy.</i>&mdash;The increase in the effectiveness of the Army that was hoped for, while it has been very considerable, has been seriously interfered with by an attempt to divide the Army on the Pro-Treaty&mdash; Anti-Treaty question.  This attempt began as early as 11th January, 1922. A statement has already been made in this matter, but it is well that it should be reviewed here.  (See Appendix &ldquo;A&rdquo;).</P>
      <P>Not satisfied to leave the matter rest here, together with the Chief of Staff I travelled to Mallow on Monday 20th March, and met there the Divisional Staff of the 1st Southern Division, together with the Brigade Commandant of that Division, and after discussing the situation there we made the following offer (see Appendix &ldquo;B&rdquo;).</P>
      <P>The Dáil Cabinet could not agree to 5 or 6.</P>
      <P>As far as is known this offer was turned down without any reference to the general body of officers who had been collected to the Anti-Treaty side.</P>
      <P>On 23rd March a summons to a sectional Convention was issued, signed by five Divisional Commandants and 29 Brigade Commandants out of a total of 14 Divisional and 71 Brigade Commandants.</P>
      <P>The Sectional Convention was held on 26th March.  An Executive was set up, and the policy disclosed itself that the Army was to be split in order that at least some portion of it might be drawn away in the spirit of Dictatorship with a view to suppressing by force the pending elections.</P>
      <P>The Limerick episode disclosed the extent to which even as early as the beginning of February the movement to split the Army had gone and the extent to which those who were driving this split were prepared to go.</P>
      <P>In the matter of handing over barracks for occupation by local volunteers, the fact that the local O/C. might not agree with our policy had not been allowed to make any difference; even to the extent that where in the Tipperary No. 3 Brigade there was very definite indiscipline on the part of the Brigade Staff and serious interferences with local persons and property, barracks were handed over to the local troops in the hope that with responsibility placed upon them the rank and file of the Army in that area could be relied upon to exert an influence sufficiently strong to reduce that indiscipline.</P>
      <P>When the Barracks in Limerick came to be occupied on 23rd February the position was such that this policy had to be departed from.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, 18th February, the Brigade Commandant of the Mid. Limerick Brigade, in whose area the City was, issued a Proclamation repudiating the authority of G.H.Q.  The nearest commanding Officer, namely the O/C. of the 1st Western Division was instructed to occupy these Barracks.  (See Appendix &ldquo;C&rdquo;).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seceding Volunteers under what is known as the Executive have interfered with our officers and men in their work of organisation by:&mdash;Attacks of persons, Shootings of persons, Seizure of posts, Attacks on our transport, Systematic <Col N="250" /> attacks on our military posts, Seizure of stores.</P>
    <P>They have been helped in this matter by the fact that they are countenanced by a section of the Dáil Opposition, who, in spite of their acts, their repudiations of the authority of the Dáil, and in spite of their declared aims, portray them as the only true followers in Pearse's footsteps.</P>
    <P>In many districts the difficulty in holding the Organisation in any way intact has been very great.  Hundreds of men from Cork, Kerry and Limerick have been intercepted by armed bands while on their way to link up with G.H.Q. at Dublin, and they have been imprisoned and ill-treated.</P>
    <P>Mails are regularly interfered with in order to intercept correspondence passing between outlying Units and G.H.Q.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless it is possible to report a very satisfactory and a daily growing grip on practically the whole country.</P>
    <P>To-day the Chief of Staff, who has personally visited the greater part of the country, has published in the Press a general superficial report upon the state of organisation generally.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Police.</i>&mdash;In addition to the work of strengthening the Army and occupying evacuated military posts, we have undertaken the work of policing the country, and to this end have occupied a large number of evacuated police barracks. Owing to the secession of some senior officers this work of policing has suffered very much in some parts of the country. Many cases have arisen in which the local authorities or local committees have desired to set up a local police force and in some cases have desired to finance this force from the rates.</P>
    <P>The actual position in this matter is that there would be no difficulty in properly policing all areas if there were no repudiation of the Dáil authority on the part of the seceding Army officers. Funds are available for the purpose and it should be generally understood that in these areas where there is difficulty with regard to police at present, the policing of the areas shall have proper attention as soon as a proper and responsible command is established in these areas.</P>
    <P>EVACUATION.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Police.</i>&mdash;The evacuation of the R.I.C. has been completed, except that there are still a number awaiting demobilisation at the demobilisation stations at Collins-town, Gormanstown, Depot Ph&oelig;nix Park and at Dublin Castle.  In all about 250 positions have been taken over.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Military.</i>&mdash;The number of military positions taken over is approximately 40. The following places outside the Six County Area have yet to be evacuated by them:&mdash;Cork; Ballincollig; Youghal; Curragh Camp; Naas; Richmond Barracks, Dublin; Royal Hospital, Dublin; Portobello; Royal Barracks; Island Bridge Ordnance; G.H.Q., Parkgate St; South Dublin Union; Royal Infirmary; Magazine Fort; Baldonnel Aerodrome; some hutments at Queenstown.</P>
    <P>In the Six County Area troops are stationed at the following points:&mdash; Derry; Omagh; Enniskillen; Armagh; Newry; Ballykinlar; Hollywood (Down); Belfast and Antrim.</P>
    <P>COMPENSATION.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to initiate a scheme of compensation for losses arising out of war services rendered, and under the following heads:&mdash;(1) Dependants of Volunteers killed; (2) Disabilities resulting from wounds received or from ill-health attributable to service. (3) Educational and other programmes interrupted by military service.  (4) Grievous distress occasioned by forced neglect of means of livelihood owing to service.</P>
    <P>LANDS.</P>
    <P>No lands held by the British War Department in Ireland have yet been formally handed over with the exception of the Remount Department at Lusk. The handing over of these lands is being pressed for.</P>
    <P>DEBTS.</P>
    <P>Certain sums are properly owing to certain Divisions and Brigades in respect of debts incurred by them.  In respect of those areas whose senior officers have repudiated the authority of the Dáil, consideration of payment of those debts is help up until the necessary command has been solidly established in those areas and until it is clear that the payment of these debts would not be a prop to mutiny.</P>
    <P>On 14th February the sum of £3,900 was paid to the Adjutant of the 4th Western Division for the payment of <Col N="251" /> debts due to traders in the area, West-port, Galway, Clifdon, Oughterard.  The debts were to have been cleared and all receipted vouchers submitted to the Chief of Staff by 14th March.  The vouchers have not been submitted and it is not known to what extent, if any, the debts have been cleared.</P>
    <P>NEW ARMY.</P>
    <P>Apart from the very serious political aspect of the doings of the seceding section of the Army, the economic aspect of their doings is very serious.  They have been raiding monies, raiding properties, destroying properties, commandeering goods, interfering with the Press, commandeering buildings, and much of this work is done under cover of the declaration of the Belfast Boycott.</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  Raids on Post Offices (See Appendix &ldquo;D&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  Interference with Railways (Northern) (See Appendix &ldquo;E&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  Interference with Railways (D.S. Eastern) (See Appendices &ldquo;F&rdquo; and &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)  Destruction of Property in Bulk (Port and Docks) (See Appendix &ldquo;H&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>)  The passage from the Belfast Boycott to Private Property (Donnelly, Porter Sons) (See Appendices &ldquo;K&rdquo; and &ldquo;L&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>)  Extensive damage has been done to the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> printing plant. Their papers had been previously seized in thousands all over the country.  Daily at present the <i>Independent</i> is being seized in thousands.</P>
    <P>72 cases of commandeering and interference are reported within the Dublin City area since 1st April.</P>
    <P>The Shell Motor Spirit Co. have been so seriously interfered with, losing over 4,000 gallons of spirit between 3rd and 19th April, that they have threatened to close down their Firm temporarily.</P>
    <P>The Irish people in definite localities, or as a whole, must some time bear the cost of all this loss and destruction.</P>
    <P>Propaganda is going on attributing militarisim to the forces of the I.R.A. acting under the Dáil.  The Labour Party, in their statement the other day, say that they have ample evidence &ldquo;that men in both forces are guilty in many instances of inexcusable aggression and a desire to domineer over the unarmed people.  We have demanded that this state of affairs should cease and that the military forces should be brought to recognise the sovereignty of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have asked the Labour Party for any evidence that they have to produce with regard to any individual acts of aggression by any of our forces; or any acts that would show that our forces do not recognise the sovereignty of the people.  As far as this assembly is concerned, I hope that I need not remind those who have been associated with it for the last two or three years that those responsible for the direction of the Army during that time have protested over and over again that the Army had a special sphere of its own.</P>
    <P>Together with this type of propaganda, pushing over on the I.R.A. proper the discredit earned by the seceders, there is &ldquo;dope&rdquo; being given out about &ldquo;soldier politicians,&rdquo; endeavour being thereby made to brand those who at present command the Army with a nebulous kind of brand, attributing to them some of that mental sleight of hand attributed to low class politicians, with a view to undermining the confidence of the Army in them.</P>
    <P>There is very clear documentary evidence available to show that those responsible for the control of the Army at the present time act in the best interests of the country and act purely as soldiers in the highest significance of that word.</P>
    <P>APPENDIX A.</P>
    <P>The following is a statement of the genesis of the Army situation, which has culminated in the forbidding of an Army Convention by the Dáil Cabinet Order of March 16th, and the summoning by certain officers in defiance of that Order of a Convention for Sunday, March 26th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The correspondence given in Appendix A and initiated on January 11th, 1922 in which the summoning of a Convention is requested by a number of officers.</P>
    <P>2.  A meeting of Divisional and Brigade Commandants in Dublin on January 18th at which this request was discussed and of which a brief report is attached&mdash;Appendix B.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Majority Against.</i>&mdash;It was made perfectly clear at this meeting that the terms of the letter of the Minister for Defence, dated January 13th, stood, and that before a Convention could be sanctioned <Col N="252" /> permission to the Dáil should be obtained.  It was also made perfectly clear that the majority of the officers present considered that it was very inadvisable that a Convention be held at present and that they agreed to the holding of a Convention only because the alternative was that a section of the officers would themselves call a Convention and a break in the strength of the Army be thereby created at a time when the British were beginning the evacuation of their forces.</P>
    <P>3.  A meeting of Divisional and Brigade Commandants on February 24th, at which it was agreed that the Convention should be held on Sunday, March 26th.  At this meeting it was made clear by the Minister for Defence that owing to the postponement of the Dáil meeting from February 14th to February 26th the permission of the Dáil for the holding of the Convention had not been obtained and the orders summoning the Convention would not be issued until after such permission had been obtained. It was decided at this meeting that a meeting of Divisional and Brigade Commandants would again be held on March 15th with a view to settling upon an agreed agenda, and that in the meantime delegates would be selected for the Convention, simply as such, without reference to any particular resolution.</P>
    <P>That no resolutions other than the resolutions to be agreed on at the meeting of March 15th be accepted from any Unit of the Army.</P>
    <P>4.  Having previously foreshadowed to the Dáil Cabinet that a proposal to call a Convention of the Volunteers was under consideration, the Minister for Defence, at a Cabinet meeting on February 27th indicated that he desired to ask permission from the Dáil at its meeting on February 28th for the holding of a Convention.</P>
    <P>The spirit in which this Convention was being called is indicated in the note &mdash;Appendix C&mdash;in the terms of which note it was proposed to put the matter before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Limerick Episode.</i>&mdash;Considering it inadvisable that it should be made publicly known that a Volunteer Convention was being held, the Cabinet decided that the matter should not be brought before the Dáil and accepted the recommendation of the Minister for Defence that the Convention be proceeded with.  In the meantime there occurred the Limerick episode, 3&mdash;11th March, indicative of the thoughtless and indisciplined tendencies that were developing in the Army as a result of the political influences working upon it.</P>
    <P>It also became manifest that in some areas the agreement of the meeting of February 24th, namely that delegates would be selected for the Convention without reference to any particular resolutions, was not kept, but that for some reason various political issues were being put before some of the meetings called to select delegates.  Those issues ranged from forcing Volunteers to vote on a Free State versus Republic issue to appeals for delegates who would &ldquo;get rid of the present G.H.Q. Staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>To Prevent the Elections.</i>&mdash;There also appeared something like a systematic attempt to infuse among the rank and file of the Army the idea that the &ldquo;Army must prevent the election taking place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>6.  At the Dáil Cabinet on March 15th, specially discussing the implications of the Limerick episode and the Convention which had been called, the Minister for Defence had to admit to the Cabinet that he could nto guarantee that if this Convention was held there would not be set up a body regarding itself as a military Government not responsible to the people; and that he had given no hope of having generally accepted for putting before the Convention a resolution:</P>
    <P>(1)  Agreeing to appoint by election from among serving officers a Commission to frame and place before a subsequent Convention to be held after the General Election, proposals for associating the I.R.A. with whatever Irish Government was then in authority; and,</P>
    <P>(2)  Disclaiming any intention of setting up a military Government as opposed to any Government elected by the people.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Convention Forbidden.</i>&mdash;7.  In view of this and of the implications of the general agitation with regard to the Army, the Cabinet unanimously decided that the proposed Convention should be forbidden.</P>
    <P>8.  This decision, together with a general statement of the circumstances leading up to it was communicated to a meeting of Divisional and Brigade Comport <Col N="253" /> mandants, which met on the evening of March 15th.</P>

    <P>11th January, 1922.</P>
    <P>To</P>
    <P>Richard Mulcahy, T.D.</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>We, the undersigned members of the G.H.Q. Staff, Divisional Commdts., etc. of the Irish Republican Army, hereby request that a Convention of the Army be called, not later than Sunday, 5th February, 1922, for the purpose of considering the resolution attached herewith.</P>
    <P>We also require&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That the machinery for calling and carrying out the work of the Convention be made up of an equal number of persons, appointed by you on the one hand and by a Committee representing the undersigned on the other hand.</P>
    <P>(2)  That a Chairman of the Convention be appointed by mutual agreement between you and this Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Basis of Representation.</i>&mdash;(3)  The basis of representation at the Convention shall be:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) All Divisional Commandants shall be <i>ex officio</i> delegates; (<i>b</i>) Other delegates shall be selected as follows:</P>
    <P>1 delegate selected at a Company parade where 30 or less attend; 2 delegates where number is over 30 or under 70; 3 delegates where number is over 70.</P>
    <P>Those delegates shall attend Brigade Convention, shall select for the General Convention 5 p.c. of the total number of delegates to the Brigade Convention. In the event of 5 p.c. amounting to a whole number and a fraction, the number of delegates shall be brought up to the next whole number.</P>
    <P>All officers and men are equally eligible for appointment as delegates at Company and Brigade Conventions, with the exception of Divisional Commandants, who are <i>ex officio</i> delegates to the General Convention.  We will await a reply up to 2 p.m. on 13th inst. to this office.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Proposed Resolution.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;That the Army re-affirms its allegiance to the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That it shall be retained as the Army of the Irish Republic, under an Executive appointed by the Convention.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Army shall be under the supreme control of such Executive, which shall draft a Constitution for submission to a subsequent Convention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Minister's Reply.</i>  To: Each Signatory. 13th January, 1922.</P>
    <P>Attached is a copy of a communication received by me on 12th inst., bearing your name typed as a signatory.  In reply I have to say:</P>
    <P>1.  That the Dáil as a whole is the elected Government of the Irish Republic and that the supreme control of the Army is vested in it, and,</P>
    <P>2.  That the proposal contained in the resolution to change the supreme control of the Army is entirely outside the constitutional powers vested in the Dáil Executive by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am making arrangements to meet and discuss this matter with you within the next few days.&mdash;Beir Beannacht,</P>
    <P>Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Commdt. O'Connor's Answer.</i>&mdash;To: The Chief of Staff, 18th January, 1922.</P>
    <P>I am directed by the signatories to the letter of 12th inst., addressed to Mr. R. Mulcahy, Minister for Defence, to say that in view of the fact that you cannot see your way to call a Convention of the whole Army, that a Convention will be called by the signatories referred to.</P>
    <P>Further, that we repeat our desire to <Col N="254" /> co-operate with you in hastening the evacuation of the country by enemy troops, but to that end the signatories can only act on orders issued by you and countersigned by me.  Rory O'Connor, Chairman, Acting Military Council, I.R.A.</P>
    <P>APPENDIX B.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The January Agreement.</i>&mdash;A meeting of General Staff and all Divisional and independent Brigade Commandants was held in Dublin on January 18th.  The following were present:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>Adjutant-General.</P>
    <P>Quartermaster-General.</P>
    <P>Director of Training.</P>
    <P>Director of Engineering.</P>
    <P>Director of Munitions.</P>
    <P>Director of Chemicals.</P>
    <P>Director of War Publicity.</P>
    <P>Commandants of the following Divisions:&mdash;3rd Southern, 4th Western, 5th Northern, 1st Eastern, and Midland and the Commandants of the following Brigades:&mdash;No. 1 Dublin, No. 2 Dublin, Wexford North and Wexford South, and Carlow.  The Minister for Defence presided.</P>
    <P>From Army Viewpoint.&mdash;2.  The meeting was convened by the Minister for Defence consequent on an application made to him by certain members of the Staff and by certain Divisional and Brigade Commandants, requesting him to take immediate steps to hold a Volunteer Convention, the object of such Convention being to visualise the present national position from the Army point of view, and to submit to the Convention the resolutions given in Appendix A.</P>
    <P>3.  It was contended that the action of the majority in the Dáil in supporting the Treaty involving the setting up of an Irish Free State was a subversion of the Republic and relieved the Army from its allegiance to An Dáil, hence the necessity for a Convention to consider above resolution.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Elected Government.</i>&mdash;As against it was contended:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  That this resolution involved a change in the supreme control of the Army.</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  That the Dáil, as a whole, is the elected Government of the Irish Republic and that the supreme control of the Army is vested in it.</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  That a Convention at this juncture would tend to have a disrupting effect on the Army, as the differences which now exist would probably then take definite shape involving a split.</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)  That there was no definite Army policy to put before a Convention until the new Irish Constitution was drafted, and the position of the I.R.A. in relation thereto required to be defined.</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>)  That the Army continues as the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Watching Council of Four.</i>
    </P>
    <P>5.  After much discussion it was unanimously agreed that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  A Council of four, two from signatories requesting Convention, and two from remainder of Divisional Officers, be set to act as a Watching Council and Advisory Body under the Chief of Staff, as a guarantee that the Republican aim shall not be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  If any two members of the above Council decide that any proposal of the Staff is inimical to the Republic such proposal shall be dropped.</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  This arrangement to hold for two months from date (18th January), when a Convention will be called.</P>
    <P>APPENDIX C.</P>
    <P>Note of Minister for Defence for Dáil Meeting, February 28th.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Convention.</i>&mdash;As a result of urgings on the part of some members of G.H.Q. Staff and some Divisional Commandants, it is proposed to call a Convention of the Volunteers for the purpose of electing an Executive, which Executive, it is proposed, shall control the Army and draft a Constitution determining the nature of that control.  This proposal reverts the control of the Army back to the days before the disbandment of the Volunteer Executive.  The object of this is to restore to the Army a control which shall be expressive of their feelings, and in which the Army as a whole may expect to have confidence.</P>
    <P>In the present uncrystallised state of Government in the country, some feel that the Army may be used for party purposes, and the proposal is one which, if given effect to, will consolidate and strengthen the Army.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would prefer that this <Col N="255" /> Convention could have been avoided, and I don't accept any responsibility for the fact that it is forced to take place, but I do accept responsibility for recommending to the Dáil that in the circumstances permission for the holding of this Convention shall be given.</P>
    <P>The setting up of an Executive in this way does not in actual fact take the Army away from the control of the Dáil.  It but secures that, just as in the earlier days of the recent operations, the work of the Army shall be along lines agreed to, not only by the Dáil, but by its own Executive.</P>
    <P>(This note indicates the spirit in which it was hoped the Convention would assemble).</P>
    <P>APPENDIX B.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Offer made by the Minister for Defence at a Meeting of the 1st Southern Division on 20th March, 1922.</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  A meeting of Brigade and Divisional Commandants with G.H.Q. Staff.</P>
    <P>2.  To select from among the Divisional and Brigade Commandants&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  A Council of say eight Commissions</P>
    <P>(b)  To frame definite proposals for associating the I.R.A. with the Government elected by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>3.  To put these proposals before a subsequent meeting of the Divisional and Brigade Commandants, for agreement preparatory to</P>
    <P>4.  Putting them before the Dáil Cabinet.</P>
    <P>(Suggested dates:&mdash;1st meeting, Thursday 23rd March&mdash;2nd meeting, Saturday 8th April).</P>
    <P>The officers of the 1st Southern stated that they were not prepared to give an answer until the following day, Tuesday. On Tuesday O/C.  1st Southern and Adjutant submitted the following as the terms to which they would agree:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  A meeting of all Divisional and Brigade O/C's. to be held on Friday 24th inst.  (February) for the purpose of selecting a council of 8.</P>
    <P>2.  This council to be commissioned to frame definite proposals for associating the I.R.A. with the Government elected by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>3.  These proposals to be put before Divisional and Brigade O/C's. on April 8th.</P>
    <P>4.  When agreed to, these proposals would be put before Dáil Cabinet.</P>
    <P>5.  In view of the above the Convention fixed for March 26th is postponed to April 16th.</P>
    <P>6.  That recruiting for the Civic Guard be discontinued.</P>
    <P>(As 5 and 6 could not be agreed to, the proposals failed).</P>
    <P>APPENDIX C.</P>
    <P>LIMERICK.&mdash;<i>Captain Hurley's Arrest.</i></P>
    <P>[Extract].</P>
    <P>The position with regard to Limerick is that on Saturday, Feb. 18th, the Brigade Comdt. of the Mid.-Limerick Brigade, in whose area Limerick City is, issued a proclamation repudiating the authority of G.H.Q.  On Thursday, Feb. 23, certain barracks in Limerick were evacuated by the British and had to be taken over from them.  The O/C. of the 1st Western Division (Clare-Sth. Galway) was instructed as being the nearest responsible officer <i>to occupy these Barracks until such time as the rank and file in Limerick and such officers there as remained loyal to G.H.Q. could be organised to occupy them.</i>  For this latter purpose, Capt. Hurley, the Brigade Quartermaster, was instructed to parade the men of the various companies in Limerick with a view of getting a maintenance group to occupy the barracks and allow the 1st Western Division men to return to their Division.  He was arrested on Sunday, March 5th.</P>
    <P>APPENDIX D.</P>
    <P>RAIDS ON POST OFFICES.</P>
    <P>From the period 23rd March to 19th April inclusive raids on Post Offices to the number of 331 were carried out.  Of these raids 234 took place over the 10 days 29th March to the 7th April inclusive, the counties particularly concerned being Cork, 30; Clare 35; Tipperary, 29; Galway 64; Mayo, 32; Leitrim 18; Roscommon 17.  The County, however, appears not to be the Unit of raiding but rather particular Brigade and Divisional areas.  For instance, on the 29th March within approximately a ten mile radius of Mullingar seven post offices were raided. <Col N="256" /> On 31st March, within approximately a 15-mile radius of Kanturk 19 post offices were raided.  This is a Brigade area in which the Brigade is commanded by a member of this Assembly.  On 7th March, within a 15 mile radius of Cooraclare in West Clare, 14 offices were raided.  This area is the West-Clare Brigade.  On 7th April in the area Galway, Headford, Tuam, Milltown, Ballinasloe, portion of a Divisional area commanded by another member of this Assembly, 14 offices were raided.  On 14th April in the Connemara area west of Carroroe-Maam-Leenane, 17 offices were raided.  And in Mayo in the area Westport, Swinford, Ballyhaunis, Ballinrobe, between the night 29th March and 1st April inclusive, 22 offices were raided.</P>

    <P>Raid on the Port and Docks Bonded Stores. Specimen of Damage in Bulk.</P>
    <P>At 10.57 p.m. on the 6th, three armed men approached from the Store St. site, gained entrance, and locked the watchman in the office. 200 armed men took part. They destroyed about 1000 cases of whiskeyvalued about £100,000.</P>
    <P>The whole of the whiskey destroyed belonged to Messrs. Dunville, Belfast.</P>
    <P>APPENDIX K.</P>
    <P>We are business men in Mullingar. On the night of Thursday between the hours of 3 and 4 o'clock a.m. armed forces came to our business premises demanding goods which amounted to about £150, for which they gave us a receipt. They again called yesterday and got more goods for which they also gave a receipt, and they have left us entirely without any butter or sugar for our customers to-day (Saturday). They again called to-day and we refused to give them any more goods. We have decided to close up our business, and turn out our Staff if this thing is allowed to go on, and we ask you for protection, especially during the night time, as we are sure they will not attack us during the day time, as public opinion is against them.

      <P>read his report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attention of Dáil Éireann has been directed in earlier reports of the Local Government Department to the punitive and obstructive measures which, during the late war, were directed against local authorities and the resulting difficulties in the conduct of local administration. These ceased to be of serious import in the maintenance of public services from the time of the Truce, July 1921; since January they may be said to be no longer of any importance.  It is, however, to be noted that the payment of rates has not been maintained at pre-war punctuality, probably because of diminished incomes due to the trade slump, and to <Col N="259" /> the dislocation of normal business relations.  Furthermore, the assessments for the financial year, 1921&mdash;22, were necessarily very largely in excess of the previous demands made by rate-raising authorities.</P>
    <P>Owing to the unemployment which exists in varying extent throughout the country, local authorities have been pressed to carry into effect schemes for relieving distress and in the most serious cases the efforts of these bodies have been assisted by the machinery of the Local Government Department.  The greatest necessity has occurred on the western seaboard along most of the coast-line from Donegal to Cape Clear.  Various cases have, in these districts, contributed to a state of affairs clearly bordering on famine.  A most painful feature is that the native-speaking population has suffered from the economic pressure to an altogether disproportionate extent.</P>
    <P>The White Cross has voted a sum of £25,000 for relief on the west coast, and the Director of the White Cross will have the fullest assistance and co-operation from the Inspection Staff of the Local Government Department in dealing with the schemes to be inaugurated.  A Committee was also formed in Dublin to relieve distress, more particularly in Gorumna, Lettermullen and surrounding districts.  The Minister has received from this Committee a cheque for £1,300, the money being payable at his discretion, limited by certain conditions, mainly, that it should be applicable to work of a constructive nature.  This contribution has been supplemented from another source by £1,200.  These two sums have been lent without interest for the purchase of seed and will be repaid in accordance with the conditions.  The Councils of the Rural Districts in which these areas are comprised also raised from Banks a sum of £5,000 on loan, repayable from rates in a period of three years.  It is to relieve the interest thereon that these sums of £1,300 and £1,200 above referred to will be employed.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Department distributed relief (Food, etc.) to the extent of about £1,600 in the Gorumna, Oughterard and Galway areas.  A supplemental estimate will be presented for this sum, in addition to others referred to later.</P>
    <P>The money was spent in circumstances of urgent necessity to ward off the imminent consequences of actual destitution. The Department considered the conditions to be so serious that the local Inspector (Mr. Lysaght) was specially despatched to and was stationed in the district for several weeks.  Mr. Robbins, T.D., also went down and assisted the Inspector in completing the scheme, and attended the meetings of the District Councils.</P>
    <P>The other case in which a special sum was provided by the Cabinet, on the advice of the Minister, was the inauguration of a special fund for Tory Island, and the contribution of £50 to provide a nurse for the Island.  The total inclusive cost in this case is £308.</P>
    <P>The Department has arranged to place Inspectors at the disposal of the Director of the White Cross in connection with the scheme which it is proposed to formulate for various districts on the western seaboard at the cost of £25,000 generously voted by the White Cross. The counties requiring special assistance are Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Kerry, and possibly a part of Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received many deputations from towns where unemployment has become chronic.  Unemployment is always revealed at once in the pulse of Local Government.  In the first report submitted to An Dáil from this Department various extracts from speeches and writings, notably those of Daniel O'Connell and Smith O'Brien, were quoted, showing the inherent objection of the people to poor relief and the vital importance of dealing with the necessities of the people by constructive methods.  The basic essentials of schemes recommended by a Commission which sat in '36 (the two most prominent members of which were the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and the Episcopalian Archbishop) still remained unfulfilled, i.e., drainage and reclamation.  It is not submitted that unemployment can be dealt with directly by the State alone, but certainly the functions of the State should be regulated to enable the business of the community to be conducted in that condition of stability which is the right of good citizenship.</P>
    <P>Since furnishing the last Report problems necessitating very careful consideration <Col N="260" /> have arisen in most of the towns and cities throughout the country. From the facts presented to the Department it would appear that the specially serious instances are Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, Tralee, Ennis, Wicklow, Athlone, and Fermoy.  In the case of Limerick, the Mayor, Ald. S. O'Mara, pointed out in a letter to the Ministry the many municipal questions requiring attention.  The Mayor of Wexford represented early in the Autumn the effect on the Foundries in that town of the business slump, connected to some extent with the aftermath of the war. In three of the towns the Waterworks (or supply) need big capital outlay, and in two cases extensive expenditure on drainage is essential.  In Limerick, owing to the high death rate, a Medical Inspector was instructed to submit a special Report.  Generally speaking the resources of Urban Districts are taxed to the utmost in the maintenance of essential Public Services, and in many cases it has been represented that extensions or improvements are impracticable because of the increase in cost and the high rate of interest on loans.</P>
    <P>The economies effected by the Amalgamation Schemes for Unions, and the fall in prices of commodities, have resulted generally in a decrease of the rates levied for 1922&mdash;23.  The Amalgamation Scheme is based on the provision in each County of a Home for the aged poor and a County Hospital with subsidiary Hospitals where necessary.  While not identical in details the Schemes generally can be adapted to conform with a uniform policy for the whole country. Enquiries into the working of the present arrangements may be necessary to preserve the best features of existing Schemes.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary to point out that a local authority cannot function satisfactorily when its finances become disordered by the delay or remissness of ratepayers.  It is regretted that many local authorities have just cause for complaint in this regard; advantage has been taken of the unsettled conditions to withhold payment of rates lawfully due.  This is a matter which will require careful consideration.</P>
    <P>During the war period is was not practicable to carry out local audits except to a very limited extent.  The work has now been resumed and a statement is annexed showing the public bodies whose Accounts have been audited since the Truce.</P>
    <P>It is with infinite regret that the Department has to report serious predatory raids and seizures of monies belonging to Local Authorities.  Explosives being released by the Minister for Defence for use in quarries were seized in transit.  The cost of quarrying, if the operation has to be carried on without explosives, will be prohibitive, and consequent unemployment is inevitable. Roads will deteriorate to such an extent that reconstruction will eventually be possible only at enormous cost.  The laws respecting malicious damage stand and some local authorities are faced with the prospect of very heavy liabilities in consequence of the destruction of property.  In the case of the City of Dublin the loss in this connection may run to six figures.</P>
    <P>Cash to the extent of £1,000 was robbed from a Paymaster of the Dublin County Council who was on his way to pay wages.</P>
    <P>Many dishonest seizures have taken place of monies from Post Offices representing collections of Dog Tax.  The loss of these monies must necessarily reduce <i>pro tanto</i> amounts available in reduction of local rates.</P>
    <P>REPORT.</P>
    <P>A Departmental development has taken place since the submission of the last report, viz., the inauguration of a business section.  The General Council of County Councils favours central purchases, and standardisation of samples has long been the objective of important organisations&mdash;including Sinn Féin and the Irish Industrial Development Association. Last year the Trade Department of Dáil Éireann compiled useful information on this subject which was placed at the disposal of the Department. A Report is attached from the chief official of this section.</P>
    <P>Examinations have been held for several positions in the Local Government service throughout the country by the Local Government Department, and the Minister for Education has been consulted with a view to arranging for future examinations.  He has submitted proposals in connection with a scheme, and the matter is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>At the Ard-Fheis held in October last <Col N="261" /> the question of officials of local authorities being elected members of other local authorities arose and the general view was expressed that any person serving as a Local Government official should not be eligible for election to a local body in the same rate-raising area.  The General Council of County Councils forwarded the following resolution dealing with the subject passed at a meeting held on 23/2/22:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Resolved:</i>&mdash;&ldquo;That the Minister of Local Government be requested to introduce legislation to make permanent or temporary full-time officials or employees of any public body dealing with Local Government ineligible for election to any other such Public Body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless the matter be considered as non-contentious it is not proposed to introduce a decree.</P>
    <P>A supplemental estimate will be submitted to sanction a payment of £750 to the Treasurer Sligo County Council.  The facts relating to this payment are as follows:&mdash;In the spring of 1921 Rate Collectors in Sligo refused to pay over to the Council, in the absence of the Treasurer, rates collected by them.  The I.R.A. apprehended the Rate Collectors and recovered over £8,000.  The Local Government Inspector for the area informed the officers of the I.R.A. in Sligo that if rates were collected by them poundage would be paid on sums so collected.  It was apparently assumed by the officers in question that the action of apprehending the Rate Collectors was equivalent to collection and a sum of £1,000 was demanded and paid under protest.  It was subsequently claimed that in consequence of the action of the I.R.A. a total sum of £30,000 (including the £8,000) was collected in rates and paid to the Sligo County Council.  The case being reported to the Department it was pointed out that the deduction of £1,000 was illegal and that the sum should be restored.  A meeting took place in the autumn in the Mansion House of some of the officers concerned with the then Minister of Defence, the then Chief of Staff and the Minister of Local Government, and it was decided that the money should be restored.  This decision was reported to the then Cabinet and sanction was given to a contribution of £200 from the Department, thereby reducing the liability to £800.  As no action was taken on this decision, a further interview took place between the ex-Minister of Defence, Commandant Devins. T.D., the Minister and the Chief of Inspection Staff of Local Government.  An offer was made and accepted that £750 would be paid by the Local Government Department, and Commandant Devins, T.D., undertook to lodge £250, making up the total sum involved.  The Cabinet approved of this arrangement and a cheque was despatched to the Inspector for the area.  He reported that he was unable to secure the lodgment of £250 by Commandant Devins, T.D. before the 31st March, and he was instructed to pay to the Treasurer of the Sligo County Council the cheque value £750. The Bank receipt was forwarded to the Accountant-General for this sum.</P>
    <P>The Department willingly and gratefully acknowledges the value and importance of the various services rendered Local Government by the Army and frankly acknowledges that the success which attended Local Government adminstration depended on the help and support so rendered.  It is not, however, within the power of the Department to sanction payment out of monies raised in Rates for services rendered by the Army, and in no other case was such payment demanded or made.</P>
    <P>A section of the Mayo County Council at a meeting held on the 18th March adopted a resolution to strike a rate of 6d. in the £ for the support of the I.R.A. and I.R.P.  This resolution was adopted after the Chairman of the County Council had been voted from the Chair because of his refusal to accept a motion in violation of the law as adopted by Dáil Éireann and some members had withdrawn under legitimate protest.</P>
    <P>The usual procedure in such cases is to consider an estimate with details of the proposed expenditure, and no opportunity was afforded the members of considering the various items which were embodied in the proposed rate.  One of the members present when the resolution was carried stated that the proposed rate would be used to clear off liabilities &ldquo;as far as it went.&rdquo; The rate so levied is invalid.  Ratepayers are entitled to refuse to pay it and the rate cannot be sustained in the Courts.  The Department has been <Col N="262" /> informed a number of ratepayers from one district have written to the Council to say they will not pay this rate.  A Deputy of Dáil Éireann who is also a County Councillor, was present at this meeting.  He is a member of the legal profession and he supported this illegal levy.</P>
    <P>Serious dislocation of the public services and considerable unemployment are inevitable from this action of a section of the County Council.  An Inspector from the Department acting on instructions informed the County Council at a previous meeting the striking of this rate was illegal.  L.T. Mac Cosgair.</P>

    <P>(TRADE).</P>
    <P>6, Exchequer Street, 22nd April, 1922.</P>
    <P>To the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>A Chara, This Department has now concluded a partial Scheme of Collective Buying for the Public Boards and Institutions under Local Government Department control for this quarter&mdash; April, May and June.  We are handling 346 items out of a possible 1,110. We propose to take the entire lot for the succeeding quarter&mdash;July, August and September.</P>
    <P>The Institutions and Boards are, generally speaking, agreeing with the Scheme and Contractors inform us that orders are coming in, but there are many such who have repudiated our authority in the matter and are making Contracts themselves.  To deal with these we are furnishing our Auditors and Inspectors with our list of prices, so that they will be in a position to deal with over-charges.</P>
    <P>The result of our exertions have been to effect a considerable saving to Ratepayers. Manufacturers and Importers have largely tendered and are now supplying direct.  We collected, in as far as possible, returns of an average three months' buying, together with average prices paid.  We were unable, during the limited time at our disposal, to get complete returns and we may here mention that it was a matter of considerable difficulty to extract these figures from the Institutions.</P>
    <P>We got no returns at all from about 40 Unions as we were in hopes that these would have been amalgamated before Scheme came into operation.  We have, however, sent them on our Price Lists.</P>
    <P>Another important saving which does not appear at all is that each Institution will get the exact quality of goods paid for, and this, unfortunately, has not always been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>We have also invited Public Bodies to ask for our help in buying any article which they may require, and owing to many such applications made to us we are now negotiating about the price of Cement and will shortly announce a substantial reduction in price, both in British and Belgian makes.  We also gave our help towards inducing the Combine to restart the Wexford Industry and are glad to state that they are now about to do so.</P>
    <P>The following are the goods we were able to collect statistics of:&mdash;</P>

    <P>You will notice that the estimated saving in sight amounts to £13,720 8s. 2d.  To this should be added the very conservative estimate of say £6,000 to cover the saving of goods for which we could not collect statisties, making an estimated total of nearly £20,000.</P>
    <P>This Department has also taken up every item concerned with trade and prices throughout the 26 counties reported by the Inspectors or revealed in the Minutes.  To show how necessary this is we may mention that we have a contract for supply of Ambulances at £281 8s. 10d.  We heard of an ambulance being supplied by a local contractor to a County Home.  We asked our Inspector to report as to make and price.  The make was the same but the price was £414 5s. 0d.</P>
    <P>We give you herewith some prices taken at random from Contracts made by various Bodies on April 1st, 1922, and give you our prices for purposes of comparison:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Our prices include carriage.</P>
    <P>The diversity of tenders accepted was very great.  The most glaring example of this was in Medicine discounts, which ranged from nett list of 17½ per cent. off. We have on a revised and reduced List obtained a flat discount of 25 per cent. off the Country and 28 per cent. off for the Cities of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>We have given a preference in every case to Irish made goods and have been the means of starting two new absolutely Irish Industries by accepting tenders for goods not yet made.  The Combined Purchase Scheme can be used as a powerful lever in this direction by guaranteeing the sale before the goods are manufactured.  In this connection it is our intention to obtain from the various Institutions, etc., actual orders for three months' supply of non-perishable goods.  We can then ask for tenders for a given quantity and hand out the orders at once.  By this method we can make the Scheme more attractive to Manufacturers and Importers by saving railway carriages, risk of goods left unsold, and capital sunk in goods and raw material.  The result will be increased competition and a keener price.</P>
    <P>Since March 4th, this Department sent out 610 letters.  During the same period we compiled and distributed 39 Circulars containing over 10,000 folio pages.  The list of Contractors and prices alone ran into 20 pages, and this was sent to every Public Institution throughout the Country.  Letters received numbered 356, not including Minutes and letters sent in through other Departments.  Mise le meas, F.G. O Meachair.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. E. BLYTHE (MINISTER OF TRADE AND COMMERCE)</NameTxt>
      <P>read the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>April 25th, 1922.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Consuls.</i>&mdash;Since the last report from this Department was presented to the Dáil an additional Consul has been appointed, namely, Mr. Charles Bewley, B.L., who has taken up duty in Berlin. Mr. Seán O Duinn who was appointed to Rotterdam almost a year ago and who, after great delay, got his passport, only to be refused a Dutch visa, remained until the signing of the Treaty without much prospect of being able to get to his póst.  He has now, however, been informed by the Dutch authorities that the visa will be given.  It is noteworthy that, as a result of the Treaty, the work of our Consul has been greatly facilitated by the more cordial attitude of foreign officials and by the increased tendency of foreign manufacturers, merchants and shippers to come to them for consultation and advice.  During the past three months we have had intelligence of numerous plans for the development of direct trade and direct freight services with Ireland. Most of these schemes were started in the belief that we were about to have settled conditions and an internationally recognised Government with power to make tariff and trade agreements, and there is naturally a tendency to hold them up for the present.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prohibition of British Goods.</i>&mdash;The orders prohibiting the importation and sale of various classes of British goods were part of a policy too rigid and arbitrary to be really sound economically or to be justifiable except to meet a wartime emergency.  Pending the completion of evacuation the orders have not been revoked, but recently a certain number of permits have been granted for limited quantities of goods.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Commission of Inquiry.</i>&mdash;The work of the Commission of Inquiry is practically completed.  The offices occupied by the Commission have been given up and the services of the staff have been dispensed with.  In addition to the Reports already issued the Reports on Peat and WaterPower are in proof and the Report on Milk Products should be out this week. There remains to be drawn up only a short final General Report of the work of the Commission.</P>
      <P>Three typewriters and a &ldquo;Gestetner&rdquo; duplicating machine belonging to the Commission were seized by armed men on 31st March and, it is understood, conveyed to a house in Parnell Square occupied by a section of the Army hostile to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Position.</i>&mdash;Almost all Irish industries are at present feeling very keenly the pressure of foreign competition. In many cases the pressure comes principally from countries with depreciated exchanges.  Protection cannot <Col N="275" /> be afforded by means of voluntary preference, one of the reasons being that except under influence of strong feelings produced by actual war conditions, only a comparatively small section of the people will exercise discrimination. Propagandist appeals have some effect but give a constantly diminishing return. Until it is possible to put into operation a carefully considered Customs Tariff which will prevent dumping and afford to industries that have not yet been able to root themselves firmly the temporary shelter they require, it is practically futile to talk of industrial development; and of course a tariff would be of little value if we were to have anarchical conditions within it.</P>
    <P>During the present year the Department has been in touch with representatives of all commercial and industrial interests in a way that was not previously possible.  The unanimous opinion is that the best way to serve the country economically is not so much by attempting to deal with economic problems now as by getting the Treaty through.</P>

    <Title>APPENDIX TO REPORT. - DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.</Title>

      <NameTxt>MR. P. HOGAN (MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE)</NameTxt>
      <P>read his report as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To the President and Deputies.</P>
      <P>I beg to present a short Report of the work performed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for the period of three months from 14th January, 1922, to the 14th day of April, 1922.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Land Settlement Commission.</i>&mdash;The Courts of the Land Settlement Commission have been functioning regularly, and have dealt with a large number of cases in various parts of the country, during the period under review.</P>
      <P>As shown in Appendix A., Courts have been held in the counties of Cork, Carlow, Galway, Kilkenny, Leix, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon, Tipperary, and Westmeath, in addition to the Courts of the Emergency and Appeal Divisions, which were held in Dublin, involving the Ownership and Transfer of a total area of 13,792 acres.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Inspection and Valuation.</i>&mdash;As shown in Appendix B., over 5,000 acres in various parts of the country have been inspected and valued and in some instances sub-divided by the Inspectors of the Land Settlement Commission.</P>
      <P>These inspections were necessary in order to supply the Commisioners with sufficient expert and impartial evidence to arrive at an equitable decision in each of the several cases.</P>
      <P>In addition to the cases enumerated under this heading, there are also a number of others on which the Inspectors are at present engaged, but no figures in respect of these latter are included in this Report.</P>
      <P>
        <i>National Land Bank, Ltd.</i>&mdash;At the commencement of the period under review, I found that the National Land Bank had something like 5,000 Acres of land ready for immediate sub-division. It was necessary to secure the services of experienced Surveyors and Valuers to carry out this work, and in conjunction with the Officials of the Bank, I succeeded in obtaining, on loan, a number of officials from the Irish Land Commission to carry out this work.</P>
      <P>This experiment has proved successful, and, as is shown in Appendix C, over 6,000 acres have been demarcated and divided, and 230 families or landless men have been provided with new Holdings, or with additional Allotments.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Agricultural Labour Disputes.</i>&mdash;During the period in question, the Department had not many cases of Agricultural Disputes between employers and employees&mdash;the majority of cases of this nature being dealt with by the Department of Labour.</P>
      <P>A grave dispute in County Wexford between a local Branch of the Irish Farmers' Union and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union was effectively dealt with.  The area affected was a large one, embracing twelve Parishes in North Wexford, and prior to the Arbitration things had assumed an ugly aspect.  However, an amicable settlement was arrived at, and no complaints have so far, as a result, been made.</P>
      <P>There are a few cases pending Arbitration in the County Cork, and as soon as the necessary Submission Forms have been returned by the contestant parties, the conciliation will be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>The condition of agriculture generally is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land Purchase, for a variety of reasons, is nearly at a standstill.  The finances of the 1909 Act which were never sound are now on the point of <Col N="276" /> breaking down.  Ireland cannot afford to finance future Land Purchase on the lines of the 1909 Act, but at the same time, the success of any future scheme must depend largely on the financial credit of the nation.  To devise a scheme for the continuance of Land Purchase in place of the existing ones which are worked out, is a primary necessity, but at present this cannot be done because, while present unsettled conditions continue, the necessary money cannot be found.</P>
    <P>Prices of agricultural produce tend to fall below the cost of production, and transit charges are exorbitantly high. As a result, land is going out of cultivation. Compulsory tillage will not remedy this because it is making a beginning at the wrong end.  New markets and new and more efficient methods are necessary.  The Railway system and the inland waterways of the country must be overhauled.  The development of an efficient dead meat trade which would make it profitable to raise beef and bacon instead of stores would mean an immediate and permanent increase in tillage and in the opportunities for employment that follow; besides being at least a partial insurance against a loss of the English Markets in the event of the entry of Canadian stores.  The projected Factory at Waterford has not yet materialised, and the Drogheda Factory built and equipped with the most up-to-date plant, at a cost of about £500,000 is idle.  The fact is that this state of affairs is inevitable in present conditions.  Agriculture is no exception to the rule that applies to industry generally.  Trade and industry require peace and security for their development. The future of Irish agriculture is now completely in the hands of Irishmen.  It is in grievous need of development but neither capital nor enterprise will be forthcoming while the present insecurity lasts.</P>

    <P>FISHERIES DEPARTMENT.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sea Fisheries.</i>&mdash;A period of acute depression has followed upon the fisherman's brief spell of apparent prosperity arising out of conditions brought about by the European War.  With the exception, however, of a few cases, where a man already possessed suitable and well-equipped boats, the so-called &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo; was far from genuine, inasmuch as it involved the incurrence of heavy liability, by way of loans for boats and gear, at a time when prices were at their highest; and owing to the failure of the Fishery in the last couple of seasons, the instalments on such loans could not be discharged by the borrowers.  Scores of valuable fishing boats are at present lying up in various harbours, their crews stating that with the price now obtainable for fish, it would not be possible to meet the loan instalments, and yet make a living.  A very conservative estimate of the damage and depreciation which would accrue on Boats, Engines and Gear thus left lying up for an entire season would be £30,000 while the loan instalments amounting to some thousands more, would also be in arrear.</P>
    <P>An Dáil has already assisted in the establishment of 5 Co-Operative Fishery Societies, but with one exception they have not been successes. Their failure was mainly due to their efforts to start operations at a period when the Black-and-Tan régime was at its height. Possibly also the isolated situation of [278] each of these Societies tended to prevent their existence having any real effect upon the industry as a whole. Some scheme of National Co-operation on a liberal scale must ultimately be faced. As a beginning, however, propaganda of an educative and stimulative nature must be set afoot among the public generally, as well as the Fishery folk, because without the creation of a suitable atmosphere no development in the case of an industry like this, which has been permitted to grow moribund, can be practicable. A scheme for such propaganda is under consideration at present, and in order to assure economy and to achieve something that shall be more than experimental, it is proposed to follow the lines which have proved successful in the case of countries like Norway, Denmark and Canada. With patient effort and reasonable help from State Funds this Industry can be rehabilitated and made to play a big part in a scheme of national economy.</P>
    <P>A great number of complaints have been received during the past quarter, concerning the infraction of territorial limits, etc., by British and Belgian Steam Trawlers, as well as by French Fishing Smacks in pursuit of the Cray Fish and Lobster. Of course until an adequate service of Revenue Cutters, or Protection Vessels of some kind, has been provided, it is manifestly impossible to prevent such incursions into our Fishing Grounds. I may say here that the French Consul in Dublin has promised to do everything possible to prevent this.</P>
    <P>The matter of developing the sale of fresh fish in Irish inland towns is also receiving attention. The Irish Railway Companies, nearly three months ago, promised revised rates for the carriage of fresh fish, but so far have failed to furnish them. The development of this inland trade is of the utmost importance, and it is better to have a slight initial delay than to set up some scheme, in haste, and find it unworkable later on.</P>
    <P>Those Irish Exporters of Mackerel who trade with the U.S.A., are much exercised over the proposed Fordney Tariff, the effect of which, so far as Mackerel is concerned, would be to impose a duty of about 28/- per barrel, and this, of course, would kill the industry. The latest advices from the States, however, are to the effect that this Tariff Bill is not likely to go through this year, and indeed may not pass at all in its present form.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inland Fisheries.</i>The Irish Salmon and Trust Fisheries constitute a not inconsiderable part of the nation's potential wealth. With adequate preservation, and proper management, the annual value of the industry now standing at, roughly, £500,000, could be trebled.</P>
    <P>At present, everyone who has, or believes he has, any interest in the fresh water fisheries, is seeking to have his own way, regardless of consequential damage to others, and complaints and suggestions innumerable have been received. As it is quite apparent that the present regulations governing Irish Inland Fisheries are interwoven into some very big questions of rights, prescriptive and otherwise, a decision has been made that, pending the holding of a thorough investigation into the whole question of our Inland Fisheries, which it is proposed to have made as soon as possible, the existing regulations must remain in force. That decision has been notified to all correspondents, and also published in the Press.</P>
    <P>It is to be borne in mind that the function of a Fisheries Department is to conserve the Fisheries in a national sense, and not merely to arrange for their distribution as between one set of persons and another. Occasionally, however, it is possible to bring about the settlement of some such question in a friendly spirit, and this happened in the case of some rodmen on the upper reaches of the Slaney, who, early this year, sought certain concessions from a couple of right-holders. The settlement effected through this Department was regarded as satisfactory by all parties. An effort was also made to bring about an amicable settlement of a dispute between riparian proprietors and others on the lower reaches of the Slaney, but it did not prove successful.</P>
    <P>An Act was passed through the British House of Commons, last autumn, authorising an increase of one hundred per cent. in Licence duties for fishery purposes. The original idea was not without merit; but, as some Boards of Conservators were not willing to make the increased charges, it became necessary to suspend the proposed increases, and let the old rates stand. This was accordingly done.</P>
    <P>A considerable sum of money will be required, in the near future, to rehabilitate <Col N="279" /> this industry, and so render it a national asset.</P>

      <P>submitted the following report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Report on the Activities of the Labour Department During the Period 11th January, 1922, to 18th April, 1922.</P>
      <P>
        <i>General.</i>&mdash;At the commencement of this period under review the work of the Labour Department had been more or less confined to the settlement of Industrial disputes, and on the whole the Department had met with very gratifying results.  I am glad to be in a position to state that the Department's activities have not diminished, and as will be seen from the appendix to this report, fifty-one industrial disputes have been terminated during the period through its intervention.</P>
      <P>I might point out, however, that the number of cases set out in the appendix does not, by any means, represent the full number of Conferences which have taken place under the auspices of this Department, as in many cases it was necessary to bring the interested parties together many times before an agreement could be reached.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Irish Railways.</i>&mdash;During the Christmas holidays of last year the Secretary of the Department was approached with a view to Government intervention in the threatened crisis on the Irish Railways. This crisis was due to the proposed putting into operation of the Carrigan awards from the 1st January. Several Conferences were convened, and eventually the Companies agreed to postpone the application of the Awards from the 1st to the 15th of January, so that the Department might have an opportunity of endeavouring to reconcile the differences between the Railway Companies and their employees.  Further Conferences took place on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th January, and on the latter date negotiations were suspended pending the formation of a new Cabinet, and the appointment of a new Minister for Labour.  The latter, in conjunction with the Minister for Economics, resumed the negotiations which continued daily until the evening of the 14th January, when the Department handed over the conduct of further negotiations to the Provisional Government, as it was not considered desirable that Dáil Éireann should give the guarantee which was necessary to the securing of a settlement.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Canal Commission.</i>&mdash;A stoppage of work on the Grand Canal system took place at the end of January of this year, as a result of a movement on the part of the Canal Company to reduce the war bonus payable to those of its employees who were not tradesmen.  In January and February several Conferences were convened by this Department without effect, and a stoppage of work took place.  However, at a further Conference held on the 24th February a temporary agreement was reached providing <i>inter alia</i> for the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry consisting of a Chairman nominated by the Minister for Labour, one member&mdash;representing the general trading interests&mdash;nominated by the Minister for Economics, and one member each nominated by the Grand Canal Company, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and the Boat Owners' Association.  The purpose of this Commission was to investigate the working of the Grand Canal System with a view to recommendations being made which might&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  Enable the canal to afford an improved service to the public, having regard to the interests of bye-traders and of riparian traders.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)  Help the Company to be worked on a sound economic basis; and</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)  Put the Company in a position to grant improved conditions of working, and such wages as would yield the Canal workers a higher standard of living; and to report as soon as possible, and in any event not later than May 15th, 1922.</P>
      <P>A Commission was duly set up in accordance with these terms.  A warrant of appointment was issued by the President on the 3rd April, and the first public sitting was held on the 11th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious intention in setting up a Commission composed of direct nominees of particular interests is to so equip the tribunal at the outset with expert knowledge, that the taking of evidence may be confined within the narrowest limits, leaving so much the greater proportion of the available time for the private deliberations devoted to the practical <Col N="280" /> examination of the subject, and the preparation of such sound comprehensive conclusions as may give adequate effect to the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this was the intention of the parties to the Agreement, and that the tribunal was regarded in no sense as judicial.</P>
    <P>The Commission took steps to expedite and dispose of necessary evidence. In their agreed public notice, the coordination and presentation of evidence by representative bodies was urged with this object, and intimation was given that, after the examination of proposed evidence, the Commissioners would summon such witnesses as they desired to hear and examine in person.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, it became evident at an early stage in the proceedings that the general trading interests, and the Boat Owners' Association, together with their respective nominees, failed to appreciate the character of the tribunal. Representation of these interests by Counsel, including the right of cross-examination of witnesses, was sought. Apprehending that this would involve the appearance of Counsel generally, and that the introduction of evidence and argument rendered largely unnecessary by the nominated character of the Commission, would militate against the completeness and soundness of the report by encroaching unduly on the very limited time available for its preparation, the Chairman, supported by the nominees of the two parties to the Agreement, felt bound to resist the admission of Counsel to a direct part in the examination of witnesses.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Economics and Labour, when appealed to, confirmed the Chairman's view of the limitations of the Commission, constituted as it was, and restricted as to time by the Terms of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The nominees of the trading interests and the Boat Owners' Association thereupon found themselves obliged to withdraw, and these interests&mdash;brought in by the Agreement in the hope of making it possible to place inland water transport on a sound and enduring footing, at least so far as the Grand Canal System is concerned&mdash;subsequently intimated their inability to take part without the appearance of Counsel on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The Agreement between the Grand Canal Company and its employees, though of temporary duration, represents a certain gain in transport affairs. Any action tending to counteract the gain is to be deplored.  The Commission asked for in the Agreement was intended to have been, and would have been, comparatively inexpensive and less formal, though none the less effective, than the more general Commission which would be set up by the Government on its own initiative.  It is to be regretted that the general trading interests and the Boat Owners' Association&mdash;the immediate users of the waterway&mdash;did not show a greater inclination to enter into the spirit of the other interests, and avail of the opportunity afforded them of taking part, not only in the furnishing of information by way of evidence, but in the constructive labours of the Commission itself.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that inland navigations, in common with the other transport agencies of the country, should operate and be regulated without delay, with due regard to every aspect of the community's economic life and development, and that the Grand Canal labour question should be dealt with, not merely superficially, but as part of the larger question.  A movement was, therefore, made in the direction of obtaining the assent of the parties to the Agreement to an alteration of its terms, which would admit of the setting up of a free, as distinct from a nominated Commission, and such extension of time and of terms of references as would allow of its not only dealing with the Grand Canal System adequately, but of bringing within its scope the economy of inland water transport as a whole.  A considerable sum of money is required to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Creameries.</i>&mdash;The situation in the Creamery Industry had become very acute at the end of the year 1921, as both the Proprietary and the Co-operative sides of the industry felt that unless some reduction of wages was put into operation business could not be carried on.  Prices had fallen to a very large degree, and while reductions in wages had been effected in certain instances, these reductions were quite inadequate as a relief from the difficulties of the industry. As the result of negotiations conducted by the Department during several months up to February, 1922, during which a series of Conferences representative of all the interests concerned took place, an agreement was reached providing for the establishment of two Joint Councils for <Col N="281" /> the two wings of the industry&mdash;proprietary and co-operative&mdash;with subsidiary District Committees for local negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Constitutions of these Joint Councils were made very wide so that almost any matter of interest to the advancement of the industry could be discussed, and more particularly any matter on which the workers were at variance with the creamery owners. Provision is made that no stoppage of work shall take place until the local machinery has first been tried, and in case it is unable to effect a settlement of the difficulty, the appropriate Joint Council has had an opportunity of considering the matter, and has also been unsuccessful in providing a way out. The Secretary of the Joint Councils is an officer of the Government, and by this means the industry as a whole is provided with an effective link with the Government.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the Co-operative Joint Council took place on the 10th February in the forenoon, and in the afternoon of the same day the first meeting of the Proprietary Joint Council was held.  At both these meetings a representative of the Department presided, and in accordance with the Constitution the Co-operative Joint Council planned the establishment of seven district Committees in Munster, and drew up a constitution for those bodies.  The Proprietary Joint Council set up one District Committee for the Province of Munster, and arranged its constitution.</P>
    <P>The first District Committee meeting took place on the Co-operative side at Limerick Junction on the 18th February, presided over by a representative of the Department, and the necessary sanction to the erection of the Committee was given by representatives of the industry in that area.  The preliminary arrangements&mdash;election of chairman, procedure, etc.&mdash;were agreed to, and arrangements were made for the consideration, at a meeting to be held on 4th March, of the application of the Co-operative Creameries for a reduction of wages.  The matter was discussed at meetings of the District Committee held on the 4th and 28th March&mdash;a representative of the Department being present at the latter meeting&mdash;but agreement was found impossible, and the matter was referred to the Joint Council.  The Council met on the 5th April, 1922, and after discussion a proposal was made which the representatives of the Creameries accepted, and the representatives of labour undertook to recommend to the workers for acceptance.</P>
    <P>The Munster District Committee on the Proprietary side held its first meeting at Limerick Junction on 23rd February, which was presided over by a representative of the Department. Similar business was transacted as at the Limerick Junction District Committee on the Co-operative side further meetings took place on the 7th and 10th March, at which the wages question was discussed without a settlement being reached, and the matter was referred to the Joint Council which met on the 16th March, 1922.  The matter was very fully considered, and the discussion centred mainly on the Condensed Milk Co. of Ireland's application for a reduction of wages, the main grounds advanced being that the Condensed milk portion of the business was being run for the past two years at a substantial and increasing loss.  The representatives of labour viewed the Company's case with considerable suspicion, and with a view to arriving at an impartial opinion on the matter it was arranged that the Council should adjourn to the 22nd March, and that in the meantime the Chairman, with the assistance of an Accountant and Auditor to be appointed by the Department, should investigate the Company's books, and report the result of his investigations to the Council.</P>
    <P>When the Council re-assembled the Chairman's report was read, and bore out the Company's contentions.  The matter was very fully discussed during a two days' session, and various schemes considered with a view to giving Labour an interest in the business.  Finally it was arranged that a proposal to reduce wages and carry on the business as at present for a period of two months should be submitted to a ballot of the workers, and that the Chairman should prepare a statement of the whole question for circulation by the Trade Unions, so that the workers should be in possession of all the facts when the ballot was being taken.  The Council adjourned to the 31st March to allow these arrangements to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The examination of the Company's books and the circulation of the Chairman's statement referred to above are interesting as evidence of the value of <Col N="282" /> the Council, after less than two months' existence, in the removal of that distrust of Capital and its statements by Labour, which is such a fruitful cause of friction between two elements in industry whose interests are not in their essence antagonistic.</P>
    <P>The Council re-assembled in the 31st March, and the result of the ballot&mdash;a very large majority against the proposal &mdash;was announced.  The proceedings of the Council, however, had raised the matter from the level of a mere trade dispute, and the parties had come to look at the question as a matter of national interest involving not merely the Company and its workers, but thousands of farmers who supply milk to the Company through the south and west of Ireland, and who would be forced to a radical alteration of their system of farming if the Company closed down.  Strenuous efforts were accordingly made by both sides to prevent a breakdown of the negotiations, and after a long discussion it was arranged that a proposal, of which the following is a summary, should be recommended by the Company's representatives to their Board, and by the Labour representatives to the workers: Wages to be reduced for the period of a month, during which time Labour would negotiate with any parties interested for the purchase of the Company's properties and interests.  If the negotiations resulted in a purchase, the amount of the wages reduction should represent part of the purchase price, and if not, the amount should be refunded to the workers unless otherwise arranged by the parties.</P>
    <P>The result of the ballot of the workers shows a small majority in favour of the acceptance of this proposal.  Save for a difficulty at one of the Company's establishments where the workers threaten a strike if the reduction in wages is put in operation, the matter is now proceeding smoothly, and steps are being taken with a view to organising the parties who would be likely to take part in the purchase negotiations.  I would like to say here the branch referred to is the biggest branch in Leinster.  In spite of the recommendations of the Union they have struck and have been on strike for a fortnight.  Several thousands of pounds' worth of stuff has gone to waste.</P>
    <P>Minor matters dealt with at the Proprietary Joint Council were the rates of payment of auxiliary creamery managers, and in addition a scheme of classification of Creameries was drawn up.  The Co-operative Joint Council considered the question of a national brand for Irish Creamery butter, and passed a resolution in favour of the establishment by the Government of such a brand.</P>
    <P>Steps are being taken to press forward the establishment of the district committees throughout the country, and it is intended that a representative of the Department will attend the meetings to be held in the various districts for this purpose.  On the 6th April a meeting was held in Sligo of representatives of Creamery Committees at which it was agreed to set up a Sligo District Committee to cover the province of Connaught.  A representative of the Department was in attendance and explained the procedure.  A panel of members was nominated from which the various Creamery Committees are to vote for the six members on their side of the Committee.  The Department is in communication with the labour interests with a view to the selection of their side of the Committee.</P>
    <P>A meeting for the same purpose will be held in Waterford on the 21st April, and at Newcastle West and other centres as soon as possible after Easter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Printing Trade.</i>&mdash;In the latter part of the year 1921 the Master Printers demanded a reduction in wages of 7s. 6d. per week, and negotiations took place without result.  Early in January, 1922, the proposals for a reduction were submitted to a ballot vote of the men, and were rejected unanimously.</P>
    <P>Following an interview on January 18th with the Minister for Labour, the parties forwarded a submission signed by both sides agreeing to refer the matter of wages in dispute to the Labour Ministry as a Conciliation Committee. The Minister accordingly arranged for a representative to hear the parties, and the hearing took place on the 24th January, 1922.</P>
    <P>At the outset both sides intimated that they had no mandate to depart from the attitude previously adopted, i.e., the masters could not accept a lesser reduction, while the workers' representatives stated that they were instructed to accept no reduction whatsoever, and that a reduction could only <Col N="283" /> be agreed to after being authorised by a ballot vote.</P>
    <P>After conferring with both parties separately and jointly, the representative of the Department made the proposals contained in the subjoined statement, and received an assurance that they would be submitted to the members of the respective Associations. On the 30th January, the General Secretary of the men's Association stated that &ldquo;my Executive Council accepted the report of the deputation and decided to submit the suggestions made on behalf of the Department to a ballot vote of our members in Ireland.&rdquo; It appears, however, from the ballot paper that Suggestion No. 4 was not submitted, and that the men received no lead or guidance from their Association. In the circumstances it was not surprising that a majority of the men voted against accepting the suggestions.  I should say that the Association is an English one.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the Masters' Association have decided to defer action until a more favourable opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>PROPOSALS.</P>
    <P>(1)  That a Committee consisting of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers be appointed to consider forthwith any anomalies in the re-grading scheme adopted by the parties in September, 1919, with a view to the removal of those anomalies.  Such Committee to issue its decision not later than the 28th February, 1922.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the wages of the workmen concerned employed by all members of the Irish Master Printers' Association be reduced by 2s. 6d. per week for a period of three months, the first reduction to take effect on the pay day falling within the week ending 4th February, 1922. Where notice of reduction has not yet been served, the customary notice to be given before any reduction takes place.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Joint Labour Council consisting of representatives of the respective Associations shall meet within three months for the purpose of devising a scheme for the regulation of wages of the workmen concerned which shall apply after the expiration of the said three months. Should the Council fail to devise such a scheme before the expiration of the said three months, and should any dispute as to wages result, the matter shall be referred again to the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>(4)  That both parties shall recommend to the members of their respective Associations that the foregoing terms be accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Merchant Tailors&mdash;Enquiry into Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade in Ireland.</i>&mdash;As a result of a dispute between the Irish Merchant Tailors' Association and their employees the Department intervened with the object of securing an amicable settlement. After prolonged negotiations an agreement was arrived at on the 14th February last for a period of six months, and it was agreed that a Commission should be established in the meantime. This Commission of Enquiry was established and immediately commenced its labours.</P>
    <P>The employers claimed to have the right to introduce into their existing handicraft workshops the system of labour under which male workers worked side by side with female workers.  The Workers' Union in Great Britain having permitted in many cases such a system of labour in the workshops there, the employers in Ireland claimed they must have the same privileges to enable them to compete successfully with the products of Great Britain. It was also claimed that the division of the handicraft system of tailoring would bring about increased production, with a resultant reduction in price to the public, and would at the same time facilitate the making up of stock garments during periods of slackness.</P>
    <P>Figures were adduced to show the decline in trade which had taken place in recent years, and responsible expert witnesses were examined.  It was evident to the Commission that a substantial proportion of the male population in Ireland were dressed in clothes imported readymade into this country, and the tendency would appear to be for this class of trade to increase, particularly in view of the fact that within the past few years a new type of high grade ready for service suit, made on American principles, was being turned out in Great Britain at a low price, and being sold in Ireland on a rapidly increasing scale.  It was alleged that the handicraft tailoring trade was at present unable to compete with the <Col N="284" /> mass of high grade &ldquo;ready for service&rdquo; clothing which was being imported. These well finished garments were being bought largely by former customers of handicraft tailors.</P>
    <P>The Commission investigated fully, through the examination of expert witnesses, the different methods of production prevailing in Ireland and also in Great Britain, America and Canada, with a view to considering the possibility of their application to the handicraft tailoring trade in Ireland.</P>
    <P>From the outset the workers' representatives on the Commission opposed strenuously the introduction into the handicraft tailoring trade in Ireland of diluted labour, on the grounds that it would bring about an increase of unemployment in their ranks.  They contended they would be fully justified in refusing to train women to do their work, and thus put females in a position to replace them at a later date.  The livelihood of the male workers in the trade would be encroached upon and seriously menaced by the adoption of any such scheme.</P>
    <P>As a result of its deliberations the Commission was agreed as to the necessity of formulating proposals of such a nature as would improve the present position and prospects of the handicraft tailoring trade.  They realised that in order that this trade might be able to meet the competition of a certain class of readymade trade some reduction in the present cost of production was necessary, and that their task was to determine in what manner such reduction might be effected without detriment to the interest of handicraft workmen. It was hoped that an increase in the volume of trade would result from reduction in the cost of production, and that such increase would be beneficial to all parties.</P>
    <P>Numerous schemes were considered, and three draft schemes, which had been formulated by the sides of the Commission, were circulated amongst representative employers and Trades Unions. There was not, however, a sufficient measure of agreement amongst the parties interested as to the relative merits of any particular scheme.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that both the employers' side and the workers' side should draw up independent reports on the matter, and that these should be transmitted to the Chairman who would forward them with a covering report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>These reports have not yet been received, but they are expected about the end of the present month.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dublin Master Printers&mdash;Employment of Female Labour.</i>&mdash;A Conference is proceeding presently between the Dublin Master Printers' Association and the Irish Women Workers' Union, with R. N. Tweedy as independent Chairman, nominated by the Department.  Three meetings have been held, the last being on March 27th; the next will not be held until the 26th inst., as both parties required time to collect information for the better presentment of their cases.</P>
    <P>The Conference is actually a Conciliation Board which was set up by an Agreement of February 22nd, which resulted from a Conference between the parties who met, at the invitation of the Department, to settle a dispute at Dollard's.</P>
    <P>The Conciliation Board has to enquire into the causes of the dispute at Dollard's, and to discuss the possibility of drawing up rules applicable to women workers employed in the printing and kindred trades in Dublin, and, if practicable, to draft such rules as will be acceptable to both parties.</P>
    <P>The Chairman is satisfied on the evidence that the strike at Dollard's should not have taken place, but that makes the need for definite rules all the more apparent.</P>
    <P>At the outset the Printers' representatives held the view that it was quite impossible to draft rules which they could accept, but the Board is well on the way to doing so.  The Chairman hopes that the outcome will be satisfactory, and will go some way to ensure peace in the industry.</P>
    <P>Another two meetings should complete the business of the Board.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the above report that the Department has been engaged on work of a more progressive and valuable nature than was possible during earlier periods.  At the same time the Department's successful intervention in industrial disputes compares very favourably with the results secured during any similar period since its organisation.</P>
    <P>Any member of the Dáil who is anxious to receive a copy of the constitutions of the Joint Councils and District Committees for the Creamery and Allied Industries can do so on application to the Secretary of the Department.</P>

    <P>Tá a lán oibre déanta ag an Aireacht ó cuireadh an Connradh i bhfeidhm nárbh fhéidir a dhéanamh roimhe sin. Tá níos mó dul chun cinn ar an nGaedhilg ins na scoileanna agus taobh amuigh dhíobh le trí mhí ná mar bhí ó thosnuigh an obair seo na Gaedhilge. Chífear a dheimhniú soin san tuairisc seo am' dhiaidh.  Táthar ag iarraidh na múinteóirí a chur i n-iúl do mhúineadh na Gaedhilge agus feidhm níos fearr a bhaint as na múinteóirí Gaedhilge atá ins na scoileanna fá láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá sraith pingne buailte i n-ocht gConndaethe i gcóir Scoláireachtaí ós na Bun-Scoileanna go dtí na Meadhon Scoileanna.  Chuir Ard-Chomhairle na gComhairlí Conndae an scéim os comhair na hAireachta.  Ní mór no coingheallacha agus an Clár bheith ceaduithe uainne.  Déanfaimíd an scrúdú scríobhtha in gach áit leis.  Níor ceaduigheadh aon scéim acht i gcóir aon bhliain amháin.</P>
    <P>Tá sraith pingne don Ghaedhilg buailte in 18 gConndaethe.  Níl cead ón Aireacht um Rialtas Aitiúil aon airgead a chaitheamh muna bhfuilimid sásta lefs an Scéim.  Déanfar obair an-mhaith sa tslfghe seo agus is mór an ní go bhfuiltear ag cur oiread san suime ins an nGaedhilg.</P>
    <P>Tá coiste comh-cheangail ag oban chun cláir na mbun-scoileanna agus na meadhon-scoileanna agus na scoileanna ceárdúla do chur i n-oiriúint dá chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá an Aireacht ag cabhrú leis an Aireacht um Rialtas Aitiúil chun gléas scrúduithe a ceapadh i gcóir postanna fé sna Comhairlí Dúithche.</P>
    <P>1.  An gléas a ceapadh i gcóir Aireacht na Gaedhilge in 1920 tá sé 'ghá chur i bhfeidhm go hiomlán anois.</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  <i>Timthirí.</i>&mdash;Tá ochtar Timthirí againn sa Ghaedhealtacht agus cunntas cruinn againn anois ar chor na Gaedhilge ins na scoileanna, ar na múinteóirí agus eile.</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  <i>Comórtas na mBonn Airgid.</i>&mdash;Tá a bhfad níos mó scoileanna istigh ar an gComórtas so i mbliadhna ná mar a bhí anuiridh.</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  <i>Comórtas idir Liontaibh Tighe.</i>&mdash;Níorbh fhéidir an Comórtas so do chur ar siubhal anuiridh.  Tá na Timthirí ag ullmhú 'na chóir i mbliadhna.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Na Bun-Scoileanna.</i>&mdash;Tá an Clár Nuadh a ceapadh fé ughdarás na Dála curtha amach go dtí na Scoileanna ó Oifig an Bhúird Náisiúnta.  Tá fonn oibre ar na múinteóirí agus déanfaid a ndicheall chun an Clár do chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>De dheascaibh ordú a cuireadh amach ó'n Rialtas Sealadach tá an Ghaedhilg á múineadh anois ar feadh uaire a chluig sa lá in gach scoil ina bhfuil múinteóirí Gaedhilge.  Nuair a bheidh na tuairiscí againn ar an scéal so beidh fhios againn cad iad na ceanntair 'na bhfuil práinn leo.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Na Meadhon-Scoileanna.</i>&mdash;Bronnadh Corn Airgid i ngach Cúige anuiridh ar an Scoil Meadhonach do b'fheárr chun labhairt na Gaedhilge.  Socruigheadh i mbliadhna dhá Chorn a thabhairt i ngach Cúige, ceann dos na buachaillí agus ceann dos na cailíní.  Ainmnigheadh ceathrar cigirí i gcóir na Meadhon-Scoileanna. Táid ag obair ó'n chéad lá de Mhárta, agus duine i ngach Cúige. Tá eolas beacht á bhailiughadh acu ar mhúinteóiribh na meadhon-scoileanna. Táid ag cabhrú leis na múinteóirí agus ag tabhairt comhairle do scoileanna atá chun tosnú ar an nGaedhilg i mbliadhna.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán scoileanna ná raibh an Ghaedhilg á múineadh riamh ionnta ag lorg múinteóirí.  Na múinteóirí atá <Col N="289" /> anois ins na scoileanna soin táid ag foghluim na Gaedhilge.</P>
    <P>Tá Clár i gcóir 1923 ceaptha ag an gCoimisiún agus an Ghaedhilg ar an dul céadna leis an mBéarla ann.  Tá na coistí ag obair ar Chlár Nuadh do cheapadh agus beidh tuairisc uatha fé chló sa samhradh.</P>

    <P>[Translation.]</P>
    <P>(Report from January 11th to April 21, 1922).</P>
    <P>Owing to the changed conditions brought about by the Treaty, the work of the Department has been greatly facilitated.  In regard to the Irish Language in particular more progress has been made this year in the schools and elsewhere than during the whole period of the Gaelic Revival Movement. Evidence of this appears in the various sections of the Report.  Steps are being taken to increase the supply of Irish Teachers and to reorganise school timetable so as to make better use of existing teachers of Irish.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the General Council of County Councils the Department has prepared a scheme for scholarships from Primary to Secondary or Vocational Schools.  Seven County Councils and the County Borough of Waterford have struck a rate for such Scholarships.  The conditions and syllabus of examination have in all cases been submitted to the Department, which will also take part in the examinations.</P>
    <P>Schemes have been sanctioned for one year only.</P>
    <P>Eighteen County Councils have levied a penny rate for Irish language purposes. The rate is sanctioned by the Department of Local Government on condition that schemes for spending the money are approved by this Department.  Much useful work will be done.  The striking of the rate is evidence of the existence of a strong feeling among the public on the Irish language question.</P>
    <P>A Co-ordination Committee under the Department has prepared a scheme of Co-ordination of Programmes from Primary to Secondary or Vocational Schools.</P>
    <P>The Department is advising the Department of Local Government on a scheme for examinations for positions under Local Bodies.</P>
    <P>I.&mdash;The scheme projected by the Department of Irish in 1920 is now completely in force.</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  The Department has eight organizers in the Irish-speaking districts.  From their Reports schedules are being compiled, showing the position of Irish in the schools, the qualifications of the teachers in Irish, etc.</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  Competition for Silver Medals.&mdash;The entries are far more numerous than last year.</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  Competitions among Irish-speaking households.&mdash;It was found impossible to hold this competition last year.  The organizers are preparing to hold it this year.</P>
    <P>II.&mdash;<i>Primary Schools.</i>&mdash;The New Programme prepared under the authority of Dáil Éireann has been issued to the schools from the National Education Office.  There is evidence that the teachers will make every effort to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> In pursuance of an Order issued by the Provisional Government, Irish is now being taught as an ordinary school subject for at least one hour daily in every school where a teacher is available. Reports as to the working of this rule will show exactly what our teaching power for Irish is.</P>
    <P>III.&mdash;<i>Secondary Schools.</i>&mdash;Last year the Department gave a Silver Cup in each province to the Secondary School which was doing most to encourage the speaking of Irish.  Two cups are being offered in each province this year&mdash;one for Girls' Schools, and one for Boys'. Four Inspectors have been appointed and have been working since March 1st. They conduct the Cup Examination and report the teaching of Irish in the Schools.  They have given much assistance to the teachers and advise schools which are about to take up Irish.  A great number of schools which have done no Irish are now arranging for teaching for next year.  The present Staffs of these schools are attending Irish classes.</P>
    <P>A Programme for the Examinations in 1923 has been prepared in which Irish is on the same footing as English.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Secondary Programmes is now considering criticisms received on the Draft Reports and will present a Final Report shortly.</P>
    <P>IV.&mdash;<i>Scholarships to Preparatory Training Colleges.</i>&mdash;There are at present 37 Scholars in Preparatory Colleges under our schemes.  The scheme has been advertised this year and applications to date show a big increase on last year.</P>
    <P>V.&mdash;A number of books in Irish suitable for school use have been published under the authority of the Department. A public notice has been issued asking that all MSS. of this nature should be submitted to the Department with a view to preventing overlapping and confusion as to Terms.</P>
    <P>VI.&mdash;At a Conference with Representatives of Irish Colleges it has been decided that the Colleges in Irish-speaking districts shall be reserved for teachers who have at least a working knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>The teachers and other interests co-operated in the preparation of the Primary Programme.  The same is true of the work at present in progress with regard to Secondary Schemes.  As a result of this policy the teachers will co-operate in every way in giving effect to the Programme in the schools.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Finance.</i>&mdash;Permission was obtained from the Ministry to send £450 to Cork School of Music; £100 to Cromog School, Co. Wexford; and to present £100 for a new National Academy.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. DESMOND FITZGERALD (MINISTER OF PUBLICITY)</NameTxt>
      <P>read the following report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Bulletin</i> ceased publication as a daily organ last December.  All other work of Publicity Department continues as before.</P>
      <P>During the period since Christmas it has been necessary to concentrate considerably upon the situation in the north, particularly in Belfast.  The situation there has been that a systematic pogrom has been directed against the Nationalist inhabitants, many of whom were murdered and their houses burned and looted.  The Belfast Press represented these occurrences as Sinn Féin outrages.  These misrepresentations were also cabled abroad.</P>
      <P>To meet this situation we issue daily reports on Belfast.  Particular care has been taken that these reports should be reliable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made several visits to Belfast and arranged a direct telegraphic news service.  This last course was adopted as it was necessary to get the truth published before the misrepresentations had been accepted.</P>
      <P>This publicity for the north has been as successful as could be expected.  But unfortunately the world's Press generally has been more interested in the far less serious disturbances in other parts of Ireland, such as the mutiny of certain portions of the Army, the interference with public meetings, lootings, shootings, etc.  Naturally the Belfast Press and other anti-Irish agencies have taken this opportunity of attributing the crimes of Orange gunmen and Special Constables to &ldquo;Sinn Féin extremists.&rdquo; Nevertheless, we have been largely successful in bringing much of the truth about Belfast before the world.</P>
      <P>Certain speeches, apparently advocating civil war, followed by lawless acts by mutineers, have given the impression abroad that the Irish people are about to spring at each others throats.  This no doubt, will be remedied when the election puts an end to the present transition period.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. W.T. COSGRAVE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move a supplementary estimate of £3,440 for the Department of Local Government. It includes a sum of £1,600 for relief in Galway, £750 of which, as I have explained, is a refund to Sligo Co. Council, and £500 for increase of salaries.  The staff had to be increased and re-groupments in existing divisions took place.  There is a sum of £308 for relief in Tory Island.  £258 consists of relief to the people of that island.  They are not subjects for assistance from local rates, as it has been reported to us that they do not pay rates and never did and according to the reports which came to us they were quite right not to have paid any of the rates because they have none of the advantages of the people who do pay rates&mdash;Poor Houses, J.P's, and the attributes of modern civilisation. There is also a sum of £280 for a motor car for the Department.  It was found that the Engineering Inspector could not possibly get through with the work he was engaged on.  An addition of two has been made to that staff since the Truce, and after careful consideration we came to the conclusion that it was absolutely essential to have the advantage of a car and a car was purchased. The total sum is £3,440.  I accordingly move for that sum.</P>

      <P>Before the House adjourns, if it was a contentious matter a Decree would be brought in. The Local Government is one of those services which should be conducted without party politics.  It is a matter of business and the question of politics ought not to enter into a well administered Local Government Department or a well administered Co. Council, Borough Council, Board of Guardians, or anything of the sort.  Mr. de Valera, I believe, agreed with the proposal that was put forward at the Ard-Fheis in this connection.  I do not see how any contentious matter comes into it.  I do not want to bring up anything contentious in connection with the Local Government Department if it can be avoided.  I want to know if there is any objection to the proposal?  It is in the report of the General Council of County Councils and in substance it was agreed to at the Ard-Fheis.
