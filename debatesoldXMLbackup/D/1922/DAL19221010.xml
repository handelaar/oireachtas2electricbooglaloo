      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs when he proposes to institute an inquiry into the cases of men who resigned from the R.I.C. during the Anglo-Irish war.  If he is aware that some of these men, and their families, have suffered great hardships since their resignation owing to their inability to secure any other employment.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of the Government to grant compensation to certain Royal Irish Constabulary men who resigned or were dismissed in recent years, because of their national sympathies.  It is intended that such men will receive as generous terms as if they had remained in the force until the date of their disbandment.  Legislation will be required to cover such compensation, and it is proposed to introduce the appropriate measure as soon after the enactment of the Constitution as is practicable.  An inquiry into each individual case will, of course, be necessary, and prior to the introduction of the proposed legislative measure, an investigating committee will be appointed.  I have no doubt that some of these men and their families have suffered great hardships since their resignation, but in this connection it should be remembered that there are many other people who have suffered acutely and for whom no compensation is available.  It is, however, hoped to set up the investigating committee at an early date to deal with this specific case of ex-Royal Irish Constabulary men.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether his attention has been directed to the announcement in the Public Press for some time past of a Monster Sweep of £10,000 in connection with an English Horse Race, known as the Manchester November Handicap, on behalf of a popular Dublin Hospital&mdash;the Mater Misericordiae&mdash;and whether the said. Sweep will be administered in such a manner as not to contravene the existing laws appertaining to the holding of public lotteries, sweeps, etc., and if he will cause to have published by the promoters a full and certified statement by a reputable and recognised public auditor, showing the receipts and disbursements in connection therewith, so as to safeguard the charitable and philanthropic public from being exploited under the guise of praiseworthy charity and generosity for the material gain and sordid personal advantage of an individual or combination of individuals, and with this end in view will he (the Minister) take such steps as will ensure that the entire net proceeds will be handed over to the hospital in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I answer this question because I had a visit from a Member of the Dáil in connection with this sweepstake before its initiation.  I am aware that the Sweepstake referred to in the question has been promoted, and in connection with it a Deputation of the Mater Carnival Executive Committee waited upon me.  It appears that the Executive Committee have entered into an agreement with Mr. Richard Duggan to run this Sweep.  Under this agreement Mr. Duggan is to give £10,000 in prizes, which amount, I understand, has actually been lodged with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and is to pay over to the Committee a further sum of £10,000 three days before the draw, no matter what the result of the Sweep may be&mdash; Mr. Duggan bearing all expenses.  In other words, no matter what happens, the Carnival benefits to the extent of £10,000, without running any risks.  It appears that Mr. Duggan has since <Col N="1385" /> made an amended offer to let the Committee take over the whole organisation and simply pay his expenses.  The Committee refused that offer.  The Committee appear to be perfectly satisfied with the arrangement which they have entered into with Mr. Duggan and want him to keep to his original bargain with them, namely, to pay over to the Committee the sum of £10,000, win, lose, or draw.  The Deputation which waited upon me pointed out that they have no machinery for carrying out such a project without risk, and stated that they considered the best interests of the Carnival would be served by accepting the offer made to them.  The Deputation assured me that they are quite satisfied with the bargain they made with Mr. Duggan.  It is understood that the accounts will be submitted to audit.  In the circumstances, I see no reason for interfering with the holding of this Sweep.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he is aware that Michael Fitzgerald, a native of Birr, serving in the Connaught Rangers in India, was, in July, 1920, sentenced to penal servitude for life, for his alleged connection with a mutiny of Irish Troops, whether he is aware that Fitzgerald is still detained in Maidstone prison; and whether, in view of the general amnesty arising out of the ratification of the Treaty, he will make representations to the British Government, with a view to securing the immediate release of this man.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Michael Fitzgerald is one of several Connaught Rangers serving in India sentenced to penal servitude for life.  From its setting up, the Provisional Government has lost no opportunity of urging the release of Connaught Rangers and other Irish prisoners whose imprisonment was due to activities obviously prompted by patriotic motives. Early in the present year following on representations made by the Provisional Government and after much pressure the sentences of the imprisoned Connaught Rangers were considerably reduced as a result of which eight were <Col N="1386" /> released in March.  In addition to these Connaught Rangers fourteen post-Truce prisoners were released in April.  It will be understood that cases involving questions of army discipline present special difficulty.  The Provisional Government has not lost sight of the remaining Irish prisoners, and it will not relax its efforts to secure their release. It is considered that the passing of the Constitution will present a favourable opportunity for taking up the matter again with the British Government.  I want to say that on every possible and impossible occasion since the Provisional Government was set up this matter has been pressed, and Deputies should understand that Army cases, cases of men who were imprisoned under distinct Army jurisdiction present very special difficulties.  It was held that these cases were not covered by the general political amnesty; and the most we were able to effect up to the present was the sweeping reduction of the sentences passed under Court Martial.  The matter has always been taken up both in correspondence and interviews with the British Ministers, and it will be taken up again on the passing of the Constitution.  It is considered that would be a favourable time to press the matter.</P>

I refer to the two men in Kilmainham jail, and who, according to to-day's papers, have had their sentences reduced.</P>

      <P>To ask the President, in view of the fact that a number of small private traders are being served with writs by business firms in England, owing to the fact that their property in O'Connell Street was destroyed during the recent fighting, and, further, in view of the extreme hardship imposed upon such traders by the inability of the Ministry to deal with their cases for compensation at the present moment, if he would consider the advisability of giving such persons the <Col N="1387" /> benefit of a moratorium, pending the time when they will be in a position to meet their liabilities, as they are prepared and anxious to do, out of the compensation to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>Special steps to expedite the treatment of compensation cases are being considered, but it does not seem feasible to adopt the suggestion made in the question, that is, as regards a moratorium.  A moratorium for a limited class of persons is scarcely a practicable proposition.  We would do more harm than good by creating a bad impression in England and abroad were we to consider this suggestion.</P>

I learn that the payment of compensation for destroyed property will be made without any avoidable delay.  These payments should have a very beneficial effect.

Having regard to the difficulty in providing houses to be let at economic rents, it is not advisable or possible at present to restrict the markets in which building materials may be purchased.

I would hope, at any rate, that the Minister would give careful consideration to the question that is involved in this, apart from the merits of this particular phraseology&mdash;the principle that is involved, that the Members of the Executive Council should be precluded from being in private business and in business concerns which might be affected by contracts for the Government. It is so important that if it is not to be inserted in the Constitution it ought very early in the history of the newly Constituted State to be made a subject of legislation.  Such a clause as this is, as a matter of fact, inserted in many Constitutions, and I do not see any good reason why it should not be inserted in our Constitution.  I am not standing over every sentence of this Clause, but I would rather invite the Ministry to indicate their willingness to agree to the principle and to see if it is possible to insert some clause of this nature in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>In principle we would agree with the ideas that are embodied in this amendment, but the difficulty is as regards the practice.  For example, &ldquo;No Member of the Executive Council shall perform the duties or receive any remuneration from any other <Col N="1398" /> Office.&rdquo;  I do not know that they have any other Office at the moment, but let us suppose for a moment that a professional man got into the Ministry and had an office or a surgery or something else of that sort, it would mean he would not be allowed to have anything to do with that business.  I think that some consideration ought to be given to the matter before putting it in black and white. What are the restrictions in regard to them?  &ldquo;No Deputy or Senator may be a Member, or Representative, or Agent of any Company or undertaking which shall secure a Contract for the supply of material to any Government Department.&rdquo; Take that particular one.  If through some mischance a man had shares in a Company, what would his position be?  Would he be disqualified from being a Senator?  He may have adopted a very patriotic attitude in investing in some Irish Company within the past few years; he might even have forgotten that he was a member of this Company.  That would exclude or disqualify him for the office, so that you will see the practice to put down this amendment as it stands would, I think, lead to more difficulties than actually securing the object intended.  In principle we all agree with the advisability of it.  I was just putting one case in which an exception might have to be made, but generally speaking there is agreement in regard to the principle involved, and we consider it would be best effected by legislation, where it might get more consideration and steps might be taken to prevent it being abused or at some time an infringement of the rights of individuals.</P>

It is hoped to evolve an entirely new Judicial System, which will supersede both the British Courts and the Dáil Courts, as formerly known.  The Committee will, of course, aim at absorbing whatever is best in both of these systems.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Ministry and the Dáil that the clause as worded is rather premature, because the clause provides that the High Court, and no inferior Court, shall decide whether any particular law is opposed to the Constitution or not.  Now, some such provision as that may be very good to make by law of this Dáil later on, but the Minister has just told us that the whole Judicial System is going to be re-cast, and I think&mdash;at the moment we do not know what Judges we may have outside the High Court&mdash;it would be a mistake to prohibit those Judges from dealing with such questions as these. For instance, you are going probably to extend County Court jurisdiction.  There is a very general feeling that people should be able to get justice without coming to Dublin, and if you will appoint Judges in the country, who will hold a much higher position than the County Court Judges at present do, it would be highly desirable that these Judges should have the power to determine points of <i>ultra vires</i> concerning the propriety under the Constitution of laws that may have been passed, rather than to make your litigant go to the worry of coming to Dublin.  My suggestion is that you should leave out the second part of the Article saying &ldquo;the High Court alone shall exercise original jurisdiction,&rdquo; or accept the amendment.  My only point is that it is premature to say that the High Court only can hear these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>As against that, there is the objection that if you leave jurisdiction to County Court Judges, or to whatever will correspond in the new system to the County Court Judges, you might have as many views of the validity of a particular law as Judges.  This, above all things, is a question which requires uniformity and finality.  Regardless of when the new system may come into being, it is desirable to get one decision <Col N="1401" /> that will bind all inferior Courts, and have early finality on the question, whenever the validity of the law may be raised.  I do not expect that it will be raised very often, but a prompt and binding decision by all the Courts in the land is desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We have embodied in that Article the question of appellate jurisdiction which was held by British Ministers, but strictly according to the Treaty we could be bound with the exact Canadian position as regards appellate jurisdiction.  The Canadian position is pretty much what the position here was with regard to the House of Lords, that an appeal lay automatically, and even in domestic legislation, and an appeal could be taken to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  Now, what is secured in this Article 65 is the most favourable position, i.e., the South African position.  I do not know just how many appeals there have been taken from South Africa since the Union was set up, but I believe the number will be found to be very small.  An appeal would not lie in the case of ordinary routine domestic legislation, but only in cases where international issues were raised was permission for such special appeal granted, as provided in this Article.  There is no express provision laid down in the Canadian Act as to appeals to the Privy Council, by a section which preserves all existing laws, and which preserves this existing appeal in all cases to the Privy Council.  Under the Australian Act the prerogative to grant such a right was reserved to the Crown in Council, and it is expressly preserved provided that Parliament may make laws limiting the cases in which such leave may be asked for, but that such a law shall be referred to the Governor-General for Royal assent.  In the South African prerogative the Crown can grant such leave to appeal, and the Crown in Council is preserved in the same way as in Australia, but in effect it went further, being bound with provisions analogous to the first part of this Article.  Now I propose to read an extract from the work of Professor Keith, who has been quoted before in this Dáil as an authority on constitutional matters.  The extract deals with the question of appeals to the Privy Council:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Fresh importance has been attached to the development of the status of the Dominions to the question of the retention of the right of appeal from the Dominion Courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  That body itself has shown no anxiety to extend <Col N="1403" /> its jurisdiction; it has, on the contrary, affirmed the principle that only in cases of the highest importance will it hear appeals from the Union of South Africa, so that for practical purposes the appeal from the Union is a matter of mere theoretic interest.  It has similarily declined its technically valid right to hear appeals from Canada, even in so interesting a case as that of the Winnipeg rioters whose condemnation raised bitter political feeling in the Dominion.  It has also shown great reluctance to grant leave to appeal in any Australian case not of the first importance.  It may therefore be held that the jurisdiction, though still in active exercise and though still of the highest importance as regards cases on the Australian Constitution, is in process of obsolescence, and that the way is paved for its extinction unless steps are taken to revise the basis on which it rests.  The feeling in Canada in favour of the retention of the appeal is growing weaker, as is evinced by the proposal in 1920 of the Ontario Government to secure the abolition of appeals from the Courts of that Province to the Judicial Committee.&rdquo; There is just one further point in this Article.  It is perhaps worthy of note, and it is that no cases of law can be made from appeals of this kind.  In the very rare cases in which an appeal can be granted to a particular case it would simply be dealt with on its merits and the Courts in Ireland would not be bound in any way to follow such a decision given in such an appeal.  It would not be possible to evade that appeal. I have shown on the strict interpretation of the Treaty, we would have been bound to the Canadian position.  We have in effect secured a position very much more favourable than that of Canada.</P>

It is a case of very definite contradiction, despite the case made for the inclusion by the Minister, and I beg to move the deletion of this clause, leaving to the lawyers the job of arguing it out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The contradiction is apparent rather than real. In the Constitution of the country a certain Court is laid down as the final Court, and in ordinary routine domestic legislation it is, and will be, undoubtedly the final Court.  But, inasmuch as we have accepted the King, then we have to accept the special prerogative of that King, and grant, in very special cases, the right of appeal.  That is the prerogative that is attached to Kings, at least English Kings, as long as we know them.  In the first instance, they heard such appeals themselves in person, but gradually, when that became too much like work, they established a buffer between themselves and the petitioners, and the fiction was that that was the King in Council. It is simply a question of facing the realities of the position that, under the Treaty, we have not been able to get rid of that appeal, but we have reduced it to a minimum, and we have, I feel, reduced it to a position where there will not be two or three appeals in a century, where appeals will only be granted in very special cases, raising matters other than purely Irish interests, raising international issues of the first importance.  If Deputies take the trouble to inquire, as I have not taken the trouble, to see how many appeals there have been from the Union of South Africa since that Union was established, it will give you some indication of the proportion on that question.</P>

      <P>Is that last remark of the Minister correct in this case?  The King appeared once specifically under that title and once by implication. The oath is one of fidelity and allegiance to the Irish Constitution as by law established.  The King as part of the Legislature and the King as part of the Executive is surely included in that.  One part of the oath refers to the King as head of the Union of Free Nations.  I think the Minister is not quite correct in what he says.  I spoke at some length on what is practically the point at issue in this matter a few evenings ago, and I have no intention of repeating myself. But I think it is right to remind the Dáil that when Lord Carnarvon, in 1867, set up the Canadian Constitution as the result of various negotiations between the Provinces of Canada, the Canadians were very anxious, inasmuch as they foresaw that many constitutional questions would arise between the Provinces and the Federal Government, that in case disputes should arise there should be no room left for appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England.  They decided to set up a Federal Court&mdash;the Supreme Court of the Federation&mdash;whose business it would be to consider questions of that type.  But in one respect unfortunately, perhaps in another fortunately, the view that the Canadian Courts took of the relation between the Provinces and the Federal Government under the new Constitution was such as to give judgment invariably limiting the powers of the Provincial Legislature and increasing, at their expense, the power of the Federal Government. So that in a few years there was quite a large number of appeals to the British Privy Council.  Now the developments of the Canadian Constitution are all away from making appeal on domestic issues to the Judicial <Col N="1406" /> Committee in Westminster; and similarly, in South Africa.  And it seems to me highly necessary that our claim should be similar to that put forward by Grattan.  We are not independent; we are not what we are supposed to be under the Treaty, if such appeal on an Irish question of law is to exist in any shape or form.  Because I do not see how this can be disputed that if any friction arises as to the interpretation of this document, and if any friction arises with regard to the decision of a Court of Law, that the determination of it is to be left to Downing Street.  Downing Street is the ruler in the last resort, and no declaration of right, such as in that draft Constitution, or any other documents which might emanate from us, or from any other similar body, will get rid of that actual fact.  All the power lies there where the last appeal lies, and I make this plea again to Ministers, as on a similar occasion recently&mdash;let us get the last ounce out of the Treaty.  Let us show that there is an Irish interpretation of the Treaty, as well as an English.  If it involves further negotiations, there is very little harm.  At any rate we shall know what is the mind of the British Cabinet on such a very important Constitutional question.</P>

      <P>This does not interest me very greatly, but I am anxious that the Dáil, at any rate, should not be led into any error by what has fallen from Deputy Magennis.  It is quite true that the Privy Council meets in Downing Street, but the Privy Council that hears appeals from the Supreme Courts of the Dominions is a Privy Council that sits in Whitehall, and it is not composed of a general body of what is usally described as &ldquo;His Majesty's Privy Council.&rdquo;  The Board of the Judicial Committee consists exclusively of selected lawyers of great distinction, many of them, it is true, from England, one or two from Ireland, and several from the Dominions. It was in consequence of dissatisfaction on the part of the Dominions with a Board composed exclusively of lawyers of great eminence, though all English, that the Judicial Committee was augmented by the provision of Chief Justices and others who had held high judicial office in the Dominions themselves. It is to that body that appeals, <Col N="1407" /> if there are any appeals to go from this country&mdash;which I very much doubt&mdash; will go.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware of that.  I said before that I did not want to repeat what I had spoken.  I am quite aware, for instance, that Lord Chief Justice Villiers of South Africa was included in the Judicial Committee, and I am quite aware that one of the greatest of the Canadian lawyers was also included in it; but there is no Imperial Council <i>as such,</i> and if any question arises as between one Dominion and another, or as between the Free State of Ireland and the Dominions, there ought to be such a Council.  The Dominions themselves are looking forward to the Constitution of an Imperial Commission or Imperial Council, to which such an appeal would lie.  Meanwhile, I think it is incumbent on us to assert our Irish position.</P>

      <P>There is really little use in making the sort of speeches that the Deputy who has just sat down has made.  In Clause 2 of the Treaty it is laid down that the relationship of the Crown to the Irish Free State shall be that of the Crown to the Dominion of Canada.  So that this was specifically accepted when the Treaty was accepted, and there is no use at all in making those high-falutin speeches about Irish interpretations, or saying that we should stand up and assert our rights, and that sort of thing.  There is no use in going back, or attempting to go back, or asking for a reconsideration of something that has already been considered. With regard to what Deputy Johnson stated about the apparent contradiction between the last portion of the first paragraph and the proviso, I can hardly believe that it was the existence of the apparent contradiction that made him wish to delete the second paragraph, because if we had only the contradiction to consider, it could have been got rid of in another way.  It seems to me that there is value in this sentence, which says: &ldquo;the decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive, and shall not be reviewed or capable of being reviewed by any other Court, Tribunal or Authority whatsoever.&rdquo;  And then there is the proviso, which says that &ldquo;nothing in this <Col N="1408" /> Constitution shall impair the right of any person to petition His Majesty for special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council, or the right of His Majesty to grant such leave.&rdquo; Taken together, it seems to me these two sentences provide that no decision of His Majesty in Council shall constitute a precedent for the Supreme Court.  If the Supreme Court decides a thing, and if appeals are really carried to His Majesty in Council, and if His Majesty in Council reverses the decision of the Supreme Court, that is an act between His Majesty and the individual applying.  It does not bind the Supreme Court for the future; it does not give any sort of twist to the law as passed by the Oireachtas. That seems to me to be the virtue of setting down specifically &ldquo;that the decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive, and shall not be reviewed or capable of being reviewed by any other Court, Tribunal, or Authority whatsoever,&rdquo; in spite of the fact that there is a proviso that in certain cases there shall be special appeal to His Majesty in Council.  In all these cases we have to be concerned with realities.  If His Majesty in Council were to give a decision that the Irish people thought to be unjust, or that was generally believed here to be unjust, that decision would be a dead letter absolutely, and we all know it.</P>

I dispute the statement made just now that we are not independent. We are independent.  This particular clause with reference to the Privy Council refers to some safeguard <Col N="1409" /> with respect to other members of that association into which we have entered by reason of the Treaty.  To that extent only is there any cause for this insertion of an appeal to His Majesty in Council to come before the Privy Council.  As such we get exactly the same terms as the other nations forming the same Commonwealth. In other words, we have entered into a bargain, we have accepted the advantages of the bargain, and we must be prepared to grant to others the advantages we derive ourselves.  To that extent, I think, there is nothing objectionable in that clause, and that most of the criticism alleged against it is criticism that is slightly prejudiced by reason of our experience of the Privy Council here.</P>

      <P>In view of the defeat of the previous amendment, it is possible that my position, in moving this, is made a little more difficult. But I suggest to the Ministry, and to the Dáil, that whereas if the previous amendment had been carried, it might, indeed, rightly or wrongly, have prejudiced the Treaty, I do not think that this other form of words would prejudice the Treaty, for the reason that this proposal, as it is put forward here, in the words of my amendment, is actually the proposal put forward in the name of the majority of the other co-equal members of the Community of Nations, and in respect of which England herself, when the proposal came up, and was fully discussed in 1917, stated she would undertake this matter and raise it again.  It may never be raised again.  It is exceedingly likely that these matters may be postponed to a very indefinite date, but whether it is raised, again or not, if it is put in this form of words that I suggest, the position of Ireland is not prejudiced.  I wish to state here that the words as they appear in this proviso, as it appears in the Constitution, are not as satisfactory to this country as they should be, because the Canadian practice is infinitely worse than the South African practice.  I do not want to go into any part of it now that may affect the whole of the issue very deeply.  But the form of words, as is adopted. possibly may extend more widely than some of us imagine at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just put forward this amendment now, and let it take its chance.  The Minister for Home Affairs remarked that such appeals would not occur in questions of ordinary domestic routine or domestic legislature, but would incur in the larger issues of the international sort.  I venture to suggest to him, that <Col N="1412" /> if it did occur in small issues of the routine domestic kind, the appeal would be a great deal less bad than when it occurs on issues of a constitutional kind. It is a constitutional appeal that is the chief thing, not the domestic appeal. There are certain rights that have been written into this Constitution as being the fundamental rights of the people of Ireland.  These rights might be questioned. The particular article of the Constitution may be challenged; if they be challenged, it is possible that the challenge may ultimately be carried to the Privy Council, and if that is true, whatever the judgment of the Privy Council may be, it will not become &ldquo; case law.&rdquo;  And although these cases may be infringements, as Professor Keith informs us, this whole process of appeal is obsolescent&mdash;nevertheless, any appeal from the provisions of the Constitution is far more injurious to the country than any appeal that could occur in what has been referred to as ordinary routine domestic legislation.  With regard to the alternative appeal, the alternative Court of Appeal, which I have embodied in the amendment, and which I am putting before the Dáil now&mdash;I would like to say that it was proposed initially by the Premier of the Australian Commonwealth. And when that matter was under discussion the various members there at that Conference delivered certain opinions with regard to this Privy Council appeal, that I think it should be just as well should be known. Mr. Hughes stated himself that the Australian experience of the Privy Council in Constitutional cases has been, to say the least of it, unfortunate.  He also quoted a case from New Zealand, and read an extract from a resolution of the Final Court of Appeal of New Zealand, which declared of the Judicial Committee that &ldquo; by its imputations in the present case, by the ignorance it has shown in this and other cases of our history, of our legislation, and of our practice, and by its long-delayed judgments, it has displayed every characteristic of an alien tribunal.&rdquo;  The statesmen of the other States present were equally emphatic.  Sir Robert Borden said: &ldquo;We have had just about enough of Appeal Courts, and I think the tendency in our country will be to restrict appeals to the Privy Council rather than to increase them.&rdquo;  Our own case has been stated and rightly stated, according <Col N="1413" /> to the South African model.  And this is what Mr. Burton stated with respect to South Africa: &ldquo;In our Constitution we have abolished the right of appeal to the Privy Council as a right.  There is no such right with us at all, but the Constitution merely says that any right residing in the King in Council to grant leave to appeal shall not be interfered with.&rdquo;  In view of the fact that when these statements were made, and in response to these statements a very lengthy discussion did occur in that body, which was largely a Parliament of the Commonwealth, it was said that a more satisfactory method would be to move for a Common Court of Appeal for the members of the Commonwealth.  And when that was set up, that it should be composed of certain members, one half of whom in each case would consist of judges from the country whose case was being heard, and that when every case was being heard the English judges should be in a certain minority.  If that were put forward in that form, and represented in that form, I believe that it would stand a very good chance of being accepted across the water.  Still, the former wording, as it is here in the Constitution, gives us another line of escape, with which I will not deal at the moment. I merely state that this is the alternative that should be considered.</P>

      <P>If there is one amendment more than another that deserves the epithet of mischievous, it is the amendment now before you.  Deputy Darrell Figgis comes here and proposes, that instead of a sham appeal in the Constitution, we should have a real appeal in the Constitution, as if forsooth, we in Ireland are not competent to settle our own matters, we are to have a real appeal. We don't want any appeal; I support the amendment put forward from the Labour Benches, because I think this clause about the Privy Council Appeal is insulting to us.  The reason I did not trouble about this is that I am satisfied that for other reasons than those given by the Minister, and for legal reasons, the thing will be a dead letter.  And the popular view, the very popular view, of this Privy Council business as the worst thing in the Constitution is founded upon a misconception. But here we have Deputy Darrell Figgis&mdash;knowing very well that <Col N="1414" /> this appeal is a humbug from beginning to end, no one knows it better, and that there will never be an appeal from the Privy Council&mdash;coming along and proposing a real appeal.

      <P>As is not unusual in these debates, two things wholly different are confounded, as if they were only one.  There is the possibility of two types of appeal&mdash;an appeal from the judge on a point of law, in fact an individual appeal, and a second type very different on some decision which brings us into collision with some of the other components of the Union.  They are two wholly different things, and the position of the whole Imperial Council reviewed in the amendment of Deputy Darrell Figgis regards one of them.  There has been a very extraordinary change made in the Canadian Constitution by the decision of the famous Lord Watson&mdash;Lord Watson described as <i>the</i> Privy Council Judge. In one of those appeals to which I refer, he changed the whole tenor and character, and altered the complexion of the original Constitution with regard to the relations between the provincial legislatures and the federal legislature, and that is always possible for a strong man in the Privy Council.  It is quite true that lawyers of eminence representing various Dominions may be, from time to time, introduced into it.  That leaves the effect as it was.  So long as there is an appeal of any sort&mdash;there may be an ambiguous one of some kind&mdash;Ireland is not independent.  There is no use our going over the ground again that was gone over by Grattan. It is the same thing that is at issue&mdash; the independence of Ireland.  I will not occupy the time of the House arguing it, because I know what the result in fact will be.</P>

      <P>Owing to the speech of the Leader of the Left Wing, it might be as well to deal briefly with this Amendment.  It proposes an appeal to a Tribunal which the proposer of it says may never come into existence. In fact he feels very confident, in his own mind, it never will; and this is to be substituted for the proviso in <Col N="1415" /> Article 65.  It is simply another example of that kind of elaborate trifling that we are getting rather inured to.  There is no use after having accepted the Treaty, which says that the relation of the Crown to Canada shall be the same as that governing its relation to the Irish Free State, yet here we have, day after day, amendments proposed that the relation of the Crown shall be otherwise.  We do not like this Appeal.  We tried not to have this Appeal, but we attempt to show here its exact proportion to the whole matter, and it is not worth the time spent discussing it here in view of the existing conditions.  Deputy Figgis's amendment proposes a common Court of Appeal for the several Dominions.  That is a matter on which he ought, perhaps, to consult some authentic representative of the Dominions.  Many leading men in the Dominions to-day have no love for a common Court of Appeal.  And, in the meantime, there is a crux that there was all through when we were negotiating this Constitution&mdash;the crux that you cannot absolutely sheer off and throw upon one side what is definitely claimed as the prerogative of the Crown. We have been treated in this particular manner more generously than upon the strict interpretation of the Treaty we were entitled to be treated.  We have a better position as regards this appelate jurisdiction than Canada.</P>

      <P>Just one word.  The Minister for Local Government used it as an argument against me, that we must abide by the Treaty which gives us the law, practice and constitutional usage of Canada; and the argument of the Minister for Home Affairs is, that we are not getting the same thing as Canada, but that we are getting something better than that in the Constitution of South Africa.  On which side lies the trifling?  I must say from the beginning here I have spoken with the fullest sense of my responsibility, and I wish that the same could be said with regard to some of the criticisms made by other speakers.  &ldquo;The law, practice, and constitutional usage of Canada,&rdquo; as Deputy Gavan Duffy himself has repeatedly instanced, must be taken through all the clauses in a synthetic sense, and must have a synthetic force.  You are not to take the law of Canada by itself, but the law, practice and constitutional usage.  And we are well aware that there <Col N="1416" /> is a sense of injury, and a very acute sense of injury, among Canadian statesmen in regard to this retention of the appeal, and therefore it is no harm while we are framing a Constitution now to try and keep it in accordance with the Treaty.  It is the Treaty position, the same position, namely, as that decidedly assented to in Downing Street&mdash;the position recently arrived at for Canada.  I see no trifling in this whatever, except it be that any effort to do something in the interests of Ireland is trifling because it is bound to be trodden down by a brute majority.</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis has touched upon the real essence of this amendment.  It is very easy to pour ridicule on this amendment by misunderstanding it.  It would be very much more to the point if those who assailed the amendment were to read the whole of the discussion upon which it is based, and if that had been done it would be easy to see, having joined the Commonwealth or Community of Nations, the kind of cases that may be the subject of appeal.  One class is cases which are internal, that affect the individual citizens of the State; and another kind of case is that which affects the relationship between one State and another. With regard to the first, under the provisions which we suggest it is proposed that no appeal should come up on an internal matter; but where there is some point of issue between one State and another there was a clear case for the existence of the Court of Appeal for that kind of case, and it was that kind of case I was dealing with here, and any criticisms based upon the first kind of case and brought into the second kind of case are purely relevant, and no one knows that better than the person who made them.</P>

      <P>I want to point out first of all to Ministers, as a matter for consideration, that here you speak of remuneration and pension as being two distinct things.  I think one should be very careful to use the same phraseology. In some other clauses the expression used is remuneration, and it is intended in those other clauses to cover both salary and pension.  We ought to get this right, I think, on the next reading. I move as an amendment to delete &ldquo; and all other Courts established in pursuance of this Constitution by the representative of the Crown.&rdquo;  I am assuming for the sake of argument that we shall be told that superior judges must be appointed by the representative of the Crown, and that otherwise we should lose the Treaty.  Be that so.  I hope the Ministers will have no difficulty in accepting the amendment, for one or two very good reasons.  First of all there is Dominion precedent for it; secondly, it would be extremely inconvenient&mdash;to put it on no higher grounds&mdash;to have every little justice in the country, every parish Justice, if we have such a thing <Col N="1418" /> under the new dispensation, or every Petty Sessions Justice, appointed by the representative of the Crown. If Ministers will reflect they are up against this difficulty:&mdash;There will be no Courts-martial for trying military prisoners unless they are established under this Constitution.  Therefore, this Article states: &ldquo;Every officer who is a judge at a Court-martial must be so appointed by the representative of the Crown.&rdquo;  Now, I acquit Ministers of prescribing any such thing, but that is what they inadvertently prescribe&mdash;that every Court-martial officer will have to be appointed by the representative of the Crown.  If the House will refer to Article 100 of the South African Constitution they will find a very good precedent for confining this matter of royal appointment to only the higher Judges.  Article 100 of the South African Constitution says: &ldquo;The Chief Justice of South Africa, the ordinary Judges of Appeal, and all other Judges of the Supreme Court of South Africa to be appointed after the establishment of the Union, shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council.&rdquo;  There is nothing about the lower Judges anywhere.  I think for the reasons I have indicated, and as you have the South African precedent to go upon, that the Ministry should accept, either now or, if they want time to consider it, at the next reading, this very necessary amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Clause as it stands is &ldquo; No one shall be tried save in due course of law and extraordinary Courts shall not be established.&rdquo;  I take it that refers to a time of peace, and not a time of war, inasmuch as special provision is made for a time of war lower down.  There is no such term as &ldquo;extraordinary court &rdquo; known in British law.  It is a phrase that has been borrowed from the new Austrian Constitution. I presume the reference is to courts of the type set up under what was popularly called the Crimes Act. That is, the Act of 1887.  The extension through martial law to military tribunals of the power to deal with civilian citizens is the setting up of &ldquo; extraordinary Courts,&rdquo; and if you declare in the first sentence of the Article that &ldquo;extraordinary Courts&rdquo; shall not be established <Col N="1421" /> it is sheer contradiction to declare in the next sentence &ldquo;the jurisdiction of Courts Martial shall not be extended through or exercised over the civil population unless in time of war.&rdquo;  There is a great deal of confusion here.  The public do not seem to be aware of the distinction between military law and martial law. The amendment which, I understand, the Ministry is about to accept says, &ldquo;save only such military tribunals as may be authorised by law for dealing with military offenders against military law.&rdquo; There is the celebrated judgment of Chief Justice Mansfield delivered in 1802, and repeated quite recently by Lord Chief Baron Palles pointing out that a soldier is still clothed with all his character, his responsibility and rights as a citizen, but has superimposed on him others which arise out of the capacity of being a soldier, and the military law applies to the soldier as a soldier everywhere, always, in time of peace, in time of war, abroad, and at home.  That is one of the fundamental things with regard to military law.  Now, a military tribunal dealing with a soldier for a military offence against the military code is not an &ldquo;extraordinary Court,&rdquo; and Deputy Gavan Duffy ought to know that, being a lawyer of practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me, it is a court set up under the statute law of England.  This is one of the most elementary things in law, that the military code has, in recent years, by gradual development, become a Military Act.  Almost all the regulations to which a soldier is subject as a soldier are under the Army Act.  That of itself has no authority, and carries with it no force only each year the Army Annual Act is passed, and on the occasion of that various alterations may be and have been introduced.  But it is a Court under the ordinary law of England.  It is applicable to soldiers; it is an ordinary and not an &ldquo;extraordinary Court.&rdquo;  Everyone here knows that at various times, when Kings tried to be tyrants, and when invasions of the Constitution were attempted they took the form of extending military law to civilians.  And it has always been declared illegal to apply military law to civilians.  Martial law is understood in the original draft here.  The original <Col N="1422" /> draftsman is a better authority on the status, I think, than the acceptor of the amendment.  Martial Law applies here to a very special situation, namely, where there is suspension of the ordinary statute law and the whole country, or part of the country, has to be put under military control.  In that case you do not require a statute of the legislature, and it is the setting up of an &ldquo;extraordinary court,&rdquo; it is the extension of the jurisdiction which will otherwise be wholly illegal and altogether at variance with the rights and liberties of the civilian subject.  I would ask the Minister to be very cautious before he tampers with the words of this, as on a previous occasion, when tampering with another Article, by which he swept away a number of recently made statutes. &ldquo; No one shall be tried save in due course of law and extraordinary courts shall not be established.  The jurisdiction of Courts Martial shall not be extended to or exercised over the civil population save in time of war.&rdquo;  That is the very doctrine we had before in an earlier debate on another subject altogether, where I contended we were taking over a going concern.  That was disputed.  At the present moment during the transition period we are working under the British Constitution, and the whole British code of law.  These have not been set aside.  According to this draft what is being made use of is the common law right, that is in the Crown and in the officers that it appoints to discharge this work for it, the common law right to repel force by force and take such measures as are necessary to quell insurrection or riot.  I would ask the Minister to be very careful before introducing into the Constitution in the way of amendments something that would take away by the Constitution that common law right.  Apart altogether from Constitutions and legal enactments every organised community has in it, as every person has in him, the inherent right of self-preservation and protection against force or force imminent.  Every organised community, especially so with regard to the system we are carrying on at present, has the common law right, not merely to repel force by force when force is actually offered, but in the expectation of it where it is obviously imminent to take such measures as are necessary <Col N="1423" /> to repel it.  Whoever drafted this Article had all that in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has nearly made me breathless with some of the most extraordinary statements I have ever heard in this Dáil.  I have no great object in traversing them, except in so far as they deal with the amendment which the Ministry has expressed itself willing to accept.  That amendment is directed to providing military tribunals for military men guilty of military offences.  It must be remembered that the soldier is a citizen as well as a soldier, and, consequently, you have in the British Army Act, which, as an Army Act, is an excellent one, you have the express provision made whereby any soldier who commits any civil offence may be tried before a civil court, except, I think, in time of active service.  It goes further than that.  Certain offences&mdash;treason, treason-felony, manslaughter, murder, and one or two other offences committed by soldiers not on active service, must be tried by a civil court.  These regulations, and the existence of these Courts Martial, are the creatures of statute.  The Deputy thinks we have them under the common law of Ireland.  I respectfully differ from him.  What is essential is to provide here some clear jurisdiction which, while allowing these extraordinary courts, which we call Courts Martial, to exist in the case of a soldier on active service, yet in the case of a soldier not on active service will preserve that soldier's rights as citizen in respect of civil offences. That is why I am glad the Ministry expressed themselves disposed to accept the amendment.  I think Deputy Magennis's remarks were calculated to give a wrong impression as to the state of affairs and the object of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word or two to correct a wrong impression that may have been created by Deputy Duffy in purporting to give a refutation of what I said&mdash;that a soldier is a citizen all the time he is a soldier. Why, I began with the judgement of Lord Mansfield in 1802, and I referred to the words of the late Chief Baron in one of the last judgements he delivered when he explained that a citizen by becoming a soldier takes all the additional responsibility and is thereby subject to <Col N="1424" /> Military Law.  I also said&mdash;and to repeat what I said is not a refutation of what I said&mdash;that the Military Law to which soldiers are subject as soldiers is, since recent years, an enactment by Statute under a Law passed from year to year, whereas Martial Law in the proper, strict, technical sense, the sense in which Martial Law ought to be understood, is a suspension of the Civil Code in times of stress and danger in virture of the power exercised by virtue of the Common Law.  I have not said&mdash;or, if I have said it, I have spoken contrary to what I thought that I was saying, and I claim that that is not likely to happen&mdash;that Martial Law is Military Law.  I tried to impress on the Dáil that they are two absolutely different things.  That what is called Court Martial is military tribunal dealing at Military Law to military offences and military offenders, and what is called the Proclamation of Martial Law, what we have been quite familiar with in recent years in Ireland, is a declaration that the State or Crown is about, for the protection of the community, to suspend the ordinary law and set up this extraordinary thing.  It is quite possible to extend the jurisdiction, and it has been in some cases necessary.  Now, on the Third Reading, I propose, with the permission of the Dáil, to bring down, for the consideration of Deputy Duffy, legal authorities, and to read him cases and judgements, and I am quite confident of being able to persuade him that they are two different things.</P>

      <P>I think it is a dangerous amendment as it stands.  I should have no objection to it if it was confined to soldiers on active service, but I have every objection to taking away a soldier's rights as a citizen in peace times.  I suggest to the proposer to postpone this amendment to the next Reading, as it more or less touches on my amendment, so that the two might go together.  I feel a great objection to inserting in the Constitution something that will take away the soldier's civil right unless that be confined to times of active service.

      <P>I think it is rather a sweeping description of the force of the amendment to say that it involves loss of civic rights.  &ldquo;A member of the armed forces of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann not on active <Col N="1426" /> service shall not be tried by any Court Martial for an offence cognisable by the Civil Court unless such offence shall have been brought expressly within the jurisdiction of Courts Martial by any code of laws or regulations for the enforcement of military discipline which may be hereafter approved by the Parliament.&rdquo; I do not consider that any case has been established against that amendment.  Soldiers not on active service may be guilty of breaches of discipline&mdash;may be guilty possibly, and not impossibly, of assault and offences of that kind, that are cognisable by the Civil Courts, and yet it might be considered eminently desirable from the point of view of army discipline that they should be tried by Court Martial. I think without the amendment the Article would make it impossible so to try them, save on active service.  The amendment merely provides that Parliament may approve that certain specified offences can be tried by Courts Martial.  To that extent, and only to that extent, would there be the loss of civil rights that Deputy Magennis speaks about.  But it would not be true to say that men would be deterred from joining the Army because of this amendment, or because, as suggested, they are brought under an additional code of laws, and suffer a complete loss of civil rights.</P>

      <P>The Ministry show that, in dealing with these Articles, they are in some confusion. First of all because there is not any proper code of laws which we are administering in regard to this matter. That code has still to be set up. Secondly, because the Constitution, as drawn, does not provide for establishing Courts Martial at all, and that is why I think, believing as I do that Courts Martial ought to be restricted to the smallest possible number of people, that it would be wise for the Ministry to recast these two or three clauses altogether, instead of agreeing to recast one of them, and passing an amendment to the next one.  The whole thing is a matter of a code that you want to summarise here, and I think it a mistake to say, in respect of 69, &ldquo;We have a good amendment which we will probably accept,&rdquo; and of 70 to suggest an amendment now.  Would it not be wiser to leave the whole matter over until the Ministry have an opportunity of going into this whole matter?</P>

So far as this amendment is concerned I think that, seeing that it leaves the matter over to the future discretion of Parliament, by whom it will be decided, no harm will be done in passing it, inasmuch as anything that opens liberty to future Parliaments will be all for the good.  It could be left for the Parliament to decide one way or another, and could be decided <Col N="1428" /> with the mature wisdom and consideration such as will then be given to it But in accepting the two amendments to Article 69, it was decided to substitute the words &ldquo;Military Tribunals&rdquo; for &ldquo;Courts Martial.&rdquo;  If the words &ldquo;Military Tribunal&rdquo; are to appear instead of &ldquo;Courts Martial&rdquo; in 69, then in 70, to have one in conformity with the other, you would still have to get that substitution.  I think the best way would be to adhere to the words &ldquo;Courts Martial&rdquo; in 69 and 70.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister sees the necessity for providing for Courts Martial by law, which is omitted from the Draft Constitution, but there is a very curious thing in the wording of this amendment.  If Deputies look at the amendment they will see that it prohibits trial without a jury except in two cases&mdash;(1) offences triable <Col N="1429" /> by law before a Court of summary jurisdiction, and (2) offences against Military Law, triable by Court Martial.  There is a distinction made there between offences triable <i>by law</i> in a Court of Summary jurisdiction and offences triable by Court Martial.  I think that wording wants toning up to make it quite clear you are not dealing with some emergency legislation, but the permanent legislation of the country.  I do not know whether it is intentional or not, but the wording seems to suggest a subtle distinction between the cases where you allow no jury for summary jurisdiction and the exceptional cases which seem to be indicated where you would allow trial without jury by Court Martial.</P>

      <P>At the request of Deputy O'Shannon I beg to move the following Amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To insert, after Article 71, new Article 72:&mdash;`The liberty of the Press and of the expression of ideas and opinions in writing, print, pictorial representation and sculpture is inviolable, and shall be guaranteed.  The Press shall not be subject to any censorship, political or military, and shall not be subsidised out of the <Col N="1430" /> national funds or by the Government No law or court or other authority shall have the right to penalise any person engaged in the act of expressing or publishing ideas or opinions in the manner herein stated, except such person shall have violated the criminal laws respecting private life or public morality.  Under no circumstances shall a printing press or plant be sequestrated as the <i>corpus delicti.</i>  No offence under this Article shall be tried under any court except the ordinary civil courts.  The courts shall not have power to determine responsibility except in cases previously prescribed by law.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one Article in the earlier part of the Constitution which may be said to ensure the right to free expression of opinion, but that is so very wide a liberty it seems necessary to ensure there should be some liberty of the Press and for the general expression of ideas in writing, print and pictorial representation. This is a right guaranteed under the Constitutions of most countries and is a very necessary right, and I hope it will be accepted in this form or some other amended form.  I am not responsible for the language of this Amendment, but I see no objection to it of any kind.  Certainly the idea that is expressed here has my strongest support.  There is, of course, under every Government, a danger that the Press will be suppressed if it attempts to oppose the views of the Government in times of crisis, especially when the Government is weakest; then the Government tries to be strongest by suppressing the opposition.  I think that ten years ago everybody in this country who has been interested in the generation of ideas that have led to the establishment of this Dáil, would have been enthusiastically in favour of such a provision, and, having achieved that object&mdash;the establishment of a new Parliament&mdash;we ought to inscribe on the Constitution the liberty which we demanded when we were striving for this liberty.  I beg to move this Amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. ERNEST BLYTHE Mr. ERNEST BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ERNEST BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that all that it is necessary to say about this matter has already been said in connection with Article 9, where it says &ldquo;the right of free expression of opinion, <Col N="1431" /> etc., &rdquo; is &ldquo;guaranteed for purposes not opposed to public morality.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be quite as much as is necessary in the Constitution.  This Amendment is more wordy, but for the most part it does not say more.  It says: &ldquo;The liberty of the Press and of the expression of ideas and opinions in writing, print, pictorial representation, and sculpture is invioable and shall be guaranteed.&rdquo;  I do not see any advantage in putting that in, in addition to where it states that &ldquo;the right of free expression of opinion is guaranteed for purposes not opposed to public morality.&rdquo; Then coming to the next paragraph: &ldquo;The Press shall not be subject to any censorship, political or military, and shall not be subsidised out of the National funds or by the Government,&rdquo; of course in normal times everybody will agree the Press should not be subject to any censorship.  On the other hand, whatever one might think, even in recent times, about the censorship on expression of opinion, everybody will agree that a censorship excluding information in regard to military movements from the Press was justifiable and necessary.  Consequently a sweeping amendment of this nature should not be accepted.  The next paragraph is implied in the guarantee to a right of expression of opinion.  Then the suggestion is that the printing press or plant should not be sequestrated.  There is no reason for attaching any special sanctity to a printing press or plant, and in time of war there might be every reason for trying an offence under this Article in Courts other than the ordinary Civil Courts.  In general, the proposed amendment is one that is very wordy, and it does not contain much that is new.  What it does contain new, is not of a nature that could be accepted. When we are devising a Constitution, we have to think more than of what would merely suit ourselves, or the propaganda we are carrying on.  Some years ago we might have liked an Article such as this, but in desiring such an Article, we would not be thinking of framing a Constitution for the Irish Nation.  We would merely have been thinking of something which would be a convenience and a protection to us individually. We would have been looking at it, purely, from an individual <Col N="1432" /> point of view, and those of us who might have looked beyond the individual point of view, and at what would serve our own party best, might not have desired particularly the abolition of all censorship, because censorship, wrongly exercised, hits the person using it, rather than those whom it is used against.  It is not a matter that really needs debating at great length.  We are all aware of the limitations of use that can be made of the censorship.  Most of us will be agreed that there are times when censorship will serve a definite public purpose, be an advantage to the State and the Commonwealth, and that the possibility of establishing the censorship should not be taken away.  That question of the censorship is, perhaps, not dealt with in Article 9 of the draft that has been adopted, and which only talks of the free expression of opinion, whereas the censorship should only deal, and naturally would deal, mostly with matters of information rather than of matters of opinion.  The Amendment is one that I would ask the Dáil not to accept.</P>

      <P>As requested by Mr. Cathal O'Shannon, I also move this new amendment to the Article:&mdash;&ldquo;The secrecy of correspondence and communication by post, telegraph, telephone, or other common means is guaranteed and is inviolable.  The law shall determine who are the agents responsible for any violation of the right and secrecy of correspondence and communication.  The Courts shall not have power to determine responsibility except in cases previously prescribed by law.&rdquo;  This, at least, is a right that should be assured to citizens, and has not, so far as I can gather, been included in any Clause so far considered. It is very important that the post, particularly, should not be allowed to be tampered with, by officials, or by the Government, or any authority acting under the Government.  I think this ought to commend itself to the House, and I do not imagine there is any need for further argument in the matter. Every citizen wants to communicate with his friends, and surely he has a right to the knowledge that, in using the public postal service, no person, <Col N="1433" /> representing the Government, has a right to open that correspondence and read it. I beg to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>We should be careful against falling into the error that, because certain measures were taken against ourselves, in the past, consequently that particular precaution, for the preservation of the State and for the preservation of public morality, should be entirely abandoned.  It is a rather natural line of argument to take, and Deputy Johnson took it, of course, quite readily.  It was the obvious course. But if we are to be frightened off certain courses, because these courses were taken by the British in the past, when they had the responsibility of government of the country, then we will have to abandon very many useful precautions, and very many useful weapons for the preservation of the State.  If this proposed new Article were accepted, it would prevent measures to check very grave abuses that exist here, as in practically every modern country.  It would exhaust measures to check betting and lottery correspondence, and, what is still more serious, it would prevent measures to check the spread of indecent and immoral circulars and advertisements, and in most countries these are now growing to be serious menaces.  Most of the Deputies are probably aware of the kind of material I refer to.  Advertisements, encouraging the limitation of childbirth and advertising all kinds of immorality, and all kinds of indecent devices are sent through the post; and if the State does not keep to itself the right of opening correspondence in cases where it thinks fit to do so, there will be really no means of coping with that particular vice and that particular danger to society and to the country in general.</P>

If, on the passing of the Constitution the existing laws were to lapse we would find ourselves in rather a bad way, pending the enactment&mdash;pending the setting up of the first Parliament of the Saorstát. This provides for the continuance in force of the existing laws until they are either repealed or amended by an enactment of the new Parliament.</P>

The date fixed is to allow us to continue until the end of the present financial year.  If it were necessary, for instance, at the present moment to end the arrangement in regard to the Customs, we would not have a Customs organised to carry out the collection of the Customs duties here. Goods coming in from England have not paid their Customs dues heretofore or up to the coming into force of the Provisional Government.  It would be necessary to continue the present arrangements, and the present arrangements are: that Customs duties on goods imported into the British Islands are collected in Great Britain, and when they are exported from Great Britain to this country that the matter is arranged by book-keeping adjustments.</P>

It is:&mdash;&ldquo;Until Courts have been established for the Irish Free State/ Saorstát Eireann in accordance with this Constitution, the Supreme Court of Judicature, County Courts, Courts of Quarter Sessions and Courts of Summary Jurisdiction, as at present existing, shall for the time being continue to exercise the same jurisdiction as heretofore, and any judge or justice, being a member of any such Court, holding office at the time when this Constitution comes into operation, shall for the time being continue to be a member thereof and hold office by the like tenure and upon the like terms as heretofore, unless, in the case of a judge of the said Supreme Court or of a County Court, he signifies to the Representative of the Crown his desire to resign.

I agree that there should be unification, but I think we are entitled to expect that there should be, in the Constitution, an equivalent provision to the Judges of the Courts which we established ourselves.  Because this motion can only mean that we are not prepared to say that these Courts are legal and proper Courts.  I think something should go in there to put those Courts on the same footing as this Article puts the English law courts on.</P>

      <P>At first sight there would seem to be something in that. But, on looking into it, and seeing that this Constitution is to be confirmed or registered or ratified in the British Parliament, and has to pass from the British Parliament as an Act, or embodied in an Act, the explanation is obvious.  The <Col N="1437" /> British did not recognise the Dáil as such, and from the very nature of their position, they did not, and could not, recognise the existence of those particular Courts, which were the creatures of the Dáil.  That was all along the position.  I think the Deputy himself knows that that position was taken up and maintained by them throughout the Treaty negotiations.  The same was taken up and maintained by them throughout the negotiations with regard to this Constitution.  We should ask ourselves, whether there is definite need to insert a provision dealing with these particular Courts, and whether it is really worth the difficulty that it would create to do it.</P>

It provides that with regard to the judges of the existing Judicial System, that if any such judge is not, with his own consent, appointed to be a judge of the new Court, that by the Judicial Committee set up or recommended to be set up, he shall be treated as if he had retired, as provided for under Article 10 of the Treaty, in consequence of the change of Government.  &ldquo;With his consent&rdquo; there means, that we could not, for economy sake, or for any other reason, appoint one of the existing judges to the new Courts and compel him to carry on in that way; if we appoint him, it must be with his consent.  But if we do not wish to appoint him, or while we wish to appoint him, he does not wish to act in that capacity, then he is entitled under Article 10 of the Treaty and to the proviso that &ldquo;this shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims he may have against the British Government,&rdquo; which means that it is perhaps possible for these judges to take the view that their office continues, even though their Courts go, and that is a matter they must thrash out with the British Government, and it is no concern of ours. As far as we are concerned, their rights are those set out in Article 10 of the Treaty, and if they consider they have further rights, these will lie against the British Government.</P>

      <P>I think these judges along with all other Civil Servants get, under Article 10 of the Treaty, the option to resign, and if they did, they get a number of years added to their service, which makes it worth their while to resign.  Now these judges continued on, and we come to a time when it is beyond that, and we are seeking to put into an Article here a proviso which enables them to stay and single themselves out for some advantage by addition to their years of service, which, I think, is not right.  I suggest that the words &ldquo;resigns as aforesaid, or if any such judge&rdquo; should be taken out of the clause.  I think, if these words were taken out, the clause would be more sensible than it is, and would comply more with the intention of those who, at the time, arranged the matters in the Treaty. I think the Government might agree to take these words out, and I suggest that they should undertake to take the matter up, and that would meet the thing, and leave this clause right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy McGoldríck is under some slight misapprehension.  The Article here deals with cases which might arise because of the earlier Article.  In Section 4 of the Judiciary there is much said about the Courts of first instance, and the High Courts of Judicature, but there is nothing whatever said as regards County Court judges, or if there is an equivalent office &mdash;which is quite conceivable&mdash;I am not in the secrets of the Ministry, it is quite unnecessary for me to explain&mdash;but it is quite possible, in the new Judicial System, there may be courts of a higher or more extended jurisdiction than is at present enjoyed by the County Courts, or there may be inferior courts, or local courts not up to the level of the County Courts as at present existing.  As I read the original Article, once the Constitution of the Free State has been enacted, these judges may be offered positions of a judicial character, and the condition is that they should consent to accept these. In other words, &ldquo;shall regard it as an equivalent office, and be satisfied with it as an equivalent office.&rdquo;  Now, it is left by the wording of the Article to the option of the judge who wishes for an equivalent office to decline it.  If he so declines, by the operation of the Article, he is deemed to have retired. <Col N="1440" /> You will observe that in reality that would be a very polite thing, in polite fiction, because he will have been discharged by his own act of regarding the new system of Courts as not in consonance with his ideas of what he would like.  I would like to ask the Minister, is there any difference, as regards the monetary position, between an official who is discharged and an official who retires, because the Judge in this case, that I contemplate, is deemed to have retired.  He resigns by not accepting the post offered to him, whereas if he had been expressly discharged he comes under another Clause.  It is a mistake to say that the Judge can make his election now.  As I read the Free State Agreement Act, the time for these things has not come.  It is only when the Constitution is enacted that these elections are to be made.  Consequently, this provision Clause is taking measures to prevent any sort of a deadlock or hitch that might arise.  The only thing that I forget for the moment is what exactly would be the different position if the Judge were declared discharged.  I have a recollection that in the earlier arrangements for the retirement of officials there was a special bounty given to those who lost office through, as it was technically called, the abolition of office. That is when the new arrangements were made, so that when an official was no longer required his office was declared to be abolished, and he was at liberty to add a certain number of years' service and get compensation.</P>

      <P>There is one question that I desire to ask the Minister before the Article is put.  It is whether the judges who have acted in the Irish Courts since 1917 will now have an opportunity of becoming judges under the Free State Parliament?  Do I understand that those judges who have acted in the English Courts, if they so wish <Col N="1441" /> to resign, will have the privilege of putting forward a man to act in their place?  If that is so, I would not at all agree with it.  I think we must give some little privilege to the men who have taken risks since 1917, in the Irish Courts.  I think it would be only right, and I would like to know whether it is possible that those men will get an opportunity, provided they are qualified, of acting as judges under the Free State Parliament?</P>

      <P>I do not know how the Deputy managed to read all that into Article 74.  Under the new system of Justice that will be hammered out those men would not automatically become judges, but it is provided if we particularly wanted to appoint one of those judges to the new system, that his consent would be necessary.  I think there is nothing there to the effect that they must be appointed and there is nothing in that Article which gives an eligible person&mdash;that is, I suppose, any Barrister&mdash;any claim or privilege before any other eligible person.</P>

      <P>What I wish to bring before the attention of the Dáil is the <Col N="1442" /> position of publicans' licences at the moment in Ireland.  Perhaps the President, or some Member of the Government, would be able to give me the information I desire.  What I want to know is, what position are the publicans in at the present time, as regards the renewal of their licences?  There seems to be considerable doubt in the minds of some people as to the position of these men at the present time, and I think it would be well if the Government would give some assurance or state what their policy is on the question.  I know in some districts certain fees have been collected by Petty Session Clerks and certain other matters have been done which a considerable number of people think there is no authority for doing.  I have raised the matter so that those men may know exactly where they are, as regards their licences for the coming year.  It would be well if we had some statement of policy from the Government in the matter.  I do not wish to labour the point in any way, but I would be glad if the Government could give the House some information on the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to licences has been, we are aware, causing some anxiety for some time back, and it is well that the matter has been raised.  The position is this: All publicans' licences expire on the 10th day of October in each year and such licences, in accordance with statutory requirements, can only be renewed upon the production to the Inland Revenue Authorities of two Certificates to the good character of the applicant and to the peaceable and orderly manner in which the licensed premises have been conducted in the past year.  One of these certificates must be signed by six householders of the parish and the other by two magistrates sitting at the Annual Licensing Petty Sessions of the district in which the licence holder resides.  In consequence of existing conditions it has been impossible in many cases for holders of publicans' licences to obtain the necessary magistrates' certificate. The Government accordingly propose to make arrangements with the Inland Revenue Authorities whereby, in cases in which the magistrates' certificate has not been obtained, in consequence of Annual Licensing Petty Sessions not <Col N="1443" /> having been held, the necessary renewal of the licence will be issued and the publican authorised to trade on the conditions that the licence holder (1) pays the appropriate Excise Duty, (2) produces to the Inland Revenue Authorities the householders' certificate required by Statute, and (3) undertakes in writing to apply for and obtain the magistrates' certificates at the first available opportunity.  Pending the production of this last-mentioned certificate possession of the licence paper will be retained by the Inland Revenue Authorities. It is intended to make arrangements as soon as possible for the holding of Sessions for the renewal of publicans' licences by the District Magistrates whom the Government are about to appoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister for Home Affairs give us some idea of the terms of the revised Clauses he promised to put before us after Report Stage?  If, for instance, revised Clause 11 were ready, perhaps he would let us have it as soon as possible, as it would certainly affect the amendments I see renewed on the Order Paper for to-morrow in my name.  I did not know that that was to be put forward in its present form at this stage, and it certainly will depend on the new Clauses that have been promised.  In any case, it would require a good deal of alteration in view of the course of the discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is, beyond taking a note of any promise or undertaking made while working through this Reading, we had no time to go into them or get down in Committee to work them out.  It will be necessary for us to do that before the next Reading comes on, and we will circulate through the Dáil the draft Constitution in the form in which we would put it up for consideration.  We would have to get simply a new draft printed with the Articles changed according to the impressions we got while working it through this time.</P>

      <P>There would be, if I may interpose, the delay certainly of a few days, after the Committee <Col N="1444" /> Stage was concluded, before we could have the Report completely ready. We are making up the Report as we go along, but it would require some little time after the last sitting to make up the Report of that particular sitting. We would then have the Report ready for the Fourth Reading, showing the amendments proposed and what happened to them, whether withdrawn, withdrawn on condition, passed or lost, whether a division was taken or not, and so on.  That is the way in which the Third Stage will appear, and in order that further amendments might be proposed for the Fourth Stage.  In consideration of the four days' notice of motion some time will have to elapse. We contemplate finishing the Constitution to-morrow, according to our Orders of the Day for to-morrow, and taking up the Executive Clauses on Thursday, the Clauses that were referred to a Special Committee.  In that case we hope to get finished on Thursday, or at least on Friday.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;At 8.45 this morning (Tuesday) prisoners in Mountjoy, from their cells, attacked the Guards in the Circle, with firearms, killing two (Gaffney and Keaveney), and wounding three.  In return fire one prisoner was killed (Peadar Breslin) and two wounded.</P>
