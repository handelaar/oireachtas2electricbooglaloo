      <P>To ask the Minister for Education if it is proposed to discontinue the Marlborough Training College this year; if so, will he state what provision has been made for the students who would ordinarily be called to this College, and can he say if the effect of such arrangements will be that the students who took first division at the Scholarship Examination may be excluded from Carysfort Training College, while students who applied to Marlborough College, and who took only second Division, have been or will be summoned to training.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether his attention has been called to the following statements in an editorial in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of September 21st, viz.: &ldquo;(1) It appears, however, that a sort of censorship, which we know not whether to describe as military or civil, still exists; (2) The newspapers have been ordered on several occasions during the past fortnight to omit passages from reports which their staffs had prepared in the ordinary way; (3) One of these reports concerned the alleged treatment of Republican prisoners; (4) Another contained the evidence and verdict at an inquest in Dublin&rdquo;; whether there is any truth in the allegations marked (1), (2), (3), (4); if so, by whom, with what authority, and for what purpose were these orders given; and what, in fact, were the statements suppressed?</P>

      <P>Until either to-morrow or this evening, when the Ministers may have answers for them. I regret they are not here.  In one case I know the Minister is working hard; he has been on a long journey and on big inspections; and, in the other case, there has been a bereavement in the family.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I did not hear the observations made by the President.  There is a question standing in my name, and I agreed to have it postponed yesterday.  It is a question of importance with reference to the censorship.  None of us knows whether any military censorship is still in existence, or whether it is not.</P>

      <P>What I said was that the Minister for Defence has been very busily engaged for some days past, and I think he must have overlooked the fact that this question was on, or he may have been engaged on some business, and I rose to excuse his absence.  If the Deputy wishes I will see about getting into communication with the Minister for Defence, and see if he will be here at 5 o'clock this evening; or if you wish. to postpone it until to-morrow.  In the other case, I explained that the Minister for Education was not in to-day.  He was in yesterday.  I believe he was in a position to answer the question yesterday.</P>

      <P>subsequently replied to the question addressed to him as follows: &mdash;It is proposed to discontinue the Teachers' Training College at Marlboro' Street.  The names of the applicants for admission to this College have been placed on the lists for one or other of the Training Colleges as far as possible in accordance with the candidate's own <Col N="716" /> choice, and in order of merit, as if they had originally been candidates for that College.  It will not be an effect of this arrangement that students who were placed in the Second Division at the Easter Examination will be admitted to Carysfort Training College, to the exclusion of those who were placed in First Division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to suggest to the Dáil an amendment standing in my name on Order 9. I am dealing with the question of a count.  The Standing Order as it stand provides that &ldquo;if, at any stage in a sitting of Dáil Eireann, any Teachta calls the attention of the Ceann Comhairle that there are less than twenty Teachtai present, the Ceann Comhairle, should he be satisfied, on a count, that there is not a quorum, shall adjourn the Dáil until the next ordinary sitting.&rdquo;  The amendment I would suggest is that you should put in as an alternative &ldquo;to insert after the word `until' the words `a later hour, to be named by him, or until.&rdquo;'  The object of the amendment is this&mdash;and it may result in the saving of a day on more occasions than one&mdash; we are all very diligent in our attendance now; but these Standing Orders will be in use, and I hope will continue in use for a very long time.  There may come a time when we may not always be so punctual as we have been for the last eight or ten days.  People don't always take so much interest in the questions of other people as to come in here when there is a long list of questions, and listening to Ministers giving answers in which they and their constituents do not take any interest.  It is quite possible some of us seeing a motion laid down in the paper which we may like to burke, might suddenly, in the midst of the question, five or ten minutes after the Dáil had sat move for a count, and if twenty members were not present the whole day may be lost.  The amendment I would suggest may enable the <Col N="719" /> Chairman to adjourn the Dáil, if there are not enough members present&mdash;adjourn the Dáil for an hour, or a half an hour, or some reasonable time on the same day to be named by him, when it will re-assemble, and if there is a proper quorum present business will go on, and the day will be saved.  I don't want to waste time in putting the amendment, but I do suggest that time is a very important thing for all of us, and not only now, but equally important later on in the Dáil.  I venture to suggest that this amendment will receive the approval of the Dáil, and it will do no harm to anyone.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>There is just one point I would like to draw attention to in Order 9:&mdash;&ldquo;If, at any stage in a sitting of Dáil Eireann, any Teachta calls the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to the fact that there are less than twenty Teachtai present.&rdquo;  Is that inclusive of the Ceann Comhairle?  Do you agree to that interpretation</P>
      <P>The Dáil agreed.</P>
      <P>The Clerk then read the Rule as amended:&mdash;&ldquo;If at any stage in a sitting of Dáil Eireann, any Teachta calls the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to the fact that there are less than twenty Teachtai present, inclusive of the Ceann Comhairle, the Ceann Comhairle should he be satisfied on a count that there is not a quorum, shall adjourn the Dáil until a later hour to be named by him, or until the next ordinary sitting.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Dáil before &ldquo;Tuesday&rdquo; we put in &ldquo;Mondays&rdquo; as well.  I do that realising the absence of the change that has been made by the elimination of &ldquo;Monday,&rdquo; for this reason that between now and December 6th, this Dáil will, of necessity, he engaged very considerably on the Constitution, and I think the elimination of Monday would <Col N="720" /> probably bring about a danger of closure being adopted in respect of the Constitution, which I think will be a calamity. Also for another reason; it is frequently the habit that Ministers, either on their own motion or at the request of members, set aside a day for the discussion of a question.  We have to-morrow, for example, set aside by the Minister of Defence, and the following day is set aside for a discussion of matters by the Minister of Home Affairs. This order, as it stands, would mean that, for the discussion of such a matter, one quarter of the time at the disposal of the Dáil would be taken.  It is not easy to say whether it is going to sit three or four hours.  Generally a day is set aside, so that really an extension of hours does not effect the same purpose. I think you will require every moment of time.  It would be very desirable, I know, to have one extra day's holiday, and I am sure it is not a popular suggestion to say we should do without it. But I think between now and the whole of this Session we may require every moment of time for the consideration of the Constitution, and it should be worth it, and therefore I propose we restore Monday as it was in the first draft.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that in Order 11 we amend the first sentence of the Order by the addition of the words &ldquo;in consultation with the Committee to be known as the Committee on Procedure, <Col N="721" /> on which the Ministry shall have the right to be represented by at least half its members.&rdquo;  Briefly, sir, to explain the purpose of this amendment I would like to refer to a later Order, in which it is stated that a ballot should be taken of private Members' Bills. Well, I think that is a procedure that is only adopted in one Assembly&mdash;that across the water&mdash;and even there it has not one single person to speak in defence of it.  To choose legislation by ballot is obviously a very slip-shod method of procedure. You may have ten Bills, and there might be only two of these the Dáil would consider of importance and eight of them might be matters that the majority of this Dáil would consider to be of no practical importance.  Yet the whole ten have to be put into the box, and one is to be picked out by ballot, which is a very haphazard fashion, and the Dáil would be asked to give its attention to matters that would not be worthy of its attention, or not so worthy of it as others there.  There is nobody in the Dáil who has one single word to say in favour of it.  Obviously some method must be adopted for the choice of Bills.  I suggest that the human method is better than the mechanical method.  If it was arranged that this Committee would have before it all the Bills, and would be able to select those of importance, acting in consultation with yourself, sir, they would be able to set them down for a day for consideration. Any Committee of this kind, to be truly representative of this Dáil, must have on it Members who would reflect the mind of the Ministry of this Dáil.  That is, the Ministry should have the opportunity of appointing at least half of the Members of this Committee. Therefore I suggest this amendment to Order 11.</P>

      <P>I was Chairman of the Committee on Standing Orders, and the view taken of it was that Deputies should have as long notice as possible of the business to come before them.  I have <Col N="724" /> arranged now for a notice board on which we will put copies of all notices and resolutions to be considered by the Dáil. Also printed notices on the paper should be got out as quickly as possible in order that Deputies will have them in their hands.  The Committee decided that you would require four days' notice of the motion and two days' notice of the amendment.  Standing Order 14 provides for the discussion of any matters of urgent importance, provided that the Chairman thinks it a matter of urgent importance, and provided that twelve Deputies give support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &mdash;&ldquo;To add to the second paragraph the words `provided nevertheless that this Clause shall not apply to amendments proposed during the consideration of a Bill in Committee.&rdquo;'  This amendment does not deal with motions or amendments to motions at all.  It deals with what we are doing now&mdash;the consideration of a Bill in Committee.  I think what has happened for the last twenty minutes shows that consideration of a Bill in Committee is more or less in the nature of an informal discussion of details. It does not touch with questions of principle at all.  When you get into Committee on a Bill and the motion is made that the Clause stand part of the Bill, you will inevitably find, and experience in other places has shown, it at once occurs to someone that that will necessitate an amendment, or make advisable an amendment in some immediately succeeding Clause, which has been overlooked by the member <Col N="727" /> who proposed the original amendment. Now, the Standing Orders provide that the general rules shall apply to discussion on Bills in Committee.  That is Standing Order 40&mdash;the rule governing debate shall apply to debate in Committee.  If you once begin to apply this, and formally fix times&mdash;two days' notice of any amendment&mdash;I think it is not a rash prophecy to say, when the first part is considered, you will find yourself hung up.  You will have to begin again in order to enable an urgent motion to be introduced, and the whole time will be spent discussing whether some particular amendment should be allowed without notice.  The same provision as to notice is given in Standing Order 65:&mdash;&ldquo;Proposed amendments shall be notified in due time&rdquo; that is, in Committee.  The Standing Orders do not say what is due time, but they do refer you back to Order 12, which we are considering now.  The rule is two days' notice.  I venture to suggest the Dáil will run no great risk by allowing amendments, when a Bill is in Committee, without notice, because it is always open to the Committee if it thinks an amendment is too serious to be taken without due consideration to decline to discuss it, but to shut out amendments, which are often merely verbal amendments, and which are very often agreed to by everybody, except by one man who makes objection, because due notice has not been given, I think will involve you in waste of time.  It would be possible to add to my proposed amendment some words authorising the Chairman, in Committee, to disallow any amendment of which he considers longer notice should be given.  I do suggest that you ought not to fetter the Dáil in Committee by requiring two days' notice of any amendment that is going to be proposed.</P>

      <P>I beg to move as an amendment to omit the words &ldquo;and shall be asked only by the Teachta putting the original motion.&rdquo;  Members will see clearly the meaning of this amendment.  It is to give the right to private members to ask supplementary questions upon matters that they may know something about.  Now, the various constituencies are represented by two or three members, and I think the second member of a constituency should have the right to ask a supplementary question to a question put by his brother member.  I know that in another place this is looked upon as the privilege of private members.  Questions are practically the only opportunity for private members to get a hearing.  This will not alter in any way the meaning of the Standing Orders.  It gives the Chairman full power to rule a supplementary question out if he thinks fit.  It will, at the same time, subject to the Chairman's ruling, give any private member the right to ask a supplementary question I availed of it in another place, and think it is a matter that will recommend itself to the unanimous approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am rather inclined to think that the suggestion of Deputy Byrne to allow a colleague in the constituency of the member who put the original question to ask a supplementary question suggests a rather happy medium, and I think the second member should have that privilege, but if everyone is entitled to ask a supplementary <Col N="733" /> question, we might have the whole afternoon occupied with supplementary questions.  If there was, what we might call an undue interest manifested in a subject, by which a body of members proceeded to discuss the matter by supplementary questions, it could go on to an inordinate length, which is not desirable, but, I think, the way suggested of allowing a colleague of the Deputy responsible for the original question to put one supplementary, might be a happy way out of the difficulty.</P>

      <P>Before we pass on, might I refer to a small matter in Standing Order 22.  That Order provides that a question may be asked by the Teachta in whose name it stands, or, if he is absent when the question is called, by any other Teachta at his request in writing.  I think the Dáil will agree that you may have the case of a man unavoidably absent, and he might ring up another man on the telephone and ask him to put the question for him. This is merely a case of questions.  I suggest, therefore, the words &ldquo;in writing&rdquo; in the Order should be omitted.</P>

It is not often that there is an opportunity on the telephone of making all arrangements in connection with a question.  A question is put by one, and its interpretation by another may be altogether different.  I think, in the circumstances, it is at least reasonable that an authorisation in writing ought to be given.

      <P>The draft Order declares that after a Ministerial motion has been proposed and seconded, and has been further discussed for not less than one hour, a Minister may move that the discussion be stopped, and then it goes on at the end of the draft order <Col N="735" /> to say that any Teachta may move a closure of the debate at any moment. There was a rule in the old Standing Orders which assured a private Teachta, moving a motion, that he would have half an hour's discussion before the closure was moved.  I think it would be fair that that should be restored here; therefore, I propose to add the words &ldquo;after half an hour's discussion,&rdquo; so that the closure may not be moved until there is half an hour's discussion; otherwise it is obvious it would be possible for the closure to be moved after two or three minutes.  The distinction between a Ministerial and a private motion made in this Order is altogether too marked, I think.  In the case of non-Ministerial motions you may not move the closure until half an hour's discussion has taken place.</P>

      <P>If I recollect aright, in the Standing Orders Committee, following the old Standing Orders of the Dáil, the idea was, if the matter had been discussed for half an hour the closure could be moved; and in drafting these, as you recollect, we separated Ministerial motions from non-Ministerial motions.  That is, in the case of Ministerial motions the closure could only be moved by the Minister after half an hour's discussion. In the case of non-Ministerial motions, the closure could be moved by any other member of the Assembly.  I presume, upon reconsideration, that the less than one hour idea came in; but what I mention was a distinct understanding in the original draft.</P>

      <P>It would be well that we should be quite clear.  In the original draft it was first pointed out that Ministers could move the closure on Ministerial motions, and private Members could move the closure on any motion other than the Ministerial motions after half an hour in both cases. The change is that a Ministerial motion must be proposed and seconded, and after it has been further discussed for not less than half an hour, the Minister, and only a Minister, can move the closure. The Committee did not advert to what would happen to private Members motions when they made that change. They made the change with regard to Ministerial motions, and did not advert to what would happen to other than Ministerial motions.</P>

Suppose a private member, say Deputy A.B., moves a motion and it is seconded, and then, in the ensuing debate, a Minister intervenes and talks with his eye on the clock until the half-hour period is on the point of expiring, whereupon, at a signal from the Ministerial Benches, one of the Ministerial Whips moves the closure.  Thus of course, all rights of the private members would disappear.</P>

      <P>Order 37 provides that when a Bill is being considered in Committee the Dáil may decide how much time is to be given to the consideration of certain clauses. Then it proceeds to say that when the time so allotted shall have expired if such clause or group of clauses have not <Col N="739" /> already been voted on, the Ceann Comhairle shall, without motion of discussion, put to the Dáil the amendment under discussion, and any other amendment which the Dáil, on a show of hands, without discussion, decides shall be so put.  Then it proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;That when all amendments have been so disposed of, the Ceann Comhairle shall put the clause or clauses concerned to the Dáil.  If the time allotted to any clause or group of clauses shall expire at 8.30 o'clock, the Dáil shall continue to sit for the purpose of taking the necessary votes.&rdquo;  Now, sir, in the draft of the proposed alterations that I have, there were two amendments designed to leave the thing to the discretion of the Dáil, and to leave the adjournment of the sitting beyond 8.30, equally at the discretion of the Dáil, but only one of those appeared on the motion paper.  What I wanted to get in in the sixth line were the words &ldquo;may in his discretion,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  The Ceann Comhairle may consider there has not been sufficient discussion, and he ought to have a discretion; and in the last line but one &ldquo;if the time allotted to any clause shall expire at 8.30 o'clock,&rdquo; not that &ldquo;the Dáil shall continue to sit,&rdquo; but &ldquo;may at its discretion continue to sit.&rdquo;  Take the case of yesterday, if we had decided, as I believe we had decided, to take 25 clauses of the Constitution yesterday, if I read this draft Standing Order aright, we should have had to sit through the night to get through those 25 clauses.  This clause says when the time allotted to any clause is expired we must go on sitting; therefore, I suggest that if you put &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; we would get over the difficulty.</P>

      <P>The objection to the first change is that it is not desirable that the Chairman should alter, on his own motion, a thing that had been deliberately decided by the Dáil.  That is, if the Dáil deliberately decides to allot a certain time to a clause, it is not desirable that the Chairman should then say he did not think the time had been sufficient. With regard to the other matter, it is not likely to arise that we would be kept until midnight.  The object is, I think, that the Dáil would not be compelled <Col N="740" /> to rise at 8.30 and leave the matter undecided until a certain vote had been taken.  The Dáil could continue sitting.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Gavan Duffy handed in his amendment, I seconded it because I thought it was an attempt to protect the privileges of private Members.  I found right through these Orders the conception of the Dáil as of a purely registering Assembly to say &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; to everything that the Ministerial leaders propose.  Observe the effect of this.  Certain wise men are to determine beforehand what is the proper amount of time to allot to the discussion on certain clauses.  It is not at all improbable that some members of the Dáil will understand these much better than some Ministers.  Yet the Dáil is to be precluded from having any information or enlightenment they might receive from such members, shut out merely because of the pre-determination of whoever was in charge of the carriage of the business of the Dáil, and five or ten minutes less may have been apportioned than was necessary. Everything we are doing is settled by the tyrannical power of the Ministry.  We are simply to come here and sit at the feet of certain of our colleagues in the Dáil, and the most we are permitted to do, in effect, is to say &ldquo;Níl.&rdquo;  I think it is a very curious way to impress upon the Irish people that the will of the people is registered here.  Why, the views of the outside public cannot make themselves felt here only unless there is some secret sympathy or telepathy between Ministers and them.  The thing to be presupposed is this, that those who sit over there are to be exclusively the expression of the people's mind and will, and that all those who sit in these less privileged benches are to sit as in outer darkness, ignored.  If you allow the Ceann Comhairle to protect us, we are safe in his protecting hands.  I am quite sure that, so long as the present occupant of the office is in the chair, no undue curtailment of our rights will be permitted.  But these Orders are setting up a bad precedent for whoever is to come after us.  And it would be much better, it seems to me, if we were allowed to debate questions at length or to the <Col N="741" /> length they would require, even if, occasionally, too much time was devoted to one clause.  It is like the old prescription for the cure of a toothache, &ldquo;cut off the head.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think the idea, if I have it correctly, of the Standing Orders Committee was that private members, who largely outnumber the Ministerial members, might continue the discussion, upon certain clauses, to much the same sort of length as the late Dáil occupied with certain matters.  And if that were so, it would be open to half a dozen gentlemen possessed of great lungs, or of great physical strength, to hold up the assembly here at their own sweet will to spite the Ministry, to spite the Dáil.  If this particular clause does not suit the Dáil, it is open to us after having experience of it to alter it, and, I take it, the business of the Dáil is the first consideration of private members. If we find the business suffers, we can alter it.  No Ministerial direction was given to restrict any rights of private members.  I do not, think it is the intention, nor has it been the experience up to this; but at last we must get down to business, and, I think, it was for that purpose that this clause was put up.</P>

      <P>The amendment, I suggest, would not in any way go against what the President has said. <Col N="742" /> The second part is, I take it, agreed to, that we are not to be compelled to sit after 8.30 for the purpose of taking the necessary vote.  To that, I take it, there is no objection.  The other is a matter of reasonableness, that we leave it to the Ceann Comhairle to say whether he shall or shall not, when time is up, permit the discussion to continue.  It may have been started only five or ten minutes before.</P>

The time is first allotted, and after the time is allotted the Ceann Comhairle is asked to say whether the time has been sufficient or not.  It puts the Ceann Comhairle, it seems to me, in rather a difficulty, because the time is first fairly allotted, and subsequently the Ceann Comhairle will have to say whether the Dáil was wrong.  I would prefer the Dáil to state it was wrong itself.  I do not wish to intervene in debates in any way, but as this is a matter which is distinctly left to me, I would like to say how it strikes me.</P>

      <P>It appears to me a closure clause of this kind is quite unnecessary until we find a reason for such a clause.  I suspect it was put forward in anticipation of something that is not likely to happen on the Constitution Bill; but if we are going to have a closure clause, I do not see how we are going to amend this satisfactorily.  The discussion that was spoken of says that, the Dáil having agreed to do certain things, the Speaker shall have discretion and say whether they would be done or not.  I do not think that is satisfactory.  If we are going to have a clause at all, I do not think that clause can be amended.</P>

      <P>moved the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To insert after Order 39 a new Standing Order to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `Teachtai who hold an office of profit under a Minister, and whose appointment has not been brought before the Dáil for sanction, shall not vote on any motion involving a question of confidence in the Ministry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sent in this amendment as a new Standing Order.  It has been <Col N="744" /> suggested that such an Order should be embodied in the Constitution. I am not certain whether it should be in or not.  I think it should certainly be an Order of this Dáil in one form or another.  I recognise the present situation, and I recognise that there are difficulties, and I really put this down to draw attention to the risk that, if we do not meet such a situation, a very grave scandal, not necessarily in this particular Dáil, but at some future Assembly, may arise.  If Ministers are free to appoint to offices of profit Members of the Chamber, Members of the Dáil, that practically means the purchase of votes for any motion they may put forward.  When Members of the Dáil are appointed to positions of profit, whose names are not brought before the Dáil for sanction or approval, it is not a desirable practice at all&mdash;it is very undesirable&mdash;that they should be allowed to vote on any question, particularly a question affecting the Ministry&mdash;one involving confidence.  I would like to hear some views on this, but I do not want to press it at this stage unless it is generally acceptable.  If it is generally acceptable, by all means let it go; but I think it is very desirable that attention should be drawn to the matter so as to prevent such a practice being confirmed and carried through for a future Dáil.</P>

      <P>Unless I am much mistaken, there is no provision in these Standing Orders for any amendment to them.  The Standing Orders were mainly drawn up to meet the present emergency; that is why they have been treated by the Dáil in an emergency manner, and things have gone through which otherwise would not have gone through.  I think it is agreed that when the Constitution and the Treaty have gone through, this Dáil will be in a somewhat different frame of mind. It would be necessary, in all probability, that some of the Standing Orders should be changed, therefore it will be necessary to have specific provision made for the manner in which the Standing Orders may be modified.  Therefore I propose an amendment of the Standing Orders:&mdash;&ldquo;To add the following further title and order: `Amendment of Standing Orders.'  These Standing Orders may be amended on the motion of any Teachta; if a motion to amend be moved by a private Teachta, it shall be subject to the provisions of the Standing Orders Nos. 12 and 54, save that it shall take precedence of other private business, and shall not be dependent upon selection by ballot.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is not that another curtailment of a private Member's right?  Last week Deputy Milroy himself, on the adjournment of the Dáil, raised the most important question that we discussed since we came here.  It was raised on an adjournment motion.  Now, under these Standing Orders private Members get no satisfaction at question hour from the Minister. He is debarred now, by your regulations, from raising the matter on the adjournment of the Dáil.  I do not understand why that should be so, considering that Deputy Milroy himself was on the motion allowed to raise a question for discussion. I may say these two points were used with great effect when the humblest Member, who had no great Party machine behind him, wished to raise a question at Westminster.  I myself, when I was refused a hearing and could not catch the Speaker's eye, availed myself of a supplementary question to raise important matters on the adjournment.  Now, I understand, this democratic Dáil has fleeced from the private Members these privileges, and I would like an explanation.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy who spoke last was trying to <Col N="749" /> mislead me.  Rule 14 says we can interrupt the Agenda to get a motion accepted. A Member must get a certain support to interrupt the Agenda, and I do not think that certain Members can get sufficient support.  I, for one, claim the right that I always had in another place that was not supposed to be so democratic as this&mdash;the right, as a Member representing a certain number of people, whether or not I had a machine behind me or a party to support me&mdash; the right to raise a matter of importance on the adjournment of the Dáil.  It was done here last week&mdash;I am referring to Deputy Milroy's motion on the Ulster Question.  I suggest that you ought to give us half an hour to raise a question on the adjournment motion.  If in the other Dáil, the business was finished before time, what happened was, when the business on the Agenda fell through before the hour appointed, at that time a Member could raise a question. If the adjournment is taken before 11 o'clock a private Member, on a motion given in, may be allowed one hour for the discussion of matters he may wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I think we are all indebted to Deputy Milroy for raising this question, and I do not think there is any reason why Deputy Whelehan should object to the proposal giving 4½ hours to private members.  It is a very valuable right.  A question may arise an hour before the adjournment is moved.  It is not essential such a discussion should take place very frequently, and if some members make themselves a nuisance by frequently raising questions which are of no general importance, there is an obvious remedy, and Deputy Whelehan will know how to apply that remedy.  I do not know if Deputy Milroy has any form of words which would fit his desire in this matter.</P>

      <P>On that question I take it a private member would find himself restricted beyond all contemplation, if he was only entitled to speak on a matter of public importance like this once in every twenty-nine weeks. That would be the period, I take it.  Now, I take it there are something like 116 members in this Dáil who are private members, and each of them has just as much right as any other private member, and each of them could ballot for one half hour each night during the period. As there are 116 members, and only four days, it should be 29 weeks before the last man got his half hour.  If it is not that, I do not understand what it is. That is the point.  There is a multiplicity of private members, and no private members have any more rights than the others.  If some of the private members <Col N="751" /> want more time, they will have to invent a longer day than 24 hours.  I do not see how it is possible to get in all sorts of questions on the adjournment.  And if every question is brought up on adjournment, we will have to sit there listening to them.</P>

      <P>I am really surprised at the remarks of the President. It is not my intention to suggest to Members of this Dáil the idea of bringing along unnecessary contentious questions for the purpose of detaining Ministers here, but up to the present we have had to exercise this right of bringing forward matters that may arise at a moment's notice.  That would not be provided for by the machinery of the ballot; it could only be provided for until such questions did arise.  I think, after all, with due respect to the Ministry, they will have to recognise the fact that they are here to answer to the nation for their responsibilities; that they, will have to meet questions and criticisms concerning the administration of the country when and how they arise, provided they are matters of sufficient urgency and importance to merit their attention.  I think this is really a valuable means by which ordinary Members can ventilate their rights, and should not be treated as a frivolous matter or as an unnecessary intervention. If you will allow, I will endeavour to find a form of words which will cover it and give it in as a motion for consideration when the next draft of the Standing Orders is brought up.</P>

      <P>I intended that the Standing Orders Committee should meet again and make that clear.  The draft Standing Orders, which you have considered with certain amendments, were drawn up at two meetings, and they had to be printed last Friday in order that the Deputies would have them in their hands.  The Standing Orders Committee, however, left out a fairly considerable number of Standing Orders dealing with ordinary procedure, which I think <Col N="752" /> would meet with very little opposition from any Members of the Dáil.  I would like, if the Dáil grant me leave, to summon the Standing Orders Committee again for consideration of these and other matters, and also generally for the purpose of considering questions that arise, and particularly to making Standing Orders.  It is better we would be able to point to a particular Standing Order instead of having to point out such things as general practice.  I find the Standing Orders Committee cannot meet again until Thursday, when we can go into this matter, and when Deputy Milroy has furnished us with the words of his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOS. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that a new Article be inserted saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Saorstát may, by legislation, in the economic interests of the community, oblige economic undertakings and associations to combine, on a self-governing basis, for the purpose of ensuring the co-operation of all the productive factors of the Nation, associating employers and employees in the management and regulating the production, manufacture, distribution, consumption, prices, and the import and export of commodities upon principles determined by the economic interests of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that this is one of the clauses which ought not to be put into the Constitution, but is merely a subject of legislation and a mere declaration.  I would forestall that objection by saying it has not been applied to other clauses in the draft which suggest that Saorstát may do certain things.  When I am met with the argument, as I probably shall be, that it is not the kind of thing that ought to go into a Constitution, I will refer to a Constitution, recently adopted by the German Republic, and say it has been embodied there, pretty much in its present form, and while I do not desire that Saorstát Eireann should follow absolutely or even closely the procedure of the German Legislature in building a Constitution, at least they have shown how it can be done, and how it ought to be done.  The proposition is, as a matter of fact, to lay down that in the view of this Assembly, which is building a Constitution, or pretends to be, that we have in mind an idea of social order different from that which we are, I hope, growing out of and which has been introduced by means of the economic subjugation of this country.  It is a proposal that <Col N="754" /> the new Ireland shall encourage the organisation of industry in such a manner that those engaged in the operation of the industry shall be the controllers of the industry and to discourage what is evidently in the minds of some people, who had hopes, at least some months ago that you were going to bring in all kinds of foreign capital to exploit this country, to the full, in the interest of foreign capitalists.  The proposition here is that the State should definitely set itself out to encourage something better than that.  The operators in an industry and the workers under those operators should combine for the exploitation and management of that industry and generally to encourage the idea of cooperative control and ownership or guildisation of industry and the control of markets, of consumption and of export and import by the people engaged in the various industries.  It would mean, for instance, that agriculture would be under the direction of agriculturists, and I am sure our friends the Deputies who represent agriculture would prefer that to having agriculture dominated by townsmen.  That is the proposition, and it is a very good precedent. I understand it is already in good working operation in Germany as a consequence of the adoption in the Constitution of such a clause a couple of years ago.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy Johnson has any serious doubts as to whether the Parliament of Saorstát has this power or will have this power, if it thinks fit to legislate along these lines. If he has no such doubts, why are we to insert this thing in the Constitution? It seems to me that we, at any rate, having regard to the particular circumstances of the time, and the particular circumstances of the country, should aim at putting down in our Constitution only matters on which we will get the broadest possible measure of consent, and that we should aim at keeping out of our Constitution matters which will stir up controversy, and which will stir <Col N="755" /> up fears.  Personally, I have no doubt whatever as to the powers of the Parliament of Saorstát Eireann to legislate along the lines indicated in this amendment. I have no doubt whatever of the powers of the Parliament, for instance, to nationalise railways, and if they can nationalise railways I see no reason to draw a rigid distinction with regard to other matters, but I personally am not in favour of setting out this particular amendment in the Constitution, as if to indicate in some way we particularly favour that course, because that course is one that would want to be very carefully discussed and very carefully considered. I see no need to insert the amendment in the Constitution, and, speaking for those who are putting forward the Bill, while it is not a matter that we stand or fall for, like some other matters in the Constitution, it is a matter which we do not accept and which we would vote against.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it would be the new Article 12.  This proposition is already embodied in the recently made Constitution in Germany, and it is not a suggestion of something that may be done by legislation, but it is a suggestion that we should take it upon ourselves as a nation that there are certain duties, first for the individual, and secondly, the individual having done his duty, that there are certain duties for the nation itself. I submit that we have a right to look to every citizen to make the best use of his bodily and mental powers.  It is not right <Col N="756" /> that a citizen should have the rights without undertaking the duties, and the duties of citizenship involve the utilisation of those powers for the welfare of the community.  If we have a right outlook on life and a right social order we will find that every citizen who does not use those mental and bodily powers for the welfare of the community is living upon the community, is a loss to the community and is a parasite on the community.  And the contention here is that we should lay down that a citizen, in exchange for his right of protection, his privilege of government, should be bound to give to that community services according to his capacity, and we desire to lay that down as a fundamental principle of the Constitution. And having done that, the citizen has a right to look to the whole body of citizens for the protection of his human machine, of his bodily health and the opportunity to gain his livelihood by economic labour.  We would lay down that a citizen having done his share, the community is bound in its turn to do its share for the citizen, and to ensure that an opportunity should be provided for every citizen to gain that livelihood, and if the State fails to provide a man with the opportunity for economic labour, then it should provide for his support. We lay the duty upon the citizen first, and he, having fulfilled his duty, then the whole community of citizens should ensure him a livelihood and, primarily, an opportunity of earning that livelihood.</P>

      <P>Perhaps as Deputy Johnson suggested yesterday, some of us take a different view of what should be in the Constitution, but this is a general declaration without very much definite meaning, and it seems to me to be the very sort of thing we should not put into the Constitution.  And, as I said before, there are things more or less of that type already in the Constitution, and if I were proposing amendments, I would rather aim at reducing the amount of space taken up with such things rather than at increasing it.  Now, in the first sentence it is declared:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the bounden duty of every citizen without prejudice to his personal liberty to make such use of his mental and bodily powers as shall be necessary for the welfare of the community.&rdquo;  That would be all right in a magazine article where nobody would scrutinise it very much, but if you put <Col N="757" /> it into an article that it should stand scrutiny, you will find in reality it means nothing at all.  If you cut out the words &ldquo;without prejudice to his personal liberty&rdquo; there would be meaning in it, and if it read &ldquo;it is the bounden duty of every citizen to make such use of his mental and bodily powers as shall be necessary for the welfare of the community,&rdquo; that would mean something, but if you put in the qualifying clause, the whole thing is nullified.  Take the sentence &ldquo;every citizen shall be afforded an opportunity to gain his livelihood by economic labour&rdquo;&mdash;the word is &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; remember.  That might be said to be a rather tall order. It certainly is one that could not be made operative.  It is a thing everybody would desire.  If we put &ldquo;should&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; it would be a pious aspiration that would commend itself to us all, and <Col N="758" /> an idea that would commend itself to us all, but if this is meant to be mandatory upon the State, it is, as I said, a tall order. Economic labour is not so easy a thing to arrive at.  I take it if we set up State workshops it might very well be&mdash; and probably would be&mdash;that the labour there would not be economic labour, and the whole thing might be uneconomic.  That might easily happen. Then if we take the words &ldquo;where no suitable opportunity of work can be found, provision shall be made for his support&rdquo; that might mean no change at all in the present condition, because I believe if a man is destitute a certain provision&mdash;provision of a type&mdash;is made for his support; so that on the ground that it is what I may describe as &ldquo;sloshy,&rdquo; I would be opposed to the incorporation of this amendment in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move that Article 12 of the draft Constitution stand part of the Bill.  The Article reads:&mdash;&ldquo;A Legislature is hereby created to be known as Parliament of the Irish Free State/Oireachtas.  It shall consist of the King and two Houses; the Chamber of Deputies/Dáil Eireann and the Senate/ Seanad Eireann.  The power of making laws for the peace, order and good government of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann is vested in the Parliament/ Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Now in this connection I think I shall read to the Deputies the first two Articles of the Treaty.  Article 1 of the Treaty reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland and an Executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  Article 2 of the Treaty reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out, the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice and constitutional usage, governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  It is on that second Article of the Treaty that this particular Article of the draft Constitution hangs.  There is an amendment down in the name of Deputy Gavan Duffy which in the opinion of the Government is practically equivalent to an invitation to this Dáil to proclaim a Republic, and I trust that this Assembly will give that amendment all the consideration it deserves.  The proposal is to leave out the King.  Now, unfortunately we consider that within the terms of the Treaty it is not possible to leave out the King, and I would like to know on what that amendment is based, whether it is on the law of Canada or the practice and constitutional usage of Canada.  I would ask Deputies to turn to page 3 in the little book &ldquo;The Three Dominion Constitutions&rdquo; and to read there Article 17 <Col N="760" /> of the Canada Act, which says:&mdash;&ldquo;There shall be one Parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper House styled the Senate, and the House of Commons.&rdquo;  And, turning to page 31, to read in the Australian Constitution the first Article:&mdash;&ldquo;The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is hereinafter called `The Parliament' or `The Parliament of the Commonwealth.' &rdquo; And turning to page 58 to read in the Constitution of the Union of South Africa, Article 19:&mdash;&ldquo;The legislative power of the Union shall be vested in the Parliament of the Union, herein called Parliament, which shall consist of the King, a Senate, and a House of Assembly.&rdquo; Now, if what the British signatories and what the Irish signatories really intended was that Ireland should have whatever position was desired by the left wing&mdash; was desired and struggled for by the left wing in any of these Dominions&mdash;I have no doubt that they would have seen to it that the draughtsman set that out.  The draughtsman did not set out anything of the kind, and we, who had the duty of working out an interpretation of the Treaty, could only take it that we were bound to work out a Constitution which would fit within the limits of those first two Articles of the Treaty, and we could not see, still less could we maintain, across the table with the British representatives, that there was anything in these two Articles of the Treaty which would enable us to leave out the King, as Deputy Gavan Duffy desires.  It is not a particularly pleasant position to be placed in to have to stand over an Article such as Article 12 of the Constitution.  It is a very safe position for one who feels he has a comfortable minority to take up, and a very safe position for one who is not primarily responsible to the country for what may befall.  I venture to say that since last December this country has more heroes to the square mile than any other country in the world, and we have Robert Emmets swaggering about, talking about this knock-kneed Government that is going to accept the King.  We propose to accept the King because we have a mandate from the people to accept the Treaty, and we cannot maintain, and were unable to maintain in the past, that within the four corners of that Treaty you could <Col N="761" /> draft a Constitution which would leave out the King.  And so, not because of any personal predilection for that gentleman, and not because of any rigid convictions against Republicanism, and not because of any deep-seated personal fear as to the consequences to ourselves, but simply taking a very serious view of our responsibility to the Irish people and not having a very high opinion of their prospects of getting any better, we stand for this Constitution and for certain vital clauses of this Constitution which are not particularly pleasant to ourselves personally. The King is part and parcel of the Parliament in all the Dominions mentioned in Article 1 of the Treaty, and neither the law nor the practice nor the constitutional usage of Canada leaves out the King. It may be that in one of those Dominions or in all of these Dominions that there is a left wing struggling hard for particular things and hoping to attain to particular things in the future.  But that position which they are struggling for is not the position which was granted to Ireland in the Treaty, and it is not a position which it is possible to secure in a constitution under the Treaty.  Every Member should face the thing in that way and it is not right to vote in the spirit&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, it is safe to vote this way because we are in a minority.&rdquo;  Every Member should cast his vote on every subject as if it were going to be a tie in the Dáil and as if his vote should mean the difference one way or the other.  It is in that spirit that the Deputies voted last December when deciding on the Treaty which gave rise to this Constitution.  If Deputy Cavan Duffy carries his amendment, no doubt he will be the Head of a Ministry whose duty it will be to win for Ireland a Constitution which will leave out the King. I wish him luck, and I promise him any personal help that I can give him in that task, but I am not sanguine of his success. I formally move that that Article stand part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is really only to save time.  As I say, let us come down to the plain facts of these things. It is not a question of leaving out the King from this Constitution; it is a question of putting him in his proper place.  I find him sprinkled all over the Constitution, and I am entitled to ask the Minister why, if I find him in a place where he has no business.  The objection is that the King is unwanted here in this Clause, and will be taken as an assertion of English authority wherever you shove him in.  The Ministerial position seems to be &ldquo;open your mouth, and shut your eyes, and see what the King will bring you.&rdquo;  In view of the, I regret to say, somewhat insincere statement made by the Minister who has spoken last, I challenge him to put before this Dáil the Clause which he despatched with the final draft that the Provisional Government sent to London last June.  Let the Dáil see that, and then we will see where we are in the matter, instead of trying to misrepresent the position, as the Minister has been trying to misrepresent it.  Now, my point is this, and I will try to state it calmly and dispassionately, and everybody can see whether it is right or wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Minister will respond to my challenge when he rises.  The King is not essential in the Parliament under the law, practice and Constitutional usage we are adopting, for this reason: he is only used as a rubber stamp on legislation, and to summon or dissolve Parliament. For this purpose he need not be a Member of Parliament.  In the ancient law, of course, he is a constituent factor in the Parliament, but the very object of putting in the words practice and Constitutional <Col N="763" /> usage was that we might, at least, get down to realities.  And who is going to say that the King is a reality in Parliament?  He has those two functions, which he may carry out just as well whether he is inside or outside of Parliament, and which, in any case, he is obliged to carry out on the advice of somebody else.  Then we are told he is an essential part of Parliament.  Look at the contradiction which the Ministers have got themselves into by this assertion. Look at this Clause here.  They have actually to modify Clause 17 concerning the Oath in order to square with their view of the King.  In Article 4 of the Treaty it was provided that &ldquo;the Members of Parliament&rdquo; should take a certain Oath; but realising that now that they have made the King a Member of the Parliament the position would be a little comical, they have changed the wording in Article 17, and instead of saying the Members of the Parliament, they say Members of Parliament&mdash;M.P.'s.  If they kept to the wording of the Treaty, they would be told: &ldquo;so the King is to take the Oath, too.&rdquo;  They have had actually to change the wording of the Treaty in order to bring the King into the Parliament.  In Clause 18, if His Royal Majesty is a Member of the Irish Parliament, he, I suppose, is to enjoy the privileges given by that Clause&mdash; freedom from arrest&mdash;&mdash;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it was intended by the Ministry that His Majesty should be free from arrest in attending this Parliament.  If they had confined themselves to saying what they say elsewhere&mdash;that his fiat must be given for legislation under the existing usage&mdash;that would have been a different matter.  Here they shove him in as an essential factor to this body that we call Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the fact that they altered Article 17 and the wording of Article 18 make it perfectly clear that the proper interpretation &ldquo;of the law, practice and constitutional usage,&rdquo; is that you should state the law as it is to-day, leaving out the law where the law is a dead letter.  In fact the insertion of these words &ldquo;the King&rdquo; is only defendable as a metaphysical abstraction.  The President told us the other day that he <Col N="764" /> wanted to come down to facts.  Now he has his chance.</P>

      <P>Well, if you are going to insist on shoving the royal gentleman in here, then tell us what King you allude to?  The King as spoken of in this country for the past 120 years is the King of Great Britain and Ireland, Is that the gentleman referred to?  I have also heard of the King of England. Is that the gentleman you refer to?  Or again, is it the King of Ireland?  Or is it the King of the British Commonwealth? The man in the street picks up this Constitution and he wants to know what the Parliament consists of, and he is told it consists of the King and the two Houses.  What King?  I fancy the Minister will have some difficulty in answering that.  I oppose its insertion on the ground that it is not necessary according to the contract we have made And I challenge the Minister to show to this Dáil the clauses concerning this Parliament prescribed in the Constitutional Draft which they took over to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite amazed that a lawyer of such distinction and such wide legal knowledge should ask, as Deputy G. Duffy asks us, to accept the statement that the King and George Windsor are identical.  Where the expression &ldquo;the King&rdquo; is used in the Articles of the draft Constitution nobody knows better than the distinguished Deputy who has just spoken that this is one of the misty, cloudy things in Constitutional law; one of the things which the British people according to their long established characteristics have agreed not to probe too closely into, but as they would say themselves to &ldquo;muddle through.&rdquo;  Either we accept the Treaty or we repudiate it. Now I understood that we had agreed to accept the Treaty and the consequences thereof&mdash;the reasonable legitimate consequences no doubt.  That is to say, we have so far consented to enter the union of Free Nations called the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We cannot do that and not do it at the same time. That may be ridiculed as metaphysics, but it is the metaphysics which the ordinary man in the street will adopt. You cannot have Ireland a Free State meaning a member of the Union of Dominions, and not have her so.  Let <Col N="765" /> us then ask what the Deputy has asked: What is referred to by this mention of the King?  Is it George who recently altered his surname to Windsor?  Certainly it is not the individual sovereign.  What is meant is the Crown.  We have the high authority of Mr. Gladstone for the declaration that the Crown and King, though often spoken of confusedly as one thing, are two things. We often speak of King George as the British Sovereign, and &ldquo;Sovereign&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; are frequently interchanged with the result that we make confusion worse confounded.  What is meant by the King here is what the words mean in constitutional documents&mdash;the Crown.  The Sovereign also means the Crown.  Deputy Gavan Duffy spoke of these as metaphysical abstractions.  Well he is partly right, according to my view of the matter, and partly wrong.  Perhaps it would seem too technical a distinction to draw at the moment between abstraction and abstracted. I will go more fully into this matter with just one little illustration which will appeal to most people, if I may indulge myself in it, with your permission.  We have all done exercises in arithmetic of this sort:&mdash;If ten men build a wall in an hour, in what time will a thousand men build it?  And Arithmetic answers:&mdash;&ldquo;In the one-hundredth part of an hour.&rdquo;  And Arithmetic will answer that ten million men can build it in the millionth part of an hour.  That is to say, that you could have a wall built round your premises in so short a space of time that it would not admit of the lifting of the trowel from the level of the clay to do the work.  Why, you left out in the calculation of the building of the wall all the humanity that goes to the making of the bricklayer.  Instead of thinking of him as a man who wants to smoke, observe the clouds, discuss politics with the man beside him, you reduced him to a mere coefficient of labour.  What you are calculating with in this arithmetical problem is not the individual as a man and brother, but a function of man, as simply a certain measurable quantum of labour.  In the same way the Crown is an abstracted entity.  There is, on one side, the Sovereign, the King as a man; on the other side, for the purposes of Constitutional law, and through the traditional language of Constitutional law, he becomes the Crown. As such he is immortal, impeccable, omniscient and has all sorts of magnificent characteristics, although we know what he is in his character as a man.</P>

      <P>There are other people, I see, beside the President who do not read the <i>Daily Mail</i> and other English newspapers.  At any rate we are well aware, if only through the Cinema, of how he looks.  We know he has the privilege of being driven to Westminster in a State coach drawn by horses gaily caparisoned, and accompanied by squadrons of armed men on lively, spirited horses.  We know that much.  That is not the Crown. That is the person of the Sovereign.  Now, you cannot have a legislature for this Free State unless you have the machinery of legislation that is provided in the Constitution contemplated by the Treaty.  One of the instruments is a rubber stamp as someone has termed the Crown.  In such documents as this, the Crown, or King or Sovereign is only another name for the rubber stamp.  Unless we begin to think of the man or the person there is no sentimental hurt and there is no harm done. Some of you may remember the delightful inimitable little sketch by Thackeray.  It represented a Ludovicus Rex, Louis XIV., King of Kings.  You have the resplendent figure of Majesty, apparelled in beautiful robes; this is Louis Rex.  Then you have the poor, puny, wretched looking individual called Ludov.  Now you have this clause about the King.  Deputy Gavan Duffy is well able to realise that those clothes of Rex will fit any Ludovicus, Georgius or otherwise, so long as the Commonwealth of Nations exists.  The King, the Crown, the Sovereign, etc., is merely the completion of the whole apparatus for enacting statutes.  If you like to go again to the building trade for a figure, he is the coping stone on the wall. Now Deputy Gavan Duffy seems to have forgotten the speech made by General Smuts in the Union of South Africa quite recently.  I am not in the habit, I regret, &mdash;I have not, unfortunately, that art of making notes or of using quotations, but for this purpose and because it is, to my mind, of such vital importance I have brought a copy of the paper in which his speech appears.  He was speaking about the relation of the Commonwealth &mdash;the Union of South Africa&mdash;to the British Commonwealth, of the relation of the Union of South Africa to the British Commonwealth.  He was trying to impress upon the recalcitrant members of his House, for they have them in South Africa as well as here, that the Crown is the sign of the Union of Free Nations. And if the more feudal, as I would put <Col N="767" /> it, language had been used of enumerating the &ldquo;estates of the realm&rdquo; the Crown or Sovereign would be stated as the first one of those estates.  Here is the quotation from General Smuts' speech, made by him on the 13th September, 1920:&mdash;&ldquo;The next question is whether the right of veto still exists and whether the King could veto a law if passed by this Dominion Parliament for secession from the Empire.  On any ordinary law there is in reality no such thing as veto, but on a law for secession it would not only be the King's right, but, according to our constitution and the Constitution of the Commonwealth, <i>it would be his duty to keep himself in force</i> and in connection with our Parliament and Union. But so far as ordinary laws are concerned, the power of veto is obsolete and irrevocable. Every legal authority worth considering agrees on these points.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect it is germane.  What General Smuts has emphasised here is what is the King's exact function in the Commonwealth&mdash; that he is there as the Sovereign of the Commonwealth, that he is there to be the outward symbol and sign of the Union of South Africa with the British Commonwealth.  That is the respect in which it is germane.  Now when Deputy Gavan Duffy speaks of the King being made a member of Parliament to secure immunity from arrest on the way to the Dáil he is thinking of the King in his personal capacity, whereas Constitutional documents always speak of him in an <i>impersonal</i> fashion.  I am not professing any great love for Kings.  I am longer a Republican in theory than any member of this Dáil.  But I am not a Republican in the sense in which it is understood outside to-day.  I hope I have more sense&mdash;more sense of realities.  I hope, too, I have a better sense of honour than after entering into a Treaty with another country to repudiate the part that is essential and vital in that settlement.  We are here to enact a Constitution which shall be a Constitution giving us the agencies and instruments for securing peace and good government, and for the progress of the nation within the Commonwealth of <Col N="768" /> Free Nations.  We are placing ourselves inside that Commonwealth, and in so doing as in the case of the other members of the Commonwealth, we recognise the symbol of unity, if there is the bond between the different elements of that combination the King in these documents means that symbol.</P>

    <P>I support Deputy Gavan Duffy's amendment, and I do that for one reason.  I am a believer in a one House Parliament, a single House without any exception.  I am just as much opposed to the principle of the Second House, or Chamber or Senate, or anything else except under certain conditions, which shall come on later on another Article of the Constitution.  I am opposed, on the grounds of reality I spoke a few minutes ago, but now I am coming to a reality.  I do not want anyone to be a Member of the Oireachtas of the Parliament of the Irish Free State who is not a reality, who is not going to come in and do some work, and perform some function actually in the Parliament Deputy Magennis has been telling us, with some truth, at all events, that the King, or, as he calls him, George Windsor, &mdash;I think the man's name is really Wettin or Von Wettin&mdash;that he and the Crown are two different things; that the person does not matter, and if the person does not matter get him out of the thing, and put in something that is reality.  Put in the Crown and then you will have the clause reading &ldquo;a legislature to be known as the Parliament of the Irish Free State which shall consist of the Crown and Two Houses.&rdquo;  That is, if the Crown is a <Col N="769" /> reality as I submit the Crown is a reality &mdash;the King is not&mdash;he may be something more than he has been described by Deputy Duffy.  He is flesh and blood, and if he is flesh and blood and King to be in the Parliament not merely to be in the Treaty, then let him come down and take his seat and do his ordinary day's work along with the rest of us, submitting to Standing Orders and everything else. I do not think you can make the Crown do that, but if it is the King you have got to do it.  There is another word which might supply a variation, and that is the older form of the word, the Latin word which the Professor has used, Rex. You might put in that and it might mean something; it might be explained, but as the Article stands I do not think anyone can explain it.  I am supporting the Amendment for another reason, and opposing the Article as it stands, because, in spite of all the questions we have put to the Ministers, the Ministry cannot, has not, convinced me, at all events, that there is any obligation whatsoever&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;in the Treaty for having the Constitution at all, or if it is a wise and expedient thing to have a Constitution when there is no obligation other than a certain Agreement between Irish delegates and English delegates, that there is no obligation in the Treaty for having certain clauses in the Treaty.  Therefore I very heartily support, on principle, Deputy Gavan Duffy's Amendment.  Cut out the King.  If you want to put in a reality put in the Privy Council, if you like, or the Crown.  Have no shams and no duds, no dummies, in the Parliament. Have something that is a reality, a convincing and real actuality, not something that none of us know anything about.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Amendment, and I do so on the lines advocated by Deputy Gavan Duffy and Deputy O'Shannon, and also on the further plea that by including this we are hereupon taking upon ourselves the establishment of Czardom in Ireland just as the Czar of Russia did a few years ago.  I would like to deal fully with this matter, but I will reserve it for other parts of the Constitution to which I will have something to say.  I do not rise as one of the new Robert Emmets of which some of the Ministers on the other Benches now and again make mention.  I do so as one who has always stood by the country <Col N="770" /> and do so now.  By including the King and two Houses in this Article we thereby implicate, and thereby of our own accord, no matter what may be said to the contrary, put the King of England, or whatever King is meant, in the position to veto any Bill that may be passed through this Parliament.  We are supposed to have a Parliament modelled on Canadian lines, and if we have a Parliament of that kind it means that within two years that if a Bill was passed by this Parliament and was sanctioned by the King, still at the same time it would be in the power of the British Cabinet to veto that Bill in two years.  The Canadian Constitution says &ldquo;the Executive Government and authority for Canada is hereby declared to be vested in the Queen.&rdquo;  The Executive authority in the Irish Free State must therefore be derived from the King of England and be exercised by his Governor-General. I think no matter what is said to the contrary that there has been too much leniency in agreeing to these matters.  Many of the Articles need revision and it will be for this Parliament, no matter what the consequences, to see that we have a Constitution moulded to suit the aspirations of the Irish people, and not be at the beck of any other country.  We must assert ourselves that we are going to have a National Parliament, and that it will be one in consort with the needs of the people.  As one elected to represent the people, no matter what the consequences may be, I am prepared to accept them to see that the full light of National freedom is obtained. It may be put forward that it can be obtained by other means, but so far as we are concerned&mdash;and so far as I am personally concerned&mdash;my object at all times has been, and I have always been looking forward to it, and I consider the need of the majority of the Irish people to be a Workers' Republic.  I say that here now, and I have never departed from that position, and I never will. I say it is up to this Parliament to show their manhood here and now, to eradicate the name of the King and the two Houses from Article 12, and show that we are here to act for ourselves and want no camouflage and intricacies put before us. It may be easy for Members here to laugh and joke, but a time will come when it will be put before us to say whether we are men or not.  Many things said here may be a matter for laughing, but <Col N="771" /> perhaps the running through of this Constitution without altering it, having gone through the farce, the result will be we will have the whole country&mdash;no matter how it now stands by the Free State&mdash; getting up against the action that would be decided or seemingly is about to be decided. I do not personally see why you should have the King mentioned so often in this draft Constitution, in practically every second Article you will find his name.</P>

      <P>In each Article he is mentioned two or three times, but in my opinion it is nine times too often in the 79 Articles, but as Deputy Cathal O'Shannon has said, if you are going to mention the Crown you mention the Crown of the two Houses.  Deputy Magennis says the King represents the Crown and that the Crown can be substituted for the King.  In my opinion the Crown of England is worth 5s., and I am sure the King is not worth much more.  Let us consider for a moment what we are up against in the future. We are up against the Irish Nation, the people have returned us here, I am not against the Treaty, I am quite prepared to support the Treaty, but as the question has been asked of the Minister on several occasions here before and not answered, I now ask&mdash;why has not the first and second draft Constitution been placed before this Dáil?  The Constitution was sent to England and it was altered by Lloyd George and others to suit themselves and not to suit the Irish people, and that is the rag we have in our hands at the present moment.  I think we must be serious for once in our lives.  I am glad to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs say &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; because it applies to himself, more or less; we have been here for the past fortnight and I certainly admit a fair amount of work has been done, but in the old Dáil the late Commander-in-Chief got absolutely sick of long speeches and he said, &ldquo;give up talking and proceed with the work.&rdquo; Now I say the same to you, give up talking about the King and get on with the work.  If you give up talking about the King you will abolish him out of this Constitution and then you will get it <Col N="772" /> accepted by the Dáil.  I do not wish to detain the Dáil as I am more of a man of business than a man of words. I ask you, especially the Ministers, seriously to consider the matter.  Ireland has gone through a lot before, and I am quite prepared to take all responsibility for not having the King's name mentioned in this Article 12.</P>

      <P>I think every Member of the Dáil must have a very deep measure of sympathy with the Amendment that has been moved.  I do not imagine that any person is going to vote for the retention of this royal person with any peculiar pleasure.  I think it runs across the tendency of feelings that have been engendered in this country for a long time.  I would like to repeat what I said in this Dáil on an earlier occasion, that I did not believe that this word would have appeared here but for the action of certain persons who weakened those who represented this country when the matter of the Constitution was under discussion.  What we have to deal with at the present moment is that, as a result of these discussions, these two words that have now been objected to have been put into the Constitution by the consent of each side. What we have to decide, seeing it has been so entered into, is whether they shall now remain or whether by their deletion we shall take certain consequences, but I do not believe that those whom we represent and who are our masters in the country would desire us to do so.  That is to say, if these two words be accepted and made part of the debate, I think that the speech made by the Minister for Home Affairs made it perfectly clear that he himself regarded it as a necessary medicine that he had to take, I think everybody here would regard it as a necessary medicine to be taken.  I think there is one serious consideration that might help us in this matter, and I would like to draw attention to it.  Deputy Magennis, in a speech that was really as illuminating as it was entertaining, referred to the King as a Sovereign Authority.</P>

      <P>I may have mis-heard the statement.  I said these two words in Article 12 are to be construed <Col N="773" /> in connection with other words in the Constitution.  Article 2 comes before Article 12.  In Article 12 it appears the legislature to be appointed shall consist of a King and two Houses and that the King shall be part of the legislature.  Article 2 is before Article 12.  It says: &ldquo;all powers of Government and all authority, legislative, executive, and judicial, are derived from the people and the same shall be exercised in the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann through the organisations established by or under, and in accord with, this Constitution. The King shall remain in Article 12, and he shall remain as a functionary of the Irish people, and nothing more or less than a functionary, just like a member of the Civic Guard although with a more or less ornate uniform and a greater variety of them to choose from.  That organisation created by the Constitution is created by the authority of the Irish people.  I would like, here, however, to repeat certain words I mentioned in another place, with a view to having them on record.  I said there whatever Constitution or organisation is established to act on behalf of the Irish people, acts under the authority conferred by them and in accordance with the specific bestowal of that authority and not otherwise&mdash;whatever person or power is named to act on their behalf and under the same authority in accordance with the specific bestowal of that authority and not otherwise.  The people conferred, of their own right, and what they conferred they may withdraw, and it is in that sense I vote for the insertion of this as an unfortunate necessity, and the adoption of the Clause.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gavan Duffy mentioned that the King was sprinkled all over the Constitution.  I may say I counted up the times that his name occurred, and I discovered it was nine times in the 79 Clauses, or it might be oftener&mdash;but I discovered nine times. I then looked at the document which bears the signature of Seoirse Gábhain Ui Dhubhthaigh, and I find the name mentioned eight times.  Perhaps the Hon. Deputy was in his pyjamas and did not read the Article before he signed it, but it is there at all events within eighteen Articles.  I think that disposes of the sprinkling.  We heard from a gentleman <Col N="774" /> on the benches on the opposite side some talk about Czardom.  The position in which we find ourselves on this Constitution is that of a co-equal member of the Community of Nations, of which the English Nation is one, and you get disadvantages, if you think them disadvantages, along with the advantages, if you think them advantages, of this association. This is one of them, as nominal head of the State there is a particular person mentioned, called by some His Majesty, by some the Crown, and by others The King, and so on.  And the position of the King is known to everybody in this country as very different indeed from Czardom.  This Constitution from beginning to end is certainly the most democratic Constitution in any country in the world at the present, and the mention of Crown in it, the limitations of the Crown are well-known to the Deputy who has spoken and to everybody else.  That is down in black and white. And if you think there are any other safeguards in the Dominions of the English Nation we can get them into this Constitution if you point them out.  We have heard about Republicans in this country for some months, and I put it to anybody in this Dáil or in Ireland, is there any comparison between the position of the Crown in this country and the position of the gentlemen who held up the white flag in the Four Courts a few months ago?  If that be Republicanism, then any armed bandit can throw up a flag and say this is Republicanism. I say the position of those under the Constitution is far superior to that of people who arm themselves and seize public property and adopt the antics of the Czar.</P>

      <P>It is up to me and the Party to which I belong to make our attitude on this matter clear.  There were no false issues at all so far as we are concerned.  We came out in the open.  There was not a platform we got on, there was not an utterance we made in which we did not say we stood for this Treaty.  If nobody else made it an issue, we made it an issue.  We asked for the support of the electorate on that issue, and we got it.  If Deputies stand up here and give very strong views on this Treaty&mdash;very strong views on this Constitution&mdash;I say here, because I know, they never made this Treaty or this Constitution question an issue at the elections.  As a matter of fact, the way they got about the question when it was asked&mdash;and it was asked five or six times at every meeting in my constituency: Were you for this Treaty or against it?  The question was never answered by them; they went round about evading the question, and they got no mandate whatever from the people to speak upon this question one way or the other. Can Deputy Gavan Duffy, or any other Deputy in this Dáil, assure us on his own initiative, or even with the Dáil behind him, that he is going to make this Treaty or Constitution better if we reject the Clause now?  Can he stand up and say &ldquo;I know I can make this Constitution better, the Treaty better&rdquo;?  Will he risk his reputation and say so?  Will anybody do so?  Why did not they go to London when the Constitution was up there? There was nothing to prevent them from doing this.  I have no objection to this King George Windsor, or George Guelph, whatever he is, as the nominal Head of this Nation, provided he conducts himself <Col N="776" /> properly.  If he conducts himself properly according to our Constitution, I see no more objection to George Windsor than I have to Erskine Childers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everybody in this country knows if the name of the King is in the Constitution, and if the name of the King is in the Treaty, it is not through choice, it is through necessity.  There is hardly an Irishman to-day but would have him out of the Treaty and out of the Constitution if we could, but are we able to put him out of the Constitution?  Let us come down to realities and face this question honestly.  My idea of it is, talk sense, talk actual facts.  How can we get the English out of this country?  I say there is no use in trying to humbug the country.  The country has given the answer on this question; they know they cannot beat the King out.  All this is camouflage and window dressing.  To use the expression of the President, it is only trying to cod the public.  I will just say this, that we have got a clear mandate on this question.  If we were satisfied that anything further could be got out of the Constitution we would vote for Deputy Gavan Duffy's Amendment, but we have no evidence that anything better can be got.  On the contrary, we think that the very last ounce has been squeezed out of it, and for that reason I support it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash; To insert the words &ldquo;sole and exclusive&rdquo; between the words &ldquo;The power.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask the Dáil to consider this Amendment as one of the highest importance. I trust the Ministry will either accept it or not make it a matter of confidence.  The object of this Amendment is to make it plain that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the Irish Free State is vested in the Irish Parliament.  I propose to add the words &ldquo;sole and exclusive&rdquo; and to quote one or two authorities which, I think, will be sufficient to show that we are absolutely entitled to insert these words.  I have here a quotation, first, from General Smuts.  He is not one of the people whom the Minister for Home Affairs describes as the left wing of the Dominions.  General Smuts, addressing the Parliament of the Union of South Africa, in September, 1919, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Constitutionally the Union Parliament is the legislative power for the Union, and the doctrine that the British Parliament is the sovereign legislative power for the Empire no longer holds good.  The British Parliament cannot, without the consent of the Union Parliament, pass any law binding South Africa, without a revolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Member interrupted: `Would it be legal?'</P>
      <P>&ldquo;General Smuts: `It is not a question of law.  It would be unconstitutional.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, this is a case where your law, practice and constitutional usage come in, and your constitutional usage blows the law to smithereens.  It <Col N="779" /> would be unconstitutional, and I want this Dáil to insert here that no other Parliament has any right to legislate for Ireland.  I am fortified in this not merely by General Smuts's dictum, which was re-echoed by Sir Robert Borden in Canada, but also, curiously enough, by a letter which appeared in the &ldquo;London Times,&rdquo; when the Constitution was first issued, from Professor Berriedale Keith, who is recognised to be the foremost authority on the Constitutions of the Dominions.  Not merely does Professor Keith sustain and, indeed, suggest the view I am putting forward, but he thought it necessary, although a true blue Briton and not an Irish Rebel, although a believer in the British Empire, he thought it necessary to go out of his way to write a letter to the &ldquo;London Times&rdquo; to point out this omission in the Irish Constitution; and that from a Briton.  Members have had a copy of this letter, circulated to them in print, as an appendix to the letter from Mr. Henry Harrison.  Let me remind the House of what Professor Keith says upon this subject:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Constitution vests legislative power in the Irish Parliament but it is ineffective, as it stands, to exclude the predominance of the Imperial Legislature and the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, which applies to all British possessions abroad, save where specially excluded.  It will be necessary (says Professor Keith) to confer sole and exclusive power upon the Irish Parliament.  The Imperial Parliament approving the Constitution will then operate as a renunciation of Imperial Legislative supremacy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have Professor Keith stating these words are necessary from the point of view, not of an Irishman, but as a believer in the British Empire, and stating that these words are necessary to prevent England asserting that she has a right to make laws that will override our laws.  If we do not put in these words, England will claim to rely upon the Act cited by Professor Keith&mdash;the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, from which I will quote one section, and I ask you to remember that that Act was passed before the British North America Act and before Australia and South Africa got their Constitutions.  It goes back to the dark ages, and we want to get rid of that <Col N="780" /> Act so as to make the law and practice clear and express the fact that we have the sole right to legislate for Ireland. That Act, when using the term colony, includes all British possessions abroad, having a legislature&mdash;and that is the word we are using here&mdash;and they will claim that we are a British possession. Section 2 goes as follows:&mdash;I am only quoting the material words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any Colonial law which shall be in any respect repugnant to the provision of any Act of Parliament (meaning British Act of Parliament) shall to the extent of such repugnancy (to the extent that it does not agree with the English Act), be and remain absolutely void and inoperative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, any English law intended to affect Ireland could under that Statute of 1865 overrule any Irish law. I have given you the authority of General Smuts and I could give you the authority of Sir Robert Borden, but I have not got the quotation here.  I have given you the express authority on the very wording of this very Constitution of Professor Berriedale Keith in the letter circulated to you, to show that we are absolutely entitled in our contract to put in here those very words, &ldquo;sole and exclusive.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With infinite respect both to Deputy Gavan Duffy and Professor Berriedale Keith I submit that Article 2 of the draft Constitution does limit the legislative power of Ireland to Ireland.  Article 2 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All powers of Government and all authority, legislative, executive, and judicial, are derived from the people, and the same shall be exercised in the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann through the organisations established by or under and in accord with this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Now the British Parliament is most certainly not an organisation &ldquo;established by or under and in accord with this Constitution,&rdquo; and further, I submit that in this very clause the definite article &ldquo;the&rdquo; before &ldquo;power&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the power&rdquo;&mdash;to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Irish Free State is vested in the Parliament, and I submit that that, to most minds, is sufficiently satisfying on the point raised by Deputy Gavan Duffy.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All citizens of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann, without distinction of sex, who have reached the age of twenty-one years and who comply with the provisions of the prevailing electoral laws, shall have the right <Col N="782" /> to vote for Members of the Chamber of Deputies/Dáil Eireann, and to take part in the Referendum or Initiative. All citizens of the Irish Free State/ Saorstát Eireann, without distinction of sex, who have reached the age of thirty years and who comply with the provisions of the prevailing electoral laws, shall have the right to vote for Members of the Senate/Seanad Eireann.  No voter may exercise more than one vote and the voting shall be by secret ballot.  The mode and place of exercising this right shall be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before you put that, in trying to get the course of the Article itself, I had not quite followed the purport of the first amendment that is down in the name of Deputy <Col N="783" /> Duffy, and which, I suggest, with all courtesy and deference to the Minister for Home Affairs, is accepted unnecessarily hastily.  If we turn to Article 78, it will be found to deal with transitional arrangements.  Transitional arrangements, obviously being transitional, do not affect the main body of the Constitution. Directly the transition has been completed, the provisions in which they are embodied cease to operate, and in the permanent body of the text there should be no reference to what is merely a transitional thing.  Therefore I do urge that those words, &ldquo;and subject to the provisions of Article 78,&rdquo; would seriously impair the character of this Constitution, by reference to conditions that are wholly past, and therefore are unnecessary and should not be included.</P>

      <P>Mr. Chairman, we heard a lot about the sovereign will of the people here for the last fortnight, and now there is a chance of giving the people the opportunity of registering their sovereign will, and therefore I think that the age of 21 years should qualify any voter to vote for a Member of the Senate.  If they have intelligence enough to vote for a Member of this Dáil, I don't see why they cannot vote for a Member of the Senate.  Therefore, I do not see why any restrictions should be put on the people of this country.  We have an opportunity now of showing we are democratic enough, and, goodness knows, as far as we went in this Constitution the people are tied up enough with the Articles we have already passed.  So, give them a chance of electing all the Members to both Houses, so that there would be some semblance of real democratic rule in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose that, not that I consider there is anything in the stand that we are taking, but because it is one of a number of agreements that were come to with the Southern Unionists, or the representatives of the people called &ldquo;Southern Unionists&rdquo;&mdash; between the late President and, I think, the Minister for Home Affairs.  We are <Col N="786" /> going to honour that as far as we are concerned.  The Dáil can do otherwise. We stand for it.  I stand for it, although I do not think there is much in it, and I do not think you are giving away much if you give away that.  I am positively convinced it would not result in making one single difference in any election that would take place for the Senate, and I think the statement made by the Deputy who has just spoken is not a fair statement, and it is that the people are tied up enough in this Constitution. Where are they tied up?  We are waiting here for the last week or fortnight to hear where is the democratic intrusion on the people's rights.  I have not heard it.  I would like to know one single line that interferes with the fullest expression of the most extended democratic thought in the country.  I want to make it perfectly clear to our own supporters in this Dáil&mdash;those who stood with us for the Treaty in the late Dáil&mdash;that I believe they are committed with us in this agreement&mdash;they are bound by the late President's agreement. The rest of the Dáil is perfectly free to do as it likes; but I put it to them that this man, occupying his position and speaking on behalf of the nation&mdash;his compact ought to be kept.  You are not giving much.  The difference will not be considerable, and it will not affect one single seat in that Senate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor W. MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>As one perfectly free in this matter I beg to support the President.  There is a very excellent reason suggested in the speech of the Deputy who introduced the question. There is a psychological reason for the difference in the age qualification.  It is this; that if people are not allowed to vote for the Upper Chamber, as it is sometimes termed, they will feel deprived of something and so they will value it.  Now, we are to create the belief that the Second Chamber has a value, that it is a respectable thing.  If you put obstacles in the way of electing candidates to this Cooling Chamber the people will regard it as a respectable thing.  One should have attained middle age in order to have the privilege of voting for it.  It seems to me instead of the age being 30 it ought to be 45 or 50 years.</P>

      <P>The great objection we have to this differentiation is <Col N="787" /> that it appears to be an attempt to make the Second Chamber a superior chamber, wiser, because older people select them. That is the objection.  We are quite prepared to recognise the anxiety of the gentlemen and ladies&mdash;I am sure there are many of them will be ladies&mdash;who desire protection of this kind.  But we are not going to flout the promises that were made.  We must record our protest against this attempt to make differentiation between one House of Parliament and the other, on the basis of the constituents.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest that as long as the machinery does not impose any value on the Senate, and it is quite clear that it does not, a slight generosity of this kind won't affect the issue.  I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy that recently in a very democratic country in Europe universal sufferage was adopted, and when recently making observations with reference to universal franchise that it was for everybody over 25.  I don't think it affects the issue very much, and I think it ought not to be pressed.</P>

      <P>I think a notice of motion by the Minister for Defence is of sufficient importance to be read now.</P>
      <P>The Clerk of the House read the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whereas the Government has entrusted to the Army the duty of securing the public safety and restoring order throughout the country, and has placed on the Army the responsibility for the establishment of the authority of the Government in all parts of the country in which that authority is challenged by force:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And Whereas the Army authorities have represented to the Government that in order to discharge effectively the duty and responsibility so placed on them it is essential that the Army authorities should have power to establish Military Courts or Committees, with full powers of enquiring into charges and inflicting punishment on persons found guilty of acts calculated to interfere with or delay the effective establishment of the authority of the Government, and that the Army authorities should have <Col N="791" /> power to detain in places whether within or without the area of the jurisdiction of the Government persons arrested by the Army authorities, and power to control the dealing in and possession of firearms:</P>
    <P>And Whereas the Government, recognising the force of such representation, has sanctioned the doing by the Army authorities of all or any of the following matters and things:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>  The setting up of Military Courts or Committees for the enquiring into charges against persons in respect of any of the offences hereinafter mentioned, provided however that every such Military Court or Committee shall include as a member thereof at least one person nominated by the Minister of Defence and certified by the Law Officer to be a person of legal knowledge and experience;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  The enquiry of such Military Courts or Committees into the cases of persons charged with any of the offences following, that is to say:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(I.)  Taking part in or aiding and abetting any attack upon or using force against the National Forces;</P>
    <P>(II.)  Looting, arson, destruction, seizure, unlawful possession, or removal of or damage to any public or private property;</P>
    <P>(III.)  Having possession without proper authority of any bomb or article in the nature of a bomb, or any dynamite, gelignite, or other explosive substance, or any revolver, rifle, gun, or other <Col N="792" /> firearm or lethal weapon, or any ammunition for any such firearm;</P>
    <P>(IV.)  The breach of any general order or regulation made by the Army authorities;</P>
    <P>and the infliction by such Military Courts or Committees of the punishment of death, or of imprisonment for any period, or of a fine of any amount either with or without imprisonment, on any person found guilty by any such Court or Committee of any of the offences aforesaid;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>  The removal by Army authorities of all or any person taken prisoner, arrested, or detained by the National forces to any place or places, whether within or without the area of jurisdiction of the Government, and the detention or imprisonment of any such persons in any place or places within or without the area aforesaid;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d)</i>  The regulation and control of the sale, possession, transfer of, and dealing in revolvers, rifles, guns, and other firearms:</P>
    <P>Now, this Dáil, being of opinion that the doing by the Army authorities of the several matters aforesaid is a matter of military necessity, doth hereby ratify and approve of the sanction given by the Government, and of the doing by the Army authorities of all or any of the acts and matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>Motion: &ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn,&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.35.</P>
