      <P>To ask the President what department of the present Government, if any, is charged with the responsibility of looking after the interests of members of the I.R.A. who were wounded or disabled during the period prior to the Truce of July, 1921; further, whether his attention has been called to the case of Lieutenant Michael Dolan, Cappatagle, Ballinasloe, who was severely wounded during the taking of the R.I.C. Barracks, at Aughrim, Co. Galway, in July, 1920, and is still disabled, and whether he will consider the advisability of making immediate arrangements so that this Volunteer Officer may have proper provision made for suitable medical treatment.</P>

      <P>The question of providing compensation for people who have suffered injuries at the hands of the British forces in the late war is at present under consideration by the Government, and it is hoped to make an announcement on the subject at an early date.  I have ascertained that as a temporary measure pending the settlement of compensation in the case of Lieutenant Michael Dolan, the White Cross Association has already undertaken to bring him to Dublin for suitable medical treatment, and to provide for him during convalescence.  The Association is ready and most anxious to assist him.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that in the Salary Agreement, No. A. 82, <Col N="1816" /> of November 29th, 1920, provision for new Scales of Salaries for National Teachers, and signed by the Civil Service Arbitration Board, the Representatives of the British Treasury, the Commissioners of National Education, and the Teachers' Organisation, a clause occurs under Section IX. as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The question of awarding a bonus to teachers in the first division of first class shall be held over for consideration by the Commissioners, who will make a suitable recommendation to the Treasury on the subject.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whether he is further aware that the Commissioners of National Education, after fully considering the matter, made the required recommendation to the Treasury early in 1921; that, in accordance with such recommendation, teachers having these special qualifications were to receive an annual bonus of £20 and £10 respectively, according as their services were regarded as &ldquo;Highly Efficient or Efficient,&rdquo; whether the question of the payment of this bonus was not still under consideration at the time of the transfer of British Government Departments in 1922, and whether his Department, as the successors of the British Treasury, will now carry out the terms of the agreement signed by the British Treasury Representative, and have these bonuses paid forthwith, together with arrears accruing to date.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance&mdash;<i>(a)</i> To state what exactly are the terms offered to Civil Servants under the Treaty, and wherein they differ from the terms set forth in the 8th Schedule of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920?  <i>(b)</i> In Departments such as the Intermediate Education Board, where officials hold directly from the <Col N="1817" /> Board, does the incorporation of the Board in the Ministry automatically abolish the positions held by such officials, and if so, if such officials are not entitled to be given a choice between compulsory retirement and the acceptance of a similar or equivalent post elsewhere? <i>(c)</i> In such cases do the provisions of the British Commutation of Pensions Act apply?  If not, what is to take its place?  And in either case how many years' purchase is to be allowed according to length of service?  <i>(d)</i> Has the Government power to postpone such retirements; and, if so, for how long?  <i>(e)</i> What proportion does the Cost of Living Bonus bear towards the estimation of pension?  <i>(f)</i> What exactly is the meaning of the sentence, &ldquo;On what basis is compensation claimed?&rdquo; in the form supplied to claimants by the Civil Service Committee?</P>

      <P>Any Civil Servant who is discharged or who retires in consequence of the change of Government is entitled, under Article 10 of the Treaty, to compensation on terms not less favourable than accorded in the Act of 1920.  As already announced in the Dáil, the Government has set up a Committee, consisting of two official representatives and two representatives of the Staff, with an impartial Chairman, to advise as to the compensation payable and all matters connected therewith, and I must decline to prejudice the proceedings of that Committee by making any statement of the Government's views on matters yet to be decided by the Committee. Questions <i>(b)</i> and <i>(d)</i> belong to this category.  As regards question <i>(c)</i>, the Pensions Commutation Acts apply to any pensions that may be awarded under Article 10 of the Treaty, but I must point out that under those Acts commutation is not a right of the pensioner, the power to commute being a discretionary matter for the Ministry of Finance.  Commutation of pension is an actuarial problem into which length of service does not enter.  As regards question <i>(e)</i>, the Committee has already advised that bonus should be treated for compensation pensions in the same way as for ordinary pensions.  As regards question <i>(f)</i>, I understand that the question on the form is directed to ascertain whether compensation is claimed in respect of retirement or in respect of discharge.</P>

It is open to any farmer to claim relief by notifying the Inspector of Taxes and proving that the profits from farming fell short of the amount assessed.  As regards the year 1922-23, the basis of assessment has already been reduced by half.</P>

      <P>The Government do not find it possible to make provision in the Civic Guard for men who resigned from the Royal Irish Constabulary during the Anglo-Irish war, and who are now over the age of 27 years.  As indicated in my reply to a question addressed to me on the 10th instant by Deputy Risteard Mac Fheorais, a Committee is being set up to investigate what particular ex-R.I.C. men are entitled to compensation in accordance with the Government's policy as outlined by me in that reply.  A register will be compiled for the purposes of such Committee, but it is not the Government's intention to make any special arrangements for securing employment for these ex-R.I.C. men.  When the compensation contemplated has been granted, the Government's duty as regards these men will be discharged.  The Government is anxious that they, in common with all other unemployed men, should receive suitable employment, but it is unable to see why there should be any special discrimination in their favour once they have been compensated.</P>

We acted on it to the advantage to the country. We did not ask where it came from, or whether we were quite sure it was right?  We acted on it implicitly, and it is to be regretted that when certain members of the R.I.C. were admitted into the Civic Guard with his endorsement that there was not the same implicit acceptance on his endorsement. It is to be regretted that there was trouble in the Civic Guard over this question, as the Deputy is well aware, and I do not regard it as part of my responsibility to risk any further trouble over that particular question.</P>

      <P>The new Electoral Law will be devised for the purpose of giving effect to the franchise resolutions of the 19th September last.  It will deal with the necessary consequential adaptation and codification of the existing law, which is at present contained in a series of British Acts.  The re-arrangement of constituencies and rules for the carrying out of elections conformably to the constitution will also be dealt with.  These matters are mostly noncontroversial, but in the necessary drafting, care will be taken to consult the views of those whose experience of elections is likely to be of assistance, and there will be ample opportunity in the Dáil for the discussion of all alterations proposed.  It is not considered that a Commission is required for the foregoing purposes, and it might cause needless delay.  At a later stage when the jurisdiction of the various new Courts will have been settled the question of corrupt and illegal practices at elections will be dealt with in special legislation, and it is recognised that it will be necessary to avail of a Commission to advise as to the important issues which will be involved in dealing with that branch of the law.</P>

      <P>Under the Unemployment Insurance <Col N="1825" /> Acts applicants for uncovenanted benefit, that is to say, benefit not supported by the qualifying number of contributions, are required to show that they are normally employed in an insurable occupation.

It is necessary to refer to the local office for particulars of the case of Simon Halpin, and I will communicate with the Deputy as soon as the particulars are received.</P>

But in this connection it should be understood that every facility is given to an applicant for unemployment benefit by the Employment Exchange to establish his claim before it is disallowed, and that it is only in a very small percentage of cases that any reasonable ground can exist for a further appeal to the Court of Referees. Where such an appeal succeeds expenses are allowed.</P>

      <P>It is the fact that considerable numbers of railwaymen lost their employment owing to interference with the railways in the South and South-west.  But at the suggestion of the men, arrangements have been made to employ a substantial proportion of them on the work of repairing and maintaining the lines, and in this way, and by the improvement in traffic which is expected to result, the position will be greatly eased.  The payment of unemployment benefit to workers not within the scope of the Insurance Scheme is a proposal which the Government could not accept.  I anticipate that it will be possible to place the reports of the Railway Commission on the table of the House in the course of next week with a view to an early discussion.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that National troops stationed at Gort attended at Ballinamanton House, Gort, on September 5th, and evicted therefrom Mr. Denis McCarthy, an employee of the Department of Agriculture, and gave possession to a neighbouring farmer, although an appeal against the ejectment decree given in the District Court was then pending; will he say if such action by the troops was in accordance with Army Regulations, or on what authority they acted; is he aware that when the matter was reported to the O.C., Galway, orders were given to the effect that McCarthy should be reinstated, that troops brought McCarthy to the house on September 8th, but failed to carry out the reinstatement or dispossess the other party because of certain threats alleged to have been used by the latter; if it is true that the officer that carried out the eviction insisted on the payment by McCarthy of £8 15s. alleged to be due for rent, and has since refused to return same, and whether it is proposed to compensate McCarthy for disturbance and for the damage caused to his furniture by the action of the military.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of the Battalion Police Officer, National troops stationed at Gort carried out this eviction on 6th September.  The officer in charge was unaware that there was an appeal against the ejectment decree, and he did not receive the amount of £8 15s. from McCarthy.  This action by the troops was not in accordance with Army Regulations.  It is the result of the tradition of days that we have not yet got very far away from, that the Army has to do everything.  The attitude of the Army Authorities in these matters for some time past is that if decrees cannot be executed without the assistance of the Army in this way, the fact must be faced that there will be delay in the execution of decrees.  When the General Officer commanding the area was made aware of the facts he instructed that McCarthy be reinstated, and McCarthy was brought back to the house on September 8th.  He could not secure peaceable repossession for McCarthy, <Col N="1828" /> and in the general circumstances of the case he considered it inadvisable to interfere further.  I have no knowledge of any damage done or of any claim for compensation.</P>

    <P>It will be remembered that last week not this resolution, but another similar one, was discussed fairly and fully, and there was no decision arrived at.  It may be just as well to state that since then the particular parties concerned, I think, have been satisfied with the actual wording of this resolution.  It is framed in such a way that if the Dáil decides, it can get to work immediately. It is not defined how the Committee should be constituted, but, of course, if any Member has a suggestion as to how it should be constituted I would be glad to meet him and to discuss the situation with him.  There is no doubt about it that there is a very exaggerated view abroad of the profiteering that is going on.  It is, to my mind, going on to a very large extent, but not exactly as was pointed out in the Dáil by some of the Deputies.  This, at any rate, will give us the opportunity of finding out exactly what profiteering is going on and where it is going on.  This will be confined to the commodities as specified in the Official Report of the Cost of Living.  It may be argued, of course, that it should go outside particular commodities, but I think it is just as well, at least for the present, that we should confine it to such commodities as really make up the everyday foodstuffs that are used by the ordinary population.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to support the proposal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce although undoubtedly the form does preclude all enquiry into the basis of a standard of living, that is to say, an enquiry into what should constitute a standard for reasonable existence in a civilised community. I recognise, however, that such an enquiry should follow a different course from the particular enquiry that is referred to, and would have to be undertaken by a different Commission.  I hope such a Commission will be set up.  There will have to be a Commission or Committee of experts, assisted by men who have some understanding of what civilisation means.  But, in the meantime, I think that this particular Committee that is suggested will help to probe the present evil that is complained of, of high prices; to find out where the difference arises between wholesale prices and retail prices, the manufacturers' prices and the retail prices, the growers' prices and the prices to the consumer.  I hope it will be possible to do this locally as well as nationally, and that the local Committees that are suggested will be small, compact and active, with a chairman who is not likely to be affected by local influences.  I think it might be possible to appoint the same chairman for perhaps half a dozen committees. That is a matter for consideration.  I believe that it will be necessary to have a central Commission to prevent overlapping so that when we find an article which is distributed from centres, such as, say, sugar, there may not be half-a-dozen overlapping enquiries, but one single enquiry from the body having authority, and I think the essential matter in this is that the body that is going to make the enquiry will have the power to probe deep and fearlessly into the existing position. I beg to support the proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this question some time ago, and the Minister did me the courtesy of showing me this resolution beforehand.  I think it does fully meet the purpose, although at the same time, I recognise it is more restricted than the purpose I had in my original proposition.  It will be all the better for that restriction, perhaps.  For the matters entered into are subjects of greater contention, subjects that need not be confused with this immediate purpose that it is the intention of the resolution to achieve.  That there is something amiss, I think, must be apparent to everybody.  As I said on a previous occasion, and I would like to take the opportunity of repeating it here <Col N="1835" /> now, it is not a question of charging anybody with profiteering.  It would be very easy to affix the blame, and it would be most unjust to do so.  It is rather a question of discovering where the manifest discrepancy appears, whether it is an actual question of profiteering by the middleman, or whether it is a question of high freights, or of any of these things.  What exactly is the cause of the discrepancy? To start off an enquiry of this kind, which is eminently judicial in its nature, by distributing blame beforehand, would be not only unjust in itself, but it would be against the efficiency of any enquiry of this kind.  That there is a very considerable discrepancy is apparent to everybody. I was rather interested in certain figures that were given here the other day by Deputy Sir James Craig.  He mentioned the very humble matter of cabbages, of which he saw a large field so near as Castleknock being turned over to cattle and sheep rather than being sent in for human consumption, because the price would not pay the cost of growth and cartage.  I have since got, and it is a matter of some interest, the actual figures, which have been compiled for me by a competent collector in that matter, and they are very startling.  The actual price in respect of that commodity at the present moment, wholesale, is 12s. a load of 55 dozen.  The actual retail price at the present moment is relatively 3d. or 4d. per head, which comes to about £10 per load.  It is so everywhere, and it is quite clear that there must be some enquiry into this matter and other relative matters if we are to adjust some misfit in the economic machinery.  I hope that a Commission of this kind, set up of a few persons, would achieve its purpose and would bring about a very considerable benefit for the consuming population of this country.  It is a very remarkable fact that Ireland, which is the producer of the raw material, if it may so be called, of all industries, inasmuch as Ireland is the producer of foodstuffs, should, nevertheless, be the place where these selfsame foodstuffs cost more than they cost in other countries, although Ireland is, and perhaps because Ireland is, an exporting country in respect of such commodities. With regard to the resolution itself, I am in agreement, as I have said, with the general purport of it and with the general machinery which it embodies. <Col N="1836" /> When I first read it I did not notice a discrepancy, or an apparent discrepancy, to which I call the attention of the Minister now.  In the Fourth Article it says: &ldquo;And this Dáil doth order that any person having knowledge of the subject-matter of any such inquiry shall, if so required by a Commission on Prices or by a Committee thereof, furnish to the Commission or Committee such particulars relating thereto as the Commission or Committee may think fit.&rdquo;  The procedure evidently dealt with in that paragraph is, wherever a local Committee is appointed, that it shall be either by or under the authority of the Central Commission. But if you turn to an earlier paragraph, it says that the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall appoint a Commission, to be known as the Commission on Prices, and may appoint in any place or district a Committee of the said Commission.  I assume that to mean&mdash;and perhaps the Minister will confirm or correct me as the case may be &mdash;that the Committee will be nominated by the Commission and created actually by a minute of the Minister, but that neither the Minister nor any other body will appoint a local Committee without the authority of the Central Commission. I think that is a matter of some importance, if the two are not to be working independently of one another, and if there is not to be possibly even friction, but, in any case, a certain loss of efficiency between the central body and the local body.  I hope, whoever is to be appointed either on the Commission or whoever the Commission may appoint as Committees of itself to make these local enquiries will be such persons as Deputy Johnson has referred to, that is to say, they will be persons who will not be concerned, rightly or wrongly, in the sale of the articles in question, and who, therefore, rightly or wrongly&mdash;and I am not pre-judging it now&mdash;would be parties who may be called upon to be judges where there may be some person who might think that they would be more rightly in the dock than on the bench. I believe that local Committees will be necessary, but I would like to feel sure&mdash; I think it is the intention of the resolution, but there is a certain doubt about it&mdash;that the local Committees will be set up by the Commission, and will report to the Commission in order that the enquiries made by the local Committees <Col N="1837" /> might be co-ordinated by the Central Commission, and in order that the report finally made by the Central Commission may be able to bring together all the local inquiries which itself caused to be made so that its work will be conducted not only on its own independent inquiries, but with inquiries of the Committees on a national basis, because if this inquiry is worth making here, as proposed, it should be made not in a local sense, but it should be made in a fully national sense.</P>

      <P>I am not going to cover to-day the ground which I covered the other evening.  I am very pleased, indeed, that this Commission is going to be appointed.  I expressed my doubts on the last occasion, and I still express my doubts that the Ministry will be able to do very much in the matter. However, it is some satisfaction to know that they are willing to try.  Two or three things have cropped up since the matter was discussed last week.  One matter that has been impressed upon me by almost everybody who has spoken to me on the subject is that unless the price of porter and stout is brought down the price of labour will not be reduced. I have been told quite seriously by seriously-minded people that if the working man can get his pint of porter at a decent price he will not object to his wages being reduced, but so long as he is compelled, or asked to pay, one shilling a pint for porter, and if he consumes three or four pints in the day, the amount of money spent at the end of the week will be so great that it will be utterly impossible for the wages to be brought down.  I want to say that I think there is a tremendous lessening of moral fibre in the country.  I am sorry to say it.  I suppose we all have suffered from the effects of the war, and our moral fibres are generally personally lessened.  May I give one small example of what I consider to be a very decided lessening of the moral sense.  A lady went to a very high-class grocers' establishment where she had been dealing for a very long time.  She was buying tea at 2s. 4d. per lb.  She said, &ldquo;I am not going to buy your tea any longer at 2s. 4d. per lb.  I am told by a friend that tea at 2s. per lb. can be bought at such a place, and that it is equally as good.&rdquo; The manager whispered to her after a few <Col N="1838" /> moments, &ldquo;Miss, we will give you 2s. 4d. tea at 2s. per lb.&rdquo;  There are only two explanations of that.  Either he had no business to be charging for tea 2s. 4d. per lb., or else he was giving an inferior tea.  I want to ask the Minister if I may, what exactly is meant by the recommendations in the third paragraph. He says here: &ldquo;In any case in which prices, costs, or profits are, in the opinion of the Commission, or of any Committee thereof, unreasonable, to make such recommendations as the Commission or Committee may think fit.&rdquo;  Are those recommendations to be made to the consumer? For instance, I mentioned on the last occasion that milk is 8d. per quart, and that, in my opinion, the only way to reduce the price would be by way of a strike&mdash;not to take milk.  Is the recommendation of the Committee to be of such a nature as to say to the people the only way they will be able to reduce the price of the commodity they are purchasing is by such a thing as a strike? Or are these recommendations to be made to the Minister, who will present this report to the Dáil?  The reason I asked about the recommendations is, because I see later on in the motion, &ldquo;The report of any Committee of the Commission on Prices shall be made to the Commission, and the report or reports, as the case may be, of the Commission shall be made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who shall as soon as may be lay the same before this Dáil.&rdquo;  I want to know if there is any difference between the reports that are to be made by these Committees or by the Commission? What is mentioned here is recommendations. I say again we will watch with very great interest the work of this Commission, and there is no doubt, if it is found that the work is useful, it may be very much extended in other directions.</P>

      <P>I may say I am in thorough agreement with the proposal put forward by the Minister, and I do hope when this Commission gets to work <Col N="1839" /> it will probe this very thorny question to the very bottom, because, while there may be certain classes of people charging exorbitant prices for the articles they sell, I am sure this Dáil does not brand every trader throughout the country as being a profiteer.  I do know that there are, in several towns, and, perhaps, cities, of Ireland a great many decent, respectable traders who charge only a reasonable profit on the wares they sell, or the food they sell, and if there are such people who do trade on what may be called the innocence of the public&mdash; if there is such a thing&mdash;I will be glad to see these people punished as they deserve.  But before this Commission comes to a conclusion I do not think it is fair to prejudge in this Dáil any class of people forming the inhabitants of this country.  As I say, I welcome the Commission, and I am sure if it does its work it will settle, at least for the time, the thorny question as to whether the traders of this country are the people some people think they are.  I heard a lot said about cabbages.  One would think it was the only thing this Commission was to look after, and whether some people are vegetarians or not, I do not know.  At the same time, I know myself, from my knowledge, and, perhaps, from practical experience that there are a number of people in the country &mdash;farmers and others&mdash;who sow considerable quantities of cabbage, not for sale as human food at all, but as cattle food.  I think the farmer should have liberty to do anything he likes with his crop.  Cabbages in certain areas and districts are a great part of the food given to cattle, both in the winter and in the summer seasons, so I think there is not very much in the argument put forward that three or four acres of cabbage have been given to cattle.  It should not be taken as a basis that this man could not market his cabbage in Dublin or anywhere else.  I welcome this Commission, and I hope it will put an end, for the time being, to this controversy.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this motion, because it is one of the most necessary that has yet been put before this Dáil.  One remark made by Deputy Sir James Craig, I, as a Labour man, completely differ with.  I did not mind, as far as I am concerned, if the cost of porter or other liquor went up to £1 a pint, neither do my supporters, because <Col N="1840" /> we in the Labour movement hope that the Members in this Dáil are not suffering under the foolish idea simply that if the price of porter came down, wages would come down with it.  Nothing of the kind.  We are quite satisfied that when the cost of living comes down, say, to the pre-war scale, wages must still remain at least 50 per cent. over the pre-war scale, as we hold that labour in Ireland was never paid.  A good deal has been said about milk.  Some day last week Deputy Sir James Craig made it very clear about milk, which is one of the most necessary items of food, especially for children.  Another Deputy contradicted and said he could supply milk at 4d. a quart, and had done so in the city.  Now I have made enquiries myself in the city during the past week and I cannot find that milk is on sale anywhere for 4d. a quart.  But still in a certain part of County Galway milk can be sold at 2½d. a quart, but we cannot get it here, as the retailers who retail the milk in the towns certainly are profiteering.  I sincerely hope the remark of Deputy Gorey will be fully understood and that the enquiry into the cost of living will mean clothing and housing as well.  I will be also very pleased when the Government sets up the Committee if they will send us&mdash;at least to my constituency&mdash;a lot of these 5s. 2d. houses we heard about a few weeks ago.  It is very very hard to sit here and listen to an honourable Deputy making statements about liquor, more or less, as if this Dáil was under the opinion, I think, by the remarks of the Deputy that the workingman lives for nothing else but drink.  I completely differ with him.  The workingman is interested in the education and clothing of his family, and by having this Committee working in each town I am sure this Committee will be enabling him to do so.  For that simple reason I support the motion and I wish it God speed. The sooner it comes the better we like it.</P>

      <P>There is just one question I would like to draw attention to.  It is this, and I know it is covered in the third paragraph which deals with the question of distribution. There are certain articles mentioned in the first paragraph, contingent with the cost of living, but there is no mention at all of one very essential commodity&mdash;<Col N="1841" /> that is, petrol; and I would mention another thing&mdash;tyres.  At the present time petrol in England is sold at 2s. a gallon. Petrol in Ireland costs 2s. 4d. a gallon. Dunlop tyres in England are sold at the same price as they are sold in Ireland. Petrol comes, as far as I understand, and I have not any technical knowledge, from America, but I certainly do not see why petrol should be 4d. a gallon dearer in Ireland than it is in England.  Why I lay emphasis on the matter of petrol is that I would like to bring it before the Minister and have it embodied in the specified items into which he will inquire, as at the present time&mdash;owing to the breaking down of the railways and lack of communication&mdash;food supplies have to be conveyed by motor, and I therefore think petrol is certainly a very important question and that there should be a very minute enquiry into why the cost of petrol is 4d. a gallon dearer in Ireland than it is in England.</P>

I think the most essential thing in connection with this Commission is that the Minister should see to it that the work of the Commission is put in hand immediately and speeded up as quickly as possible, so that he may be able to bring his recommendations before the Dáil at the earliest possible date.  While the Commission is proceeding with its work we cannot overlook the fact that a number of unemployed will be starving, and whatever goes on at the Commission, or whatever evidence is given at it, will not bring down prices.  I hope, therefore, when the Minister brings his recommendations before the Dáil, that he will devise at the same time some kind of legislation for the purpose of enforcing the regulations which the Dáil will undoubtedly sanction.</P>

      <P>I desire to support this motion.  I think it is a very desirable one, and as a trader I welcome it.  There has been a great deal of loose talk about profiteering.  There is undoubtedly profiteering going on, and it <Col N="1842" /> is not confined to one particular class of the community; it is spread over nearly every class in the community that has anything to sell, or has even a wage to earn.  I would draw attention to one particular item, and I hope it is included in the enquiry.  Before the war this particular item was sold at one halfpenny per copy.  I refer to a daily paper that has an immense circulation in this country.  There is a charge of twopence being now made for it, although the war is over some two or three years.  The same applies in other cases.  I hope that Ministers' salaries will be investigated and that professors' salaries will be inquired into.  All these things should be taken into account; the trader should not be made the exception, while those other gentlemen are let off with their immense salaries.  The Commission might also pay attention to the farmer who buys a horse, and who should sell it at a reasonable profit, and not be holding out for 100 or 500 per cent. profit.  I hope these things will be all inquired into, and that the distributor will not be the only person who will be victimised in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. GAFFNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support the motion.  I would like, when this Commission is set up, that some effort should be made to set up in different towns local Committees something on the scale of the Committees of a few years ago.  These would be able to give advice to the Commission, which could then deal with the whole of Ireland.  Heretofore in some places these Committees did achieve good work.  In certain places there was active opposition to them, and the Committees did not succeed as well as they might have. Again, there was a great lack of public co-operation.  People did not come forward and give particulars of where they had been overcharged.  I acted on several Committees of this kind, and I always found it was very hard to get people to come forward and give particulars of how they were over-charged; even though they would tell it to people outside, they would not give the particulars to the Committee.  Of course, unless somebody came forward with a complaint, the case could not be dealt with.  Touching upon the remark about petrol, quite recently I was speaking to some people engaged in the motor trade, and they referred to <Col N="1843" /> the exorbitant charge in the way of tax that has been made on Ford motor cars, compared with other types of car, such as the Lancia.  The difference was £9 or £10 or £15.  The Ford car is a cheaper car, and is more available to the ordinary class of people than cars of other build. It has been suggested that the tax would be put on petrol instead of on the cars. This fourpence, which is the difference between the cost in Ireland and England, is due to the fact that the petrol is shipped to London, and that fourpence goes to the parties there.  If the petrol were shipped to Ireland, that fourpence would come to the Irish Exchequer, or, at any rate, it would come in some way to the benefit of the Irish people.  I would like that as the Commission proceeds, and deals with the cost of living, housing, clothing, etc., it would touch upon other matters not included in the list, and that as a result of the Commission, legislation will be enacted whereby fair play can be dealt all round, and that it will not be within the possibility of any section to deal unfairly with another section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some questions asked in the course of the debate, to which I will now reply.  Deputy Figgis dealt with local Committees. The local Committees will be appointed by me, but in consultation with the Commission. The last paragraph of this resolution provides for reports of the local committees to be made to the Commission. That will effect the necessary coordination. Deputy Sir James Craig wanted to know if the recommendations were to be made to traders.  The recommendations referred to will only be made to this Dáil.  Deputy Gorey asked if food, clothing and rents will be included. They will.  I do not know if Deputy Nicholls was here when I was speaking, but I think I mentioned the fact that this resolution referred only to the commodities specified in the official report on the cost of living. I think we must confine it to that because it is the most essential thing at the moment.  I am afraid we will have to set up another Commission to inquire into the question of petrol and tyres, and, perhaps, Ministers' salaries, later on.  Deputy Davin mentioned that the very fact of inquiring into profiteering will not reduce the cost of living.  That is so; but still I feel that <Col N="1844" /> the very fact that we move at all in the matter will bring down prices all round. There is no reason why the Commission should wait to report on the full proceedings. If, as they go along, they find glaring cases of profiteering, they will naturally report to me, and I will in turn report to the Dáil immediately, so that the Dáil can take whatever steps are considered necessary.  Deputy Gaffney referred to the shyness of the people.  I know for myself that the Profiteering Committees in existence before found it very hard to get people to give particulars. The people looked on the matter as if it would be informing.  If they do not give the support necessary our efforts will be all for naught.  In Dublin you will find in one street the same article selling at 40 and 50 per cent. more at one end of the street than at the other. To a very great extent it is all the people's fault that such a thing does happen; all the legislation in the world will not affect it, and if the people do not give the support that is necessary I am afraid there will be a great deal of labour for nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WM. O'BRIEN Mr. WM. O'BRIEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. O'BRIEN</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion I submit is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;That, with a view to the prevention of corrupt practices during the election of members of the Legislature and of local governing bodies, and in connection with the appointment of officials under public boards, it is desirable that a Committee should be set up without delay, charged with the duty of devising the best practicable measures to prevent such corrupt practices.&rdquo;  This motion is designed to deal with evils with which all Members <Col N="1845" /> of the Dáil are more or less familiar, and it is primarily intended to deal with the basic corrupt practice of impersonation at elections.  Now this question of personation has existed as long as I am familiar with elections and, of course, a great deal longer.  But it has increased very much in recent years.  That increase is due to a number of reasons. The Register has been increased, the area consequent on the adoption of the Proportional Representation system has increased, and there are other causes. Up to four years ago personation, although it existed and was deplored, was within a measure that could be grappled with.  We read about it and a certain amount of organisation and machinery was capable of curtailing it within certain limits.  But since about 1918 this evil has grown until at a recent election it increased to an extent that was never witnessed or dreamt of in the past.  At the local elections of 1920 there was a very noticeable increase, and at the Poor Law Elections, six months later, there was a much greater increase.  At the recent Parliamentary elections, especially in the City of Dublin, it went beyond all former dimensions.  In fact some of the older hands who were familiar with how it was done in the past turned green with envy when they witnessed the facility with which it was being performed.  I think it would be fairly safe to say that if personation existed in the past to an extent of 5 or 10 per cent. it would be an outside figure, but I am prepared to submit evidence that in one constituency with which I happened to be connected personation existed to the extent of 60 to 75 per cent. of the votes for a particular candidate.  Deputies may not believe all that, but I now bring it forward as a solemn fact that can be supported by evidence.  In the old days it required a certain amount of skill, knowledge, organisation and preliminary enquiry to carry out personation.  All that thing was thrown to the wind recently.  Certain machinery used to be set up to ascertain whether a voter was likely to record his vote or not, to see whether a person was dead or in hospital, and that information proved very useful to the skilled operators on the day of the Poll. But recently that was all brushed aside and mass voting without reference to <Col N="1846" /> any of these preliminary enquiries became popular.  We are all familiar in industry with the cases where things that used to be produced by skilled craftsmen or artists are now made by mechanical contrivances which were invented to replace them, and in these or other respects it was natural that craftsmen should give way to the machines. That, of course, is the humorous aspect of it, but this thing is very serious and goes to the very foundation of our public life.  The public bodies elected by this method administer very important functions and deal with large amounts of funds and patronage, and with the ordinary activities of our daily life that affect all citizens, and, unless adequate steps be taken to deal with this thing, other corrupt practices will, and do, necessarily flow from it.  One of my colleagues would, had he been here to-day, have told you of a remarkable incident that happened in his constituency down the country.  As he is not here I will repeat it.  One would suppose that the maximum of impersonation of votes recorded would be 100 per cent. of the Register, but in the instance he gives 100 per cent., plus two, voted in a particular district.  A number of voters came in, and subsequently there was a large influx, and the Presiding Officer was compelled, at the point of the revolver, to fill the ballot papers for every name on the Register, and thus the Register was polled with 100 per cent. plus two votes. That was not unique, and a remarkable thing about it was, that notwithstanding the fact that this personation was rife there was not a single arrest in Dublin, or any other part of the country.  That showed that no attempt was made to stop those corrupt practices, and I would urge the Ministry that some adequate steps should be taken to deal with this evil.  When we come to deal with the actual proposals, there will, of course, be differences of opinion.  These corrupt practices are more prevalent in large centres of population like Dublin than in country parts, because in large towns it is difficult to know the individual voters.  Where there would be large numbers of well-organised political parties with ample time to make preparation, that could be checked.  That state of affairs did not prevail in the last election, and if public life is to have any meaning at all, this will have to be <Col N="1847" /> dealt with before the next election.  In Dublin, for example, the form in which the election register is compiled has a great deal to do with it.  Streets are arranged alphabetically.  The result is that two or three or four streets may be grouped together at a particular polling station, and there may be a great difference in location between these streets, and the one personation agent can have no knowledge of all the voters in these particular streets.  I would urge that the Ministry should consider this matter carefully, and see what adequate steps they can take, in conjunction with the Electoral Bill which they propose introducing, to deal with the changes consequent upon adult suffrage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I agree entirely with all that has been said by Deputy O'Brien.  In the last election the extent to which personation was carried out was an absolute scandal, and was in some cases so bad as to make the election something in the nature of a farce.  I do not think that there was anywhere so little personation that it was not in the nature of a scandal, and the presence of a 100 per cent. poll in particular districts, with the Register stale, and where a large number of the electors must have been dead and gone, was enough to show the value of such a poll.  In one case I knew, 100 per cent. polled, and there was the coincidence that every paper in the box had its No. 1 for the same candidate, which showed the peculiar unanimity of the people in that district dead and alive.  The principal corrupt practice is, undoubtedly, personation, and, I think, it is so important that a Committee should be set up to devise the best means of dealing with the matter. There have been other suggestions made &mdash;one was made to me&mdash;with a view to dealing with that particular difficulty, but the machinery was so cumbersome and complex that the proposition could not be adopted, and it is because of the difficulty of getting some scheme of check that will be ample, but will not hold up the smooth running of elections, that it is necessary that the matter should be thrashed out by a committee of people of large and varied experience before it is brought before this Dáil at all.  One of the principal defects that Deputy O'Brien suggested, in connection with the form of the Dublin Register, <Col N="1848" /> is undoubtedly the way in which streets, from different ends of the Ward, have been brought together at one polling station, and that has led to a lot of difficulty in detecting personation.  Even in the Register now being compiled we are trying to arrange for the division of Wards into areas, so that streets in the one area may fall into one polling booth. That is a difficulty we are trying to rectify already.  The resolution deals with another matter, which is, perhaps, not in the same category; that is corrupt practices in connection with the appointment of officials to public boards.  It seems to me that that particular form of corrupt practice&mdash;and, of course we know there is a great deal of corrupt practice&mdash;is of a kind that is in a different category from the corrupt practice in connection with the elections to the Dáil, and the Senate, and Local Government bodies, and it might be as well it should be dealt with separately.  It may be some little time before we come to deal with the Local Government legislation that will be necessary on the abolition of the workhouses, and the setting up of County Homes, and that will necessitate besides, other reforms overdue in Local Government legislation. That, perhaps, will not come just immediately, or just so soon as the Electoral Laws.  It may be better, in regard to any change as to officials to local bodies and safeguards to prevent corruption, that they should be considered at the time when we are bringing before the Dáil legislation in connection with Local Government, and I think it would be better if the resolution were altered so that a Committee could be set up which would deal only with the corrupt practices in connection with elections to this Legislature and to local bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the suggestion of the Minister in regard to the appointment of officials on public boards, and the practice which leads to the selection of one person in preference to another, and I admit there is some distinction between the two cases cited, and perhaps, if so desired, Deputy O'Brien will be prepared to eliminate that particular phrase from this resolution on the understanding that the Minister himself would use all the powers that he has&mdash; and I think they are very considerable in such matters&mdash;to prevent the buying of <Col N="1849" /> posts.  We know, as a matter of fact, and everybody who knows the country knows it, that where there is a possible vacancy, say, for a dispensary doctor, some young man with a father who has plenty of money, or who can borrow plenty of money, really bribes the Guardians for the appointment in question. I think it would be possible to obviate a good deal of that if there was an understanding that appointments in the districts should be offered to seniors within that particular area who have had a number of years' experience, provided there is no reason against the appointment of the seniors.  The senior should have the option of taking the better appointment, rather than that a new man should be able to come in and get that particular vacancy by purchase.  Now, this question of purchase is, of course, a condemnation of the Guardians and others who will be purchasable, just as much as it is of the purchaser, and I think there ought to be very drastic steps taken, when any suggestion comes to the ears of the local authority that there has been a purchasing of appointments, and that the culprit in such a matter should be punished very severely. Now, coming again to the question of personation and corrupt practices at elections, the evil, unfortunately, is not only with the personators.  We know very well that public officials have been parties to this evil wholesale.  Public officials have been appointed as presiding officers and returning officers, and have actually gone out of their way to fill the ballot-boxes with papers filled up by themselves. This is even more grievous than the crime, as it is a crime and offence, of a voter himself or herself, and I want to emphasise the femininity of this particular offence.  It is probably exaggerated to a degree almost inconceivable by the willingness of women to act as personators.  I think the process takes something like this course: a little timid urging to go in and vote as a &ldquo;duty to the cause&rdquo;; a vote for somebody whom they know to be on their side.  That is found so easy that they try again, and again, and again, and then they delight in the prospect of being able to poll 20, 30, or 40 votes per day! This has a very serious moral effect, and I believe the evil is not so much that the person elected is not the free choice of the electors, <Col N="1850" /> but that the electors themselves have lost all sense of the value of their civic rights, duties, and responsibilities. There cannot be a proper civic spirit developed when this cheapening of the ballot is extended through the country as it has been in the last few years. It is a sport; who can do best and poll the most votes; and I think, if we are all frank and honest, as we might well be now, neither of the last two parliamentary elections gave any indication of the will of the people.  The supposed 1918 election was not an election which decided that the people wanted a Republic. The 1922 election did not indicate the will of the people at all in these public matters, and but for the fact that there was other evidence of the will of the people, but for the fact that there was other evidence, outside the ballot, of the will of the people, nobody could, say what the will of the people was upon these particular momentous matters. It is hypocrisy to refer to the elections as a test of the will of the people.  There are other methods of testing the will of the people, not formal methods, but obvious methods, and that is the only evidence that is of any value in testing whether the people of Ireland were supporters of the Republic, or whether the people of Ireland were supporters of the Treaty, but the elections were a farce and utterly useless as any test upon these questions. I suggest that such a Committee as may be appointed may well consider that there should be something in the way of citizenship papers issued to every citizen which might be producible under a proper signature, and photograph or other mark before a person would be entitled to the use of the vote.  But, whatever method is adopted it is essential in my opinion that it should take place before the next election, and that we should not have any qualms about drastic measures, even though those measures limit the poll.  I believe it would be well even to demand that there should be personal application to go on the Register before any person is put upon the Register.  I think we should aim at making the exercise of the vote as something akin to a religious rite. Because it might be made the most important item in a man's life with regard to his civic activities.  And I think we should rather try to elevate this exercise <Col N="1851" /> of civic rights.  I am glad to know that the Minister has readily accepted the proposition, and I have little doubt that at his request the mover of the resolution, Deputy William O'Brien, will agree to the deletion of that particular clause on the understanding that the Minister will use all the influence and powers of his department to prevent corruption in the making of appointments.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this matter, believing that some Deputy would mention one aspect of this question that I judge to be of very considerable importance. Deputy Johnson, my colleague in the representation of the County Dublin, came very near to it; and I desire to take this opportunity to make specific and clear mention of one of the most important parts of this very important subject, and it is this:&mdash;Following the recent election I had occasion to speak with certain persons of electoral knowledge in different countries, knowledge that I used in drafting a certain Bill, which I thought would meet this matter, but which did not get so far as the First Reading.  This Bill did embody the experiences of several countries, by reason of the fact that there were certain people from these countries present in this country at the time, who had knowledge of the methods by which this abuse could be rectified.  I was told by one of those gentlemen that in certain European countries, Norway was mentioned and the Scandinavian countries were specified, a citizen would as soon think of committing a crime of the nature of theft as he would think of personation. It is only when that attitude of mind is produced in a people that this will finally be met.  The only way, therefore, I believe, in which it can be stopped is by treating personation as a crime.  There are people in this country of the devoutest faith who would be reluctant to thieve or lie, but who, never-the less, will go in with the utmost cheerfulness to thieve or lie when they get inside a polling booth.  The only way in which this matter can be adequately met, and in which it has been met in <Col N="1852" /> other countries, is by treating the person who steals somebody else's vote exactly in the same way as if they stole somebody else's watch and chain.  If that can be done, and those are the lines in which it can be done, you would be able to destroy what, unfortunately, in this country is a habit.  I am willing to put in evidence, before any Committee that may be appointed, that in a recent election personators came up drilled to a certain polling booth, thirty or forty at the time, and marched in drilled, and registered their votes drilled, and that when a certain person who was acting for one of the candidates made an objection to this rather flagrant method of conducting this business, the objector was told that it was a recognised part of the game. Unfortunately, that is the attitude adopted towards it&mdash;that it is a recognised part of the game, and is so regarded, and is not regarded as what it is in absolute fact, and that is a crime.  It is a crime by which the only substance on which democracy can rest is endangered. The wells of democracy, if they be defiled, will corrupt the whole national life, and until that is cleaned&mdash;and it can only be cleaned by inculcating a right attitude towards it&mdash;we will get legislators elected to meet here, or elsewhere, that will have no right or authority to legislate, inasmuch as they will hold no right or authority from the people whom they are presumed to represent.  It was a very remarkable thing in the recent elections that a certain type of candidate on his first count got a certain measure of votes and never got any further.  In the distribution of the surplus votes he never advanced beyond that point.  And when Deputy O'Brien said that he was willing to put in evidence that a certain candidate in a certain Dublin constituency got votes, 60 per cent of which were personated votes, I venture to say that if the political party of that candidate were to be discovered&mdash;I am not inquiring who it is, though I can make a very shrewd guess&mdash;if the co-adherents of that candidate throughout the country were taken, it would be found that the average number of votes that they got everywhere throughout the whole country, that well over 50 per cent. of those votes would be personated votes.  I am entirely in favour of this, and the only reason I rise to speak on it is that I desire to say if we are going to deal with this <Col N="1853" /> matter we must deal with it as a crime, and make it a criminal process, and not in the least hestitate to punish it as a crime.</P>

      <P>One would think from the Deputies who have spoken that personation is a monopoly of Dublin. Now, coming from the country, I can assure you that it is not.  We have had our hands in the game up to the elbow, and perhaps a little bit further.  I know something about personation, unfortunately. I have listened to Deputy O'Brien and the rest talking about what they heard.  I will not talk about what I heard.  I will talk about a little I know.  I have seen men voting that were dead ten years, and men who were dead two years and six months; men who were here in Dublin in hospital voting down in Kilkenny, but not at the last election.  I have no complaint, or very little, to find with the last election, because I believe it was an honest record of the votes, except as regards a small section&mdash;perhaps one hundred or one hundred and fifty&mdash; and the votes were polled by a certain section of the community who were in a minority.  The result was that Kilkenny gave a clear vote as to what they and Ireland thought.  I have had experience of elections both in the Local Government and for the Dáil, and it is a question whether the local Councils or the Deputies represent the dead or the living.  I think some of the Deputies should be classified as representing Glasnevin.  I am very glad to see that we are going to change all that.  Neither the 1918 Dáil nor the 1921 Dáil was a correct record, so far as the voting is concerned.  The recent election, where the bully with the gun obtained, was not a fair election, and the biggest offenders we have got, I regret to say, are the ladies.  They do not look on it as a crime at all.  They look on it as a fine art.  Really it is well done when you come to see how they do it; and unless you adopt Deputy Figgis's suggestion and make it a criminal offence and punish it as a crime, it will continue. Prevention is no good.  I know presiding officers who personally would do nothing wrong, but I have seen them not exercising their authority and allowing people to vote who were not entitled to vote.  They said it was not the presiding officer's business to challenge any vote except it was brought to his notice by the personating agent.  It should be mandatory <Col N="1854" /> on any official to exercise his knowledge and punish crime, whether it was brought to his notice or not.  I do not know that there is anything else to be said about it, but if you want the names of the people I saw personating dead men, I can give them to you.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters I would like to mention in this connection.  It has been stated that the Returning Officers, or persons employed on the day of the poll were guilty of some offences against what is known as the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Acts. I think it is the bounden duty of anyone who has any such information against any person so employed to acquaint the Minister for Local Government with the names of these persons, so that, under no conceivable circumstances will these persons be again employed in positions of responsibility such as that.  There have been cases during my term of office&mdash;there has certainly been one case during my term of office as Minister for Local Government&mdash;of interference with members of a local authority attending to do their duty as members of a local authority when an election took place. That is not, I believe, within the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Acts as they are at present constituted, but it is in essence a corrupt act.  It might not be a corrupt act according to the law, but it is corrupt, and there is no provision whatever in the law as it stands at present to prevent a person going to a Returning Officer and presenting a nomination paper to him.  Cases occurred in the last election where it was alleged at least that there was interference and obstruction, and I believe something equivalent to an arrest was made of a person who intended to present a nomination paper. but was headed off by the other side.  That should also be included. I believe it should be the duty of the Returning Officer seeing a person coming into the booth to vote on more than one occasion to refuse that person a ballot paper.  I think Deputy Gorey will bear me out with regard to Presiding Officers at the election, that they either fail to appreciate the responsibility of their office, or they carry it out in such a slovenly way as really to prejudice the result of the election.  Hundreds of papers that were actually, so far as electors were concerned, perfect votes, were rendered invalid by reason <Col N="1855" /> of the fact that the Presiding Officer did not put the stamp on which he is required to put on each paper before it is handed out.  There is not much use in criticising the last election.  A good many of us were not present at the 1918 election, and we are not in a position to speak about it.  The last election was held under abnormal circumstances at a time when the ordinary law, and respect for the ordinary law or for common order, was not very well pronounced.  There were no peace officers functioning throughout the country, and it was well known that party feeling ran very high, and the ordinary peace officer has got a wholesome respect for guns.  I expect he may have thought that guns might be used.  In this matter it is not really what regulations are imposed or what Acts of Parliament are passed.  It comes down to this, that there must be common support from all sections of the community to make any Act of Parliament, or any regulation you may make of this kind, operative and effective.  Something is needed in this matter to arouse the civic conscience. Personation, I believe, is unknown in other countries.  It would be too great a crime against civics, and the people are too patriotic to offend against any such code of honour&mdash;and it ought to be a code of honour.  Now, it would have been impossible in the late election to have preserved that position as we would like to have seen it preserved, and it is only by the strongest possible co-operation by every section of the community we can have this thing recognised as a crime.  It is a crime at the present moment, and it is punishable as a crime.  People have been punished in the last ten years for attempting personation, and we know that in the last election such laws were practically inoperative. I do not agree with Deputy Johnson that the onus should be placed on individuals to have their names registered, and I do not agree with it because my experience is to the contrary.  Up to seven or eight years ago I took some interest in registration, and I found that, while people were particularly anxious to have votes on the day of the poll, they had no such anxiety a month or two previous, when the time came for putting their names down to be qualified to vote. If you place the onus on them, you will find that there will be a very small register, <Col N="1856" /> and that it will not represent the general body of the public.  Having regard to the fact that we levy rates and taxes on the public, they are entitled at least to this service that their names should be entered on the Register of Voters.  It may be possible&mdash;I do not know about the next election&mdash;to get some sort of civic distinction for each citizen, which should be presented at the time of voting, but I think that within six or eight or ten months it would be scarcely possible to do that.  In the meantime there ought to be a Press campaign, and the aid of the Church ought to be sought, and the aid of every political organisation in the country ought to be invited in order to get the civic conscience aroused to bring it home to the people that it is a question of honour, and that it is their honour that is impugned if personation takes place.</P>

      <P>We have heard from all sides of the Dáil a very painful history of the depths of political depravity to which our people have sunk.  I am no believer in machinery for making people good.  I do believe in compulsory education, I do believe in the compulsory subjection of all so-called educators, to conform to a standard which shall be sufficient to secure their capacity for such important work as they undertake.  Behind all that machinery there must be some other force of a far more vital kind.  Now, you may pass all the acts of Parliament that you can contrive with all your legislative skill, and you will not get rid of this evil, until you begin to rear up a population of Irishmen and women who will have a different attitude altogether towards their public duties from that which prevails in the present generation.  No one has spoken here of the need of reform in educational matters and, after all, that is the root.  The mal-education or the neglect of the education of the people is the root of nearly all the evil of which we have to complain.  For many years I tried to bring pressure on the Intermediate Education Board to include this great subject of Civics in its curriculum; to make it a compulsory subject in all the schools, and at one period the Intermediate Board was so impressed with the necessity of this that I was asked to draw up a programme, but, by a snatch vote, as I understand, at a later period, the thing was withdrawn, <Col N="1857" /> and the vote was rescinded.  I have laboured for years and years to have it made a subject for instruction for teachers in the Training Colleges.  The programme issued under the new regime in this and the following years at last contains a very admirable course in Civics.  There are few people in Ireland who have the slightest opportunity for understanding the needs and the duties of citizenship, which was never included in the moral teaching they received. It was really withheld from the public; it was never allowed to be a subject in the school books.  Years ago, if I may be pardoned for the egotism of giving what I did as an example, I introduced into reading books for children in the National schools certain lessons dealing with laws and institutions, in order that they might understand why there are laws, and why there are institutions of government, and the moral that was intended to be conveyed was that these were sacred things, that they were practically divine institutions, and that it is the duty of everyone with a proper enlightened sense of patriotism, to do for his country everything when the opportunity for doing it came his way.  And these lessons were impugned. Some of them were expunged from the books on the grounds that these lessons were Socialism.  Now, that is the kind of educational deficiency that our country has been suffering from for a long time.  It was always possible to introduce poems into books where one could thank God that He had made him a happy British child, but the duty of the child to his nation and to his community, his sense of civic pride, were never cultivated. It was not allowed.  Lessons directed towards that were looked upon with suspicion as being seditious, and were disapproved of by the educational authorities because they seemed to lead to sedition.  You were allowed to glorify William Tell if you liked; you were allowed to recount the glories of Robert Bruce if you liked; but you should remain silent about every Irishman that the Irish people held in reverence.  You should draw no lessons from his sacrifices and from his devotion to his country's need. The result was that through this educational system the people were hardly allowed to realise that they had a country and that their country was entitled to make demands upon them by way of <Col N="1858" /> service, so that the only side of life in which they were allowed to become cognisant of it was through the activities of politics, and from that kind of malignant influence and malignant conditions that prevailed it became necessary for the people not merely to evade the laws, but to break the laws, and we are the inheritors to-day of all of that evil tradition that laws were made to be broken, and that electioneering is part of a public amusement, or some sort of a game in which a man who can get the best of his opponent is the best practitioner.  Now, I would suggest that this is a matter quite as much for the Minister for Education as it is for the Minister for Local Government.  It seems to me that we ought to realise that the great bar to getting Acts of Parliament which shall be passed hereafter in the next Dáil and in successive Dáils&mdash;the great bar to secure the proper spirit of obedience will be the want of understanding of the people of how they stand related to the Institutions of Government.  We have lost the habit of obedience.  The country will have to undergo a new discipline.  Every child should be required to go through a proper course, with the same care with which he is put through a course of religious instruction, with regard to civics; and what is more, I would hold that in the framing of electoral laws we should see to it that before any citizen is allowed to have a vote he must have had sufficient schooling and have passed a satisfactory test with regard to Civics and that he ought to know what he is doing, that he is not going blindly through some ritual, or not doing something which he is ordered to do by a political boss, but that he is discharging a duty to the country with a full sense of the responsibility that it involves.  These are reforms for future legislation, I shall be told.  And if the working of reforms through education is too slow, and meanwhile there must be a penalty, then let the penalty be to deprive the offender of citizenship for so many years.  That makes the punishment fit the crime.  To personate is a denial of the claims of citizenship, and those who deliberately and consciously violate citizenship, in this fashion, should be deprived of citizenship for a number of years, so as to bring home to them what the nature of the criminality is, and also to open their eyes as to what their duty is.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion of Deputy O'Brien.  I believe the sooner this Committee is got together the better.  I do not share the views of the President, that it would not be possible to do anything within the next eight or ten months.  I believe if such a Committee were set up immediately that something could be done, and that the result of it would be that these corrupt practices, at any rate, would be brought down considerably. During the last election there were many cases, in various parts of the country, but not so much as in the 1918 election. I would say it was well noted, and well known that in certain areas in the last election, where a particular candidate got most of the preferences, and where the Presiding Officers were not of the same way of thinking as the candidate who got the most preferences, whether it was done deliberately or not, the papers remained unstamped.  In that connection I suffered very much in some areas in my constituency; perhaps the same thing may apply all round.</P>

      <P>But I could afford a few.  I believe in connection with this matter of appointment of officials on public boards, though this is not relevant to the motion, a good deal could be done if, for those positions, competitive examinations were to be the deciding factor in the future, and that canvassing was done away with.  Canvassing, to my mind, in many places through the country, has had very evil effects. It has had the effect of placing people in positions they were not fitted for, and it led to other causes which could have been combated had those positions gone by competitive examinations at the beginning. So much has been said in connection with this matter, that for me to speak on it now would only mean going over the ground that has already been covered, but I would say that there are many points in which this matter of voting could be decided. <Col N="1860" /> There is the question of each person going to the poll having his photograph, with his signature or finger-prints, or there may be other means devised. However, with a small Committee, some system can be devised whereby this could be done away with, to a still greater extent than at present.  As regards the matter of personal application to be put on the Register, for a few years I had to deal a little with this, and I know if it were to be left to the individual to have his name put on the Register, the Register for the various Constituencies in Ireland would be at least 75 per cent. less than what it is at present.  I would say that it should be the duty of the local Rate Collector, or whoever has to do with it at present, to see that those who are qualified to have a vote are on the Register, until such time as we hope there will be sufficient civic responsibility that people will realise that it is their duty to have their names on the Register, and not be complaining when they find their names do not appear when it comes to the day of the poll.  I would strongly urge that this matter be taken up immediately, and that any assistance it is possible to give in the matter will be given, and that for the future, at any rate, we will not have a repetition of the evils which confronted us at the last couple of elections, or at least in the election of 1918, when, as my co-Deputy remarked, people who had been dead for years were voted for by young people.  I might say, in that respect, they were voted for by men and boys more than by ladies. I do not believe that all the vice rests with the ladies in that respect.</P>

      <P>The motion I have to move reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas, the existence of large numbers of unemployed men and women in rural and urban areas is a grievous social and economic loss to the Commonwealth and constitutes a danger to the State, it is the opinion <Col N="1861" /> of the Dáil that Ministers should without delay lay before the Dáil any plans they have prepared for dealing with the problem in the event of either</P>
    <P>(1)  a peaceful issue of the present strife at an early date, or</P>
    <P>(2)  a continuance of armed opposition to the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I consider, A Chinn Comhairle, that a duty lies with Ministers to explain to the Dáil what is in their mind, what are they proposing to do to deal with this problem of unemployment, in either of these two positions they may be placed in?  It may be said we cannot do anything in the present circumstances, or we can do very little until we know what is our financial position, what is our military position, what is our political position?  But I submit, it is necessary, before the winter comes upon us, that we should know what is in the mind of the Government, whether there is peace, or whether there is to be a continuance of warfare?  A couple of days ago, the Minister for Education said something about the rights of the parent being superior to the rights of the State; that the parent did not exist for the State, or the citizen did not exist for the State.  That the State existed for the citizen.  I subscribe to that doctrine to the full.  &ldquo;The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack,&rdquo; and while it is true that the citizen does not exist for the State&mdash; the parent does not exist for the State&mdash; the contrary is true; the State exists for the citizen.  One is the complement of the other, and the citizen would not be a citizen, unless there were a community in which he could live and of which he forms a part.  But I want that doctrine applied generally.  I want the Ministers and Members of the Dáil, and the public, to bear in mind always that the welfare of the citizen is the end of all these political and economic activities, and that we must not think of the citizen, the workman, as something that is available for promoting the prosperity of the country, as some item that might be used for the promotion of trade and commerce; but that trade and commerce and civic rights that we have been talking about, all exist for the promotion of the well-being of the citizen.  If we have that in mind, we will see the necessity of making provision for the well-being of <Col N="1862" /> that citizen, and that the economic arrangements shall be so directed as to ensure that the citizen shall have the opportunity to make the best use of his abilities, his strength of mind and body, his experience, to help to build up the Commonwealth.  It was well to hear the Minister for Education indicate that in his view the State existed to promote the well-being of the citizen, because coming from one who has been to the forefront in promoting the idea of Nationality it shows that in his mind, at any rate, the ideas that surround this notion of the Nation are all associated with the well-being of the individual, and the counterpart of that idea in politics is the idea of collectivism in ecomics. I am not one of those who want to spread the idea of collectivism or the idea of Nationalism, to such an extent as to make collectivism appear pure State Socialism, or Nationalism or Nationality, or pure jingoism.  There is a place for both, but we must always bear in mind the object ultimately is the production of good citizens, bright-eyed, happy-hearted human beings.  This may seem a little bit apart from the resolution, but I want to submit it is not at all apart from the resolution, and if you subscribe to the doctrine I am trying to suggest, that you must make a deliberate and direct attempt to save this mass of the people from the contamination that results from unemployment, from the deterioration, the demoralisation that unemployment entails.  Therefore, it is the direct duty of Ministers to devise plans for dealing with this problem forthwith and lay their plans before the Dáil and before the country, so that we may know there is something afoot, and that Ministers are not relegating this problem to the chances of commercial speculation, but that they are deliberately contriving to so order the communal life as to ensure that men, women, and children shall be able to live as decent citizens.  I want to suggest, too, that this country knows something of the problems that surround the land question, and land-hunger, the desire to have sufficient land to ensure a livelihood and to ensure security.  I believe that the ultimate impulse, that accounts for this land hunger, is the desire for security; for a feeling that, at any rate, whether a man requires my services or not, whether I <Col N="1863" /> am going to be employed by others or not, I am always going to be secure for food, because I have the land that I can grow sufficient food upon.  That, I contend, is the urge that has led men in this country, and has led men in most countries, to desire sufficient land to maintain themselves.  I think our purpose in the communal life should be to ensure also that the security the community gives should be available for the man who is not a land worker; and that if we can provide the working-class citizen with this security, with the feeling that at any rate, so long as he is willing to give his services, he will at least be guaranteed the opportunity for a decent livelihood, with the sense of security which the community ought to give to the individual, we would solve very many problems, and incidentally would remove many of the difficulties that critics of trade unionism apply to trade unionism. The real reason for these difficulties lies in the absence of security, the feeling that men must protect their opportunities for future employment.  I want to impress upon Ministers that they have a duty to bring forward to the Dáil their plans&mdash;if they have plans&mdash;and to confess that they have no plans, if they have no plans, for dealing with unemployment during this coming winter. The only indication we have had up to now, that there was any thinking about the future in this respect, has been from the Minister for Defence.  Evidently in his mind, or in the mind of his advisers, there has developed the idea of using military men for constructive work. Now, it is possible to develop that idea wisely, but it is very dangerous to utilise the military machine, as a military machine, within the civil organisation. I do not want to develop any criticism on that line just now.  I want to utter this warning: that it will lead to disaster if the Minister for Defence is going to develop certain ideas in regard to employment of unemployed men, and the Minister for Agriculture is to develop another idea to the same purpose, and the Minister for Economic Affairs, or Industry and Commerce is to work upon a different line.  It is essential that whatever is done, or whatever is thought, about these problems ought to be co-related and co-ordinated, and should be part of a general plan, and there should <Col N="1864" /> not only be co-operation of the various departments, but that those who are able to speak for the organised workers in the various industries should also be brought into consultation, to discuss, and, if possible, arrive at, common agreement in regard to these problems. I do not know what the latest figures are; I suppose the official figures of the number of registered unemployed men and women would be round about 50,000 in these 26 Counties.  There are, perhaps, 20,000 more who are not registered. One cannot arrive at an exact figure, but there are certainly many thousands of unemployed men and women throughout the country who are not registered, and of whom there is no account.  I want to suggest two or three lines upon which Ministers might set their minds working. Perhaps when they come to reply, they will show us that they have already been working on these particular lines.  There are hints, of course, that afforestation is under consideration.  I hope it has gone past the stage of suggestion and has come to the stage of almost practical application.  There is a particular suggestion that I want to make, and emphasise, in regard to urban workers more particularly.  It is that the Technical Schools&mdash;the machinery of the Technical Schools&mdash;ought to be utilised for the training and improving in the technique and the craftsmanship of a particular workman, or the training in elementary forms, perhaps in newer industries and occupations of people who are receiving unemployed benefit.  I believe it would be an economic act, and a social benefit, if the unemployed pay were increased, conditional upon certain hours in the week being given to training in Technical Schools on technical work.  This might be said to apply more particularly to women workers, and it would be a very good thing for the women and for the community if there was some attempt at training in many domestic activities, of the recipients of unemployed benefit.  The demoralisation that goes along with unemployment pay, and no work of any kind, is a positive loss to the community.  It would be a positive benefit if there was a duty attached to the receipt of these unemployment benefits.  I submit it would be well for Ministers to look ahead a little bit and to consider the value that would be <Col N="1865" /> gained from some added technical training as a condition of receiving the increased unemployment pay.  I believe, I am sure, it is desirable and necessary that the unemployment pay should be very greatly increased, and along with that increase, there should be provided an opportunity for the training of the faculties of the recipient for doing practical work of a socially productive character.  We know the problem of housing, and it is no use dealing with that at this moment, but there is one aspect of public work that might be taken in hand by Ministers, and that is to urge upon local authorities and upon private employers, perhaps with the aid of the Nation's credit, such as it is, to promote regularisation of employment, to look ahead and consider what the prospects are for employment in a particular trade, and if we have exceptional slackness now and a certain demand for particular work to be done in a year's time, we ought to encourage that work to be done now instead of waiting for the year to pass.  There is certain work which is normally done in the summer that could just as well be done, at perhaps a little extra cost, in the winter time.  You have trades like painting where there is an immense amount of overtime work in the summer, and a general universal slackness in the winter.  Very much of that work can be done in the winter time if a deliberate attempt is made to regularise that seasonal work.  I think the Local Government Department and the Ministry for Industry could do a good deal in that direction in quite a number of trades. They are attempting to organise the purchases of local governing bodies.  It is possible to look ahead and to say that certain Institutions will undoubtedly require so many thousand articles of a particular class next August.  We are hoping that there will be an improvement in trade by next August, and we ought to be willing to bank upon that faith, and to say &ldquo;these things that you require next August can be ordered now, and we will take some risk as a State; we will take some risk to support you in the ordering of these goods at this particular time, when things are slack, and so promote the regularisation of Industry and the relief of the unemployed.&rdquo;  I have no doubt much stress will be laid upon financial <Col N="1866" /> difficulties, and I am going to risk making a suggestion which may be proved to be utterly fallacious and impossible.  But I would like it to be proved impossible, before I believe it is impossible.  I want to suggest to the Minister for Finance that a good deal could be done to promote general employment in the country if in the payment of public funds to men in the Army and in the public services, and more particularly if they are thinking, as I hope they will, of increasing unemployment pay, to make that increase, or at any rate a proportion of it, only cashable in the purchase of Irish-manufactured goods.  My proposition is that the Ministry should consider the issue of some form of Treasury Note&mdash; some form of cheque or bank order&mdash;or whatever form it may take.  Small sums in such orders, cheques or Treasury Notes, will only be cashable by the bank&mdash;I hope it will be a National or a State Bank, as it ought to be&mdash;on presentation by a manufacturer, on a panel, who subscribes to certain conditions with regard to the use of Irish manufactured articles, as well as the employment of labour under fair Trade Union conditions.  I believe that such a process, as I am hinting at, might possibly add to the cost and might possibly limit the purchasing power to some extent. I believe it would be so small a reduction in its purchasing power, and would have such immense effect, that it would give such a fillip to the production of goods, with consequent necessary employment of Irish Labour, as to be worthy of the increased cost, and the increased cost would very soon be eliminated.  I throw that out as a suggestion; I think it is worth analysing and considering.  I want the Ministers to tell us what plans they have made, in view of the possibility of continued strife and warfare, and what plans they have made in view of the possibility of an early peace?  It is no use relying entirely upon the prospects that, given peace, all kinds of private enterprise would be set going, and everything would be blooming and beautiful.  That has not been the experience of other countries after peace. We have got to look ahead, and to look ahead in view of various possibilities.  I want to submit that this problem of unemployment will have to be dealt with in a dozen different ways, and if the Government is prepared to deal with it, <Col N="1867" /> and deal with it boldly, that it will have considerable effect in bringing about that peace which we all desire.  I beg to propose the motion.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion, and I would like to impress upon the Ministry the grave necessity for taking immediate action in this particular case of giving employment. Now we, in the country, know that there are some County Boards of Health whose funds are being rapidly exhausted through giving relief to families of working men during last summer. How are we going to face the winter if the Government does not come forward with some scheme whereby the men will be employed?  It is all very fine to say that the Government has no funds to meet this matter, but I say the Government should pluck up courage and get the money to give employment.  Our people should not be allowed to starve, and it is the first duty of a Government to see that its people do not starve.  I have known cases in my own county of men who were falling against the walls of their cottages with the hunger, and yet they were too proud to come and ask for help.  It is our duty to help them, and the Government, if they realise their responsibility, ought to promote schemes and get to work at once.</P>

      <P>I beg to support this motion, and, in doing so, would like to call the attention of the Dáil to the fact that the motion only asks the Ministers to lay before the Dáil any plans they may have prepared for dealing with the problem of unemployment. We have heard from Ministers recently statements to the effect that they have not any money to spare, and they lay down certain reasons for that.  We are willing to believe that, but though they may not have one penny piece to spend now, or for the next five months, that is no reason why they should not let us and the country know what they intend to do when they are in a position to spend money.  There was some talk during the last few weeks, of unemployment and irregularism, and Deputy Figgis suggested that the irregularism was largely caused by unemployment.  I quite agree with Deputy Figgis on that particular remark, and I know myself that there are lots of men in the ranks of the Irregulars in parts of Southern Ireland who have had no opportunity of working, <Col N="1868" /> for the past eighteen months or two years, and have no chance now of getting a job if they come back to civil life. The very fact, that they knew&mdash;by the Government laying their plans on the table&mdash;that they would have in a short time an opportunity to work and earn their living in the ordinary way, would tend to make them give up the business they are at, at the present, and come back to civil life.  But, so long as they realise that there is nothing for them to do but to walk around the streets, idle, without any opportunity of getting the right to work and live, these young men are inclined to remain where they are. Unemployment, or the lack of any plans to demolish unemployment, are certainly causes of the continuance of the opposition to the Government at the present day.  I do not think it is necessary to talk about the details of unemployment for, as Deputy Johnson mentioned, the figure was somewhere about 50,000.  I have had three or four letters on it for the past week from different parts of the County Cork.  Just before I stood up I got one from Aghada, and each of these letters suggested that the Dáil should do something to get employment for the out-of-work men in these districts. It is practically the same all over the County Cork, and so it is with every small town and every rural district which has got its quota of unemployed men, and some of these people are not quite as keen in striving to bring about a state of peace in the country as they should be.  Three or four weeks ago I think it was the President or, at any rate, one other of the Ministers suggested that the civilian population were lacking a great deal in moral courage, and that if the civil population did not actually help the Irregulars at least they refrained from helping the National Forces.  In my opinion those of the civil population who are unemployed have had very little encouragement to take an active interest in either side.  They have remained simply passive.  If they do not help the Irregulars they do not help the National Forces, because they have come to the conclusion that as they are out of a job with no means of livelihood it matters little to them whether the war lasts a week, a month, or twelve months.  In my opinion it would be no longer possible for any Minister to accuse the people of a certain lack of moral courage if the <Col N="1869" /> people realised that the Government had some plans to put before the country to provide work and to enable them to live, I think even if the plans were laid before the country, although at the moment it was impossible to put them into operation, it would give an incitement to the people to put an end to the strife that is unfortunately going on, and it would give a certain amount of encouragement in the direction of bringing the present civil war to a conclusion. Therefore I support the motion moved by Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion which has been moved.  We heard a Deputy speak about unemployment grants, but what is wanted is really work.  In the County Wicklow we have a vast amount of unemployment and the employers and workers have held meetings to endeavour to devise schemes to provide employment. A deputation came to the Minister for Agriculture some weeks ago and they were promised 400 acres of land in Wicklow upon which to plant trees.  Up to the present not one man has found employment under that scheme.  We had numerous applications from men who are willing to work, but were unable to gain employment.  The County Council was trying to get work for the men on the road but they were unable to secure the money from the Government.  Schemes had been considered by the County Council and they were prepared to assist the Government by every means in their power to put some scheme into operation which would diminish the evil of unemployment.  We in Wicklow are in a unique position to provide employment.  We have there our lead mines and silver mines which have been closed down, and these if they were worked would absorb the whole of the unemployment in the county.  The Fishing Industry is at a standstill at the moment.  The fishermen have had a very bad time, some of them were unable to secure their dinners in the last month.  We ask the Government to try and relieve this awful distress in our county and in all other parts of Ireland as well.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a pity if this matter should only be urged as it has been urged with such power from the Labour benches, <Col N="1870" /> because the matter appeals in every aspect to this Dáil and in every respect to the National life represented in this Dáil.  I said before, and I am perfectly convinced now, that but for unemployment what is known as the Military situation would long ago have been got under.  We are told by the President to-day that the Military situation is very well in hand.  I am delighted to be assured of it in spite of appearances to the contrary.  But I do feel convinced of this, that there is at the present moment a problem which is called a Military problem that is not primarily or fundamentally a Military problem at all or even a police problem.  I believe that out of a total of 100 per cent. of the people to-day who are employed in illegal causes that brings them into hostility with organised Law as represented in this Assembly,&mdash;that out of that total of 100 per cent. not more than 10 per cent. concerned in the war are there for any principle&mdash;and 10 per cent. is a generous allowance&mdash;and that there are not 15 per cent. of those following leaders, engaged in the war, upon the question of principle.  That is to say, that of the entire body engaged with the Irregular Forces to-day there are not more than 25 per cent. at the very outside concerned in the issue of principle. Who are the remaining 75 per cent.?</P>

      <P>The remaining 75 per cent. of the people engaged in Irregularism are those connected with it, not because of principle, but because there is no work for them to engage in, and that there are more people than there is work for.  I know I will be told that even if work were provided, these people would not work. That is a remark that will always be made.  When I raised this question once before, a gentleman in the gallery, a very well-known citizen, who was listening to me, said afterwards in the Lobby that these people were &ldquo;work-shy.&rdquo; And he added, &ldquo;has anyone ever had a holiday for three weeks that did not come back work-shy.&rdquo;  Every unemployed person for a week or a month is work-shy.  At the end of three months they are revolutionaries, and at the end of four months they are anarchists, and it is not until work is provided for those referred to as being in the ranks of Irregularism that irregularism <Col N="1871" /> will be brought to an end.  I am, therefore, prepared to support this motion, because I believe it is at the bottom of the whole of the present trouble in this country to-day.  I believe the work put into the hands of the Minister for Defence is work that no Minister of Defence in control of armed forces can deal with, because just so soon as he has dealt with it in one part of the country, by the very necessity of the case, and by the very destruction that he has had to cause, and from the very nature of the hostilities in which he is engaged, he has created as much unemployment in his endeavour to cure irregularism.  He has created, in one form, irregularism, just as he is engaged in another form in keeping it down in one or other of its aspects.  I think that is a matter which should engage the attention of the Dáil, and a plan should be formulated to deal with this unemployment. I agree with what the Deputy opposite said, that if plans were placed before the Dáil, even though these plans could not be put into immediate operation, even if it were a question of weeks before they could be put into operation, the mere publishing of them&mdash; the mere enunciation of them and publishing them here, and the mere knowledge that this Dáil was concerned with them, would have a remarkably salutary effect in parts of the country that would help the work engaged in by the Minister for Defence, and would reduce his problem to a more measurable military proposition that he could deal with, and, as I said before, the work he is engaged in would be taken off his shoulders by some such proposals as are asked for in this motion.  For him and his colleagues in the Cabinet there are very great difficulties.  We have been engaged in passing a Constitution, which is the primary concern of this Dáil.  No one wants to minimise this.  On the other hand, while there can be no minimising of the difficulties with which Ministers are faced, the urgency of this problem of unemployment, with the winter coming in, is a grave danger to the country.</P>

      <P>I rise to contradict the statement that has been made here with regard to irregularism, or as to who are the Irregulars.  I happen to know something about the country I live in.  I happen to know something about the <Col N="1872" /> prisoners who come in to Kilkenny, which holds about 400 at present.  I happen to know something about Tipperary. I don't know about Dublin. But I do know that in the places I have mentioned that 95 per cent. of the Irregulars are the sons of farmers&mdash;small farmers.  They are not from the labouring community at all.  That class of people has been in the Irregulars all the time.  The Regulars are the labourers. The vast majority of the Regulars are labouring people, but 95 per cent. of the Irregulars are, as I have said, the sons of small farmers.  And Mr. Figgis can take that bee out of his bonnet altogether. Let him deal with figures and facts and cite them for us.  I don't know much about figures, but I am only talking about the Irregulars.  And it is the farmers' sons, who have plenty of work to do at home, who are the Irregulars.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, in reply to the last Deputy, that the position as regards the South of Ireland, more particularly as regards Cork City, has been stated by Deputy Nagle. A great portion of the irregularism that is going on at present is due to unemployment. Whatever it may be in other districts, it is at all events the fact down there, that it is due to unemployment. My opinion is that if a portion of the money which has now of necessity to be devoted to the Army were used for providing means for employment, it could get rid of irregularism, in some respects at all events, as quickly as the method of fighting the Irregulars. This is a matter which some of us in that district have gone very carefully into, and we are convinced in the truth of this.  I personally am convinced of it that one of the best means, apart from the activities of the National Army, for bringing the state of war to an end is to provide employment for those who are willing to work.  As the Minister for Defence in his statement to the Dáil said, there are three classes of Irregulars.  There are those who do not want to work; there are idealists and the politicians; and those who in any event in fairly settled conditions even would be somewhat of the criminal class.  But there is no doubt whatever that in the case of the South, the district that I am acquainted with, that there are large numbers even yet with the Irregulars <Col N="1873" /> who are simply out with them because they have no employment, and who would not be with them if they saw any opportunity of employment.  Therefore I would strongly urge upon the Ministry the consideration again of that aspect of the case, because I believe it would lead to a cessation of the warfare so far as some of the Irregulars are concerned if there is a prospect of employment afforded to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the time has come when we must canonise some of those Irregulars.  According to what we hear now the only complaint is that the Irregulars have not employment.  There is an Irregular in Mountjoy at the present moment who had a position in the Dublin Corporation of £1,000 a year.  I suppose it is not enough for him.  He is now an unemployed Irregular.  There is another Irregular there who was a messenger in my Department.  He was fairly well paid at, I think, £3 a week. But I suppose that was not enough. There is another one of them who had over £6 a week, and so on.  There is no use in telling us that it is due to unemployment. It is not.  Irregularism brought about unemployment, and it is responsible for the present position of affairs. I can quite understand those who represent Labour, and whose entire interests are concerned with labour representation urging a case like this.  But I do not understand a Deputy like Deputy Darrell Figgis standing up and refusing to look point blank at the actual economic circumstances of the case.  You have got two illustrations already on the Continent showing examples of what is to be put up to us here.  Russia is one, Austria is another.  In the one case you have irregularism gone mad; in the other case you have what Deputy Darrell Figgis would urge us to do here.  Now I am not a magician, and I am not in the position that Deputy Figgis is in to urge this Dáil or the country to pledge its credit for what it cannot afford to pay. I said that before.  It will be admitted by any person who has weighed up the circumstances in the case that in the first place we have got no credit to mortgage. Absolutely none.</P>

      <P>You want to deal with unemployment.  You will not deal <Col N="1874" /> with unemployment by printing paper, and if you do, no one would recognise it. And there is no other way except borrowing from somebody else.  You will borrow from somebody else at an exorbitant figure, that you are not in a position to pay.  The Government, since it came into office, has set apart for building houses one million pounds. By no means anything like a large part of that has been taken up by the local authorities.  They are nibbling at it. And in the case of the district represented by another Deputy who has spoken here, plans are only being perfected, or the tender is only being received, and the price put up by the local contractor is something like £900 a house.  Now, I put it to the Deputies here, can a country afford to pay that price for a house?  Certainly not.  And that is the position we are placed in, that in order to buy off irregularism we are to bankrupt the country, and to destroy the future prospects of the country under such bankruptcy.  We have set £275,000 apart for roads, repairing of roads, and so on.  And that is being distributed to the local authorities. Before the last Dáil went out of office, we had earmarked £100,000 for relief of distress in the Western seaboards. Now, that is £1,375,000 so far.  That has nothing to say to such things as the sum I mentioned yesterday for the development by the Port and Docks Board. It has nothing to say to the huge sums of compensation that are being distributed, and will shortly be distributed in pretty considerable quantities, in every part of the country.  There is a considerable danger in shovelling out huge quantities of money like that.  There is a great danger of inflation.  Now, the point evaded by every speaker is whether or not there is an equitable economic scale at present in operation in the country.  That point was evaded by all the speakers.  If there be not an equitable economic scale, one of two things is bound to happen.  There is a possibility of a fall in the exchange.  If you mean to have a currency of your own, you must honour the currency, and take every precaution to see there is no fall in it, or you will be getting half the price of the produce that you will export, and the only remaining industry in this country will be bankrupt, <i>i.e.</i>, agriculture.  You have got no other, because the possible <Col N="1875" /> accumulation of wealth and at the same time absolute discontent amongst the employees are the two things that you have got to steer an even keel between. I think the gentlemen on the other side of the House will admit that those are really the facts of the case.  Now during my term of office as Minister for Local Government I came across one instance where a local authority had built 1,400 cottages and let them at small rents, and the last balance sheet I saw in connection with that showed that it would have paid the local authority to have discharged all outgoings for interest and principal-to have, in other words, said to the people: there are your cottages, keep them and repair them and look after them yourselves.  We do not want any rent for them.  It would have paid them to do that.  I mention that fact because there has been all through the history of this country a general design to place practically every citizen in the community dependent upon the Government. That is a false basis&mdash;a wrong basis.  If the gentlemen opposite, and they are perfectly entitled to do it, ask them and urge them to forward a scheme for housing more agricultural labourers throughout the country, it will be utterly impossible to get anything like the same financial accommodation as prevailed during the last decade or twenty years. There can be no mistake about it. Money has doubled in cost to the Government since that particular scheme of 1,400 cottages I am speaking about was put into operation, and unless those who have benefited under the Acts that have been passed realise their responsibility and pay the rent due on these houses and discharge their obligations to the State it is useless to come forward and say we want more houses.  It cannot be done.  In addition to the things I have mentioned we have set up a new organisation, known as the Civic Guard. There are, I understand, about 1,200 men employed in that.  If they have not been drawn from the unemployed circles they have, at least, made room for employment for other people.  I expect that force will be augmented by about a couple of thousand.  We have taken a huge number of men into the Army, and we have not got any money in our Exchequer, and you know it.  Only a fortnight ago I disclosed here the actual description of every penny we expected to <Col N="1876" /> receive.  I gave you the actual figures of what we received during the last six months, and what we paid out, and I disclosed the sum we estimated would be paid out on foot of compensation in addition to the sums I have mentioned here to the Army and Civic Guard.  But that is not the situation we have to face. There has been, whether we like it or not, a moral degradation taking place in the country for a very considerable time.  You have, for instance, the case of the gentleman who wrote out from the barracks that he wanted a gun to interview bank managers and railway clerks, and other people like that.  No, it is not unemployment, but it is that there has grown up a desire to get rich quick.  Now, we have been criticised, not very far from the City of Dublin, for absolutely refusing to include baths in houses that we have provided.  We have refused to do so, not because we are against baths&mdash;I take one every day myself, and I would prefer to have two or three rooms less in a house with a bath than to be without it&mdash;but I do say that a bath is a luxury, and that those who want it should pay for it.  I say you have no right to house four families where you could house five in order to give the four families four baths.  It was because the cost of a house in this case exceeded the cost we estimated, and we had estimated a fair price, £750 per house.  I think it is a considerable price; it happens to be 40 or 50 per cent. in excess of similar houses in England, and we are not sufficiently rich to spend one and a half as much on anything in this country as the English are able to pay. Now, I do not know where the money is to be got in order to deal with these. Irregulars who are looking for employment. I do not know there are any Irregulars who are willing at this moment to come along and say &ldquo;we will lay down our guns if you will provide us with employment, and we will be good citizens of the State.&rdquo;  Is that the position that is put up to us?  It is not, and everyone who has spoken knows it. A Government commonly handles only the absolute excess profits, if we might say so, of the business of the country, i.e., profits over and above what is necessary to provide for the running of the business and the paying of the dividend on the capital invested.  It is only <Col N="1877" /> the excess profits which we handle, because I look on Income Tax as an excess profit.  In the particular case of two Deputies who have spoken, there was an absolute conspiracy on the part of the people who sent them here to evade their obligations.  We have not got anything from one particular city I have mentioned&mdash;the City of Cork although we have made available for them something like £300,000.</P>

      <P>I hope you will realise we want that money as soon as possible.  I will qualify my statement to this extent.  Up to two months ago, under one heading, we had not got a single per cent. of the Income Tax due to us, and in another case, I think, the whole average would not amount to 5 per cent. of the total Income Tax due to us, and we have available for that city something like £300,000, made up out of compensation claims, housing, and road board grants.  We cannot pay out these moneys unless the people pay us their money.  It is an ordinary matter of business.  I do not know that it would be possible to effect the purpose that Deputy Johnson has in mind about paying a certain sum of money conditional upon that particular sum of money being spent on Irish manufactured goods.  It is one of those cases in which a Deputy who was very thin, and a Deputy who was very fat, might each complain that the cost of living affected them in a ratio that was not recognised by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce when fixing the figure for the cost of living.  One man might say that the incidence pressed heavily upon him. My information about Irish Manufacturers is to the effect that they sell their <Col N="1878" /> goods largely abroad, that the home trade is inconsiderable.  That is what I am told.  I don't know how Deputy Johnson's suggestion could be carried out.  In practice it would be excellent, if it could be put into practice.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that that motion was put down for to-day.  Unemployment in the country is a paramount question before the Government and before the people. Several times here I referred to the deputation which came before the Dáil last December and spoke of the 30,000 then unemployed up and down and through the country.  If I had any doubt in my mind as to the vote I would have given on the Treaty issue, the grave words of the spokesman of that deputation would have removed such doubt. So far from that critical problem having been solved or dealt with since, it has, from the force of circumstances, gone from bad to worse and it stands to-day as a factor menacing the life of this Nation, menacing the fabric of ordered society within this Nation.  To what extent it is the duty of a Government to intervene in a matter of that kind is an interesting subject for discussion. People have always differed and people now differ and people will probably always differ as to the exact functions of a Government; whether it is merely to attempt to create and maintain a condition of things which will leave the freest possible scope to individual enterprise, or whether the State should go further and attempt to deal with such problems as unemployment itself.  That is a matter which could always be discussed with great advantage and interest, but this problem that exists now is on all too large a scale to <Col N="1879" /> permit of its being discussed in any merely academic way.  It is said that the State cannot live by its citizens taking in each other's washing.  A State cannot live by its citizens raiding one another's houses, and the position here in this country at the moment is that there is no spirit of work from top to bottom, none of that spirit of industry which you have in Continental countries, but only a desire to live by raiding one another's houses, and that cannot last indefinitely.  We can and will beat down this armed opposition.  It is not a pleasant task; there is no joy of battle; no one will be heady or flushed with victory when it is over; it has been a grim and painful task since last December, but we can and will beat it down, and having beaten it down we will have prisoners on our hands to the number of, perhaps, 10,000.  Having beaten it down, how does this State stand?  Is it going to grow and flourish, or to perish in sheer futility?  That is a question which we of this Government cannot answer.  We can merely restore, with a strong hand, conditions which will enable people to live honestly and work honestly.  But whether this State will live or die is a question which only its citizens can answer, and whether it will live or die will depend on the spirit of work, on the spirit of industry in its population.  There is no use coming in here and reading lectures to the Government, which has been doing its best since last January, while wild men were screaming through the key-holes; no use whatever; no use whatever in coming in and talking to us about any expenditure of money, when the normal taxation of the country is not being paid, and when the credit of the country is not worth twopence.  Go out to the country and read your lectures to the people of the country.  Go out to the country with strong words of condemnation against those who are creating conditions which are smashing enterprise, creating conditions under which every man who had a five pound note is sitting on it.  I do not want to get over-heated on this subject, and I do not mean what I have said in any personally offensive way. That is the kernel of the problem, that the people are not working, that somehow they have forgotten how to work, and that a great many of them are determined, if they can at all help it, that <Col N="1880" /> they never will work again, like our poor friend who wrote out asking for a gun to be kept for him so that when he got out of jail he could have brief and profitable interviews with bank managers and railway clerks.  No Government can change the heart of the people; the people themselves must get a grip of these matters, and must realise that we have reached the stage when we must trust to evolution rather than to revolution for the attainment of our ideals, and that in any case, if we are to go ahead afresh, we must work.  It is a primal curse, and you cannot get away from it, and the individual or the family or the nation that attempts to get away from it perishes.  Somehow I think there is a mentality in this country which rather ignores, or is inclined to ignore, that primal curse at the moment, that thinks you can get the result of work without the work.  And you cannot.  You may try for a while, and you may seem to succeed, but you go down, and this country will go down, and no man or body of men will save it, if we do not conquer that mentality, if that idea of individual responsibility for the ordered conduct of society is not resurrected. A phrase was used here, and it was a true one&mdash;&ldquo;If the pack is strength to the wolf, the wolf is strength to the pack.&rdquo;  I like that, because it sums up that idea of the responsibility of the unit to the mass, and if the units of our mass do not get thinking along these decent, orderly, straight lines, and do not realise the seriousness of the problem of the moment, then we are steering for a bad smash.  This Government cannot lay grandiose schemes for draining up unemployment before the Dáil, because it cannot lay grandiose schemes for obtaining the money that would be necessary to carry out such public works as would drain up the unemployment of the country.  We are attempting to restore conditions which will enable commercial enterprise to have free play, and we cannot work miracles, but we are gradually restoring them.  The people must do the rest.  Somehow we have not been doing our own housekeeping for many a long year, and always we could blame someone else.  Now, when we find ourselves in that position that we must blame ourselves, if things go wrong, many of us have difficulty in appreciating the change.  But a people <Col N="1881" /> that has not been doing its own housekeeping for centuries is inclined to be woefully irresponsible, and this people is woefully irresponsible, and has been woefully irresponsible since last December, and if we are cured of that irresponsibility, the medicine will be sour medicine, indeed, but it will be, on the whole, healthy medicine.</P>

      <P>I was following this debate fairly closely, but unfortunately I was called away and I do not know what the President has said, although he usually covers the whole ground.  I was called away, not on the question of unemployment, but about a strike that is on, at the present moment.  I will not say what parties are responsible for it, but it is only another case of taking advantage of the times we are in that is responsible for the strike.  The way it appears to be me is that unemployment at the present moment is not getting the relief it should, and I have evidence, which I am not in a position to produce now, but which I can produce at a later date, to show that the sitting on the £5 note, as referred to by the Minister for Home Affairs, is the correct one, and on the other hand, the men also seem to want the last pound of flesh.  Consequently there is nothing doing on either side.  It is a fact that there is a lot of money available in Cork City, and plenty of work can be started there, but the ring of the employers is too strong, and on the other hand, they say, and a good many people say, that the men want too much money.  That may be due to the fact that the very thing we were discussing here to-day is correct, that profiteering is rampant there. In any case, that is the position, and the Government can do nothing, as between both parties.  I have proof that the employers in Cork&mdash;the contractors&mdash; wanted thousands of pounds more than a Dublin firm or an English firm, and it may be that we may yet have to bring over English contractors to do all the Irish work that is to be done.</P>

      <P>It must be said in all fairness that the contractors who have taken on the work are paying the same wages that the Cork contractors would have to pay, but they are not exactly looking for the same profit. <Col N="1882" /> There are other cases throughout the country where the employers have offered perhaps ten shillings a week less, and the men turned it down.  Hundreds of people could have got employment. Neither side would budge.  The result Nothing doing! What could the Government do in that case?  Nothing.  As regards the future, we have been asked to lay before the Dáil any plans we have prepared for dealing with the problem. Deputy Johnson very fairly asked us to state definitely if we had such plans, and if we have not to say we have not. I will be perfectly frank with him and say we have not any plans, but we have not lost sight of the question; we have not been forgetting it.  I do not agree that we should wait until the Irregulars are put down and hope then that industrial and commercial enterprise will bring about normal employment.  Before this thing occurred, and even in 1914 before the war, there were chronic cases of unemployment.  It was always here; it was everywhere, but there is no reason why we should not tackle it and see if we could not get rid of it for good and all.  Let us be frank.  I do not believe that talking in this way will remedy it. I believe that it is necessary to get together a body which will go largely on the lines suggested by Deputy Johnson to-day, but will have nothing else to do but to consider it, from every point, and explore every avenue, and then advise a Government, whatever Government it may be&mdash;it may be the present Government. It will, however, take a long time, but such a body should get going immediately and have nothing else to do.  There are men available who are anxious to do it.  They would tackle the question thoroughly and we then may get to the bottom of it.  That is, apart entirely from the present situation or the situation arising out of the war. In dealing with that question they naturally would be anxious, and we would be anxious, that they should deal with the question of unemployment money.  It is bad that unemployment money should be paid at all.  I agree that it has a very demoralising effect, but it has been put up to us, not by any official labour people, that it should be increased. There was a body prior to the outbreak of June, calling themselves the Council of Action, who mobilised four or five hundred people outside the Provisional <Col N="1883" /> Government Buildings; they came in and saw me and put up reasons why the unemployment benefit should be increased, as compared with England, etc. I brought the matter naturally, as I promised them, before the Cabinet, and it was a question of nothing doing.  This unemployment scheme is purely an English scheme.  It is one that we took over from the British and we have carried it on exactly on the same lines as it was carried on in the past, but there is no reason why it should not be tackled to see if it is necessary at all and to see if the money that is being spent on it could not be spent in another way.  Some people seem to think it is absolute waste of money giving it in that way.  I do not think, when proper consideration is given, that they will come to that conclusion. After all, even if you did put that money to something else, there would be a very large number who would go hungry.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Johnson said regarding the question of Technical Instruction, more particularly for females, and if it were possible, to place a premium on their attendance there, I think it would be a good thing, but then, it would be only such a body as I referred to in the beginning could deal with such a matter. That is the position as it strikes me at this moment, and as I said before, we have been considering the formation of such a body, and we will welcome, as Deputy Johnson promised, the help of his party, and the help of every other party in forming that committee, to get at the bottom of this thing, not as at present, but to get rid of it wholly if possible.  It confronts every country and it is not the result of war alone, because it was there before the war, and it was very bad before the war.  That I know personally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOS. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion at least has brought forth that very frank statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Government has no plans for dealing with this problem.  Well, I suppose one cannot be too hard, in view of the circumstances, in view of their newness to the responsibilities of office, and the tremendous problems they have had to face, but I believe, that had they given all attention to this&mdash;at least all the attention this problem demands, and had been bold enough to jump clear of the commercial <Col N="1884" /> system which they have inherited, or even taken the first steps to get clear of that commercial system which they have inherited, they would have been on the way to solve the problem permanently. It is quite true, as the Minister has pointed out, this is not a problem peculiar to the conditions in Ireland at the moment; it is a universal problem, a problem that has followed wars and that has followed a long period of peace, but it is a problem that ought not to exist, particularly in a country such as this, which is close to the earth, which should make it possible to feed and clothe and house men and women and children, without all the intricacies of the modern commercial system.  Ministers have spoken of the difficulties of finance, but we heard stories in the House to the effect that crops have been abandoned in certain cases, farmers cannot sell their produce, which is food&mdash;and this is a food problem fundamentally.  I submit that it is possible, even without the financial resources that the Minister spoke of, to bring food to the mouths of hungry men, and to make those men fit to produce more food, and your economic problem is thereby solved.  This introduction of the financial difficulty is the bogey that is going to prevent for ever any settlement of this problem, if we allow it to remain as the bogey.  Money, exchange, and finance ought to be considered in due relation to the realities of industrial and economic life, as an adjunct, an accessory, an assistant to the proper distribution of commodities. If finance interferes with that proper distribution of commodities, then find some other way of distributing these commodities.  The material wealth, apart from finance, is here in the country.  People require that wealth to consume it.  They are prepared to give their labour for the production of more wealth in exchange, and if we are bold enough we can bring the hungry man and the unclothed child into closer relations with the producer of food and the producer of clothing.  If finance is in the way, skip finance.  If it is not going to be a help, do not let it be a hindrance.  Hungry men and barns full of corn, idle mills and bakers capable of making the corn into bread! You have got to face the fact that the food is there, and the people who will consume that food are willing to turn <Col N="1885" /> their labour into other commodities, and if you are willing to get away from the habits of mind of the commercialist, the capitalist system, and take a step into the co-operative commonwealth, that so many people spoke about in the years before the Treaty, we shall then be able to solve this particular problem, or at least take a long step towards solving it. Ministers have thrown contempt upon the suggestion that there is much connection between what has been called Irregularism and unemployment.  I did not stress that, nevertheless, I am quite convinced that there is a very close connection between the two problems&mdash;one being sometimes a cause, and sometimes an effect.  In very many cases, if the opportunity were available for men to turn from the present irregular habits, to the older, and I hope, the newer, regular habits, when men will give service for their livelihood, if the opportunity serves, very large numbers, I am quite certain, will turn from irregular habits to regular habits.  We will need, if we want to solve this problem, to think not of the ordinary methods of commerce and trade and industry and capital and wages and profit. The Minister for Commerce and Industry has pointed out, that this problem may be accentuated at the present time in Ireland, but that it is a problem affecting England, Scotland, France, America, and other countries, where they have not an Irregular problem.  Can not we make an attempt to solve the problem in a way which other countries have not been willing to solve it?  People require goods, and the goods are waiting for consumption. People, in exchange for goods, are prepared to give their services, their energies, their skill, their brainpower, their muscular power, their experience. That is the circle, the complete circle.  By such means only can we bring the ends of the split circle into unison again.  Unless we are willing to strike out a line for ourselves we are not going to solve this problem, and you are going to get all the difficulties of Irregularism, you are going to get all the difficulties of unemployment, and all the problems arising out of unemployment, not only this year, but next year, and successive years, perhaps to an extent that will prevent the development of this country on the lines so many hoped for in the past few years.  I take it, it is useless to push this motion to a division, inasmuch <Col N="1886" /> as the Ministers told us quite frankly that the Government has no plans, so that the object of the motion, in that respect at least, has been served, so I beg to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>The motion which stands in my name deals with a question that is cognate to a matter which has already been dealt with, but is not included in the scope of that, and I suggest that after the matter has been briefly discussed, the best way to deal with it would be to include No. 5 within the scope of No. 1 on the Orders of the Day.  The subject is that of the increase of rents and inasmuch as my motion does briefly recite the arguments in favour of itself, I will read it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Inasmuch as wages and salaries of workers that had during the period of the European War been increased on the pre-war scale, are now everywhere being decreased as the result of a general effort to reduce costs of production; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Inasmuch as the increase in rents, in excess of standard rents, allowed by the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, and the increase in rents, in excess of standard rents, allowed by the Decree of this Dáil of the same year, were both based on the increase of wages and salaries prevailing at the time of the passing of the said Act and the said Decree, and are now out of proportion to the decreases that have since then been effected; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Inasmuch as this disproportion is the cause of much of the present discontents, besides being injurious to any attempt to reduce costs of production; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Inasmuch as the said Act, being now the law in effective operation in Ireland, will, unless otherwise provided, continue in force until the twenty-fourth day of June, nineteen hundred and twenty-three, and the said Decree has no stated term within which to run:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To MOVE that the Ministry be desired, without further delay, to amend the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restriction) Act, 1920, and to amend the said Decree of this Dáil, and to bring them into conformity with each other, with a view to changing the increase in rents, in excess of standard rents, allowed by the said Act and the said Decree, to such other, lower figure, or to disallowing the increases altogether, as the circumstances may seem to warrant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> It is perfectly clear that during the period of the war the value of money steadily decreased and the relative value of commodities steadily increased.  It is equally clear that salaries and wages that were paid during the period of the war mounted higher and higher, and in order to keep pace with that continual mounting up it inevitably followed that rents were increased.  As those rents increased from time to time and from stage to stage, the increases were marked by a series of Acts passed in the British Parliament and that became of force and effect in Ireland.  The first was in 1915, within one year of the European War.  The next was in 1917; the third was in 1919. In that year it will be recollected there were very remarkable and rapid increases of the kind.  Another Act was passed and finally in the following year, 1920, the Act was passed which is recited in the resolution, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restriction) Act.  When that was passed it touched as it were high water mark of all the increases that had been made since the beginning of the War.  The matter was brought to the attention of the First Dáil.  It was taken under review and as a result, the First Dáil passed a Decree on August 6th, 1920, very shortly after the passing of the Act.  The Decree of the Dáil and the Act of the British Parliament do not agree.  I assume, without definite knowledge to that effect, that the Decree of the Dáil, enacting a lower figure than the Act of the British Parliament, was passed partly for political reasons, but also partly because it was felt that the increases registered in the English Act might have been just in England, because of the rapid increases of salaries and wages there, but was not just for Ireland, and therefore the Dáil stated a very much lower figure.  Members who have had to go into this matter will be aware that the differences are too complex in each to be assessed in either by one uniform figure: but generally speaking, it is known that a published figure has been taken for one, and another figure has been taken for the other, and these figures are 40 per cent. increase for the English Act, and 15 per cent. increase for the Dáil Decree, it being felt by the Teachtai in the first Dáil that the 40 per cent., quite conceivably just for England, was not just for Ireland.  What has happened <Col N="1888" /> since is owing to the enactment of the Treaty the English Act is of full force and effect to-day.  It practically was since the beginning.  Some of us who served as Justices had occasion to administer the Dáil Decree, but we know in a much larger number of cases adjudicated upon the English Act was enforced, not the Dáil Decree.  The argument that is true with regard to the English Act, is equally true with regard to the Irish Decree, that argument being that in 1920 in Ireland as in England, though not of the same degree, salaries had touched high-water mark, wages had touched high-water mark and therefore it was felt, to correspond with that increase rents should also touch high-water mark. Since then salaries have decreased and wages have decreased.  They have very seriously decreased.  Rents have not decreased because they have been assessed upon a legal basis that has not allowed for their decrease.  My attention was called to this matter as a matter of prime interest by a large employer of labour, and in a dispute that occurred in Dublin last week, by a remark was made across the table by one of the leading employees in his Firm.  He drew the attention of this employer to the fact that in 1914, he was getting 36s. a week, and he was now getting £4 3s. 5d.  The man replied that 36s. a week in 1914 was better worth while to him than £4 3s. 5d., although he thought both an insufficient wage.  I think if a careful estimate be made it will be found there is a very great deal of substance in that.  I wish to confine myself to the obvious justice of the case I am making. It was not intended by the British Act or the Dáil Decree that the figures stated should be more than a maximum to correspond with the maximum of salaries and wages.  From that maximum of salaries and wages the country has since then gone back a great distance, and, to correspond with it, rents should also go back, and until this be done, one of the greatest difficulties in the way of the last subject of the discussion&mdash;that is the provision of employment&mdash;cannot be satisfactorily answered because it is agreed&mdash; we know it is the case&mdash;that English contractors are engaging in work here in Ireland and undertaking it at a much lower figure than Irish firms.  That is an undesirable thing, for, though manual labour employed in Ireland by English <Col N="1889" /> contractors might be the same as by Irish contractors, there is a great deal of other work of a clerical nature diverted from this country to other countries, and the reason why English contractors can deal with the situation in a more satisfactory way than the Irish can, is that they have a lower scale of living altogether, and in Ireland, it is necessary that that lower scale should also prevail.  We are dealing with the matter, so far as food and drink are concerned, but I suggest that, in order to keep the thing in parity, we should deal with the matter so far as housing is concerned, and let this question as to what the lower figure should be, or if there should be any increase whatever on the 1914 rents, be dealt with directly by the Government, or if the Government preferred, it could be referred to a Committee proposed early in the proceedings of this day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Gracefully to emphasise the obvious is a fine art, and the Deputy who has spoken will allow me to say he is a fine artist.  There are, at the moment, two Decrees bearing on this question of increase of rent, one being the English Act of 1920, and the other, the Dáil Decree of 1921.  I remember when the Dáil Decree was passed, and I remember how it was passed and how it was framed, and it was framed in a hurried interval between two sessions by a couple of men who were asked to look over the British Act and see in what respects it might be amended, to suit conditions here. It is obvious that the matter needs consideration, and it is obvious that we must have a single ruling here on the question.  I have had a memorandum prepared showing the differences between the British Act and the Dáil Decree, and all the material will be ready to decide on a figure and pass an Act here in the first Parliament of Saorstát Eireann fixing the matter definitely.  The Courts, as Deputy Johnson said, some time back, are at present in the difficult position of having two distinct rulings on the same question, and I am in the difficult position that what is and what is not the law of the land is a question of fact that only the Courts can rule on.  That position can be very speedily terminated, once the <Col N="1890" /> Constitution is passed and all the material is ready for framing an Act, and legislation will be introduced at an early stage of the next Parliament.  It cannot well be introduced before the next Parliament. Our functions are purely administrative, and while we can pass legislation, we ought not to pass legislation, stretching out beyond the date of our own lifetime, and, seeing that the interval between the present and the first Parliament of the Saorstát is so short, I think that the matter might well be left over for them. In the meantime the question will be considered and the material made ready for the preparation of an Act.</P>

      <P>I agree if the Dáil agrees with the condition that the photograph shall not be a copyright photograph.  If this condition is accepted it will be taken at 3 o'clock on Wednesday, and Deputies who desire to figure therein should be in their places at that time.</P>

      <P>On a point of procedure, sir, I want to know in view of the statement made by the President yesterday that there may be some adjournment after the passing of the Constitution <Col N="1831" /> for a certain length of time before the other business of the Dáil be entered on, whether before that adjournment he will set aside a date for a statement to be made on the general military position, and any debate that may arise thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The question will probably arise when the adjournment is being taken.  If the President desires to answer it now he will be within his rights.</P>

      <P>I may answer it at once.  There are people in this country who are suffering from a certain nervous prostration of one kind or another, of suppressed hysteria and various other ailments.  When the Dáil adjourns <Col N="1832" /> we are asked what is going to happen, what is the position, and are we going to win, and so on.  I have no doubt whatever of the ultimate result.  I do not think it is a time that any attempt should be made to gratify that peculiar form of disorder that has crept into our lives, that is curiosity.  I do not know you would be anything wiser by my answering these questions.  If you have any suggestion as to how the Army is to do its work, I am satisfied that the Commander-in-Chief will take that into consideration.  The military situation is well in hand.  It has improved very much.  All we want is to forget that there has been any interruption of the normal condition of our lives, and to get back to work, and to do things sensibly.</P>
