      <P>1.  To ask the President who is now in charge of the Publicity Department of the Government and at what salary, and how many persons are employed on the staff of the Publicity Department; further, to ask the President whether he will, on behalf of the Government, repudiate the policy of a propaganda directed to increasing the political bitterness in the country as advocated by certain minor propagandists.</P>
      <P>2.  To ask the President whether he will circulate to Members the Draft Constitution in the form in which it was taken by delegates from the Provisional Government to London in June last, in order that the Dáil, sitting as Constituent Assembly, may be in a position to see whether and how far that draft differs from the Draft Constitution subsequently published officially in the Press; and further, to ask the President whether he will circulate that earlier Draft before the present Draft Constitution is brought before the Dáil for discussion.</P>

      <P>I am aware, and regret that cases of hardship have arisen, not so much through the absence of tribunals empowered to deal with such cases as the present conditions, which render the setting up of such tribunals impossible, the County Courts and the Recorders Courts are the only Courts at present empowered to deal with workmen's compensation cases, and the County Courts will go out as usual on the Autumn Session, and the Recorder's Court in Cork City, with which, presumably, the Deputy is particularly interested, will sit and hear such cases, pending the reconstruction under the Judicial Committee outlined in my reply to the Deputy yesterday. These Courts must continue to deal with such cases.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether, in view of the official denial issued by the Postal Workers, he has or has not procured evidence, to prove the charge of sabotage made by him on Monday against the postal strikers in the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Certain, acts of sabotage had been committed at Crown Alley and at Amiens Street Office, where wires had been cut before the Staffs left on Sunday evening.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Deputy refers to the Official account he will find that that quotation which certainly did appear in the Press is not strictly accurate.  I have nothing to add to the information furnished yesterday regarding the acts of sabotage at Amiens Street Telegraph Office.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Telephone Exchange at Crown Alley the details are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Code markings of the Junction, and Trunk circuits were interchanged causing absolute confusion in the switching of calls.  Military lines were similarly interfered with.</P>
      <P>The calling circuits for some of the Trunk and Junction lines were also put out of order so as to prevent calls being received over those lines in the Dublin Exchange.</P>
      <P>Further the cards containing records of code markings could not be found when the Staff left, and the Staff address record were also missing.</P>
      <P>The result cf the interference with the switchboards has been seriously to interfere with the restoration of even restricted Telephone Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Provisional Government have provided a grant of one million pounds in aid of Municipal Housing.  The Scheme of the Ministry of Local Government has been taken up by 77 of the 94 urban authorities, and the proposals include 1,985 houses. There is no intention on the part of the Government of withdrawing the Grant; on the other hand they are doing everything possible to expedite the building of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think with the permission of the Dáil I would like to answer that question as I have had a good deal to do with Local Government. It would be impossible to foreshadow to what extent Government assistance would be forthcoming next year.  Some assistance will be forthcoming, but the assistance will be relative to the increased cost of building over the pre-war cost.  That, however, should not interfere with or limit to any extent the operations of Local Authorities in acquiring land or making the other plans for schemes in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>TOMAS O CONAILL:</NameTxt>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education if he is aware of the special hardships which the present system of calculating pensions will inflict on teachers, who are due to retire during the current Financial year; and if, in view of all these circumstances, he will consider the advisability of allowing all such teachers, who are efficient, to continue in the service at least until 31st March, 1923.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill) MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill):</NameTxt>
      <P>This question involves the general question of the National Education Estimates for the payment of teachers, and also the question of the charge to Teachers' Pension Fund.  The National Education Estimates are based on the understanding that teachers with fairly large salaries will normally retire at the age of 65 or earlier, and that their places in the general teaching profession will be filled by young teachers coming in at the lower scales of salaries.  The Teachers' Superannuation Fund is also based on the normal retirement of teachers in accordance with the late Rules.  In view of the changes in the administration of Irish Education, a number of teachers who had reached the age for compulsory retirement were continued beyond the normal time&mdash;some of them six months longer than they would have been retained by the late administration.  This has already put a considerable strain on the estimate for teachers' salaries for the current financial year, but the suggested continuance of such teachers for another six months would put an abnormal financial strain not only on the National Education Estimates for salaries, but on the Teachers' Superannuation Fund.</P>
      <P>The retention of such teachers beyond the normal time raises, besides, a serious question, inasmuch as their continuance in the service would, result in a very serious grievance:</P>
      <P>(a)  To the number of younger teachers awaiting promotion;</P>
      <P>(b)  To the number of young recently trained teachers who, in these circumstances, would be unable to obtain employment;</P>
      <P>(c)  To the number of teachers trained in previous years, who, owing to their inability to obtain employment, were obliged to seek service in schools in Great Britain, with the consequential loss to the country of the cost of their training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the salaries basis and the consequential changes in the rates of pensions have naturally caused certain apparent anomalies, but the improvements recently made in the salaries of the teaching profession have in the bulk of the cases resulted in giving substantial pensions to the teachers who now retire <Col N="261" /> normally under the rules, aud the suggestion that such teachers should be further retained does not appear to be defensible either on educational or other grounds.</P>

      <P>moved &ldquo;That in the public interest, and pursuant to the declared policy of the Government of upholding the authority of the Dáil, it is the opinion of the Dáil that a measure should be introduced immediately to legalise and control with suitable safeguards such Executive action as may be necessary during the present civil war for curtailing the liberty of the subject;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Dáil is to be congratulated on the dignity and good temper with which this matter has been discussed up to now, and with a view to continuing that happy state of affairs I desire to say at once that in raising this somewhat delicate subject I have no intention of saying what would give offence to those who disagree with me, and I ask the Dáil to give me their sympathy, and where they cannot give me their sympathy at least their toleration in the task of championing or appearing to champion the under dog, particularly if you think that the under dog is mad.  My concern is far <Col N="267" /> less with the under dog than with his matter, the Irish people, and it is because I am concerned for the dignity of the Irish people that I have thought it necessary to raise this Motion now.  I ask the Government to believe that I am not moving in this matter out of any cantankerous desire to cause them difficulty, and I ask the Dáil to believe that I have not been approached by anybody on the anti-Treaty side to bring this matter forward.  I mention these matters with some hope of disarming criticism that might otherwise be made.  I am bringing this matter forward with a full realisation, a fuller realisation perhaps than many members, of the difficulties of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Home Affairs, who has the hardest post after that of the Minister for Defence.  I am bringing it forward in friendly spirit and not as hostile criticism, because I hope to induce the Government to meet me in the matter in the same spirit as I move this motion, in the spirit in which the other day the Minister for Defence gave that noble speech that we listened to.  The matter in question concerns two quite distinct classes of people.  You have first the man of war &mdash;the fighting man, properly so called, taken in arms and imprisoned.  You have secondly the political suspect.  I am not particularly concerned with the first class.  I suppose nobody will deny that the fighting men taken in arms against the State must be imprisoned.  I suppose they themselves would hardly deny it, but at the same time I regret it is done in the wrong way, and that the matter has not hitherto been legalised.  I am, however, concerned, deeply concerned, With the case of the political suspect.  I want the Dáil to realise the position we have to-day in that matter.  The Government, in the exercise of its discretion, have arrested numbers of people, I know not how many, numbers at all events without charge, without any intention of trial, and with the intention of keeping them in prison indefinitely.  Now, that may or may not be necessary.  I plead guilty to a very strong aversion to the system of internment, but I am prepared to admit that there may be crises in the life of the State when remedies of that kind are necessary, and I daresay the Government can satisfy the Dáil <Col N="268" /> that this is one.  But what I do know is this, that these arrests have been made without any Law, without any Decree, without any judgment to sanction them or authorise them, and without any authority whatever from this Dáil.  I suppose it is a truism and needs no argument that there is no more dangerous power that you can put into the hands of the Executive than arbitrary power over the liberty of the citizen.  That power is dangerous enough when exercised, as it was exercised in England the other day, and during the last few years in this country under Law or under pretence of Law, under rules and regulations with safeguards.  It is dangerous enough when these safeguards are of the best, but what is to be said and how could it be defended when it is exercised without any attempt whatever at legal justification, legal control, or legal restraint?  I am not asking the Government to do anything difficult.  I am asking them to do something that will strengthen, instead of weakening their position, strengthen it immeasurably.  It will be obvious, I suppose, to everyone of us that if it be the fact that you have a considerable number of prisoners politically opposed to the Government interned on suspicion of having helped the armed forces that are opposed to the State, it will be sufficiently obvious that if there are a number of these people&mdash;human nature being what it is&mdash;there must be some of them improperly imprisoned, and there are certainly many of them sincerely believed by their friends, and believed by at least a section of public opinion, to be improperly interned.  And therefore one serious result of this interning without lawful authority is that you are giving food for propaganda against the Government where you need not give it, making friends into enemies, and making the task of the Government ultimately more difficult.  I do not think that is a wise procedure, I do not think it is a just procedure.  Let me give you two or three cases of persons who have been subjected to this process, and I think I shall include in the instances I mention the names of two people whom it would probably be very easy for the Government to make capital against in this Dáil, in view of the records of these people, and in including them I do so because it is not a matter of persons, but <Col N="269" /> a matter of principles.  The other day we had Dr. Bastable, who came over from Glasgow.  He is a medical practitioner there, and came on holidays to Dublin. I have not the honour of the gentleman's acquaintance, but I am told that after being in Dublin for two or three days he finds himself suddenly whisked off to jail without any reason given whatsoever.  It may be that there are the best of reasons. They are not known to the people and not known to his friends.  I am informed that this gentleman has had no active part in the insurrection directly or indirectly. It may be, but I do not know, that his relatives were mixed up with the Irregular forces, but I trust, A Chinn Comhairle, that we have not yet got to the stage that you imprison a gentleman because you do not like the politics of his relatives.  He, at all events, claims he is improperly imprisoned, and, if I understand the answer given to the House by the Minister for Home Affairs, he is not allowed to see his solicitor with a view to making preparation for a <i>Habeas Corpus</i> application.  That is one instance. The Government there, I say, may have a perfect answer, but, the public and his people do not know, and therefore the Government put themselves in the wrong; and, in any case, this is the necessary result of arresting people arbitrarily without having any proper code of law or rules under which to act.  There was another case&mdash;Mr. de Blacam.  He was arrested the other day.  He is well known to be hostile to the Government on the question of the Treaty.  He may be against the Government in the civil war.  He is a person who does not possess strong health, and on him imprisonment, I am told, is most dangerous. The effect of the arrest of that gentleman&mdash;and, if my information is correct, he has taken no part in the military activities against the Government&mdash;the effect of it is to create further propaganda against the Government and against those who are supporting the Government, quite unnecessarily, simply because this thing is done in this illegal way and no explanation given, whereas there may be cause for the Government's action, and they may have a good answer.  Take the case of Mr. Justice Crowley.  Judge Crowley was appointed a Judge by Dáil Eireann.  I am told that Judge Crowley is a cantankerous person <Col N="270" /> and a difficult person.  I am further told that he has emitted some most objectionable Decrees against the Government in spite of the Government's attempt to suppress his Court. I do not know why that gentleman was arrested the other day, why the Government arrested and interned one of its own Judges without charge or trial. What happened was this: Mr. Crowley was, I think, fifteen months in prison up to the truce with England, and it is common knowledge of all who know anything about him that his health suffered very severely in consequence.  It is, therefore, known that Mr. Crowley is a man to whom imprisonment is dangerous. I am told Mr. Crowley in prison addressed a letter to me seeking my interest in the subject.  In that letter he started what I have given just now to the Dáil and proceeded to say that if he were not released, he would go on hunger strike.  That letter has not been permitted to reach me.  That letter, if my information is correct, was simply suppressed, but, however, it had the desired effect.  In the face of that threat of Judge Crowley the Ministry paused and considered and said: &ldquo;How shall we look in the eyes of public opinion if one of our own Judges die of hunger strike in prison, where we have put him illegally?&rdquo;  Then they let him out.  I may say I am not mentioning that to make capital against the Government, but I am mentioning it in order that the Government may realise what a mistake it is to put themselves in such a humiliating position.  If he went on hunger strike when legally and properly put in prison in order to make capital against the, Government, then the Government could stand by what they were doing. Now I will give a final cage.  Some of you have heard of Mr. Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly.  He is a gentleman who, I am told, is against the Treaty.  He is a gentleman who&mdash;if I am correctly informed&mdash;was engaged upon some publicity work in connection with the activities of the Irregular Forces in O'Connell Street, and the newspapers have told us that he was on the point of leaving for the United States of America in order to show up the iniquities of the Government, when he was arrested and clapped into gaol.</P>

      <P>In that particular case the Government, instead of dealing with the matter according to law, as they should have done, proceeded to perform what I consider an extremely foolish piece of propaganda which created in the minds of the public an impression that this gentleman was to be locked up because the Government did not wish him to do propaganda against them in America.  That impression, I hope, was false, but the Government is not doing itself justice in this matter of arresting people without authority.  The Government told us, and they got the support of the Dáil on it, that all they are thinking of is to maintain and uphold the authority of Dáil Eireann.  It is doing these things without any authority from Dáil Eireann.  There may be some serious objection, to legalising this position.  I don't know of any.  I have discussed the matter with several people, and the objections they have made are three.  There is the objection of the thoughtless man in the street.  The thoughtless main in the street says:&mdash;&ldquo;It is war time,&rdquo; and that is enough.  That may have been an adequate answer at the beginning of the war while the trouble was in the capital itself.  That is not an adequate answer when Dáil Eireann is sitting when the whole matter could be put right by putting through a short Act of Parliament which any competent lawyer&mdash;and the Government have many at it command &mdash;could have ready for this Dáil in forty-eight hours.  It is not an adequate answer when the Ministry knows, and if it needed assurances it would get them, when the Ministry knows that such a Bill could be brought down to the Dáil and presented and passed.  If the Minister for Defence and Commander-in-Chief comes here and tells us that such and such things which we do not like are essential in the present crisis, this Dáil will be anxious to facilitate the Commander-in-Chief, and will not put any petty difficulties in his way.  It is not an answer when Dáil Eireann is sitting to say &ldquo;This is a time of war.&rdquo;  Then you have the answer of another type of gentleman.  You have the answer of the professional politician. <Col N="272" /> And the professional politician will say to you &ldquo;These fellows are anarchists,&rdquo; and he will give you that as a full and sufficient answer.  The other day the Commander-in-Chief in this Dáil told the Chamber that there were three classes of persons upon the other side in this war.  He said there were politicians, military men and criminals, and he told us that many of those on the other side were on the other side, not for ignoble motives, but because they put faith before reason.  We do not know&mdash;perhaps he does not know&mdash;what proportion of the forces ranged against the Government consists of criminals but in view of the statement made to us in this Dáil, it is impossible and it would be unjust to dub as criminals or anarchists all those against us.  You cannot kill anarchy by anarchy.  If it be true that the Government have anarchists to fight against, that is all the more reason why it should assert the supremacy of the law in the face of that anarchy, and why it should refuse to descend to anarchical methods itself, and especially in a country which has been brought up from the cradle to believe that the law is the enemy, and that illegality is rather a virtue.  Now, at the starting of the new Irish State when the eyes of the world are upon this country, it is above all necessary that the Government, at least, should not lay itself open to the charge of giving lessons in anarchy.  No, it will not do to answer the proposal by calling these people names.  But then it is said by opportunists:&ldquo;Oh, it is all right; the thing may be formally wrong&mdash;a legal quibble, you now, and all that kind of thing.  We will have an Act of Indemnity after the war.&rdquo;  We will have an Act of Indemnity after the war. That is the answer of the opportunists, and I shall be surprised if that kind of answer finds any echo in this Dáil.  The thing is either right or wrong.  There is no difficulty, if it is wrong, as I say it is, in putting it right.  I therefore ask the Government to treat this matter, not lightly, as a matter of no concern, but to take it seriously.  What I want to see them do is this: to bring in before Dáil Eireann a short Act of Parliament to legalise the whole position.  They can do the same thing in other ways if they think proper; there are other legal means of arriving at much the same result.  I <Col N="273" /> suggest to them the obvious and best means would be an Act passed through this Dáil, whose authority they are anxious to maintain.  That Act would provide for the arrest and imprisonment &mdash;imprisonment upon capture&mdash;of those caught in arms; those fighting the Government in arms; for the arrest and imprisonment of those, if any, whom it is necessary, for the safety of the State, to intern at the present moment.  It would specify clearly the rights of those men and their obligations.  It would set forth the discipline under which they will be held, the punishment to which they expose themselves in case of contumacy, and it would set out, no less clearly, the right of any such man to test the legality of his imprisonment by some method provided for in the Act.  There are many ways Which the Legal Adviser of the Government would have no difficulty whatever in incorporating in such an Act, and you thereby remove what is a real grievance, and, where it is not real, is at all events a sufficient grievance to do very serious propaganda against the Government. And you remove the danger&mdash;and think it is a serious danger&mdash;that our friends, men of our own blood across the seas, and particularly in America, will be filled with animus against the Government, on account of the things that are said about the Government's performance, by those who are attacking the State to-day.  People who are out to do propaganda against the Government will, no doubt, have some success in any case.  Governments expect that; but, if you give them good, solid material to do propaganda work their success will be a very different thing from what it would be otherwise.  And the danger is a real one that people far off will believe a great deal more and a great deal worse than what the truth is, and that we shall have the humiliation of seeing Ireland visited by a delegation of anxious inquirers from America, eager to know what is the truth about the alleged atrocities.  I ask the Government to spare us that humiliation. This is a moment when the eyes of the world are on Ireland.  For 700 years Ireland has been fighting a fight to which there is no parallel in history&mdash; a noble fight nobly fought&mdash;and it is our duty now, when we are starting the new State, to see as far as we can do it <Col N="274" /> that we do not lower the level of this Nation.  It is the duty of the Government to remember the traditions which it represents.  If the Government believes, as we have all professed to believe, that we, the Irish people, have a Mission and a Gospel of our own, and a civilisation of our own, to communicate to the world, let us not begin by sullying our first pages.  I ask the Government to take the simple measure I suggest in order that we may leave to our children, and our children's children, the memory that when this first Government of the Irish State began its work under circumstances of great difficulty, it remembered its traditions, it remembered what our for bears had stood for, and it decided to fight this fight in a clean and straight way, and to be guided all through by principle and not by opportunism.</P>

      <P>I desire to second the motion, and I do so on the general principle that not alone in every organisation, in every Parliament such as this, but in every State, certain order and procedure is necessary.  Our own proceedings here have in one sense been slightly out of order, as is known to you, A Chinn Comhairle, simply because we have not had Standing Orders completed. Now, it has been necessary for this Assembly to get a Committee to devise Standing Orders to govern our procedure, in order to have debate, and produce decisions, in an orderly manner.  It is much more necessary in the government of a State that things should proceed in an orderly manner.  The contention against those who are taking up arms against Dáil Eireann, in the view I take of the matter, is this, that they are trying to smash a State organisation in this country which is governed and directed by this Assembly.  In other words, they are acting irregularly and out of order. They are using force for that purpose. Now, it is the duty of the Ministry here to assert the authority of this Assembly. On account of the challenge being by force, we are satisfied in this Assembly that the Ministry has no option but to use force also.  But in the assertion of that authority it is particularly incumbent upon our Ministry to act according to certain rules, and according to certain orders, and according to certain methods which would be understood by everybody&mdash;by <Col N="275" /> those who are in arms against them, or any political opposition against them, as well as by those in sympathy with them.  For that purpose and that reason, and in order that method may be produced, I second the resolution.</P>

      <P>It is only natural that the people who have a great deal to do with law, and a great deal to do with constitutional matters should be more conscious perhaps than the rest of us of the necessity of doing all things strictly according to rule, and all things strictly according to constitutional precedents, but in the very eloquent and, on the whole, the rather reasonable address which he delivered, it seems to me that he had not sufficiently faced the facts arising from the peculiar circumstances of this country at the moment.  That he did not face the fact, that we stand amidst the ruins of one administration and the foundations of another, still unlaid and still unset.  And that while we were in that peculiar and anomalous position we were faced; with the gravest and most painful duty which any administration could be faced with; the duty of facing with force a wayward section, of our own people, the logical outcome of whose acts would mean the destruction of the hopes of the people to whom we were responsible.  The  Provisional Government was appointed by a meeting of Members elected to sit in a certain Parliament over a certain area.  It was not elected strictly speaking by a Parliament, for that meeting was not a Parliament.  It was a meeting of Members. Now, I want to go rather fully into this matter, because I want to show this Dáil in a reasonable way that we had duties and we had responsibilities, very great, very grave and very far-reaching; and that we had not in fact all the machinery at our disposal which we would wish to have to deal with the situation we were faced with.  That Provisional Government of nine men was elected, and I wonder if in the history of the world there was ever greater responsibility on nine very young and rather <Col N="276" /> inexperienced men.  The position of that Provisional Government which was elected at that meeting of Members was rather unique.  We had an existence of and we had a duty and we had a responsibility apart from the existence of any Parliament.  And theoretically at any rate we could have gone out into the highways and byways and co-opted men into that Government.  We could have co-opted into that Government men who would not have any shred of representative capacity, but those services we felt would be a useful addition to that Government and so we were in fact rather a Committee to tide over a very difficult transitionary stage than a Government in the ordinary acceptance of the word. Between the dissolution of one Parliament and the assembling of another we were faced with very definite evidence that the majority will in this country was not accepted as the deciding factor in the political affairs of this country: and that certain men, from whatever motives, had determined to take a step which we felt would once and for all dispose of this Treaty on which so many people in Ireland have based their hopes for Ireland's future, for Ireland's development and for Ireland's prosperity. And remember that the duty that was placed on us at that meeting at the Mansion House was there.  That terrible responsibility was there, and it was there, and I wish to stress it quite apart from either the Assembly that had dissolved, or the Assembly that was yet to meet.  We took a certain line of action which many people not understanding perhaps all the facts, and not understanding perhaps quite fully the peculiar position, we occupy and the very, responsibility we had to all our people criticised very severely, and we had not at our disposal in the country machinery so that all things could be done according to law and that all things could be done even according to precedent. But I think we did according to our lights or, as some would say, according to our twilights what we considered was the best for the Irish Nation in the circumstances that had arisen.  And we did try to insure that injustices would not occur, and in the early days, in a spirit that many have termed far too generous, we arranged that by the signing of a very simple undertaking, an <Col N="277" /> undertaking that was not a hardship to expect any citizen to give as proof of his bonafides, we turned men out of jail. Then our faith in human nature got several rather severe shocks, and as I said yesterday the holes of the sieves were made so much smaller.  There was a little more delay in dealing with cases, but we still adhere to that that men who give evidence of good faith and give an undertaking which we believe to be genuine as regards their future conduct are still released if the Intelligence Department of the Army endorses the recommendation for their release.  I was rather glad to hear Deputy De Roiste say that it is the duty of the Ministry to vindicate the authority of Parliament. Because, unless I am very much mistaken, I read in the Press some month or six weeks ago threat from Deputy De Roiste that if there was not instantaneous peace, and he did even define the terms on which it was to be declared, that he would resign his membership of this Assembly. Now, Deputy Gavan Duffy spoiled a rather good case by over-stating it; and if, instead of all the destructive criticism and all the perfervid eloquence, he had set himself in a reasonable way to say what we could have done in that particularly difficult and anomalous period&mdash; what we could have done other than what we did&mdash;it would, perhaps, have been more profitable to us and to the whole Assembly here.  There are many things anomalous in the condition of this country to-day.  There are people in occupation of land and property which is not theirs; there are people with legal rights that it is not yet possible to vindicate. I think a true sense of proportion would not pick out from the existing chaos and all the existing anomalous conditions in the country just this one thing which Gavan Duffy has picked out and stressed with an eloquence of which he is capable and a special pleading of which he is capable to-day.  There may be in some prisons here and there through the country, amongst the 5,000 prisoners, or approximately 5,000 prisoners, some whose cases deserve investigation. We have endeavoured to secure that, on any prisoner petitioning for consideration for his case and giving certain evidence of bona-fides, that such consideration will be promptly given. And, further, we recognise that that particular <Col N="278" /> process of the past, which was necessary because of the peculiar set of circumstances, cannot remain the process, now that it has been found possible to call the Parliament together, and that a certain policy with regard to prisoners and to regularise their internment and the conditions of their internment is desirable. The Government in fact, long before Deputy Gavan Duffy pushed so hard at the open door, had been considering this matter and had been in consultation with their Legal Advisers.  The Minister for Defence will, I hope, deal even more fully than I can with all the difficulties there have been in the past, and all the difficulties that still remain, and all the difficulties that undoubtedly will exist in the future.  The Motion perhaps will serve some useful purpose, if he can see his way to give the Dáil a statement of the question as it appears from the particular angle from which he is compelled to regard it.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to deal at any length with this particular matter. Hearing Deputy Gavan Duffy speak I had something of that feeling that a good student has when he gets his preliminary couple of lectures, say, on Physiology or Psychology, and when he hears all the precautions there are, and feels that if he only had a proper grip of them he would never have a bit of pain or a single thought of worry for the rest of his days. Then when I find myself at the stage of being a six months student I find the Professor coming in one morning with indigestion, in a very irritable frame of mind, so far at any rate as the Professor is concerned, all those facts that he knows so much about, in their actual application, break down.  We certainly would be very strengthened in our work if we had all these rules of thumb read to apply, and if we had such familiarity with, and experience of, them, that if any particular case arose the whole machinery would move along sthe lines, say, of Rule 77.  If everything were done properly the prisoner would be placed in his cell with a list of the things that were wrong with him, a list of the things that would have to wait until they were done, and a list of the things he would have to go through to the end.  As I say it would be a tremendous <Col N="279" /> source of strength to us if we had a structure of law around us that would help us to carry out our work, and I certainly have everything to add to anything that might be said in favour of this particular Motion.  I have sent over for a few papers in connection with the cases we have heard mentioned, and I am glad that those papers have not turned up, because I think that no matter how sympathetically Deputy Gavan Duffy spoke of the particular cases he brought under our notice they are not simple cases at all, and there are serious difficulties in allowing to go free in the country, or in city areas, men who are, say, even a source of irritation to the troops working there, and men whose actions and whose words are such as would prejudice first and foremost the forces that are helping to restore order in the country, and that would prejudice their discipline.  It is very much safer, if there is a man in Donegal, where our troops are, under very difficult circumstances, performing a very difficult task, that the man who is talking irritably or writing irritably should be taken out of Donegal until we settle tho lack of law and order that is there, than that he should be left there, if you want to look at it from that point of view.  It is very difficult, if you arrest a man who, as has been stated, is an opponent of this Government, and you leave him go, and he falls into your hands five or six weeks later, and you find in his pocket instructions that some particular person who is a leader, say of the Irregulars considers it absolutely necessary that he gets away on the following night to America, and that he should look after the rest of the &ldquo;Thompsons&rdquo; and see about buying ammunition, to blame the military authorities if they turn around and say, &ldquo;Hold on to him.&rdquo;  I realise quite well that, in justice to these particular men and in justice to the whole country, and that in order that we may take advantage in the present situation of the little things that are simply irritants and not dangerous, that it would be well if we had rules that would help us in dealing with all these matters, and if we had time to instruct the fairly large machinery that we have attempting to do our work under all those rules.  I wish to support the Motion.  I am in favour of it, and I hope, when it is passed here, that we will be able to get assistance <Col N="280" /> from all sides of the Dáil in creating a set of Rules and a set of Orders that will not be an impediment to the work that we are trying to do.  If, instead of simply getting on with our work, we had to consider at every turn of the hand what particular law of psychology we were working along, or what particular though passed through, our minds, we would not get through our day's work.  And if we are to get a set of Rules like these, let them be sensible ones, and do not come in and put in front of the work we are doing this mere resolution, and say, get on with the work.  To the best of our intelligence and the best of our ability we are dealing with the work as justly as possibly can be done, having due regard to the safety of the people.  Do not let this resolution stand as an impediment to it.  Let it be simply a public manifestation, if you wish, of those things that have been in our minds all along.</P>

      <P>Mr. Chairman, when I opened the <i>Daily Mail</i> this morning I saw the caption, &ldquo;a million words per day.&rdquo;  It was over an account of a French Radio-apparatus, but I genuinely thought it was the prelude to an account of the long speeches we have been listening to from the Ministry since we began.  Fortunately, to-day there has been a departure from this practice of long Ministerial orations; but with this comes something far more astonishing than the cessation.  Some of us who are only plain people, and not Ministers, must feel considerable be wilderment in consequence of the speech just delivered by the Minister for Defence.  This is quite a kaleidoscopic change, that the Ministry so long arrogant have turned apologetic, are not merely on their defence, but uttering apologies on account of their youth, inexperience, and the difficulties of their position.  I am not sufficiently old a man to taunt anyone with being young, but when the Minister for Home Affairs himself accuses himself by putting forward the excuse, one is entitled to refer to it.  I wish he had not so accused himself. Surely the situation is not what was described by either of the Ministers who spoke.  It may be that my history is utterly wrong and that the impression that I formed in regard to the position and to the power of the Provisional Government was formed&mdash;in common with <Col N="281" /> that of many other people&mdash;on altogether sufficient basis.  The Provisional Government is responsible to this Parliament, and this Parliament is defined as being that to which it is responsible.  It was appointed, as you have just been told, at a meeting of the Members elected to sit in the Southern Parliament. Now I was challenged, I think rather peremptorily, by the President of the Dáil the other day when for the sake of brevity I used a shorthand formula and described it as being &ldquo;set up by the British Government.&rdquo;  In a sense it is a creature of Statute, just as this Parliament is in a sense a creature of Statute. As set up it was in the nature of a Clearing House because the Irish people recognise no other Government than Dáil Eireann, and the British Government refused to recognise the Dáil Government, and for the purpose of the change-over to which the Minister of Defence has just referred, it was imperative that there should be some body whose authority the Irish people would recognise and to which the English Government could delegate the authority which it was transferring.  In my conception of it the Provisional Government was that body.  Now why should we not make some effort after clarity of thought?  Does not everyone know that this is not a new State beginning absolutely afresh&mdash;its origins without any history or without any antecedents? We are not building from the ground up. The Provisional Government took over &ldquo;a going concern.&rdquo;  You are taking over a form of polity and a system of institutions that have been already in operation, and our task is to try and mould and adapt these to Gaelic ideals of law and government, to adjust their and to abolish them if necessary; to bring into operation a system of institutions which will be in harmony with the spirit of the Gael, yet in consonance with the requirements of Ireland.  We are not, therefore, in vacuo, and will all respect to Deputy Duffy, who has practised the Law&mdash;I myself am a Barrister&mdash;at least, I was called to the Bar, but unlike Deputy Duffy I never had the good fortune to achieve a practice&mdash; we are not here without a legal system and without the machinery with which to regularise Acts of government.  This is the only thing that I object to in the resolution of Deputy Duffy; with all the principles which he laid down, and all <Col N="282" /> the fine aspirations which he uttered for clean-handed action in administration of justice, and for just protection of political opponents, I am in the most thorough accord, but I suggest that a measure does not need to be introduced to legalise the system of Laws under which we now are living, and which, though you may profess to be in opposition to them, are all in operation.  What may be requested, and what I do think is requested, is some code of rules, some code of regulation, which, under the existing legal system, would secure the desired result.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the whole system of law.  If aggrieved you have the Habeas Corpus Act, which is part of the Constitution that has been taken over and is already in operation.  You have the High Courts, and all the statutes for preserving the liberty of the subject.  There is, too, the tradition&mdash;happily not lost&mdash;of the exercise by the community of its inherent powers to take whatever measures may become necessary in critical situations for its self-preservation.  I think, then, with all respect, the Minister for Defence was rather weak in supporting this resolution.</P>
      <P>He, or rather the Minister for Home Affairs, promised to see into those things complained of.  He promised on behalf of the Ministry to remove the grievances and give less room for propaganda than had hitherto been given. Are not these speeches tantamount to a full admission the part of the Minister and of the Provisional Government that things have been done that now require to be legalised.  That is what it amounts to.  I submit that on reconsideration the Ministry will realise their position.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to rise now only for the speech we have just heard.  I wonder whether it is desired by the Deputy that we should bring back the Executive forces, the Authority that has gone, because unless special power is taken or given by this Dáil there is no Executive authority existing in Ireland to-day, so far as I can understand, capable of dealing with any large violent trouble.  I doubt&mdash;perhaps I <Col N="283" /> should not say I doubt&mdash;I am very nearly sure&mdash;that we have no lawyers affiliated with our organisation.  The Solicitors' Union has not yet applied for affiliation! The facts, as I understand them, are that even the use of the army is illegal and will have to be legalised, so that it is necessary that steps should be taken to legalise the control of such Executive action as may be necessary with suitable safeguards.  Unlike Deputy Magennis, I thought that the promise from the Minister of Defence was satisfactory. I would again add a request; I will put it in the form of a request; I made it as a suggestion a day or two ago that there should be appointed a Commission of some body of persons not connected with the authorities, or only partially so, who would act as Commission of Inquiry into special cases that are set up on which members of this Dáil may be appointed as they were on a previous Commission.  I think those who are familiar with these things know that there was some value received by prisoners and there was some kind of security created by the Commission that was set up&mdash;I think it was under Lord Shaw. But whether that is a true statement or not, I believe it would be a good thing here if we could remove the possibilities of an injustice being done to even one citizen, if we can possibly do it.  There are, it was admitted, perhaps about 5,000 prisoners.  Some of the cases the Minister for Home Affairs said are deserving of consideration.  That is not a worthy thing for the Minister for Home Affairs to say.  Every prisoner's case is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>On the point that the Minister has just mentioned, I would submit&mdash;it is somewhat of an aside, perhaps, but I would submit it&mdash;that the evidence he gives of the unreliability of the word of many prisoners proves the futility of presenting a form of the kind he mentions.  Prisoners who have conscientious objections to signing any such form will continue to be imprisoned.  Those who have any knowledge of the circumstances of the past two years know it is true that <Col N="284" /> many people, though they may be innocent of any crime against the State, will refuse to sign forms of that kind when they have not been tried; and the fact that many do sign them with a definite intention of breaking them when they come out shows the futility of the method.  I want to support the resolution, and I hope that, after the acceptance by the Minister for Defence, there will be unanimity in passing the Motion.</P>

      <P>From 1916 to 1919 a good many members of this House were prisoners from time to time. They were put into prison, and had no reason provided as to why they were there.  I think I interpret the minds of others, interpreting my own, in saying there was a considerable amount of indignation as to the treatment we received and as to our being there at all, or if we did not feel that full measure of indignation at least we expressed it.  The speech made by the Minister of Defence certainly expounded the mind of our captors with a very great deal of eloquence, and shows that they had their own difficulties to deal with.  There was this in any case&mdash;they never proceeded, except in the later stages, to arrest without authority.  I am not criticising any of the past actions taken by the Government.  The <Col N="285" /> Government acted at the time, when hostilities broke out, without any machinery of law to which they could appeal.  They acted at the time, as I am perfectly convinced, under circumstances that left them no alternative but to arrest a large number of people for whose arrest they had not due authority, and yet whom to leave at large would imperil, I am perfectly convinced, the life of the community.  It is, I understand, not the immediate criticism embodied in this resolution now before the Dáil.  I think the purpose is somewhat larger and it is with the larger purpose I would urge the Government once again to reconsider whether they cannot accept it; that purpose being that now there is this Dáil, authority should be required by the Government and legislative measures sought.  The Minister of Home Affairs has already told us it is the intention to do this, and that it is unnecessary to push at an open door. If that be the Executive intention, or the intention of the Minister, or of the Ministry on whose behalf he speaks, it seems to me the purpose of this resolution has been served and need no longer be pressed.</P>

      <P>Listening to the speech, of my colleague, the member for the National University, it seemed to me that it might be necessary to put the Dáil in possession, at all events of the facts as they exist in my mind with regard to the right that I have to speak here at all.  I wish to assure my, eminent colleague that the authority I feel myself vested with, first of all as a Member of this Dáil, and secondly as a Minister appointed by this Dáil is derived wholly and exclusively from the people of this country.  That is true not only of each of us here, as I understand it, but it is also true of the Provisional Government as it existed up to the time that this Ministry was reconstituted by the Dáil a few days ago.  The Provisional Government, as far as Ireland is concerned, derived its authority, from the ratification of the Treaty by Dáil Eireann.  With regard to the main point brought forward by this resolution, which proposes to declare that &ldquo;in the opinion of the Dáil a measure should be introduced immediately to legalise it,&rdquo; etc.,.... the action which has been taken by the Government and by the Army on behalf <Col N="286" /> of the people of Ireland, and with no other object in view but the safety of the people of Ireland, <i>Salus Populi.</i>  That action was either right or wrong, in it's details it is either right or wrong.  In its policy it is either right or wrong.  We do not find ourselves here in the political atmosphere that surrounded Henry VIII., who, when he wished to do something which happened to be illegal got an Act of Parliament to enable him to do it. So far as we stand here&mdash;I trust I may speak for all my colleagues as well as myself&mdash;if you desire to legalise certain courses of action it is free to you to do so, but I hope that all my colleagues, I hope that I myself, I hope that every person holding office or responsibility under the Irish people will do what is right and necessary in order to secure the safety and the authority of the people. A state of war, a state at all events of belligerency, has been forced upon this country.  It has not been forced upon it by us.  The measures that were taken in opposition to the public voice, the public will of this country&mdash;those measures could only have been met by military measures.  I trust I am making a statement now which any person here can contradict.  If any person can contradict what I say here now that those measures taken against the peace, against the will, and against the safety of the people of Ireland, could only have been countered by military measures, if any person desires to contradict that I am prepared to await interruption.  The very essence of military measures is, that they interfere with freedom.  It is impossible to take military measures without interfering with liberties; measures taken that do not interfere with liberty are not military measures.  It is altogether not a matter of difference in kind, but rather a matter of difference in persons and localities.  If the Minister for Defence directs one of his subordinate officers in any part of the country to carry out a certain military measure, in doing so he has to override the rights of persons, he has the right to occupy roads, he has the right to occupy buildings, he has the right to trespass on grounds, he has the right given to him to enter into houses and to prevent other people having access to them.  He and his subordinates have the right to do a thousand things, which interfere with liberty as liberty ordinarily exists.  Now <Col N="287" /> if this Dáil proposes to pass any measure to legalise all those things I say for my part it is quite welcome to do so, but the position, in which I wish to stand is this, I wish to take the responsibility &mdash;full responsibility for whatever is necessary to establish the right of the people, the safety of the people, and the will of the people&mdash;I wish to take that responsibility, and I am not going to allow that responsibility to await on a technical legislation of what is necessary to be done.  If when these things come to an end his Dáil Eireann or its successor desires to enact an Act of Indemnity well and good.  If it desires on the contrary to impeach me along with others for the wrong we have done well and good.  We will stand the trial.</P>

      <P>I had not the opportunity of hearing the case presented by Deputy Gavan Duffy as I was engaged on important pther business outside while he was addressing the Dáil, but I understand the case he made dealt with three specific cases of arrest, and if I am correct in thus quoting him according to number, I must say that the number is insignificant, and the case made is largely the case which an able man makes the most of when he knows the case is an exceedingly bad one. When I was a very young man I was very anxious to become a Barrister-at-Law, but as time went on and I grew older I thanked God that I was not a Barrister. I have not the necessary time to read the <i>Daily Mail,</i> or what it says about this House, or any other.  I hope Deputy Gavan Duffy will confine himself to a fewer number of cases than one million.  I regret to say I cannot accept any responsibility for the modesty of the Minister of Home Affairs.  I am essentially a modest man myself, but I would not express myself with the modesty in which the previous speaker describes the position.  If there are only three cases cited by Deputy Gavan Duffy surely we have spent a long time in considering them; and we have not got from anybody anything lie the same condemnation for the lives of the citizens taken, and I believe that the five or six thousand persons at present in gaol are as responsible as anyone else.</P>

I wish to point out <Col N="288" /> that I mentioned three cases as evidence of a large number, and as typical cases I wish to point out the President is not in order in commenting on a speech which was delivered while he was out of the Chamber, and misrepresenting what I said in that speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recollect that the Deputy has said that we should give prisoners of war treatment to the prisoners. Not being very well versed in these matters I consulted my brother, as he is more of an authority upon this question than I am.  I asked him what was prisoners of war treatment, and he said the first thing in prisoners of war treatment was to cut the buttons off their trousers.  They are not even getting that kind of treatment, and if there is to be treatment other than what they deserve I will not be responsible for it.  Now the question is whether or not there has been sufficient grounds for the arrests. First of all, the military or the Government arrested no prisoners about whom there were not serious grounds for susipicion and ample ground for arrest, in the ordinary circumstances prevailing in any country during a time of war.  It was in the interest entirely of public safety that any arrests have taken place.  We have not, perhaps, exactly regulated the conduct of those arrested by a written law, but I think that the securing of the safety of the public is the first duty of the Government, and on that safely we are taking our stand and are prepared to be tried at any time for the arrest of this five or six thousand individuals, whose arrest, I think, secured the safety of the country. Of that we are satisfied.  I understand that one of the gentlemen about whom complaint has been made has decorated himself with the title of &ldquo;Judge.&rdquo;  A Judge is not far removed from a barrister, only a step or two. And this particular Judge held a court and issued an order for the arrest of the Minister of Defence and for several other people as well.  Now I ask was that a thing that could be lightly looked upon by the Government?</P>

      <P>Because he was an old cod.  And I think Deputy Gavan Duffy himself informed me one time <Col N="289" /> that that was his real title of distinction. Now at the present moment it is well known that the hospitality that we are able to afford these prisoners is limited&mdash;to some extent by the number of them that have accepted it, whether willingly or unwillingly.  And this is not our fault; it is their misfortune.  If they are suffering great inconvenience and discomforts, they are themselves the architects of their misfortunes.  And we will welcome any motion coming along to enquire not into this or that particular case, but into the whole case from beginning to end; and upon this we are prepared to stand our trial.  It is not usual, I take it, for a person in my position to move an amendment, but, nevertheless, I will move an amendment on this occasion, which is&mdash;</P>

      <P>You definitely. and decisively ruled that a certain part of the Amendment is a substantive Motion, that is, in so far as it asks for approval of certain military steps taken.  That is not an Amendment, but a new resolution. I submit there are three things contained in the Amendment, and one is a proposal for subsequent legislation. That, I submit, is a legitimate Amendment, inasmuch as it is a re-wording of what is here in the Motion.  But to propose as an Amendment something which would clothe with the authority of the Dáil whatever the military agents of the Government may do, or whatever may occur to them to do, is entirely a <Col N="291" /> new proposal and, I submit, should be ruled out of order, being a substantive motion without notice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a Motion of this kind requires many words in its favour, because the Postal Strike is a matter that is holding up the life of this country, as we know, and I think it is quite clear that there must come some kind of daysman between the two parties.  There is something like that to come about, prior to settlement &mdash;some person comes in between the two contending parties and seeks to discover if there could not possibly be arranged some means of peace where up to that moment there had been war. Obviously, if this is going to be done, as it will have to be done sooner or later, the sooner it is done the better.  When this proposal was made yesterday by Deputy Byrne, some Deputy behind me I heard use the word &ldquo;compromise.&rdquo; If that be an impeachment, it is an impeachment that I will at once frankly admit.  The nature of the circumstances are such that they are only amenable to the conditions of compromise.  There is no principle involved in the actual conditions of the strike.  I am not now referring to events subsequent to <Col N="296" /> the strike where a question of principle has been raised, and where, in my judgment, the question of principle is rather more, if I may say so, against the order issued from the Ministry for Home Affairs, than with it.  But that is a matter which does not concern the strike actually itself.  The strike is a strike with regard to conditions of service in the widest application of the term.  There are certain proposals put forward from one side and certain proposals put forward from the other, and I think under any conditions it would be infinitely deplorable if it became as strikes in this counttry have become in the past, a fight to the finish.  If it were to last for any protracted length of time, it is obvious that the business of this country would be seriously impeded, even as it has already been seriously impeded with grave loss, as at the present time.  Particularly it necessary that this strike should be brought to an end, because the general conditions of unrest and strife and other matters make it very desirable that the general territory of strife, the territory of warfare, should not be extended, but should rather be narrowed as far as possible. Directly we get then to this ultimate question that is bound to arise as to under what conditions a strike is to be settled we come within the region of compromise.  In order that there should be compromise between two contending parthes, it is essential that some person should come in between them and laying a hand upon each seek to discover how far each side is willing to come to a way of life in the matter that is under, dispute.  Since it occurred to me to bring forward a resolution of this kind I received just this moment a letter which came to me here, and it is from one of the two contending parties in the Postal Workers' strike.  Since it did not come from the Government side it must have come from the other side.  It is a suggestion put forward from one of the Postal Workers who happens to be a constituent of mine.  He puts forward a table of conditions which he believes should form a possible basis of peace.  I am not sufficiently cognisant of the details of the issues which led to this conflict to know whether these conditions can be made a basis as he suggests is possible.  The letter is written in very moderate terms, and is evidently <Col N="297" /> written by someone who is not anxious to put an <i>ex parte</i> case even though he may be involved on one side of the two in the dispute.  If therefore finally it is inevitable that compromise has to be made, and if before such a compromise can be made it is necessary that a third party, should step in between, the two contending forces in this contest, then obviously I would say there is no higher authority in this land that could appoint such a body than this Constituent Assembly of Dáil Eireann, and I therefore move:&mdash;&ldquo;That this Dáil appoint, and hereby does appoint, a Committee to enquire into the present state of the Postal strike, with a view of discovering whether Terms of Settlement can be arranged, land to report to Dáil Eireann; and that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was on the 1st March that the Postal Officials for the first time threatened to strike against the wages and salaries that were being paid to them.  There had been a cut in their bonus on the 1st September, and that cut was made in the operation of the figure found by the English Board of Trade.  That cut took place, on the 1st September, and there was no threat to strike.

      <P>The point in my mind is, that if we <Col N="300" /> are going to discuss the whole question of the strike it will be out of order, but the recounting of the steps taken in connection with the strike could be gone into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN:</NameTxt>
      <P>I only asked to be allowed to recount the steps taken from start to finish, and I am entitled to do that.  As I have just stated, there was a cut in wages on the 1st September, and the cut took place under the operation of the English Board of Trade figure.  The next out was due on the 1st March, and on the 1st March the Postal Officials who had no objection on the 1st September threatened to strike and to strike-for the first time.  Now that is rather a peculiar circumstance and I ask the Dáil to give full weight to it. In order to meet them the Government set up a Postal Commission, and on that Commission there were two Representatives of Labour.  I am not sure of what particular body, but there were two Representatives of Labour on that Commission, which was asked to enquire into the following matters:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That an independent Commission of five members be set up to inquire into the Wages and Salaries, Organisation of Work, and Conditions generally in the Post Office, and to report what alterations, if any, are desirable.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the cases of the principal classes of Post Office Servants, and of such of the other classes as the Commission may think necessary, the first task of the Commission shall be to determine whether the present basic wage can bear the recent cut, this to be determined by the 15th May, 1922, and that the Commission shall be empowered to recommend in the case of Classes where the cut is regarded as not being justified, an increase of the basic wage as from the 1st March, without prejudice to the general findings.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Commission shall then consider the general question of Wages and Salaries, Organisation of Work, and Conditions generally.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Commission shall have the right to determine what subjects may properly be regarded as coming under the terms of reference, and what evidence is admissible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The Commission was asked to report, and this was their finding:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  That the British Board of Trade index figure does not accurately apply to Irish conditions, and that an Irish cost of living figure should be prepared by the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  That while on the figures supplied to the Commission it would be impossible to estimate the relative cost of living in Ireland as compared with Great Britain, the Post Office staff in Ireland have found it extremely difficult to adjust their living expenses to the reductions in their bonus.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  That this has caused certain hardships in the lower paid classes, especially in the case of married men with families.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission, therefore, recommends temporary additions to basic wages of certain permanent classes of Post Office servants and to the consolidated wage of certain temporary classes.  The Commission recommends that these temporary additions should date as from March 1st last, and that they should be continued until an official Irish cost of living figure is agreed on for use in the calculation of bonus, or until the adoption of the final report of the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In others words, the Commission stated that they could not state whether the basic wage could bear the cut until the Irish cost of living was agreed upon.  Now the Postal Workers themselves put forward the case and keep up the case that the Irish cost of living should be found. Consequently Departmental Committee was set up to find the cost of living figure. It was under the Ministry of Economics, and was immediately after the Ministry presented the Report of the Commission making these temporary conditions of wages until the figure should be found. This letter was written to the Secretary of the Postal Union:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Provisional Government have given the most careful consideration to the recommendations submitted by the Commission in their Interim Report of the 11th May, 1922, a copy of which is enclosed.</P>
    <P>Pending the production of an official cost of living figure for Ireland, <Col N="302" /> and without prejudice to the adjustment of the remuneration failing to to be made when this figure is known, the Government are prepared to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission, subject to the condition that in no case shall the total remuneration, inclusive of bonus, of any Officer resulting from the application of this decision, exceed the remuneration which he would now enjoy if the reduction in bonus which took effect as from the 1st March last had not taken place.</P>
    <P>It must be clearly understood that the increases of remuneration resulting from the decision are purely temporary and provisional and will operate only until the official cost of living index figure has been produced by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were told that this 12½ per cent. added to their wage was only to remain on until the official cost of living index figure was found, and they made no demur. This Committee, which was to find the cost of living figure, found the figure.  It was a Departmental Committee&mdash;a Committee of the Ministry of Economics.  They found that the figure was 90 per cent. increase in the cost of living over 1914.  The figure for England and the North of Ireland was 85 per cent., and the result of the application of this figure of 90 per cent. to the bonus of the Postal workers will be that the salaries of postal workers in the 26 counties will be higher than the salaries of postal workers in England or in the six counties.  That cannot be contradicted. The figure was found before the 1st September, and the Government wrote to the Postal Union and told them that the figure would be applied, and the Postal Union took up the position that there was to be no reduction whatever until the whole question of the basic wage and re-organisation was inquired into.  They took up that position notwithstanding the Report of the Commission, and that they were specifically told by the Government three months before that their remuneration would be dependent on the official cost of living figure, and they then made no demur.  They said in general terms that this index figure that was found was incorrect, and that case has been made for them here.  They have published leaflets quoting certain figures from the Report of the Committee that found the index.  Now our position in that is quite <Col N="303" /> clear.  That figure was found by the Minister of Economics, and he is prepared to receive any evidence whatever that that figure is wrong.  He is ready to consider it and is ready to revise the figure if it is wrong.  If anybody can prove it is an incorrect figure, the right figure will be applied.  But what is the attitude of the postal workers?  They were not so very much concerned whether the figure was right or not.  Their attitude was that there should be no reductions in wages until a later date&mdash;until the whole question of the re-organisation of the Post Office should be inquired into.  Now that is a position which we cannot stand for and which we will not stand for.  In order to meet them we made this proposition which, I put it to you, is perfectly fair. We said that the figure first of all must apply.  It has been accepted and is applied to the rest of the Civil Service. It is higher, as I pointed out, than the scale in England and the six counties. In order to meet any possible grievances they might have, it was decided that the reductions should take place in two cute, one cut now and one cut at a later date, between, this and the 31st December. They made the claim that their basic wage was not sufficient.  The fact is their basic wage is exactly the same as the corresponding class in England, and in order to meet them, and to make ourselves absolutely right and put ourselves in an absolutely fair position we offered to take off this out of 12½ per cent. in two cuts, one now and one before the 31st December, and by that time this Postal Commission, which is still sitting, and still in operation, will have reported, and said whether the basic wage they complain of is right or wrong.  But they refused that, and they refused it because they knew&mdash;they realised that they had a condition&mdash;circumstances outside made the present a very suitable time for a strike.  They realised that they were administering a key service, and that by striking they could hold up&mdash;or they thought they could hold up&mdash;the whole Postal service of the country.  I call that blackmailing.</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to say that the strike all the present time is motived not I by any consideration of wages, but belief of the Postal officials that this is the proper time to strike&mdash;(Shame)&mdash;and that this is the proper time to get concessions whether they are concessions they are entitled to on the merits of the case, or not.  That is the position.  The Government will not deal with these men while they are on strike.  The Government cannot deal with these men while they are on strike.  They have made an offer&mdash; a perfectly fair offer&mdash;and cannot and will not go back on it or modify it in any respect.  I put it to the House that they ought to weigh these considerations very carefully.  We are not going to make any money.  The Government are not going to make any money out of the strike.  The wages of these officials will be paid out of taxation; out of the taxation of you and myself, and the man round the corner.</P>

Comparing them with the wages and salaries that are considered fair in other countries that are a lot better off, we have offered to pay them higher wages than they are paid in England or in the North.  We are a poorer country and have far more calls to meet, and that is a consideration. You are the trustees of the taxpayer, just as the Government is.  You have no right in a moment of generosity to give away money to Civil Servants or other bodies that they are not entitled to on the merits of the case.  The Government set out its position and the terms which they would give Civil Servants. They are terms accepted by the rest of the Civil Servants, and I ask this Dáil to give its support to the Government <Col N="305" /> in that attitude which they cannot and will not alter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of your ruling the Minister of Agriculture has got in quite a good deal beyond the merits of the strike, and I think I am entitled to refer to some of his statements. He began by detailing the history of the strike, in September, 1921, and wishes this Dáil to draw as a conclusion from his statement that the Postal workers did not strike then because the British Government were in power or they were the servants of the British Government.  I do not think there is any justification whatsoever for that inference, in view of the fact that we remember the Postal workers did actually strike while in the service of the British Government, and struck on a matter that it was more dangerous to strike on, than the question of wages.  When the next cut came due in March the Postal workers threatened to strike, though they did not threaten in September.  It may be just that it was the last straw, that they had reached the limit their wages could bear.  A Postal Commission was set up, and went into this matter, and as a matter of fact it did bear out the contention of the Postal workers, in the main, that their wages were such that they could not bear the cut that was made in March. The findings of the Commission have been mentioned by the Minister of Agriculture, and I think he led the Dáil to believe that the Government had accepted the findings of that Commission and put them into operation.  Subsequent events have proved apparently that this is not the case.  The Commission recommended temporary additions to basic wages and recommended that they date as from March 1st, and that they should be continued until the Irish cost of living figure was &ldquo;agreed to&rdquo; for use in the calculation of bonus or until the adoption of the final report of the Commission.  I want to draw the attention of the Dáil to this phrase &ldquo;agreed to,&rdquo; because in sending a letter to the Union the Postmaster-General used the words &ldquo;until the Irish cost of living figure is produced.&rdquo;  There is an immense difference, to my mind, between the two phrases.  I would like to ask the Postmaster-General or some member of the Government to say if the interpretation of this phrase &ldquo;agreed upon&rdquo; has been referred to the Commission, and, if so, will he tell us what <Col N="306" /> the reply of the Commission has been? It is important, I think, that the Dáil should know that, because a good deal will depend upon that particular phrase, but I would like to point out this, that the Minister of Agriculture lays great stress on the fact that these temporary increases were to continue until we had the entire cost of living figure produced, or agreed upon.  But what seem, to have been forgotten altogether is this&mdash;there was another alternative in the findings of the Commission; it was that they should be continued until the adoption of the final report of the Commission.  It was just as right and proper that that alternative should be taken as the other alternative, for it is not stated that the words which might have been included, &ldquo;whichever of these occurs first,&rdquo; are not there, and I say they are not there deliberately. Now I don't wish to go into the question of the cost of living figures for the very good reason I do not feel competent to do it.  I have only received the document this morning.  It was produced or appeared a day or two before this strike was called; and when we are challenged here with not producing evidence to show that the other evidence was wrong, it must be remembered we had not an opportunity of producing evidence to show it was wrong. I understand when some of the civil servants heard that this private committee of the Departmental officials were sitting they asked to be represented upon this in order to put their point of view before the Committee to find a cost of living figure that would affect their future status, and they were deliberately turned down. I make that statement subject to correction. If it is not true, the Ministers will say so.  I am informed by my colleagues that the Labour party also asked that they should be represented, and they too were also turned down.  Therefore I don't want to dwell on the cost of living figure at all, but I say it was a manifestly reasonable proposition that the postal workers should say that the other alternative should be accepted in view of the fact that the agreed cost of living had not been found from the workers' point of view and also from the public point of view.  The Commission issued this report last May, and it was a reasonable assumption that the final report would be ready before 1st September, and if it is not available, the fault does not lie either, with the Commission or with the postal workers.  I would <Col N="307" /> like to say this&mdash;the Commission to go into the whole question of the wages of postal workers is actually in being at the present time, and I would like to ask did the Government before the strike was precipitated refer the matter of the strike or the question at issue to the Commission. Men of ordinary commonsense would think that would be a reasonable attitude for the Government to take.  It set up a Commission, to go into the whole question of wages in the Post Office.  Here was a dispute in which the whole country would be involved, but it was never referred to the Commission to see whether anything could be done to prevent the strike or not.  The Minister for Agriculture has said that this strike has other motives behind it rather than what appears on the surface.  In my humble opinion there is absolutely no justification for that statement.  It seems to me he has taken up what I can only describe as a diehard attitude.  He says that they cannot deal with the men while they are on strike.  This is not the first time that a statement of that kind was made and had to be withdrawn. It reminds me very much of a Btatement made in another Parliament regarding other matters, but displaying the same spirit; and I think his statement will meet with the same answer.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell has practically covered all the points I intended to make but I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to the words, &ldquo;the terms to be agreed upon.&rdquo;  No terms were agreed upon.  We hear a great deal of men in employments breaking agreements, and here we have a case in which the Government represented on the Commission entered into an agreement with another body of men to wait until the scale of the cost of living had been agreed on.  Then they broke that agreement. Neither the Postmaster-General nor the Minister of Agriculture told us where they got the cost of living scale and how they arrived at the figure.  I am informed that last June the Government sent out 3,000 forms to the body of men Deputy O'Connell represents and these men were told that this form was to be used in accordance with an agreement.  They were told that the individual returns would be treated as strictly confidential and they would be used only in totting them in figures with the returns of a large number of other bodies in order to arrive at averages. <Col N="308" /> These forms were sent to small places in the West of Ireland trying to find out how the people lived and what rents they paid, and cost of food and other things. The rent which was paid for a small cottage in some far off village in the West of Ireland by a cottager might be either a shilling or two shillings per week, and these figures were taken in order to average with rents paid by postal employees in Dublin and other large centres where the rent of a similar cottage was from twelve to fifteen shillings.  They lotted these together and divided them with an imaginary figure, and then tried to impose them on the postal workers.</P>

I am not going to go into the merits or demerits of the strike, but suggest that we ought to adopt the motion which has been proposed by Mr. Darrell Figgis, and let us get some sane business men, other than politicians, look into this scale, and evolve some reasonable figure which can be established as an Irish cost of living.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. WALSH:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a few points in the speech to which we have just listened that I would like to refer.  I do not want to say very much, but as the Dáil may regard me as being one of the parties to the dispute which has occupied the attention of the Dáil for the past week, my silence might be open to misconception, seeing that my name has been so often introduced and that certain decisions or conclusions have been not quite accurately associated with my Department.  Deputy O'Connell, who happens to be more closely versed in the rights and wrongs of the Post Office position than anybody else&mdash;I venture to say&mdash;in this Dáil, because of the active part he took in these matters, has stated here that this Commission itself was not consulted prior to the precipitation of the strike.  The Commission was consulted in regard to its interpretation of <Col N="309" /> the words &ldquo;agreed on,&rdquo; and it is well that the Dáil should know that, at least, one member of that body was in a position to give an opinion as to what was in his mind in regard to these words. I will read the reply from the Secretary to the Commission.  He says: &ldquo;In making these recommendations the Commission did not mean to suggest an agreement between the Post Office staff and the Government before an Irish figure was applied, but they had in view the production of a carefully prepared index figure by the Irish Government which should be generally accepted by the people of Ireland, more especially by representatives of Commerce and Labour in much the same way as the English Board of Trade index figure is agreed on for use in England.  The Chairman and Mr. Friel, having read the report of the Committee on the Cost of Living, expressed their personal opinion that it had produced a figure such as the Commission had in view.  The other members, not having read the Report, could not express any opinion, and, in any case, the Commission as a whole does not feel competent to express any opinion as to the accuracy or not of the result.&rdquo;  That may not be very conclusive, but it was my duty to further probe the ideas of the interpretation of these words in the minds of those members of the Commission available, and I may say here, for the information of the Dáil, that certainly Mr. Friel was satisfied that if this figure was to be applied by the Government to the Civil Service, and if it is the intention of the Government to apply the index figure, it was his desire that the figure should be applied to the Post Office. I do not think that I misrepresent the Chairman of the Commission also when I say that that very clearly approximates to his view.  There is another point I cannot permit to pass unchallenged. It is this, that in the final stages of the dispute the Commission ought to have been consulted.  That is quite right. It is only right that the view of the Commission should be taken in some respect or another, and appreciating that view point the Chairman of the Commission interested himself in the dispute and made himself responsible for proposals on the lines of the Government's proposals, but the Union rejected them. Whether the Chairman had the support of the other members of the Commission <Col N="310" /> in mating these proposals, I cannot say; but, at any rate, he was available for us to consult and he made certain recommendations, and it could not be said, therefore, that he was not consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, there were several approaches.  I cannot say that the Government approached the Chairman of the Commission, but I certainly took it upon myself to approach the Chairman, and I take the responsibility for so doing. A very wide field has been covered here, and I think it is right we should all have our say.  We have time enough to discuss the merits of the introduction of a Special Commission, but the underlying fact which forces us to proceed very carefully in determining the wages of our employees in the, Post Office is the fact that the Irish Post Office is being run at a very great loss.  The present financial year will result in a debt to the taxpayers of this country to the tune of, at least, one-and-a-half million pounds; while, in the case of the Post Office in England and in East Ulster, it will result in a profit of at least ten millions.  In view of this very serious loss, when the proposal is made, as it has been made, that higher wages should be paid in this country than in England, we are justified, we are bound, in fact, to examine the facts and the figures associated with that application and to satisfy ourselves that any variation of the existing figures mast be based upon solid grounds.  The Postal officials are displaying certain figures through town, and it is stated that these officials are already underpaid.  Well, there are no officials or people in this world&mdash;at least I have not yet met them&mdash;who do not believe they are underpaid.</P>

We have here in Dublin men engaged in the simple work of sorting being paid a present <Col N="311" /> wage of over £6 per week.  It is no exaggeration to say that the work that these men are doing&mdash;and I think Deputy O'Connell will agree with me&mdash;is of so simple a character that a sufficient knowledge of some phases of it could be secured within the brief period of three or four weeks.</P>

      <P>Yes, there are.  When I used the word wages, I meant to include basic pay and bonus, and in the case of certain clerks and telegraphists at the maximum that wage represents over £6 per week before the cut.  In the case of female telegraphists, they receive after the cut at their maximum a basic wage and bonus running into the tidy sum of 73s. 2d., and it is because the Government decided to make the ordinary normal cut which fell due through the application of these figures, and which did not reduce these wages by a very appreciable figure, that the postal people went on strike.</P>

      <P>Railway clerks in Dublin, called upon to do much more difficult work than sorting clerks, are paid at least £70 a year lower wages, and £70 a year lower wages than the sorting clerks will receive when the bonus is fixed at £90, the cut which the Government proposes to enforce.  As regards postmen, a postman in Dublin receives in bonus and basic wage after the cut 73s. 7d. per week.  You may compare these wages with, say, the wages of a man employed on the <Col N="312" /> railways in a similar capacity.  What do we find?  We find that the traffic porter is receiving 50s. a week as against the postman's 73s.&mdash;73s. after the cut has taken place&mdash;and the goods porter who has got to do hard physical work receives 53s. 6d. per week, and the ticket collector who, it will be admitted, has got to face a reasonable amount of responsibility only receives 57s. per week and they have got to live in Dublin, and they have got to meet the high prices that you allege exist in Dublin.  Now, a point was made by Alderman Byrne a little while ago that the cost of living figure was largely secured from the West of Ireland.  The cost of living figure was secured from 500 different places in Ireland, and included every part of Ireland, Connemara as well as Dublin, and an average was taken, and an average was taken in 1914, and there was no difference in the two methods. And if a house is cheaper in Connemara than it is in Dublin, so also are the wages of postal officials in Connemara proportionately lower than they are in Dublin.  That point should be remembered when quoting the cost of living figures.  There is a great deal of capital made out of a Leaflet that has been issued in regard to houses which can be had at 5s. 4d. per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH:</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated a while ago this cost of living figure, has been produced on the very same lines applicable to the original cost of living figure.  That included, for instance, what labourers, fishermen, merchants, servants, barmen, carpenters, and a series of others are paid.  It also included the postal officials.  I daresay the originators of the cost of living method had in mind the fact that the postal official paid something higher than other classes in the way of rent, but that does not alter the situation, for the simple reason that if we take a higher rent and add the increase in the interval, we do not necessarily produce a higher cost of living figure, as you will find, if you take the trouble to work it out.  The fact is that the rent of a Postal Official and of all other workers has been made out on the one common plane, and if it happens that the postal official pays a higher rent than others, <Col N="313" /> it does not affect in the slighest the final result.  Naturally we feel that the disturbance in the communications of the country is an unfortunate thing at this stage.  We did all that was humanly possible to obviate the trouble, but there was a limit, and we were faced with that limit when we were faced with a statement that the postal officials would not now, or at any other time&mdash; this is our reading of their attitude&mdash; tolerate any reduction in their wages, tolerate any applications of the cost of living figure; then the end of negotiations came.  I agree with the Minister for Agriculture in what he believes to have been the frame of mind of the leaders of this Association.  I do not wish to raise what one would consider bad blood in this trouble at the present time, but I do feel this about it, that the ordinary worker in the Post Office was not a free agent in deciding whether this strike should take place or not.</P>

      <P>I want to impress on the House that the ordinary Post Office worker was not a free agent in deciding whether this strike should take place or not.  The speakers at a certain meeting here in Dublin, when the question of a strike, or no strike, was being discussed, threatened certain physical consequences to those who failed to own up, and failed to go on strike.  And it is because of that threat, and because of the application of that threat in the interval by the picketing of the private houses of members, and by threatening them through letters or by howling at them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH:</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I wish to make it clear that, as far as we are concerned, we had no desire to precipitate this trouble.  We were satisfied it was essential for the wellbeing of the community that peace should reign in an important industrial concern, and were also satisfied that we went to-the utmost lirait to maintain that peace; but when it is put up to us that a figure which is being accepted by Civil Servants generally, and which the Government intends to enforce, is not going to be accepted by the Post Office, well, we have no alternative.</P>

      <P>This has been an illuminating discussion.  I noted while your predecessor was in the Chair, and while Deputy O'Connell was protesting vigorously against the allegation that there were political motives behind the strike, that the Minister of Agriculture more than once attempted to rise in his place, and I wonder if I am interpreting his mind rightly in thinking he was calculating on the possibility of the Chairman declaring him out of order if he were to repeat that solemn asseveration that he had evidence to support what he said. However, I know now without speculation <Col N="315" /> and as a matter of fact from the Postmaster-General himself, that several Ministers are genuinely and sincerely convinced that they are not face to face with an ordinary strike, but with what wears the outward appearance of a strike, and is in reality a political movement intended to paralyse the work of the Government and to hinder the business of the country, and to aid the rebels in the field.  Now, that is a fair account of the mentality of the Government, or of the major part of it concerned in this dispute.  I think it is very clear that no arrangement can be arrived at, that no machinery of settlement will be useful. What is demanded is instant absolute and unconditional surrender of the Postal servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, let us consider the mentality of the strikers.  There is an obvious dissatisfaction on the part of those people with the procedure of the Government as outlined by the two Ministers&mdash;absolute dissatisfaction on the, part of the Postal workers with the procedure of the Government.  It must, indeed, seem to the ordinary plain man a very unhappy thing that, while the Commission appointed by the Government was investigating this very question of wages, a dispute of such magnitude and of such serious character should be precipitated. It seems to me that the point in dispute is really one which turns upon this question of figures regarding the cost of living. Now, I found it hard to believe, until I was assured of it by the Postmaster-General himself, that this estimate of the cost of living was arrived at in something like the fashion in which a cricketer's average is calculated&mdash;by adding together his entire score and dividing it by the number of innings in which he batted.  Surely Ireland, though predominantly an agricultural country, has in it a few towns, and the cost of living in the towns of the Eastern seaboard in connection with Great Britain is notoriously high because of that geographical fact.  The cost of living is lower in the country than in the rest of Ireland, and it should occur to any administrator of sanity to consider these two classes of cases apart&mdash;that the case <Col N="316" /> of the country worker and the case of the city worker should be separately considered.  There should be <i>two</i> estimates of living for a country so peculiarly circumstanced.  Now, here is the state of fact at the present moment: you have a non-possumus attitude on the part of the Ministry and an equally obdurate and determined attitude on the part of the men.  Meanwhile, the whole economic fabric is in danger of destruction, and business is at a standstill, and ail sort of uncertainty is rife.  Surely this is a moment then for the interference of the public, who are even more vitally concerned in the matter than the Government or Postal servants, because it is their interests that are at stake&mdash;the vital interest of the community. I fear that, is the desire to be brief, I am not so clear as I would desire. When Deputy Darrell Figgis proposes to have the matter investigated by Committees composed of Members of this Dáil it seems to me he is proposing the wrong machinery.  He Is setting up the wrong sort of Committee of Conciliation, because it has been declared repeatedly since we began to sit here that this Dáil is the Government of the Nation, and the Ministers are the servants thereof.  And this is a dispute between the servants of a Minister and the Ministry who are the servants of this Dáil.  Consequently, what I would suggest to Deputy Figgis is that instead of going on with this proposition that he should satisfy himself with a resolution to have some body of men with a view to conciliation appointed, and let them be citizens of standing&mdash;representative of the various business elements of Ireland, and not Members of this Dáil.</P>
