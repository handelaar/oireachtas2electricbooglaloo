      <P>I did not quite catch the whole of that question. I understand in certain constituencies there are other means of travelling than <Col N="1637" /> by railways.  If that is the point it is a matter upon which the Committee furnished no report, and as my information goes there are two such constituencies in Ireland.  In one case I think there is a certain advantage to Deputies living in that constituency, and in the other case no claim has been made in respect of any allowance other than those recommended by the Committee.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to a statement of the Chairman of Dublin Port and Docks Board, published in the evening papers on Thursday, October 12th, to the effect that the withdrawal or discontinuance of Government grants would stop the Board's improvement schemes, and that 300 men would be thrown out of employment; if he is aware that valuable remunerative port improvements, including the providing of a deep water berthage, were in hands and in the course of construction; if he will now take steps to prevent the dismissal of the 300 men mentioned by the Chairman, and reconsider the application for the continuance of the Government grant first issued by the Lord St. David's Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE MINISTER for FINANCE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  In connection with the improvement scheme of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the Government have already provided £18,500 towards the relief of unemployment.  In view of the general financial position, I regret that it is not possible to provide further funds at the rate at which they have hitherto been provided for these works by the Government.  If, however, any proposals involving the Government in a substantially smaller liability were submitted by the Board I would give them consideration, but I am unable to give any undertaking in the matter.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether he is aware that it is becoming quite a common practice in the Dublin Market and county fairs for members of a labour <Col N="1638" /> organisation to approach the owners of live stock, picket them, and prevent by violence, as in the case of Mr. Hammond at the September fair of Tinahely, the sale of animals offered, the reason alleged being that the owners of the live stock had in their employment certain workers who did not belong to a labour organisation.  If in the absence of trade dispute such picketing, apart from methods of violence, is lawful, and, if not, what steps are to be taken to prevent the recurrence of such practices, which are detrimental to the farming industry and constitute a serious attack on the liberty of the citizen.</P>

On the broad question of peaceful picketing, I am not in a position to advise the Deputy without further particulars of the practices of which he complains as the issue is a legal one.</P>

      <P>Consideration will necessarily be given to the effect of freight charges on the cost of foodstuffs by the forthcoming Commission on the Prices of Essential Commodities and probably by the Agricultural Commission.  The question of railway rates will also arise on the reports of the Railway Commission. <Col N="1639" /> Until the conclusions of these Commissions have been considered I would not feel justified in setting up another special investigation.  With regard to the last part of the question, I have no power under existing legislation to reduce railway rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided to transfer the Borstal Institute from Clonmel in order to leave the premises at the disposal of the Minister for Defence, who urgently required them for Military purposes.  Clogheen Workhouse was selected as the most suitable alternative location for the Institute as a result of an inspection of various suggested places and particularly as it possesses all the essential requirements for Boys and Staff.  The place is in perfect repair, is lighted throughout with electricity and is provided with an independent water supply and up-to-date sanitary accommodation.  There is all the necessary accommodation for inmates, officers, workshops and gymnasium. The question of transferring the Institute to Clonmel cannot be considered until the Military exigencies permit of it.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Education whether it is proposed to discontinue the payment of special fees for teachers of Irish outside school hours, and also the bilingual fees; if so, whether it is proposed to consider the question of compensating teachers who have hitherto been in receipt of such fees because of their contemplated discontinuance; also to ask the Minister if he will state when the fees due on account of the year ended 30th June, 1922, will be paid, and what will be the procedure in the case of classes which it was not possible to have examined before that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new programme no provision is made for the teaching of Irish as an extra subject outside school hours, and accordingly the payment of special fees for this purpose disappears.  In the case of schools in which the bilingual programme was sanctioned in the past the question of additional remuneration to the teachers is under consideration, but no final decision has yet been taken on the subject. The delay in payment of fees for the year ended 30th June last has been due to the fact that Inspectors' reports for many schools, especially in remote districts, were delayed owing to the condition of the country.  Three-fourths of the claims have now been dealt with, and it is hoped to have the remainder paid within the month.  An effort will be made to deal equitably with the claims of classes which it was not found possible to have examined.</P>

    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>  It is a fact that some candidates who passed in the First Division have not been called to training, while others who did not pass in the First Division have been called.  This is due to the fact that the &ldquo;order of merit&rdquo; candidates for admission to Training Colleges is based on the total marks awarded, including &ldquo;service marks&rdquo; and certain marks in optional subjects, while the classification in divisions is based on the marks received in obligatory subjects only.  Candidates who have not been monitors, pupil teachers, junior assistant mistresses, are not awarded service marks, and it can be readily understood that such a candidate might get First Division on the obligatory subjects, but at the same time might get a much lower grand total of marks than an ex-monitor or pupil teacher who only got Second Division, but had afterwards the benefit of service marks and marks for optional subjects.</P>

      <P>The regulations applying to claimants of unemployment benefit are devised so as to minimise inconvenience so far as is consistent with reasonable economy and with proper safeguards in administration. Claimants living six miles or over from the nearest Employment Exchange or Branch Employment Office are required to attend once only, and are thereafter paid by post.  If the claimant lives less than six miles and more than four miles away, he attends once a week; less than four and more than 2, on alternative days. To utilise local post offices in addition to the existing local office of the Ministry for the payment of benefit would involve an increase in administration expenses, which would not be justified in present circumstances.</P>

Hitherto the cottages have been built in rural areas under the special provisions of the Labourers Acts.  If it is represented that any further provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts should be made applicable to rural areas, the matter will be carefully considered.

      <P>The facts are correctly stated in the first part of the question. The average cost of building compared with 1914, as presumed in the question, is possibly correct, having regard to the high prevailing costs of which we have actual experience in the cases of State-aided urban housing schemes.  Correspondence is proceeding with the British Government with the object of securing that advances for the purposes of the Labourers Acts may be resumed where loans had been sanctioned but not fully <Col N="1646" /> issued by the British Government.  Heretofore advances from Land Purchase Funds were confined within prescribed limits per cottage, the most recent limit being three-quarters of the cost.  It is doubtful to what extent, if any, it may be possible to issue supplemental loans from Irish Government Funds to meet extra building costs in view of the depreciation in Land Stock generally and the heavy financial liabilities of the Government. The Government's policy as regards the resumption of rural housing is receiving consideration.</P>

      <P>The date as set out in this question is not quite correct.  In February last the Killarney Urban District Council requested sanction to a loan <Col N="1648" /> for the purpose of extending a sewer at St. Mary's Lane.  The Council's engineer submitted his plans and estimate (£669) on March 4th.  These were returned to the engineer by the Department's Engineering Inspector with advice as to necessary alterations.  The revised plans were submitted and approved, and sanction was sent out on April 4th.  A month later a new set of plans was submitted, including a water main which it was proposed to lay beside the sewer at an estimated cost of £810.  This was not approved by the Department.  A week later the engineer's estimate was increased to £988.  The Council failed to secure a contractor to lay the sewer and water main even at the increased price. It will be seen they had discarded the scheme which had been sanctioned, and were inviting tenders in connection with a scheme which did not have the approval of the Ministry of Local Government. It was then proposed to have the work done by direct labour.  The Department offered no objection to this proposition, but repeatedly refused to sanction the laying of a sewer and water main in one trench.  The Council eventually submitted plans with which the Department was satisfied.  These were forthwith sanctioned.  Date of sanction, August 21st.</P>

That much clerical work is expected of them, combined with a corresponding intelligence in understanding the Classification of books, and the comparative excellence of books as authorities.  Whether he will define the duties upon which the Assistants in the Library are daily engaged.  Whether there are several with 15 years and upwards established service whose basic salary amounts to less than £80 per annum.  Whether in his report to the Council of Trustees of the National Library for 1921-22 (May, 1922) the Chairman stated that &ldquo;the increases allowed are less than those put forward as equitable by the Trustees over three years ago, before the recent general rise in prices and salaries had taken place,&rdquo; and this being so, the Minister will give an undertaking to institute an immediate inquiry into the salaries paid to this Staff, as they are utterly inconsistent with the recommendations of the Reorganisation Committee and do not constitute a just return for services rendered.</P>

      <P>It is not feasible to give a precise definition of the daily duties of the National Library Assistants, as these duties are very varied and range from the cleaning and dusting of books to clerical work.  The amount of clerical work similarly varies greatly, and is determined <Col N="1650" /> by the length of hours of public service, and the seniority and consequent experience of the Assistants.</P>
      <P>Detailed information as to the duties of Assistants in the British Museum of Printed Books is not available, so that a comparison of duties cannot be made.</P>
      <P>The statement that there are several assistants with 15 years and upwards established service, whose basic salary amounts to less than £80 per annum is not correct.</P>
      <P>The Chairman of the Trustees of the National Library has made the statement quoted in his report for the year 1921-22, but the rise in prices to which he refers has been met by the award of a bonus based on the official index cost of living figure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN Mr. P. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The College of Science is closed for military reasons.  Our military advisers informed us that as a result of the information which they had at their disposal they could not be answerable for the protection of the Government offices unless the College of Science was closed.  There is no necessity to go into the reasons now.  Having regard to that advice, there was no option but to close it.  I take it that we are all agreed about that.  I take it also that it will be agreed that the question at issue is not the closing of certain buildings, but the necessity of seeing that the students are not seriously handicapped by the closing of these buildings. To a great extent the same subjects and the same courses are being taught in University College, Dublin, as in the College of Science.  Further, the practical work done in the laboratories of the College of Science can, to a very great extent, be done in the laboratories of University College.  When the College of Science was closed, the President of University College, Dublin, very generously offered to place all facilities afforded by the University at the disposal of the College of Science even to admit College of Science students to its classes.  This offer of Dr. Coffey was accepted, and it means that, as far as the greater number of the students of the College of Science are concerned, immediate arrangements can be made for them in University College, Dublin, and a large number of first year students attended at University College to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, Dr. Coffey offered to place a part of 68 St. Stephen's Green at the disposal of the College of Science for classes which are not taught at the University. When these arrangements are completed all the College of Science classes will be provided for, with the possible exception of the practical work in Engineering, and I am hopeful that this <Col N="1654" /> can be arranged for in a very short time. Arrangements will also be made to hold the usual College of Science examinations, and in this way it will be ensured that no student of the College of Science is prejudiced by what has happened. Trinity College has also very kindly offered to provide any facilities required.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of agitation in regard to the closing of the College of Science which has had no connection with the question of providing facilities for the students, but was motived by the fear that the College of Science would not be re-established in its original position.  On this subject I would like to say a word.  There are a great many anomalies connected with the College of Science.  It is an anomaly to have one educational establishment in Merrion Street under the Ministry of Agriculture, and another at Earlsfort Terrace under the Minister of Education, both teaching to a great extent the same subjects.  There is no reason whatever for duplication so far as there is duplication, and this question will have to be considered when the College of Science is reconstructed.  When it is reconstructed, however, it will be reconstructed in accordance with the merits of the case, and there is no intention of taking advantage of a mere accident to effect a special arrangement.  On the other hand, there is no intention of allowing this accident to prevent reconstruction when the time for reconstruction comes.</P>
    <P>Further, it should be quite clear that any reconstruction should not be undertaken through motives of economy.  On the contrary, if there is one direction in which we cannot afford to economise it is education, especially agricultural and technical.  One of the scandals of the former regime in Ireland was the disproportion between the very small amounts spent on education and the very large amounts spent on administration.  An alteration in this disproportion will, in my opinion, do more for agriculture than any reform.</P>

It will depend what distance reconstruction has gone; but when it is reconstructed, however, it will be reconstructed in accordance with the merits of the case, and there is no intention of taking advantage of a mere accident to effect a special arrangement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the more reason why it should be discussed so that there may be no doubt about it; as I understood and as I know other members understood, the death penalty was not going to be inflicted until we in this Dáil had seen the exact Regulations under which it was proposed the death penalty should be inflicted.  I am told I may be wrong.  The resolution passed by the Dáil is substantially reported in the newspaper; and it will be found in Volume 14 of the Dáil Reports as well as the newspapers of the past few days.  It provides for an inquiry by the Military Courts into the various offences, but there is no law and no regulation of this Dáil or any other body under which penalties for these offences can be prescribed until such time as Regulations are passed by the Dáil.  The document providing for the making of the Regulations should be laid on the table of this Dáil.  That has not been done.</P>

We will work formally and steadily through the amendments, and merely ask in view of the conditions here, and in view of the political conditions in England that speakers will not be diffuse, but that having put their particular points they would have sufficient faith in the ability of the Dáil to appreciate and digest them without very much elaboration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>At the first reading it will be remembered I moved a motion for an amendment to insert a certain clause as the Preamble, or, in place of the Preamble that was then printed. When we received the Order Paper, and saw the exact form in which the Bill was to be presented to the Dáil, it was apparent that the form in which I had moved the amendment was not quite applicable to the new form in which the Bill was presented, and after some discussion I withdrew the proposal with the promise that I would bring it forward in another form later.  Certain changes have been made in one of the clauses of the Constitution, and certain assurances or statements have been made by Ministers touching another clause of the amendment which I proposed, which made it unnecessary, I think, for me to move these particular portions of the Preamble which I first gave notice of.  But I am moving the amendment which now appears in my name, to be placed not in the Preamble of the Schedule, <i>i.e.</i>, the Constitution, but in the first paragraph of the Bill itself.  If this amendment were accepted the paragraph would read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this Provisional Parliament acknowledging that all lawful authority <Col N="1659" /> comes from God to the people, hereby declares that: the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland is indefeasible; that the Nation's sovereignty extends not only to all the men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions; the Nation's soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the Nation: `In the exercise of our undoubted right and in the confidence that we shall thus restore our National life and unity, Dáil Eireann hereby proclaims the establishment of Saorstát Eireann and decrees and enacts as follows.' &rdquo; I ask permission to delete the word &ldquo;hereby.&rdquo; The amendment asks the Dáil to make formal declaration without any challenging intention, but to put on record in this Bill certain phraseology which will make it clear to future generations that this was not a formal renunciation of the claims that Ireland has made in the past of sovereignty&mdash; the sovereignty of the nation.  I think that the amendment as suggested conforms absolutely with every declaration that has been made by Ministers.  It asserts that Ireland, a united Ireland, is under the control of the people of Ireland, and it guards against the possibility of its being said that Ireland has renounced certain rights which have been claimed from time immemorial.  It would ensure that Ireland did not give away the right to ultimate control, when she so desired, of certain ports which have been conceded to the guardianship of another.  It also asserts that no act of this Dáil is consenting to the possible handing over of the material resources of the nation to any foreign capitalistic or other corporations or institutions.  It asserts in the front of this Bill what every person believes; and I think it is desirable that that should be done, to prevent the possibility of its being declared that in the passing of this Constitution the rights that Ireland has claimed were to any degree renounced.  If this were inserted, then I take it that the meaning of this Act would be that the claim that Ireland has made in the past she still makes, but in the exercise of the right of the people of Ireland, an engagement has been entered into to enable the country to carry on satisfactorily, in view of the compulsion of circumstances, by agreement with another country, in regard <Col N="1660" /> to certain rights which for the moment are relinquished I do not think that any charge can be made against this clause; that there is an apology for the Treaty contained in it.  It would simply be a formal declaration in the first Act of this Parliament of the position that all Irishmen who have taken part in the recent struggle, and all Irishmen, I think, who have taken part in any national struggle, have maintained.  I believe that it is a very desirable thing, in view of the whole history of Ireland's agitation, that some declaration of this kind should appear in the opening paragraph of the first Act of this Dáil.  I beg to move this amendment to the Preamble.</P>

      <P>I have an amendment which I think meets the purpose of that amendment, and which if I may say so, meets the purpose better. The amendment is: &ldquo;To delete Article 12 and to substitute `all the lands and waters, mines and minerals, within the territory of the Irish Free State hitherto vested in the State, or any Department thereof, or held for the public use or benefit, and also all the natural resources of the same territory (including the air and all forms of potential energy), and also all royalties arising within that territory shall, from and after the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, belong to the Irish Free State, subject to any Trusts, Grants, Leases or concessions then existing in respect thereof, or any valid private interest therein, and shall be controlled and administered by the Parliament, in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation, but the same shall not, nor shall any part thereof, be alienated, but may in the public interests be from time to time granted by way of lease or licence to work under the authority and subject to the control of the Parliament.  Provided that no such lease or licence may be made for a term exceeding ninetynine years, beginning from the date thereof, and no such lease or licence may be renewable by the terms thereof.&rdquo; That amendment meets, in my view, at any rate, all that Deputy Johnson claims <Col N="1661" /> for his particular amendment, and has the advantage in the Constitution what we consider an advantage over the other amendment that it is not poetry, but very explicit and very carefully worded prose.  We prefer the amendment that stands on the paper and we would ask the Dáil to accept it.</P>

      <P>I suggest there is a good deal to be said for keeping this particular title in the Bill, whatever might be said about the subsequent titles.  There is something to be said for keeping this title, &ldquo;Fundamental rights,&rdquo; so far as it reads now.  I do not know how it can be done without unbalancing the whole Bill.  But if the Minister could see his way to do it in an amendment I would urge him to do it.</P>

      <P>I suggested before, and may I briefly repeat the substance of it, that if we had as part of the Preamble a recital to the effect that a Treaty has been entered into between Great Britain and the Irish people, that under that Treaty Ireland takes such and such a place, reciting the words of the Treaty, it would be possible, then, to take what is Article 1&mdash;&ldquo;Fundamental Rights&rdquo;&mdash;up into the Preamble as a recital, and I think it is to get over this difficulty that the present alteration is being suggested.  It is not a &ldquo;fundamental right&rdquo; in any proper sense of the word that the Irish Free State should be a coequal member of the Community of Nations, and the awkwardness of asserting that it is can be easily got over, as I suggest, by the machinery of recitals.  Then everything that follows after that statement is in the nature of a &ldquo;fundamental right.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think the objection moved by the Minister is in consequence of an objection that was moved by somebody or other that the Statute, when it became a Statute, might be misconstrued by reference to the headlines of particular sections, and it was feared that because some particular section was headed &ldquo;Financial Control&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fundamental Rights,&rdquo; as the case may be, the Courts might import some misconstruction from the headline.  It is of immense convenience to have a long Constitution of this kind, particularly a Statute that does create a Constitution, divided into convenient sub-heads for the purpose of reference and otherwise; and I rather think the very Deputy who supported this amendment, and who advocated it at an earlier stage, is now asking that in future reprints of this Statute these sub-heads should be continued.  I wonder if the Ministry would consider the advisability of putting in at the end of <Col N="1666" /> this Constitution that the headings shall not be used for the purpose of construing the Statute.  I have seen such a provision in other long Statutes which do contain sub-heads.  I do not think there is anything irregular in doing that.  It would enable this Statute, when it comes to be circulated and used by the public hereafter, to be sub-divided, as it has been throughout these debates, without incurring the risk which Deputy Figgis and Deputy Duffy referred to at earlier stages&mdash;the risk of having the enactment itself misconstrued by a reference to a sub-head.  I do not press the point; possibly it has been considered and rejected. If it has not been considered, I think it is well worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>I adhere to the amendment.  I have in a series of amendments to remove these sectional headings.  These amendments were moved largely because of the scope that is given for talk, if they stay in&mdash;talk here and perhaps elsewhere.  They do not fulfil any vital function.  If they are to remain as part of the Constitution, they will need to be carefully discussed and perhaps it will be necessary to go into Committee first of all to decide exactly what the sub-headings would be, and where they would be put.  The object of moving to leave them out was simply because they are not necessary, and as Deputy Figgis has said, in later stages, when the Constitution is being published, these explanatory sub-headings can be put in anywhere we wish.</P>

      <P>The amendment in my name reads: &ldquo;Article 3.&mdash;To introduce after the opening words `Every person' the words `without distinction of sex.' &rdquo; The first line will then read &ldquo;Every person without distinction <Col N="1667" /> of sex, domiciled,&rdquo; etc.  In the original draft, it will be remembered, this clause ended with the words &ldquo;men and women have equal rights as citizens.&rdquo; That, I take it, was in the nature of a definition, because as you are all aware, there are contexts in Statutes, on which Courts have been bound to hold that the proper interpretation was that &ldquo;person&rdquo; meant a man.  Now if we have no indication here that leaves it beyond all doubt that &ldquo;person&rdquo; means both man and woman we shall have a number of anomalous positions created in the later Articles. For example, &ldquo;the dwelling of each citizen is inviolable.&rdquo; Is a woman a citizen and is her dwelling inviolable? &ldquo;All citizens of the Irish Free State have a right to free elementary education.&rdquo; Has a girl or woman the right to free elementary education? It is simply by way of definition that I propose you add those words.  They add nothing, I think, in substance, because, I take it, the original draft represented the mind of the Ministry on the matter and so this will be acceptable.</P>

      <P>I beg to second this amendment.  I had the same amendment on the paper, and I use the same arguments that Deputy Magennis has used, reinforcing them by referring to quite a number of subsequent articles, where the need would arise of making sure that citizens include women as well as men.  The very fact that in the last reading there was a removal of the last sentence of the last clause to form a new article, and an alteration in the phraseology, makes it essential that there should be a formal definition that every person who has become a citizen includes women as well as men.  I think it will be recognised that this is merely a formal matter, but it is rather important that it should be defined in the opening sentence.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned I would be prepared to accept this particular amendment, but I want to make it clear that in doing so, I do not accept some of the implications that have been put up in connection with the case that has been made for women having equal rights of citizenship.  I think that was the original term that was knocked out.  That has implications which, I explained at the Committee stage, and which, as far as I am concerned, <Col N="1668" /> I am not prepared to accept.  I am not prepared to accept the proposition that if having once passed a single clause with regard to this matter in the Constitution that we have to set about searching the archives of Acts of Parliament, decrees and soforth, and to regulate the position according to what is found there.  The interpretation we had was that no disability would be suffered by women as against men.  We certainly had not in our minds the change of the Income Tax laws or other matters, such as a man's responsibility for the upkeep of his wife and children, and so on. Neither had we in our minds laws anticipatory of marriage settlements or anything like that.  That is the position.  We will agree to accept alterations so far as the ordinary acceptance of equal political rights, and rights of citizenship are concerned, but not of a position which will put us into a difficulty to pass certain laws to regulate this whole procedure. We are not accepting that, but on the lines of citizenship&mdash;that is, to make them citizens, as intended&mdash;I am prepared to accept that and nothing more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rather an important amendment I am about to propose, and I think it will be acceptable. In Article 3, about the middle of the Article as originally drafted, and as passed on the last Reading, we come across these words &ldquo;And who have been ordinarily resident in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.&rdquo; My suggestion is that we should use that same descriptive phrase, &ldquo;in the area of the jurisdiction,&rdquo; in the first part of this Article and in two or three subsequent Articles, and my reason for asking that to be done is as follows: I believe it is accepted that, following the Treaty, Ireland is Saorstát Eireann.  The whole of Ireland constitutes the Irish Free State under the Treaty, but in certain circumstances Dáil Eireann is prepared to forego its jurisdiction over a part of that geographical area.  If we use this phrase, &ldquo;the area of the jurisdiction,&rdquo; it does retain the sense of geographical unity; but with the relinquishment in present circumstances, and until new circumstances arise, perhaps by agreement, of the legal authority over part of that geographical area.  If that is the position&mdash;I <Col N="1669" /> think Ministers have accepted that view&mdash;then we ought to insert the phrase in other parts of this particular Article, and in one other Article later on, as we have done in the middle of the Article.  We have used the phrase &ldquo;The area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State,&rdquo; which implies that it is that part of the Irish Free State over which Dáil Eireann or the Oireachtas will exercise the authority, but it retains the possibility that that area of jurisdiction may be increased eventually to cover the whole of the country, Ireland, the Irish Free State.  It may seem to be a nice legal point or a matter of phraseology, but I think it is important.  I think it ought to be acceptable, and it will not destroy the harmony of the Bill in any way, because, as a matter of fact, it is using the same phrase in other parts that has been used in one part.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move to delete Article 4 which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Men and women have equal political rights,&rdquo; and to insert the following Article:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Men and women are guaranteed equal rights of citizenship; and unless otherwise debarred by law, shall be eligible, without distinction, for public office and employment according to their abilities and attainments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The original Article which I move to delete limits the rights of women citizens to political rights, and I daresay the principle of law would then apply <i>expressio unius exclusio alterius.</i>  That they could have no other than political rights is a necessary implication or declaration of the Constitution that they have political rights.  Now what is proposed here&mdash;&ldquo;Men and women are guaranteed equal rights of citizenship&rdquo;&mdash;has been spoken against in some measure by anticipation by the President just now.  A number of highly educated and notable Irishwomen supporters of the Treaty, and residents in this city have circularised Deputies with this circular and they have provided us very definitely with citations from the recent Constitutions of the States of Europe, in regard to this question of the relationship of women to the State.  The Constitution of Poland, Article 96, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All Citizens are equal before the law. Public employment is open in the same degree to all under conditions prescribed by law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 7 of the Austrian Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All Citizens of the Federation shall be equal before the law. Privileges of birth, sex, position, class and religion are abolished.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The new Constitution of Germany, Article 109, states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All Germans are equal before the law. Men and women have fundamentally the same civic rights and duties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And Article 128 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All Citizens of the State without distinction are eligible for public offices as provided by law in accordance with their qualifications and abilities.  All exceptional provisions against women officials are annulled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 106 of the Czecho-Slovakia Constitution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Privileges of sex, birth, or occupation shall not be recognised.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> And the Article from the Bavarian Constitution, dealing with the same subject says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every Member of the Bavarian State who has completed 20 years is a Citizen of the State without distinction of birth, sex, creed, or occupation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a notable distinction between the claims set out in these Articles I have just read and what is actually claimed in my amendment.  We are all aware that the phrase &ldquo;equal before the law&rdquo; is susceptible of many interpretations. As an ordinary conventional formula it is by way of indicating what is indicated here, what I read from the German Constitution, that &ldquo;men and women have fundamentally the same civic rights and duties,&rdquo; and that is why when reading the Article from the German Constitution I emphasised the word &ldquo;fundamental.&rdquo; To guarantee to women equal rights of citizenship with men is not guaranteeing to women the right to do or to have the same things as men. Unfortunately the exigency of the time does not allow me to argue all these points and therefore I appear in the unhappy position of stating these truths dogmatically Now we do not allege that men and women are equal.  I have no intention of drawing this House into a discussion as to the alleged equality of men with women or the alleged equality of women with men, These are highly disputable points and fortunately are irrelevant to the present issue.  I dare say that most of us will agree that as regards that very supreme service which Woman renders to the State that of itself is an incident which will have the effect of imposing a heavy handicap upon her in her competition with men.  If all the barriers which could be removed by law were to be removed there would still remain this great barrier that a woman is a woman and not a man. I therefore do not take up the foolish position of thinking that by any draftsmanship, or any amendment to the Constitution, that we could remove the irremovable.  But within the limits of Nature, and in view of what women are capable of, and have shown themselves capable of, and in view also of some of the things in which men have displayed their lamentable incapacity, it is merely proposed that this amendment should provide Equality of Opportunity. Equality of opportunity is <Col N="1673" /> the great demand of Democracy.  Not that men shall be put into one selfsame category by an artificial declaration. Men are bound to be unequal. It is purely artificial and arbitrary to declare that they are not.  But at the same time what is demanded in the name of Democracy for every individual is equality of opportunity.  Now as regards the second part of this claim the words are taken largely from the declaration in the German Constitution that all citizens, without distinction, of the State are eligible for public office as provided by law.  The amendment here is &ldquo;that unless otherwise debarred by law,&rdquo; etc.  I have two things in mind, in the second portion of the amendment; one is, I look forward to the setting up of a National Civil Service, which would be controlled by an Irish Civil Service Commission, and under the regulations to be made by that Commission we should get rid of the jobbing and political lobbying and all these other things, which have unfortunately, as history shows, marred the progress of young democratic States. But I have also in view that it may be necessary at the same time to deprive offenders against the Constitution or against the State or against the laws of citizenship, and room is left in the wording of this Constitution for legislation to that effect.  It might be held afterwards that it was contrary to the Constitution to prohibit A B or C D from holding office in the Free State.  Because it was declared that all were to have equal rights and the consequence of equality.  So the provision &ldquo;that unless otherwise debarred by law, shall be eligible&rdquo; leaves room for a variety of things in point of law.  Now, on the first occasion that this question was before us, and just a few minutes ago, our attention was drawn to certain inequalities at present existing.  Now, many of these, are in the nature of privileges for women, or at least, are so described by a misuse of language.  Some of these privileges are really insulting and offensive to women&mdash;I refer now to some of the institutions under the CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ACT&mdash;some others of them involve an inherent injustice, and right-minded women would not ask for a continuance of such privileges.  For example, &mdash;a wealthy wife, separated by her own fault from her husband, is not chargeable for the maintenance of her children, where the father is unable to provide suitably <Col N="1674" /> for them.  There is another type of &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;&mdash;it is in the realm of chivalry, or of so much of chivalry as has survived in the modern world, and this would be enjoyed still, as being part of the flower of civilization, no matter what the law is made.  I do agree with the President&mdash;I generally do agree with the President&mdash;it would not be advisable to put into the Constitution a declaration of something which would have the effect of sweeping away a whole lot of existing laws.  Afterwards, these laws will have to be dealt with in their own time.  There is an article later in the Constitution providing for the continuance of the present system, at least until such time as provision shall be made for changing them.  And the original Article&mdash;or rather the Article which I am moving to delete&mdash;has itself been guilty of this very fault, which I am anxious to avoid, because, by limiting the rights of women to political rights&mdash; it has, in effect, repealed a Statute recently passed, known as &ldquo;The Sex Disqualification Removal Act.&rdquo; Therefore, I am quite willing to echo the criticism of anyone who reprehends an operation of this type, by a phrase and formula in an Article of the Constitution of either doing away with existing legislation, without more ado or introducing new and perhaps important legislation.  Whether the words convey exactly what I desire, the intention is to provide equality of opportunity for women as well as men.  It is not demanded that certain offices should be reserved for women, and commonsense, of course, will operate, irrespective of laws and there will be always employments in which women will be given preference.  No one, for instance, would dream of appointing a man to be a warder in a woman's prison. There are cases like that, quite a number of them, which might safely be left to ordinary common sense.  There are employments too which, I dare say, would be better fitted for women, and there are other employments more suited to men.  These employments should be open to them according to their ability and attainments.  So there is merely a principle asserted that they should be equal as regards the fundamentals of citizenship.  That leaves room for a great deal of legislation&mdash;that they should be equally eligible for public service, such as for service on jury and employment <Col N="1675" /> such as in the Civil Service, and according to what they are able to accomplish in the way of satisfying certain tests to which they may be submitted.</P>

      <P>I support as much of this amendment as obviously asserts the right of women.  I disapprove of so much of it as takes away that right from them.  The Deputy who spoke last may be assured that if his objection to the clause is that he will not be entitled to give his seat up to a lady in future in a 'bus, that objection is not well founded. That was the objection raised by Ministers on the last occasion.  As the proud inventor of the phrase &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; as a substitute for &ldquo;as citizens,&rdquo; I am very glad that Deputy Magennis proposes that that phrase should be used, but he goes on to say that, unless otherwise debarred by law, women shall be eligible for certain things.  By putting in the phrase &ldquo;unless otherwise debarred by law&rdquo; he takes all the virtue out of the rest of the sentence. There is no use in providing in the Constitution that women shall be eligible for certain things, if. in the same breath, you provide that the law may take that away from them.  He provides that women shall be eligible for certain offices, and by the very fact of making that provision we will be told hereafter that they are not eligible for other offices.  He starts by an assertion of equal citizenship and then he goes on and specifies equality in certain respects, thereby implying there is inequality in other respects.  I suggest he ought to stop at the word &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; and say &ldquo;Men and women are granted equal rights of citizenship.&rdquo; By so doing he gets all he wants.  The rest is either <Col N="1676" /> redundant or contradictory, and I hope he will see his way to leaving it out. As to the objection raised to the words &ldquo;of citizenship,&rdquo; if Ministers still persist in objecting to these words, I hope they will be able to tell us quite plainly and clearly what are the provisions of the law which they consider to be injuriously affected by this amendment.  We were told the last time, if we passed the phrase in which the wording then was &ldquo;equal rights as citizens,&rdquo; women might claim certain things to which they are not entitled under the present law.  I do not think that can apply to any restriction of their rights under the laws relating to husband and wife.  I should be very glad to hear of any specific case in which it is said that the law will be altered in an undesirable manner by the passage of this amendment, because, I would ask the Dáil to observe that it is not enough to say &ldquo;We do not like to use the words `as citizens' or `of citizenship ' &rdquo; without knowing what they mean.  If these words are objected to, surely we are entitled to something quite definite as to the objection. Let us know exactly what are the additional rights it is suggested we are conferring on women and which ought not to be conferred on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>To trace the Government's attitude on this matter involves some little history.  Article 3, as originally drafted, contains as its last sentence &ldquo;Men and women shall have equal rights as citizens.&rdquo; Now we do not think that that Article or that sentence as it stood was dangerous.  We do not think that it conveyed anything more than that they would have equal political rights; but presently criticism reached us on that particular clause, asking did we propose to repeal by a couple of words in the Constitution what a very considerable body of law had recognised&mdash;a distinction between the sexes which provides for certain obvious inequalities that have always existed and, despite what anyone may say to the contrary, do still exist.  Now it is understandable that, while having a very definite view in our own minds that these words would not repeal these laws, we were yet anxious to avoid raising what might bid fair to be a very angry controversy, and so we changed the Constitution slightly and inserted as a new Article.  &ldquo;Men and women have equal political rights&rdquo;; for we did <Col N="1677" /> not wish to have it in doubt for a moment that we had any intention of repealing in the Constitution such very important laws as the following existing laws&mdash;as to the guardianship of children, the existing law with reference to marital coercion and crime.  That is a matter in which women have a certain privilege.  They are entitled to go into Court and say they committed a crime under duress of their husbands; husbands, unfortunately, are not entitled to go into Court and say they committed a crime under the duress of their wives. The existing rule of the Civil Service under which women on marriage are required to retire on gratuity; the existing provision in regard to married women's settlements&mdash;that is a protection for women and a very valuable protection without which I venture to say many women and their children would have found themselves in a serious position, because a second husband would have otherwise disposed of the marriage settlement; the existing position under income tax laws, by which the husband makes a set of deductions for the family&mdash;children and wife&mdash;and so on.  It is suggested that the wife should be able to make a like set of deductions.  The existing position of the law under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, the existing difference in relation to the Divorce Laws, and so on.  Now if there is a case against these laws, or any one of them, that case should be considered on its merits.  It should be carefully discussed and seriously deliberated and voted on, and taken on its merits alone.  It was very quickly realised that the words in the Constitution originally were taken by certain ladies in this city to mean the repeal of these enactments.  It would have raised a very angry controversy hereafter when it would be discovered that that was not the intention of the Government.  To avoid that bitter and angry controversy the Government inserted amendments in the Constitution emphasising that it was equal political rights were intended.  Equal rights of citizenship is one thing; identical rights of citizenship is quite another thing.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Dáil appreciates that fact. However, it is well that you should know that in the minds of certain ladies who called to the Government Offices to discuss this matter of equal rights as <Col N="1678" /> citizens, what was in the Constitution originally was read as meaning identical rights as citizens, and it was seriously contended by them that that should remain in the Constitution, and that it would, in effect, repeal all those enactments which I have set out.  Deputy Magennis said that there was no danger of that, because an Article later on in the Constitution provides that all existing laws shall continue until repealed.  I had the curiosity to turn to the Article in question and to read&mdash;&ldquo;Subject to this Constitution and to the extent to which they are not inconsistent therewith, the laws in force in the Irish Free State at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall continue to be of full force and effect until the same or any of them shall have been repealed or amended by enactment of the Parliament.&rdquo; It would be very little use to us hereafter if we had left the Constitution in this matter as it originally stood&mdash;to quote Article 72, because those ladies would say that, &ldquo;subject to this Constitution and to the extent to which they are not inconsistent therewith,&rdquo; and they would say that those particular laws are inconsistent with your Article 3 and therefore they do not continue in force.  It is as well that we should clear our minds on this matter and it is better, seeing the trouble ahead to avoid it by having definite, clear expression of the thing now, than simply to be peddling with it hereafter.  Do we want to repeal these enactments and do we want the great body of the people in this country to believe that they are repealed?  As I have said it is understandable that the Government would think, would even know, that these enactments were not repealed and yet may wish to obviate any controversy as to whether they were or not.  It was made quite sufficiently clear that certain people would take the view that these enactments were repealed if we left the Constitution as it was. Certainly all these matters should go and would go if you had left the Constitution as it stood originally.  Recognising the fact that there is coming into existence a certain type of woman, an extremely able woman, an extremely strong-minded woman, a woman of highly developed public spirit and civic sense, recognising all that, we have to remember that there are still alive a great many women of a very, very different type, who certainly <Col N="1679" /> need the protection of these enactments and who certainly must not be deprived of that protection; a less independent woman whose civic outlook or, as some would say, lack of outlook, is excused as having its origin in early Victorian education, and there are some of these women left. They do not obtrude themselves perhaps, but we must realise that they are left and that a great many of these laws provide very necessary protection for them.  We have no intention of repealing these laws in a hasty, ill-considered way, or to put it in the minds of citizens of this country that these laws have been repealed by a couple of loose words in the Constitution. Some time ago at the Catholic Truth Society I unfortunately ran up against a new type&mdash;able, strong-minded ladies of highly developed public spirit, and it pained me to see that on that occasion they only got equal rights and that their removal was not carried out with any more ceremony or consideration than a man's removal would be carried out in the same circumstances.  That of course is irrelevant.</P>

      <P>As I have an amendment on this subject to follow, and to save the time of the Dáil, I think it might be well that I should intervene in this discussion and use the arguments that I would on my own amendment, and thereby save repetition.  I feel that after hearing the Minister in charge of the Bill, and realising that the Ministerial purpose, as expressed by him, is pretty much the purpose of those who have put forward these Amendments, it makes me feel a little bit ashamed of the ability of the legal people of the country, to find that they were not able to advance some form of words which would cover what the Ministers themselves desire, and what we desire, without limiting very considerably, as they have done, the liberties granted in the preceding clause.  The use of this word &ldquo;political&rdquo; undoubtedly limits very many of the liberties that are assured in the Amendment that we have just passed.  I think that the Minister said that equality did not mean identity. That is the key of this whole question and it removes the basis of the opposition to the proposals that are made in the Amendments of Deputy Magennis and myself.  Nobody suggests that there should be no differentiation.  I refer as an <Col N="1680" /> example of this matter to Article 1 of the Constitution: &ldquo;The Irish Free State is a co-equal member of the community of Nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo; We ask you to insert a clause somewhat analogous to that.  &ldquo;The women of Ireland are co-equal Members with the men of Ireland in this Community of persons called the Irish Free State.&rdquo; Now, there is no suggestion that the Irish Free State is identical with, that its powers, its force, its laws, and its conditions are the same as the powers, laws, and conditions in England, Australia, Canada or South Africa.  But what is contended is that as citizens, the protection of the State and the right of the citizen in the State should be not identical but equal, not necessarily undifferentiated.  The idea of equality in the family is apparent; children are considered equal, but there is no suggestion that they are all identical. They have a claim upon the parents for equality of treatment, but that does not suggest that the parents must treat them always identically, or without differentiation, and that is the claim that is put forward by the movers of the Amendments. I, for one, hoped that the Ministry would have been able to find legal advice and draftsmanship which would cover that particular reading in a way that would save them from a difficulty they seem to anticipate.  If it is not possible to accept either of these Amendments, and as Deputy Magennis has pointed out, it has been possible in several European Countries where in recent Constitutions they have embodied this idea, while they have differentiation there is no suggestion that the laws are identical&mdash;but if it is not possible for Ministers to agree to either of these Amendments, I would urgently ask them to delete this Clause 4.  It is very much better to delete it entirely if you cannot amend it, because it is an absolute limiting of the rights of women in the country to have a clause which says they shall have equal political rights.  We are already assured that citizens shall have citizenship irrespective of sex.  There is no necessity then to put in a clause which says they shall have equal political rights, which implies a denial to them of rights which are not political, but which are social.  I would strongly urge that if you cannot find a way to meet <Col N="1681" /> the arguments of the mover of this Amendment or the following Amendment, that is in my name, that you would delete entirely Article 4 and leave the position as it stands in Article 3.</P>

      <P>I wish to say I accept the amendment of Deputy Gavan Duffy.  I am willing to leave out all words in the Clause after &ldquo;Men and women shall have equal rights of citizenship.&rdquo; That I think will clear the air considerably. I wish also to say that I agree with the general tenor of the speech of the Minister in charge of the Bill, because as Deputy Johnson has just pointed out&mdash;he put into epigrammatic phrase what I had stated more diffusely&mdash;the claim was not for the same things exactly.  Equality of right is not identity of right.  It is obvious that the Ministry are pleading duress in this case, and the duress of women.  It is a very extraordinary thing that on the first occasion that this was before us, and on the present occasion, it was regarded as a humorous thing to say that men were not at liberty to plead the duress of women, but the Minister for Home Affairs has told us that the reason why he took away legal rights, civic rights, and every right except political right from women by this express provision is because certain women came on a deputation to the Ministry and made it so clear that they were going to interpret the clause &ldquo;equal right as citizens&rdquo; to sweep away the whole lot of existing legislation that the phrase was altered.</P>

      <P>With reference to Deputy Johnson's speech, for my part, I do not think that Article 4, as it stands, when it is read in its context, as part of this whole Constitution, can be held to have any limiting effect.  That is especially so when we take into account the presence in the Constitution of the words which were inserted in his motion this morning in Article 3.  In any case, for my part, I hold that the suggestion he put forward of withdrawing it has much to recommend it, not only as that particular Article or phrase now stands, but also as it was. I know there is some body of opinion amongst women, who are interested in the matter, believing that the position is really much stronger from the women's point of view to have nothing said at all about it, that it should be taken for granted, as clearly it can be taken for granted, from the Constitution, that fundamental and general equality is the intention and is conferred without any specific clause.</P>

      <P>We are prepared to leave out Article 4, if it is felt that the express mention of political right in any way limits or abolishes the other rights. I think Deputy Magennis spoke of <i>expressio unius</i> as <i>exclusio alterius.</i>  Well we are prepared to leave out <i>expressio unius</i> and simply leave it that the political rights are rather obvious, inasmuch as women have the vote and have the right to be elected here, and so on, and need no stressing.  Further, the other rights seem obvious too, and the only restrictions or qualifications are such restrictions and qualifications as are contained in existing law.  If there is a case against these, or any of them, let that case be brought up here and let these things be repealed on their merits, but do not let this repeal, or seem to repeal these laws by a couple of words in the Constitution.  To leave out Article 4 seems to me an eminently sensible suggestion.  It is a suggestion we are prepared to accept.</P>

I do not wish to repeat the old Latin tag that has been quoted two or three times, but the use of the words political rights does seem to exclude the civil rights and such other rights of equality though not of identity. Therefore Article 4 should go and if Article 4 went, what is the amendment that is immediately before us in its altered form?  &ldquo;Men and women are guaranteed equal rights of citizenship.&rdquo; That is established in Article 3 exactly as we have now passed it&mdash;&ldquo;every person without distinction of sex domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State is a citizen.&rdquo; That is exactly what he means to include in his words &ldquo;men and women are guaranteed equal rights of citizenship.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to say briefly in supporting it, that I have not been able to follow the various statements made by highly respectable members of this Dáil with regard to the meaning of political rights.  My belief is that this Constitution is, from beginning to end, a political document. Everything contemplated in it is a political right, or something connected with political rights, and political rights cover what is called civil rights, or what is called social rights, or if it does not, the clause in the Constitution which would create anything beyond political would lead us far further than we intended to go, or that any Constitution properly should go.  I believe the term &ldquo;political rights,&rdquo; as it stood in this, covered the whole ground of right&mdash;public right, private right&mdash;that could possibly come under the scope of a Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The next amendment is to substitute for Article 6 <Col N="1685" /> the following:&mdash;&ldquo;No title of nobility, nor any title indicative of, and conferring rank, precedence, or other such public privilege, may be conferred on a citizen of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; The purpose I had in view in this amendment was to meet the situation created by the vote a few evenings ago, by which we set up a Governor-General for Ireland and arranged to make the maintenance of his state and office chargeable on the Free State Funds.  If we are to have a Governor-General with a mock Court, and if we are to have all the appendages of semi-royalty, various levies and functions such as we are familiar with as Viceregal in recent years, then I think it is very necessary for the protection of the purity of political life, that it shall not be within the power of the Governor-General to confer titles of nobility, or Knighthoods or Baronetcies or things of that sort, that give social precedence or set up a distinction of caste.  It is all very well to express our faith in the robust vitality of the National spirit.  These things are notoriously fragile, and as was remarked in one of Bacon's Essays in matters of this sort, &ldquo;the first and best thing is not to will, and the second not to can.&rdquo; If one is not able to resist the temptation then it is better that the temptation be taken away.  Consequently it will not harm the virile Republican or the virile Democrat if this thing is beyond the power of the Governor-General, and it will greatly assist the weaker brethren if it is not in the power of an official of this type to seduce them, or tempt them by the proffer of social distinctions of this sort.  I will not say any more on the matter.</P>

      <P>In the Committee stage we dealt rather fully with this Article.  It is one of the Articles in the Constitution that we consider most safeguards the Irish position. and it renders any repetition of the Act of Union proceedings absolutely out of the question.  &ldquo;No title of honour in respect of any services rendered in or in relation to the Irish Free State/ Saorstát Eireann may be conferred on any citizen of the Irish Free State/ Saorstát Eireann except with the approval <Col N="1686" /> or upon the advice of the Executive Council of the State.&rdquo; Taking first &ldquo;in respect of any services rendered in or in relation to the Irish Free State&rdquo; those words have the practical effect of what Deputy Magennis desires to achieve by his amendment, that a title cannot be conferred on any citizen in respect of services rendered in Saorstát Eireann, or in relation to Saorstát Eireann.  To attempt to go further would be to say that the British Government and King could not reward, say, a great General or a great Admiral if he happened to be a citizen of Saorstát Eireann; that the people who go out from here and make a name for themselves, whether it be in the Army or Navy or in Art, or in any other phase of life, could not be rewarded or receive distinctions.  Of course, taking that line you come crop up against the question of the King's prerogative as the fountain of honour.  You secure as much more tactfully by the Article as it stands.  If there are titles conferred here in future, they must be conferred on the advice of the Executive Council, and it is in the power of the Parliament if it does not wish those titles conferred to order the Executive Council that it shall not advise the conferring of any titles.  But this is not the Parliament of Saorstát Eireann; this is a Provisional Parliament, which must not stretch out its arm beyond the transitional period, or attempt to limit the sovereignty of future Parliaments.  The first Parliament of Saorstát Eireann, the second, and the third can give that instruction to the Executive Council, that its policy should be that titles would not be conferred on Irish citizens.  The position is amply safeguarded by the existing clause in the Constitution, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No title of honour in respect of any services rendered in or in relation to the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann may be conferred upon any citizen of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann, except with the approval or upon the advice of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.&rdquo; We stand on that and we do not accept any amendment.  It is an agreed clause arrived at after a considerable amount of arguing and negotiation. We consider it perfect, as it stands, from the Irish point of view.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the persistence about this Article.  It is within the power of the next Parliament, or of this Parliament, when and if it becomes the first Parliament of Saorstát Eireann, to say to the Executive Council that no hereditary title may be conferred on a citizen of the Irish Free State.  That is one thing perfectly understandable; but to attempt to lay down in the Constitution more than that these things cannot be conferred except on the advice of the Executive Council is a direct and needless challenge to the King's prerogative.  It is equivalent to saying the King cannot confer a Baronetcy or a Peerage on an Irish citizen, whereas we know if you take that line you come very definitely in conflict with the point of view which you avoid quite skillfully and satisfactorily by the Article as it stands.  And so it is agreed that they shall not confer titles except on the advice of the Executive Council and of Parliament.  Parliament can warn the Executive Council that it must not advise the conferring of any title. There is somewhere a lurking fear that 1800 is going to repeat itself, and that this Parliament will be sold for titles. I do not think that is at all on the mat.</P>

      <P>As regards this question of the Royal prerogative, it is always possible by statute to surrender, or to have surrendered, so much of the Royal prerogative.  There is precedent for that.  Merely to tell us this is the Royal prerogative, and leave us to understand by that it cannot be touched and cannot be minimised, and cannot be subtracted from, is to ignore the whole current not merely of English history, but of Dominion history.  It is <Col N="1688" /> quite possible, so long as the statute mentions it, that the prerogative be so far surrendered&mdash;unless it is mentioned it is not surrendered.  There is a point about Deputy O'Brien's amendment which I think the Minister has overlooked, and though I am loath to obtrude so much on the Dáil, I just want to draw attention to it.  It is this: Granted an Irishman may in some of the Dominions, say, under Great Britain itself, render distinguished service to the Empire and be rewarded, I say it is eminently reasonable to leave room for the granting of a title, though I should wish that Irish citizens would refuse those honours.  But for the title to be made hereditary involves this, that generations after this distinguished servant has passed away, men domiciled here will be marked out from their fellow-men by the social distinction of this title.  This tends to introduce an element which is most objectionable for the future democracy of the Free State.  I suggest, with all respect, that the Minister has overlooked that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has emphasised the fact that succeeding Parliaments may instruct the Executive Council not to advise the granting of titles.  That is perfectly true. But I am just tempted to remind the Minister that when we suggested some weeks ago that succeeding Parliaments may make a Constitution, and that there was no necessity for laying down what succeeding Parliaments should do, or should be deprived of the liberty of doing, we were told that we must set forth certain fundamental laws which would restrict the rights of succeeding Parliaments unless by special permission of the supreme authority, the people, with the sanction of the people over the water.  The argument now is that we can trust succeeding Parliaments; but there is quite a possibility that succeeding Parliaments may be made of different stuff; they may be of a different character altogether, and inasmuch as it is desirable to lay down certain other fundamental laws, the proposal is that we should lay down this as a fundamental law, which can only be altered by the vote of the people for alteration of the Constitution.  It seems to me that part of the argument at any rate will not hold water in this case, inasmuch as it was not allowed to hold water. <Col N="1689" /> in the last case.  The claim is made by Deputy Magennis that there is a very great distinction between the conferring of honours for the lifetime of the recipient and for the conferring of honours which may be handed down from father to son and mother to daughter, as it may be.  That difference is so great as to require that there should be part of the fundamental law which would deprive any citizen of the opportunity of being the recipient of a hereditary title.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that no Parliament which may be freely elected in the future by the Irish people on the basis of adult suffrage is likely to favour the conferring of titles on members. If the Irish people change their minds and return such a Parliament that would agree to the conferring of titles, then the amendments proposed here have nothing behind them but a desire to save the Irish people from themselves. For my part, I do not think it necessary that we should save the Irish people from themselves.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if I might move this by permission. Notice of it was not given, but it may meet a certain point of view which finds expression in another amendment on the Paper.  My suggestion is to take out the words &ldquo;save in time of war or armed rebellion,&rdquo; in the second line of the Article, and to add to the Article thus amended, &ldquo;Provided, however, that nothing in this Article contained shall be invoked to prohibit, control, or interfere with any act of the military forces of Saorstát Eireann during the existence of a state of war or armed rebellion.&rdquo; Deputy Johnson pointed out quite rightly to me that the Article as it stands might mean this extraordinary thing, that once a state of war or armed rebellion was in existence anyone could arrest anyone else, so that there would be no such thing as liberty of the person at all.  The effect of the amendment now proposed is to limit it strictly to the military forces of Saorstát Eireann, and to confine it with regard to them strictly to the period during which a state of war or armed rebellion exists.  The present position, as I understand it, is that the Judges are refusing to consider complaints from people about infringements on the liberty <Col N="1690" /> of their persons, on the grounds that there is in existence a state of war or armed rebellion, and that it is something outside the scope of their business to consider these things, but that at the moment that a state of war or armed rebellion ceases, then the right of the person which was submerged during that period is resurrected, and he has his full rights to proceed against anyone he thinks responsible for his wrongful arrest.  This amendment we are proposing now emphasises that the right is set out in the Article; the other is merely inserted as a proviso at the end, &ldquo;that during a period of war or armed rebellion&rdquo; that Article must not be quoted against the military forces of Saorstát Eireann. When the period of war ends, all the rights of the citizen are resurrected, and he can proceed against anyone who has wronged him.</P>

      <P>That is a very decided improvement.  There is one aspect of the matter I should like to have cleared up.  Whether a given state of the country is, or is not, a state of war, or armed insurrection, to use the legal phrase must be determined in some way.  In later years here there was a marked tendency to decide the matter merely by an affidavit of the General Commanding the Troops.  Now, in Article 69 of the draft Constitution, as it originally stood, the correct doctrine was laid down:&mdash;&ldquo;Such jurisdiction with reference to Military Courts shall not be exercised in any area in which the Civil Courts are open or capable of being held.&rdquo; That is the famous decision of Coke, so the question of whether it is, or is not, a state of war is answered by the determination of whether or not the civil courts are open, or capable of being held.  Now, on hearing the last clause read out I was not quite sure&mdash;I am open to correction about this&mdash;that a phrase might not have been incautiously used that would seem to give countenance to the idea that a state of war may be determined in some other fashion.  I know that the Law Adviser to the Ministry would be in favour of the contention that the real test is&mdash;are the civil courts open or capable of being held?  He argued that&mdash;I need not say with great <Col N="1691" /> ability&mdash;in a case quite recently.  I merely put the question now for greater lucidity.</P>

I do not know but it seems to me that it will require some little amendment to speak of the lawfully authorised forces of the Government, or something of that kind, or something to indicate that they have been authorised by the civil authority to act.  &ldquo;Any authorised act of the military forces&rdquo;&mdash; perhaps that would be sufficient.</P>

I am not quite clear about the wording of the whole sentence, &ldquo;provided, however, that nothing in this Article contained shall be invoked to prohibit, control.&rdquo; I suppose the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; goes on then past the parenthesis, &ldquo;control of the military force.&rdquo; I suggest the whole thing would read much clearer in this form: &ldquo;Provided, however, that nothing in this Article contained shall be invoked to interfere with any authorised act by the military forces of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The clause has reference, really, to the liberty of the person, and deals simply with the question of arrest and detention, and, consequently, nothing in it could, by any stretch of the imagination, be held to authorise or accord liberty to the military to do anything other than arrest and detain persons.  Now, the clause as <Col N="1692" /> it stands provides a remedy for any person who holds himself to be illegally and improperly detained, and all that the proviso does is: it prevents such a person having recourse to that remedy during a time or state of war, or when armed rebellion exists.  The Judge to whom application is made will, as at present, decide whether there be a state of war, or whether armed rebellion exists, and the evidence upon which he will decide what is the state of facts will be a matter for himself.  The object of the proviso is to leave the law in this matter as it stands, and Article 72 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to this Constitution and the extent to which they are not inconsistent therewith, the laws in force in the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall continue to be of full force and effect until the same or any of them shall have been repealed or amended by enactment of the Parliament/ Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the proviso, as I said, will in no way alter the law as it stands at present, and is in no way drawn so as to constitute any danger that the liberty or the rights of the subject will be curtailed in any way that they are not curtailed in in time of war or armed rebellion at present.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following new Article to follow after Article 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The right of the children to food, clothing and shelter and education sufficient for their physical welfare and training as citizens of Saorstát Eireann is guaranteed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to be able to say that this Constitution is a charter for the children of the future.  Despite the possible shortcomings of the parents, it is for us to say that the sins of the fathers shall not be visited upon their children.  When we are about organising the community we ought to bind ourselves for the future so far as we can bind the future to assure to the children of the nation sustenance, shelter and education sufficient to equip them for their duties and responsibilities as citizens.  If we are agreeable, and if we determine to insert such a provision as this, it would bind future Parliaments against any interference with the rights of the children in this matter of sustenance. I think we were reminded upon the last reading of this Bill that there were Poor Law rights even to-day, and that under the Poor Law children will be maintained, but I do not think <Col N="1694" /> that anybody would argue here that it is a desirable state of things to limit their sustenance to the Poor Law level as we know it, and I think it will be admitted that the education they receive in Poor Law institutions is not of a kind that will fit them for training as citizens of Saorstát Eireann.  I would like it to go out to the country that this Dáil at any rate is prepared, in so far as it can bind the future, to bind that future to say that the rights of the children to food, clothing, shelter and education are guaranteed.  There is a possibility that even the rights that are guaranteed to-day under the Poor Law system may be abrogated.  We have representatives of an organisation which claims to be nation-wide, to use an American term, a very important organisation in the mind of the spokesman, who are already out to reduce the rights of the children to education, and possibly, it is quite conceivable, that that body or some such body might go very much further and achieve such power and influence that these present elementary rights of sustenance established under the Poor Law, that they even may be lost.  I would like to lay down in the Constitution that the children of the Irish Nation have to be guaranteed sustenance, so that, at any rate, they will not be at the loss of the means of life and comfort and education. I beg to move this motion.</P>

      <P>The objection which I have to this clause is very much the same objection as the clause which was moved at an earlier stage.  It is that this proposed Article if adopted would not carry us the least bit further. At present the children have a certain right to food, clothing, shelter and education.  Neither the food, clothing, shelter or education may be such as we desire.  But at least they have the right to these things, and any suggestion that any organisation would take away the <Col N="1695" /> rights of the children to food, clothing and shelter is, I think, entirely fantastic. Now, Deputy Johnson said that such an association was out to reduce the rights of education, and that the adoption of this Article would obviate or reduce that danger.  In fact this Article is so vague that it would not protect the rights that actually exist at the moment.  The intention of the Article is to extend them, <Col N="1696" /> but it is so drawn, that it does not achieve that, but, at any rate, if these rights are to be extended it should be done by specific legislation considered on its merits with regard to the machinery of ways and means.  I do not think it achieves that right, and because it does not achieve anything I do not think it should be included.</P>

      <P>I wish to move the amendment which stands in my name.  It will be in the memory of the Dáil that on a previous occasion when this Article was being considered an amendment which stood in my name was withdrawn in order to consider the wording of the amendment and on the understanding that it would be brought forward at this stage.  Now the Article as it stands in the draft at present&mdash;Article 11&mdash;is weak and to my mind indefinite and apt to lead to confusion. It says, &ldquo;all citizens of the Irish Free State have the right to free elementary education.&rdquo; Well, all citizens, I take it without limitation or conditions laid down as to the age.  We might have peculiar complications arising from that if it were left in that form.  It might happen, for instance, that any citizen, no matter what his age, might make a claim on the State for free elementary education, and before the State could refuse it would have to establish that that citizen had received an elementary education.  Then the word elementary, to my mind, would also lead to confusion, <Col N="1697" /> because it would be necessary to define what elementary means in this connection, and at the present time it is rather undecided.  It would then depend on some constitutional lawyers to define what this word elementary means.  Some might define it and say that a man who is able to write his name had received an elementary education.  On the other hand you might get another judge who might say it brought a man up to the University standard.  In any case I think the amendment which stands in my name is much more definite and will meet the necessities of the case in a better way than the Article as it stands, <i>i.e.</i>, that &ldquo;Provision shall be made by the State for the free education of the young up to an age to be prescribed by law. School attendance shall be compulsory.&rdquo; With regard to the second portion of it, there is no use in making provision for free education and going to the expense which this entails unless we further provide that the people for whom it is provided will avail of it.

      <P>I wish to propose an amendment as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Provision shall be made by Saorstát Eireann for the free education of the young, and for their compulsory attendance at school up to such an age, and to such a stage of instruction as shall be prescribed by law.&rdquo; The reason why I suggest bringing the last clause into the body of the original statement is that &ldquo;school attendance shall be compulsory,&rdquo; left by itself in isolation is too wide; it does not say attendance of whom or at what school.  It merely says attendance at school is compulsory.  Whereas by making it an integral element in the other statement, what is really provided for is that the children of the country are bound to get education in so far as they <Col N="1698" /> shall not be able to raise the plea of poverty in extenuation for non-attendance; and then inasmuch as they are provided with free education, education is made compulsory, and it is free up to a certain stage of instruction.  I think we cannot go beyond that.  There are children incapable of undergoing instruction beyond a certain stage because of mental deficiency.  There are imbecile children, and children who are not exactly open to be pronounced imbeciles, and yet are very poor stuff for the teachers' work, and, of course, in an educational code with a future Dáil, or perhaps this Dáil acting as the Chamber of the Free State Parliament, may enact such a code, and in it provision might be made for exemption from attendance on the score of medical judgment, or such things as would be reasonably taken by the public authority to exempt them from attendance.  I do not think I need labour the matter because it has been sufficiently before you. We are all, I think, urgently desirous of having, not only a free Nation, but an educated Nation.  The two things go together, as, in fact, I have so frequently stated.  No nation, no people, can grow to its full stature unless with the aid of education.  Consequently, this is another of those amendments which satisfy the requirements I have spoken of earlier for restoring the Gaelic state.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the provision in the Constitution as it stands is not absolutely definite.  It provides that all citizens have the right to free elementary education, and it has been pointed out by the mover of the amendment that this does not state how much, or what degree, or what extent of education is meant by the word &ldquo;elementary.&rdquo; The same criticism exactly applies to the amendment.  The amendment makes no provision whatsoever as to the amount, the degree, or the character of the education to be provided, but simply provides that education shall con tinue during a certain length of time.  I would like to make my own position clear with regard to this question of the position of the State in relation to education. My position is that the right of <Col N="1699" /> education, in the first place and fundamentally, belongs to the parents of the children, or those who are in <i>loco-parentis</i>, so long as the children are properly under that parental control: in the first place, and fundamentally, that that is the higher right, a more fundamental right, than any right possessed by the State.  Especially in this matter of education it is most necessary that we should be all clear in our minds, at all stages, that the State exists for the benefit of the citizens, and not the citizens for the benefit of the State; that the children of the people do not belong to the State, but that, on the contrary, the State belongs to the people and to the children of the people, and we must be extremely careful in anything that we lay down as a general principle that we do not say or appear to say that the control of education belongs as by right to the State.  It belongs to the State only by right of service.  Now, I do not see that we can do more.  The Article in the Draft Constitution is undoubtedly indefinite, but I think it is essential that it shall be indefinite, for the simple reason that not one of us, no matter how much experience we have, nor all our collective experience, I think we would admit, is wise enough to define what is sufficient education for children.  We are finding that out and trying to find it out every day.  Nor do I think it well that we should attempt to define a common standard of education, nor anything that would appear to be a common standard of education for all children.  I hold that the right of children to education, when the State undertakes the responsibility of providing it, is what we were reminded about with regard to another question which arose early this evening, the right of equal liberty.  That right of equal liberty is, in this case, even less a matter of identity and more of equality, but it is equal opportunity in proportion to capacity.  For that reason I think it is as well that what we are attempting to define as the duty of the State with regard to education should be left not too definite, and that we should leave it to the wisdom, or unwisdom, of those who will be the Legislature of the State to give it definite form from time to time, as it may seem best to them.  Now I pass to the other question, that school attendance shall <Col N="1700" /> be compulsory.  I would object to that in any form, either stated as baldly as it is there or even implied and passed into another clause to be stated in the Constitution, because it seems to me that it runs contrary to the principle I have already laid down.  I hold that I, as a parent, or any other parent, in discharging our duty to our children, have a right to consider ourselves capable of educating our children at home by bringing in such teachers as we chose to educate them, and that consequently it cannot be said that we are bound to send our children to any particular private school or a number of private schools.  On that point we must be clear; so that while I hold that it is right that the law should intervene in the case of dereliction of duty, as it does for the protection of children in many other respects, at the same time to lay down that the law, or rather the Constitution, should state beforehand that every child may be compelled to use such provision for education as may be provided by the State is fundamentally wrong in principle.  With all these things in view it seems to me that, while undoubtedly the Article in the Constitution does not make clear and definite provision, it at all events lays down that there shall be a minimum of provision, and beyond that it seems to me very difficult to go.  The Article as it stands in the Draft Constitution is to me very much preferable to the amendment.</P>

I do not think that he would contend that the parent has a right to refuse to educate his children.</P>

      <P>That is the intention of this amendment as moved by Deputy O'Connell, that provision shall be made for education up to such an age, or to such a stage, as shall be prescribed by law.  The amendment is to ensure that such provision shall be made so that parents may be enabled to exercise their duty and their right.  The Minister objected to the suggestion of compulsory school attendance.  As the proposal is amended it is quite competent to define that the compulsory attendance at school may mean at the source of instruction&mdash;may be the parent and the home.  There is no need to define that as being some place apart from the home.  Speaking for myself, I am at one with the Minister in saying that the parent who can provide such education as will stand the requisite test, without sending the children to school, is perfectly entitled to claim that those children have fulfilled the requirements.  I do not want to insist that all children shall go to a particular school or be confined to a particular curriculum, but I do want to ensure that there shall be a minimum standard of education arrived at by all children.  I think the arguments that were used by the Minister are entirely in support of the amendment that is proposed by Deputy O'Connell, and rather contravene, in their implications, the Article proposed in the Draft.  I beg to support the proposition of Deputy O'Connell.</P>

      <P>There are just a few comments I would like to make on the proposed amendment&mdash;&ldquo;Provision shall be made by the State for the free education of the young up to an age to be prescribed by law&rdquo; The Article in the Draft is &ldquo;All citizens of the Irish <Col N="1702" /> Free State have the right to free elementary education.&rdquo; The Article in the Draft defines the right of the citizen, as against the State.  The other takes a somewhat different angle and says that as between certain ages, up to an age to be prescribed by law, the State must make provision for the free education of the young.  What I fear, there, is that this amendment is loosely worded and it might well mean if you fix the age at 14 or 15 you will have some desperately precocious youngster &ldquo;sticking&rdquo; the State&mdash;if I may use a vulgar expression &mdash;for not merely his elementary education, but for secondary education, and possibly for a certain amount of University education.  If the amendment contemplates that the State may in certain circumstances have to bear the burden of secondary education of a boy who happens to be within the age limit that is something we ought to examine very carefully, and it must be taken relative to the resources of the State.  I daresay many here would like to see the State in a position to provide for the education of citizens in secondary schools&mdash; possibly in the University&mdash;up to a measure, but to set down here that the State definitely accepts the burden of the education of the young, up to a certain age, is something we ought not to do.</P>

      <P>The two Ministers who have spoken on this amendment, I think, have commended it with considerable strength, one by the lameness of the defence of his original Article, and the other by an argument that practically was in support of the amendment.  This original Article underwent a great many forms, and was reduced finally to a single sentence, which gives the substance&mdash;I think a very naked substance, inasmuch as it definitely prescribes nothing.  I think the strongest argument that appeals to my mind in favour of the amendment is this, that if any Deputy reading Article 11 of the Draft Constitution were to be asked to define what he thought it meant I think he would define it in the terms of the amendment now proposed. I think there is hardly a single Deputy of whom that would not be true.  There has been an argument put forward that, inasmuch as there is a certain Act that already exists by which education at schools may be made compulsory, precludes the necessity of any such provision in the Constitution is, I think, not the soundest of possible arguments. It is true there is a body of law in rule and in force and effect in Ireland at the present moment by which what is known <Col N="1704" /> as Habeas Corpus is permitted, but will anyone think of writing a Constitution without making that a provision?  Because there happens to be current legislation, which we take over, dealing with the right of children to education does not alter the fact that the right of children to education is so fundamental that it ought to be written into the Constitution. We have excluded it from the Constitution.  No one desires it to be excluded.  That is why Article 11 appeared in the first instance, and I think Article 11 is not sufficiently expansive, not sufficiently explanatory, and if any Deputy were asked to define what was in his mind from that sentence that at present constitutes Article 11 he would give such a definition as is now in the amendment.  I think the amendment is therefore a distinct improvement, because it is&mdash;well, more lucid.</P>

      <P>Article 11 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;All citizens of the Irish Free State/ Saorstát Eireann have the right to free elementary education.  Now, that does not prescribe compulsory attendance at school.  The other Article does. That is the one very big difference between them, and that is the reason I prefer Article 11 to the Article that is suggested instead of it.  I think we can all agree a Constitution, so far as it does not deal with the mere mechanics of Government, should only deal with fundamental rights.  We deal with the only fundamental right in this connection in Article 11, the right of the citizen to the opportunity of education. Compulsory school attendance is another matter, is a mere detail in that connection.  I suggest that the sensible view is for the Constitution to make quite sure that this particular fundamental right, the opportunity of free elementary education, but that when you come to questions of compulsory attendance and questions of that sort you come to questions which are more appropriate to an Act of Parliament.  When you talk about compulsory attendance you must talk about the machinery, or you should be talking about the machinery to enforce attendance, and you should be particularly careful that any Act of Parliament, let us say, that deals with education and compulsory attendance at school does not take away what Professor John MacNeill pointed <Col N="1705" /> out, the right of the parent in the matter.  This case of compulsory attendance is essentially a question that should be dealt with specifically and carefully defined.  It has no place whatever in a Constitution.  All that a Constitution is really concerned with is the fundamental right, and that fundamental right is defined, so far as it is right to define it, in the Constitution.</P>

Because, as far as education for the young is concerned, so long as you have it briefly laid down that children have the right to education, I believe it is the principle we should embody in this Constitution. If there are other things, such as compulsory education, or laying down a standard to which children should be educated, I think that should be done by legislation at a later date.  For that reason alone I favour the Article as it stands in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move: &ldquo;To insert the following new Article after Article 11&mdash;Private Schools for the instruction of young persons within the limits of age which may be prescribed for compulsory attendance shall not be established except on conditions to be determined by law, and every person engaged as a teacher in any school attended by such young persons must possess educational qualifications to be prescribed by law.&rdquo; The object of this amendment is for the protection of young persons.  The State, in my opinion, owes a duty to children, and part of that duty is to protect them from exploitation, exploitation especially for private gain.  At present, although we have a regular system of education&mdash;it may not be, and it is not anything, like what we desire it to be&mdash;there is nothing to prevent any body or any individual setting up a private school and plastering the walls of a town with advertisements pointing out the magnificent nature of the instruction that is given in  particular academy, thus possibly imposing on credulous people.  The State does not step in as I maintain it should, to prevent a person doing that, unless on certain prescribed conditions.  We do not allow anybody who wishes to set up an establishment for the sale of spiritous liquors for private gain.  They have to fulfil certain conditions laid down by the law, but that does not necessarily mean that having fulfilled these conditions, and having obtained permission under them to engage in the sale of spiritous liquors, that the State has the right to step in and to indicate the particular class of liquor that ought to be sold, or rather the particular amount of stock that should be kept, or how many assistants he should employ.  The management of the shop is left largely in the hands of the licensed person.  The statement of the Minister for Education, when speaking on the last amendment, brings to my mind the necessity for speaking on this question of parental right.  I agree thoroughly that the right of the parent in the matter of education <Col N="1709" /> is fundamental At the same time I do not admit that the State has not the right, if and when necessary, to protect the child, even against the parent, or against dereliction of duty on the part of the parent.  I am glad to notice the Minister agrees with me in that.  Whenever this matter of education is mentioned it seems to me there is always a tendency to cry out about interference with parental right.  It is well known to us all that the State does in many matters interfere with parental right and protects the child, if and when necessary, against the misdemeanours and the misdeeds of the parent.  We have many instances of that which I need not here quote.  There is another misconception which is very prevalent, and which I think it very necessary to remove. There seems to be an impression in many quarters that advocacy of State interference of any kind in the matter of education is an advocacy of what is sometimes termed godless education.  I do not think there is anybody in this Dáil, and certainly not on these benches, who would advocate anything which might be described as godless education. To my mind, there are two aspects of education&mdash;definite and distinct.  You have the civil and the social aspect, and you have the moral and religious aspect. It is the concern of the State to deal with education from the civil and social aspect; it is not the duty of the State to interfere with education from the moral and religious aspect.  Nothing in this amendment of mine can be taken to mean that.  With regard to the second portion of it, it is well known that we protect the children and the people against unqualified doctors and dentists; I do not know whether we do protect them against unqualified lawyers.  There is more reason why we should protect young children against teachers who do not possess necessary qualifications.  The effect of a teacher on the minds of young people is enormous; it can do much good, and likewise it can do very great evil, and it is not asking too much that protection be afforded by having certain qualifications prescribed by law.  It may, and possibly will, be argued that these are matters for legislation.  I have heard that argument put up on several occasions when it seemed to suit Ministers. If they were to be consistent, they could write the Constitution in three lines and <Col N="1710" /> say that the right of Ireland to freedom is hereby guaranteed, leaving it then to legislation to show how the mechanical rights to freedom should be carried out. If that is the argument in one case it ought to be equally the argument in the other case.  I commend this amendment for the consideration of the Dáil, and I hope it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I think it is clear that if there is anything at all that should be left to legislation it would be a matter of this kind, and here again I must say that, as worded, the amendment seems to me to come at the question from the wrong approach.  The private school may not be established except on conditions determined by law. It seems to me that no provision of that kind should go into the Constitution.  I feel, and the more I am in touch with the difficulties of education the more I feel the great folly of people who happen to be an authority, no matter whether they be Boards or individuals, or what they are, assuming that they have all the wisdom that is necessary, and that some private person may not come along and in a private way by private enterprise do something far wiser than anything they ever conceived.  I think possibly we have here people who themselves were either pupils or whose children were pupils of St. Enda's School, established by Patrick Pearse, a bold educational experiment.  Now, it would be very unfortunate if our Constitution were to contain a provision that would prevent a bold experiment of that kind being made, and, of course, that could not be made unless it was put for two or three, or several years to the test.  I think it would be wrong to lay down any principle in the Constitution that would prevent initiative in the matter of education.  And it is not so much, to <Col N="1711" /> my mind, the question of the State carrying on a system of education in which there would be no religion.  I think that our experience in this country teaches us that the people who are charged with the defence of religion are very well able to defend it.  The whole question goes wider than this amendment. It has a different aspect, and that is that the tendency is not so much of taking away parental right as to deprive parents of the sense of responsibility that they ought to have by doing as much as possible for them through the State machine, and leaving as little as possible to be done by themselves.  I hold it is better to allow people go wrong sometimes than always to attempt to compel them to go right.  I do not think there is very great danger of schools running as imposters for a length of time even by the aid of very vigorous advertisement, and even if they do, and succeed for some time in imposing&mdash;that is an exceptional thing&mdash; the imposture will be found out.  That could not be prevented, as suggested in the amendment itself, by conditions to be laid down by law, and for that reason I think we should not be justified at all in adopting into our Constitution the principle which is the starting point of this amendment, and that is &ldquo;Thou shalt not establish a private school.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor WM. MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education is always interesting, but the interesting things he says are not always relevant.  The principle that underlies this amendment is that education is a national concern.  Furthermore that in a country where there is a Food and Drugs Act, in a country where we take such precautions to see that no unqualified medical man shall conduct novel and daring experiments, open hospitals, and try all sorts of new remedies, authorised merely because there are those who are willing to undergo the experiment, that in a country where we take extraordinary precautions that if a man holds himself out as a solicitor and writes a letter using a form of language intending to impress upon the reader that he is a solicitor, he can be prosecuted. Here we are in a country where we profess we seek to form a Gaelic state, and re-create in the people a reverence for education, next only to their reverence <Col N="1712" /> for religion&mdash;education&mdash;the one thing necessary, the one thing without which the people cannot live their lives fully, and get the greatest measure of advantage out of life&mdash;are we to allow anyone who choses to hire a back room in a city, and call it an educational institution for the young, and decorate himself with any title, to use the phrase the President used the other day, is he to be allowed to do so with impunity without any remedy or redress to the parents. What we want to secure is that lest children are subjected to that kind of treatment on the part of such so-called teacher the State shall see to it that the practitioner is qualified for his duty. There is a limit to the rights of parents&mdash; a well-defined limit.  A parent is not entitled for the sake of the child's salvation to baptise it, and then throw it in the river.  It may be a very noble sentiment to allow it to go out of life in a state of baptismal innocence, but the law will indict and imprison the parent who has committed any such offence.</P>

      <P>It is true that infanticide is not referred to by name. There are various forms of infanticide. There is such a thing, for instance, as death in life, and to suffer death in life, so a badly trained teacher, or an untrained teacher may be quite more evil and more injurious to the State than an actual murderer.  How many criminals are there in the community due to defective education, wrongly instilled instruction, abstract statements imparted to youth without the necessary reservations or without the practical wisdom required; in short, the communication of national hysteria from badly trained teachers giving instructions without ever having gone through the preliminary educational training necessary. The imparting of education is an art, a practical art, precisely of the same complexity and the same public value as efficiency in medicine, and that should never be lost sight of.  We do not allow parents to play tricks with their children in the name of parental freedom.  If the parents send the children out to beg, is there not a law to punish them for that?  Surely according <Col N="1713" /> to the Minister for Education the parent has the duty to exercise proper regard for the interest of his children.  Now, what we want to see laid down as a fundamental provision, is, that the State will protect itself&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;from the ill-directed efforts of the amateur educationists. That has been the plague, the blight, on education&mdash;that every man who is unfit is allowed to be an educationist. There are certain things in the amendment&mdash;certain forms of phrases to which I do not feel myself able to subscribe, but the cardinal principle in it commends itself to me.  I do not think this is a case in which it is a sufficient answer to reply that it is a matter for legislation; however, let it come up in the Educational Code.  I think it should be in the Educational Code as well as in the Constitution.  This is a Constitutional requirement just as much as that the house of a citizen ought to be his castle.  Just as much as the person of man is inviolable, so the soul and mind of the child ought to be inviolable and not to be placed at the mercy of everyone who seems to think he has a right to make a living by the business of &ldquo;education.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies, and particularly the Minister for Education, to a sub-leader in one of the morning papers upon this very important question&mdash;the vogue of psycho-analysis.  It is pointed out in this Article that the schoolmaster and the schoolmistress, or particularly those people who call themselves by those names, are dabbling in this science of the mind, and using their opportunities as teachers in private schools to ruin the minds of the children.  That is the kind of thing that is going on, and that ought to be guarded against in some way, if not by the method proposed in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not merely the ineffective teacher, but it is the experimentor that is possibly dangerous unless there is some kind of supervision.  I agree whole-heartedly with the proposition that was made by the Minister that we should encourage experiments in education.  But that must be within limits, and limits that are prescribed by law.  But if you are going to allow liberty for any person who takes up a fad of this kind&mdash;and we are only on the fringe of discovery in these psychic matters, I expect&mdash;if we are going to <Col N="1714" /> allow the child mind to be experimented upon without any restriction, it may be a very dangerous thing indeed, and I think that the object of the amendment is to prevent the possibility of that kind of thing developing.</P>

      <P>Well, Professor Magennis complimented Professor McNeill on his cleverness, and I think I can do the same for Professor Magennis himself. Let us see where we are.  Professor Magennis drew a picture of an ignoramus starting a school and getting children into it.  He agreed with Deputy O'Connell that it was quite possible to have the dead walls of a particular town placarded with advertisements praising the school, and as a result, parents might send their children there, and that in that way, they would be very badly and very poorly educated.  But he did not tell us how this particular amendment was going to remedy all this.  He did not tell us how any possible Act of Parliament could remedy this, or how any possible qualifications that might be prescribed in an Act of Parliament could remedy that.  I am sure Deputy O'Connell will agree with me that there is no ignoramus more dangerous than an ignoramus with a degree; and that it is not mere academic qualifications that make a good teacher.  I am sure of that.  And I put it to him that no Act of Parliament will do it, and if I ask Deputy O'Connell to devise an Act of Parliament for me now to make it perfectly sure that every school would be safeguarded against this thing, I don't think he could do it.  And I do not think that anybody else could do it.  I do not think that any qualification which you could put into an Act of Parliament will ensure as a matter of course, the kind of school he wants.  Deputy Magennis attempted to draw an analogy between the qualifications of doctors, solicitors, lawyers and so on.  There is absolutely no analogy. Every one of us knows that some of the best schools, some of the schools which have turned out pupils who made history, science, literature in every domain of letters and education, have been schools which have been run by men who had not the sort of qualifications likely to be put into an Act of Parliament.  It is because education is so much higher, because it is so fundamental, it is because it is such a personal matter, such a close thing between the teacher and the taught, that it is necessary and vital.  It is necessary <Col N="1715" /> at least, that there should be freedom of experiment.  I think that on consideration most people will agree that Professor MacNeill was sound when he pointed out the necessity of allowing people to experiment in that direction.  This amendment really does nothing.  It contains a principle which has been already refused by the Dáil&mdash;this principle of compulsory attendance&mdash;at least the Dáil has refused to put it into the Constitution.</P>

      <P>There is in the draft Constitution Article 12, which says &ldquo;the rights of the State in and to natural resources, the use of which is of national importance, shall not be alienated. Their exploitation by private individuals or associations shall be permitted only under State supervision and in accordance with conditions and regulations approved by legislation.&rdquo; The amendment I have to propose involves the deletion of that Article and it reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All the lands and waters, mines and minerals, within the territory of the Irish Free State hitherto vested in the State, or any department thereof, or held for the public use or benefit, and also all the natural resources of the same territory <Col N="1716" /> (including the air and all forms of potential energy), and also all royalties arising within that territory shall, from and after the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, belong to the Irish Free State, subject to any trusts, grants, leases or concessions then existing in respect thereof, or any valid private interest therein, and shall be controlled and administered by the Parliament, in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation, but the same shall not, nor shall any part thereof, be alienated, but may in the public interest be from time to time granted by way of lease or licence to work under the authority and subject to the control of the Parliament. Provided that no such lease or licence may be made for a term exceeding ninety-nine years, beginning from the date thereof, and no such lease or licence may be renewable by the terms thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that it may be found that that meets the purpose which Deputy Figgis had in mind in setting down his amendment. He, of course, will speak for himself in due course.  It reserves to the State all the land, waters, mines, minerals and all forms of potential energy within the area of the State, and it forbids their alienation and it lays down that the longest term of any lease shall be ninety-nine years, and that no such lease can provide for its own renewal.  It protects the country that has become politically free from becoming economically unfree by reason of having its resources bought up by capitalists of other countries.  I would be rather anxious to hear whether Deputy Figgis considers it a good substitute for his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to withdraw mine, seeing this has been put in its place.  I think that the Article that is now being proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs disposes of my Amendments No. 21 (A and B) and No. 40 (A) further down in the Orders of the Day, which I imagine we will hardly reach to-day, although it does not deal with 40 (B) which will arise in its own place. My remarks on that will keep.  Substantially the Article that is now being moved, by the Minister for Home Affairs, as will be apparent to anyone studying the three paragraphs I had put down <Col N="1717" /> myself, meets the case.  There are two that are matters of words and one omission of substance to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs.  I will take them in sequence as they arise.  The first is the question of words.  It occurs in the second line. There you have &ldquo;all the land and water within the territory of the Irish Free State, hitherto vested in the State&rdquo;: now to eliminate the parentheses and to come to the rest of the sentence &ldquo;vested in the State belong to the Irish Free State&rdquo;&mdash;that is the sentence, and I think there is some gap there somewhere.  Take this sentence, &ldquo;all these things, within the territory Irish Free State, hitherto vested in the State belong to the Irish Free State.&rdquo; That is a sentence one can hardly stand over.  I understand and appreciate the difficulty quite fully.  It is a matter requiring certain change of wording.  The second State referred to is the State that has hitherto prevailed. and that is the Crown of Great Britain and Ireland.  I think the Minister will probably agree with me that that sentence could not be quite stood over.  I think it was a very famous logician who once stated that a fallacy that would not deceive a child set down in a simple syllogism would deceive the profoundest scholar when put through the pages of a portentious tone.  Here is a sentence the ineffectiveness of which is rather masked by the many parentheses with which it is beset.  If you put the parentheses aside you will see that the sentence itself requires further elucidation.  I would recommend the Minister to go straight at the second State, and say exactly what he means by the State, the word &ldquo;State,&rdquo; in the second instance, being hitherto the Crown of Great Britain which is now the Irish Free State.  My second criticism is rather more than a matter of wording.  When one comes to examine it carefully, it is on the fourth and fifth lines, page 65.  The sentence reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Subject to any trusts, grants, leases or concessions then existing in respect thereof, or any valid private interest therein.&rdquo; Those are the words to which I would draw the attention of the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;Or any valid private interest therein.&rdquo; I would venture to say that that is a most dangerous sentence, and that in future law courts will put a construction on that we do not imagine at the present moment, or at least they lend themselves to be <Col N="1718" /> put such a construction perhaps, so as to render the entire provision of this Article nugatory.  When we say these things shall be &ldquo;subject to any trusts, grants, leases or concessions then existing in respect thereof&rdquo; that I think is quite sufficiently expansive, and we need not go further into any other matter quite so dangerously phrased as &ldquo;any valid private interest.&rdquo; I do urge these words should be eliminated and that the provision, the intention, and the purport of this Article would be greatly strengthened if these words were deleted.  My third criticism is this:&mdash;it is a question of omission.  I think something should be introduced into this Article as it now stands dealing with a matter I dealt with in another one of these paragraphs that I had suggested at an earlier stage, because there is one clear omission, and it is a very important omission, because at the present moment there are certain rights that have been alienated.  The Minister stated that the provisions of the Article would frustrate any future alienations, but they do not deal with the major right of this State over alienations which have already been made.  Some of these alienations deal with matters of great importance we know, for example, there are many parts of our coast line where the foreshore has been alienated.  I know where alienations are being sought for by foreign speculators. Foreign prospectors knowing this country is coming to a period of great development have come in and have seen places where ports of considerable magnitude may be developed, and where they have got leases of the foreshore, the most valuable territory possibly of any country, of a country certainly, that abuts on the sea, with ports and bays and creeks of great importance that they have around the shore of Ireland.  I think I should like to see some form of wording suggested and accepted, by which the Irish Free State would claim an ascendant right over all these alienations that have already been made, and even compelling them to be for terms not exceeding ninety-nine years.  We know, there is a man in America at the present moment, of the name of &ldquo;Vanderbilt&rdquo; who is reputed to be one of the richest men in the world.  What made him that, not industry of his own, no but simply because right far back at the beginning of the development of the United States of America, one of the Vanderbilts happened <Col N="1719" /> to have a farm in the middle of what is now the City of New York; and because the citizens of the State have made New York what it is, that Vanderbilt is a rich man.  If Vanderbilt had made the money himself I for the moment would say that he is entitled to the riches he has made or earned, but when other people have made that value, when other people have increased that value, then I say the State should step in and say this wealth had been created by the Nation at large to which it belongs and should be vested in the Nation at large, so I say, to any speculator&mdash;we have many now and we shall have more within the next few years,&mdash;I say to any speculator who comes over to Ireland and who sees clearly there is a port going to be developed in this part of the coast and who gets a lease on that part of the foreshore, because I should be inclined to say that some exist at the present moment, I should say that &ldquo;if on that foreshore a great port is created by the energy of the Irish people the benefit of that will accrue not to you, but to the Irish people.&rdquo; In the third instance, the omission I think that might be provided for very simply by a form of wording. That is the only criticism I have to make on this Article in respect of which I withdraw three of the four amendments I had put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking these criticisms in their order, it is admitted that the first sentence reads awkwardly, in view of the frequent repetition of the word &ldquo;State.&rdquo; It may perhaps read better if, instead of &ldquo;The Irish Free State&rdquo; you have there &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; It is better to have, I suppose, as a choice a thing that refers to the previous State than to have a direct reference to the Crown, which gets on the nerves on so many of the people in this Dáil while it does not at all get on ours.  We would suggest a change there, instead of on the second line, &ldquo;After the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution,&rdquo; that that date could be made, of course, the Treaty date.  The other obvious objection about the purport of the sentence which refers to any valid existing interest or any trusts, leases and concessions, is more weighty.  It is an objection of substance, and just as Deputy Figgis's speech was an elaborate euphonism for expropriation which is a rather serious <Col N="1720" /> proposition and rather an unwise proposition at the birth of a new State.  If we are to go forward in peace and progress and reconstruction we must go forward with the goodwill of all citizens.</P>

      <P>I would like to explain that I think the Minister has misunderstood me.  I agree that the the sentence, &ldquo;subject to any trusts, grants, leases or concessions then existing in respect thereof&rdquo;; I agreed to that, but what I do not think strengthens it, but rather weakens it, are the other six words, &ldquo;or any valid private interest therein,&rdquo; the awkwardness being the subsequent interpretation that may be given to the word &ldquo;valid.&rdquo; That is embodied in the words, &ldquo;trusts, grants, leases and concessions.&rdquo; That will meet the criticism that he is now making, that I was thinking of expropriation, because that was not in my mind at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection to those six words will be noted.  I could not undertake more at the moment because I think it would be a mistake for us, who have a responsibility for this Bill, to accept amendments hastily and without careful examination of their implications.  In the concluding portion the Article forbids alienation and it limits the terms of a lease to ninety-nine years, and provides that it cannot be by its own terms renewable.  I think that is as far as we can go, but to suggest that existing leases might be cancelled is, I think, taking a wrong view of the situation.  It is not as if we have absolutely won out to the full extent of our programme.  By and as a result of negotiations with the British, and not as the result of a smashing defeat, or being driven into the sea, or anything of that kind, the British are leaving this country and we are stepping into their shoes. We have in a great many matters to accept their liabilities here, just as we are bound to their Civil Servants and to their Officials, either to keep them on or to pension them in accordance with the Treaty, so in a great many matters we have to honour their Bonds, treating them as our predecessors and stepping into their shoes.  We have to honour their Bond on this question of leases and existing agreements, which is not one that we could or that we ought to deal lightly with.  As I say, if we were going forward we have to do so with the <Col N="1721" /> confidence and goodwill of all sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are few words in addition which I suggest the Minister might accept in the top line, on page 65.  The clause at present reads: &ldquo;And also all Royalties arising within that Territory.&rdquo; There are many existing grants, as everybody knows, from the Crown, which are terminable, grants of Royalties strictly speaking, such as Fairs, Markets, foreshore rights, and franchise and all the rest, which are terminable on the cessation of male heirs.  These are all existing Royalties that if they were determined the word &ldquo;arising&rdquo; would not apply because they arose long ago.  They would fall back to the grantor&mdash;the Crown&mdash;unless you provided in this Constitution that they shall go back to the Free State.  I would suggest to substitute the words &ldquo;worked or enjoyed&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;also all royalties and franchises arising within that territory, shall, subject to any grants&rdquo;&mdash;and so on&mdash;&ldquo;belong to the Free State.&rdquo; The effect of that would be that if one of these came to an end they would go back, not to the grantor or successor of the grantor, but to the Free State itself, and I think that there can be no objection whatever to these words.  Also, in the last line of the fourth clause&mdash;&ldquo;may, in the public interest, from time to time, be granted by way of lease or licence to work under the authority.&rdquo; I think that &ldquo;to work&rdquo; or to be &ldquo;to be worked&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;may be granted by way of lease or licence to be worked or enjoyed under the authority of the Free State.&rdquo; I only throw this out as a suggestion.</P>

Dáil Eireann is accepted practically as an English word.

      <P>I move immediately after Article 27 to insert a new Article as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Each University in the Irish Free State, which was in existence at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall be entitled to elect three representatives to the Dáil upon a franchise and in a manner to be prescribed by law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment arises from a decision here from the Committee Stage, whereby the Dáil approved of the principle of representation for the Universities in the Lower House.  To visualise the position Deputies will remember it was a definite agreement with representative Southern Unionists&mdash;I use the word rather than representatives of the Southern Unionists&mdash;that there should be representation in the Senate for Universities. Then the principle was adopted here that there would be representation in the Dáil and those who pleaded for that, said that for that consideration they were prepared to sacrifice the <Col N="1726" /> clauses of the Agreement which referred to University representation in the Senate.  Now it is felt that having departed even in detail from the Agreement, that those who departed from it should definitely put up and insert in the Constitution the consideration for that departure, otherwise people would be in the position of having given up a fairly valuable thing&mdash;University representation in the Senate&mdash;and having nothing definite or binding to show in its place. Now, realising that, and anxious to make it quite clear that we did not simply enter into an agreement with certain people in London and come home and run away from it, but simply giving in place of what we removed from that Agreement, or something considered of more value by the very people it was intended to cater for, I would move this Article.  It was thought better to have three there as it will more easily enable Proportional Representation to be carried out.</P>

Nevertheless, I am bound to say now, that we come to this matter, I think the change from forty to sixty, besides making the election of the Senate an exceedingly difficult matter from the point of view of the electorate, also alters the entire character of the Senate.

If you have a large Senate elected over a wide territory and that particular type of person whom the manner of election will choose you get a Senate that would very largely lose its authority, as it would lose that mode of selection that would seem to be preferred. I suppose if it is involved in the pledge given, the matter is too far gone. I think it a very great pity we should have sixty and not be at liberty to put it down to forty, as I think forty would have suited the Senate very much better from everyone's view, including those who wished the number at sixty.</P>

I am informed by experts who understand the business that before the end of this financial year there <Col N="1729" /> will have to be some financial performances which could not strictly be called a Budget, and would more strictly be called Estimates.  On line 37 it is proposed to delete the word &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;Financial resolutions.&rdquo; Both of these amendments refer to Article 36.

      <P>I do not know whether that is proposed as an incitement.  Being somewhat prone to incitement, I accept the challenge.  I think the word &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; is very much better and the reason why is that you have all the financial estimates proposed in one solid body with no tag ends hanging about.  There is a certain solidity and a certain gathering together of all the Estimates embodied in the word &ldquo;Budget,&rdquo; and if that is going to be deleted on the proposal of the permanent officers of the Department of Finance, I do not like the augury it suggests.  There is one other matter.  Article 37 is affected by this amendment.  I do not press my liking for the word Budget in preference to the word Estimates to any conclusion, but I take this opportunity of stating it.  There is a matter implied in Article 37, which reads: &ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law, unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same Session been recommended by a message from the Representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo; Since we debated that, this Dáil has done one other thing which I think affects this Article to a certain degree.  It decided there shall be certain Ministers directly responsible to this Dáil, who shall not be Ministers of the Executive Council, and these Ministers would be able to come directly to the Dáil and put proposals before it involving the expenditure of money, presumably, and would ask the sanction of this Dáil directly.  If this Dáil is precluded from granting these proposals until it has first got the consent of the Executive Council, then you have got there Ministers who are not Ministers, but Ministers of Ministers, camping out and masquerading as Ministers.  We ought to consider this very carefully in respect of this Article, because of the commitments <Col N="1730" /> we have since undertaken in the Executive Clauses.  I think it is questionable now, unless you are going to tie up your directly responsible Ministers.</P>

      <P>I might say an explanatory word.  The first reference to Budget refers to estimates before the end of the previous financial year, and the second reference to Budget should be &ldquo;financial resolutions,&rdquo; because it refers to the proceedings after the commencement of current financial year upon which subsequent legislation is founded.  This is done under existing Statute.  The Budget, there in each of these references, means two separate performances; one is estimates before the end of the current financial year, and the other refers to the proceedings after the commencement of the current financial year.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the unfortunate report of the unfortunate Committee over which I had the misfortune to preside, saddled the poor Ministers with this.  It is not really their fault.  It has been pushed upon them, but the corrections are certainly right, because the word Budget, as the Minister has stated, is used in two entirely different senses, and therefore it is obviously improper to use the same word in the same section with two different meanings.  In the first place it must mean estimates of the receipts and expenditure, and why not say so, and in the second place it means the resolution necessary to provide for expenditure and taxation necessary for the coming year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this Military matter, which is also a civil matter, I trust I will not be accused of making a wanton attack on the Army Authorities for they represent one of the very few Departments of Government for which I have a profound respect. The matter arises in this way.  Three weeks ago, or less, this Dáil passed a resolution sanctioning the establishment of Emergency Courts by the Army Authorities, subject to certain restrictions. Now the important thing here in which the Dáil was then concerned, and should be concerned now, is the fundamental principle that this Dáil must control the liberty of the citizen, and that that principle must be applied, even in time of war, and more particularly where you are dealing with civilians.  What has happened is this, that acting upon what I conceive to be a misinterpretation of the resolution of this Dáil, the Army Council has issued a Proclamation in the Press whereby they purport to take power to sentence people to death for certain offences.  Now I venture to assert that the greater number of Members of this Dáil who heard the debate on this question at the end of September had clearly in mind that what was being done and what was intended was this, that whenever the Military Authorities deemed it necessary to take power to impose the death sentence, they would before assuming that power, bring before this Dáil, and lay on the table of this Dáil for four days, the Regulations governing the exercise of this power.  This is the interpretation, I venture to say, in which the matter was generally understood.  It is obvious that the Army Authorities have placed a different interpretation upon it. Now the resolution provided first of all for the setting up of Military Courts, and secondly, for the enquiry by such Military <Col N="1732" /> Courts into the cases of persons charged with certain offences, and one of the offences was the breach of any General Order or Regulation made by the Army Council.  That resolution of this Dáil never intended to create offences which did not exist before, and the Dáil will observe that the Military Authorities are not claiming to act under any law at all unless it be the resolution of this Dáil. There is no other law justifying them in the measure they propose to adopt.  The resolution, therefore, sets out vaguely and generally, certain things which the Military consider they must have special power to deal with.  One of them was unlawful possession of any property, looting, arson, destruction, seizure, unlawful possession, or removal of, or damage to, any public or private property.  That cannot be intended as a definition of crime.  If you are going to make regulations that a man may not have some particular seditious literature, you will say so in your Regulation, but no Parliament that ever existed could have intended to make provision in such general terms as these and then say &ldquo;we thereby have defined an offence.&rdquo; They do not thus define any offence.  They merely describe generally a certain class of things for which Military Courts would be required and then they proceed to say that Regulations would be made.  That phrase about the regulations appeared in the fourth of the four paragraphs.  Apparently it has been assumed that because things like looting and unlawful possession of property are mentioned in separate clauses, therefore you need no regulations to deal with it. Now the Military Authorities have issued a Proclamation in which they themselves say they have issued regulations which have not been on the table of the Dáil. The Military Authorities recognise that they could not bring up people for sentences before their Military Tribunals until they had made regulations on the matter.  I have not seen these regulations, neither have members of the Dáil generally.  Therefore, I take it, they do not define the class of property which you are to have to expose yourself to trial by one of these courts.  But the Military say they made regulations on the 2nd October, 1922, providing for the trial of civilians charged by these courts.  And then they give the penalties, including death, as being the sequel of these sentences, and they state that these regulations made by the Army Council <Col N="1733" /> on the 2nd October, shall come into force and apply on the 15th October. Now the wording of this thing is bad.  I admit that; the wording of the resolution of the Dáil is bad, but I do not think that any interpretation of the wording would justify the view taken by the Military Authorities, that because certain things described generally in this Resolution by the Dáil, certain things which had to be indicated, therefore, it meant that it was going to give the right to the Military Authorities to make regulations outside this House, under which people might be sentenced to death.  Note, these offences are offences only by virtue of these resolutions, and this resolution provides that a breach of any order or regulation made by the Army Council is to be a subject matter for enquiry by these Courts. Now, in the resolution passed by the Dáil, you have these words:&mdash;They recite these various offences established by these courts, and so forth, and then they say &ldquo;Now this Dáil being of opinion that the doing by or under the Authority of the Army Council of the several matters aforesaid is a matter of military necessity doth hereby ratify and approve of the sanction given by the Government and of the doing by or under the Authority of the Army Council of all or any of the acts and matters aforesaid.  Provided, however, that as regards such general order or regulation as aforesaid the same shall specify the maximum penalty which may be inflicted for any breach thereof and shall be laid on the table of this Dáil and shall take effect on the expiration of four days thereafter during which the Dáil shall be in session unless this Dáil shall have previously passed a resolution disallowing the same.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that can only have meant&mdash;that if the Military found it necessary to lay down that certain things were punished by their special courts with death, they would bring the regulations down to this Dáil and lay them on the table so that everybody could see them four days before putting the regulations into force.  And I may call the attention of the Minister for Defence to the fact that the actual wording of his own proclamation makes it clear that the phrase dealing with the breach of the regulations and the phrase therefore requiring the regulations to be laid on the table of this Dáil applies to any regulations made by the Army Council.  The resolution says so in so <Col N="1734" /> many words.  &ldquo;A breach of any general order made by the Army Council&rdquo; is the express wording in the regulation.  These are the words in the recital.  Now the operative part of these regulations come into force only after they have been four days on the table of the Dáil.  The Military admit they have made regulations in their own Proclamation.  If this Resolution be against them then there are their own words.  A breach of the regulations cannot be committed until the regulations lie on the table of this Dáil.</P>

    <P>It is hereby notified that the following resolution was passed by Dáil Eireann on the 28th day of September, 1922, namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) WHEREAS the Government has entrusted to the Army the duty of securing the public safety and restoring order throughout the country and has placed on the Army the responsibility for the establishment of the authority of the Government in all parts of the country in which that authority is challenged by force.</P>
    <P>(2) AND WHEREAS the Army Council has represented to the Government that in order to discharge effectively the duty and responsibility so placed on them it is essential that the Army Council should have power to set up Military Courts or Committees with full powers of enquiring into charges and inflicting punishments on persons found guilty of acts calculated to interfere with or delay the effective establishment of the authority of the Government, and that the Army Council should have power to authorise the detention in places whether within or without the area of the jurisdiction of the Government of persons in Military custody and power to control the dealing in and possession of fire arms.</P>
    <P>(3) AND WHEREAS the Government recognising the force of such representations has sanctioned the doing under <Col N="1735" /> the authority of the Army Council of all or any of the following matters and things.</P>
    <P>(a)  The setting up of Military Courts or Committees for the enquiring into charges against persons in respect of any of the offences hereinafter mentioned provided however, that every Military Court or Committee shall include as a member thereof at least one person nominated by the Minister of Defence and certified by the Law Officer to be a person of legal knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>(b)  The enquiry by such Military Courts or Committees into the cases of persons charged with any of the offences following, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Taking part in or aiding or abetting any attack upon or using force against the National Forces.</P>
    <P>(2)  Looting arson destruction seizure unlawful possession or removal of or damage to any public or private property.</P>
    <P>(3)  Having possession without proper authority of any bomb or article in the nature of a bomb or any dynamite gelignite or other explosive substance or any revolver rifle gun or other firearm or lethal weapon or any ammunition for such firearm.</P>
    <P>(4)  The breach of any general order or regulation made by the Army Council</P>
    <P>and the infliction by such Military Courts or Committees of the punishment of death or of penal servitude for any period or of imprisonment for any period or of a fine of any amount either with or without imprisonment on any person found guilty by such Court or Committee of any of the offences aforesaid. Provided that no such sentence of death be executed except under the countersignature of two members of the Army Council.</P>
    <P>(c)  The removal under authority of the Army Council of any person taken prisoner arrested or detained by the National Forces to any place or places whether within or without the area of jurisdiction of the Government and the detention or imprisonment of any such persons in any place or places within or without the area aforesaid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> (d)  The regulation and control of the sale possession transfer of and dealing in revolvers rifles guns and other firearms.</P>
    <P>(4) NOW this Dáil being of opinion that the doing by or under the Authority of the Army Council of the several matters aforesaid is a matter of military necessity doth hereby ratify and approve of the sanction given by the Government and of the doing by or under the Authority of the Army Council of all or any of the acts and matters aforesaid.  Provided however that as regard such general order or regulation as aforesaid the same shall specify the maximum penalty which may be inflicted for any breach thereof and shall be laid on the table of this Dáil and shall take effect on the expiration of four days thereafter during which this Dáil shall be in session unless this Dáil shall have previously passed a resolution disallowing the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now from the ordinary wording of these Regulations I suggest, without any further argument, it is perfectly clear that there is only one reference to the general orders or regulations made by the Army Council and that paragraph 3 indicates clear authority for the infliction of any of the punishments mentioned without further ado.  In the case of offences under 1, 2, and 3 and that where the last paragraph says &ldquo;provided how ever that as regards any such general order or regulation as aforesaid the same shall specify the maximum penalty which may be inflicted for any breach thereof and shall be laid on the table of this Dáil and shall take effect on the expiration of four days thereafter, during which this Dáil shall be in Session unless this Dáil shall have previously passed the Resolution disallowing the same.&rdquo; If that is not perfectly clear I would refer Deputy Gavan Duffy to the Orders of the Day of the 28th September and in these Orders of the Day he will find there is an amendment down under the name of the Uachtaran to add to Clause 3, section b., sub-section 4, the following words, &ldquo;provided however that as regards such general orders or regulations as aforesaid the same shall be laid upon the table of the Dáil and same shall take effect on the expiration of four sitting days during which the Dáil shall be in Session unless the Dáil shall have previously passed a Resolution disallowing the same.&rdquo; And that clause was transferred to the end.</P>

      <P>I do not know why it was, but certainly reading the wording of the resolution cannot have been to bear out your point.  In the Order or Proclamation that the Army Council has issued on the matter, there is reference to the regulation made on the 2nd October, 1922.  These Regulations were not of a nature that had to be laid before this Dáil in any way, and did not affect the authority under which we were working.  These regulations were the general regulations as to the trial of civilians by military courts and are regulations for the guidance of our officers as to the general procedure to be adopted, and for the convening of the courts and the constitution of them, places of assembly, and general regulations concerning the routine of these courts.  I recommended to the Deputy when he raised the matter here to-day that he would read the regulations as passed here in the Dáil and I recommend it to him again.  And I recommend him to look at the Orders of the Day and also to see that portion of the debates recorded in the Parliamentary Proceedings of Sept. 28th, and to look at some of the remarks there, and to appreciate the implication of them.</P>

      <P>I have already done that, and I take it, that the effect of the Minister's speech is that no regulations will ever be laid on the table of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>And he will take another opportunity when I have finished. I happened to see some of the remarks that I passed, and I am not in the habit of reading my own speeches.  I happened to read a particular statement that I made on these regulations, when I put them forward and I wish now to remind the Deputy that I was very much pleased with the wisdom that I showed on that occasion.  The change which I refer to was the change which was imposed by this Dáil, and it had reference solely and exclusively to the regulation that would be made by the Army, outside of the three particular items that I specified in my statement.  And I left the Dáil under no misapprehension whatever with regard to the implication of these three <Col N="1738" /> things.  If the Deputy in his innocence thinks that these statements were not meant by us&mdash;that we did not mean business&mdash;that is a matter, that as he grows older he will improve on.  It is unfortunate that a man of the simple mind of Deputy Gavan Duffy should have made such an extraordinary statement about the meaning of certain words.  We were well advised in putting them in. We did it, as we explained, to preserve the lives of our soldiers, to preserve the freedom of Deputies coming here, and to preserve the ordered fabric of society. If any propaganda is to be used against these regulations that we have laid down, and if any ulterior motives exist, except in the minds of Deputies or people outside &mdash;that is one of the disadvantages that we have to put up with in this country, from people who have been unable to withstand the shock of war and from people who seek to evade their responsibility and that liability that a representative has got to stand up to in a case like this.  We knew well what the implications of these regulations were, we know them now.  We know that there is not a single member of the Ministry, that has not a reversionary disadvantage by reason of the responsibility that they put upon themselves and they did it for the security of their own troops, for the security of their own families, and of the families of the nation.  It is vital, it is important, and it has this disadvantage for some of us, who have lost some dear members of our families; and this Dáil has lost two of its noblest representatives. And if every Member of this Dáil was to be wiped out and only one Deputy left, he himself would be forced to bring forward the same resolution, and the Army would have to make the same regulations against people who are guilty of crimes.  And these people are guilty of the crimes that have been laid down in the regulations.  They are crimes&mdash;they are crimes against the nation and the law of this country; and if you are to wipe out the whole code, and if you bring in a new code&mdash;even a Deputy Gavan Duffy code&mdash; there would be the same regulations, and you would have to stand up against them any feelings you have, or sympathy you have for these people notwithstanding.</P>
      <P>Motion: &ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn,&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 3 o'clock on October 19.</P>
