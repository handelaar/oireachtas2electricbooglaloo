      <P>To ask the President whether it is intended to introduce legislation for the purpose of giving effect to the Irish side of the mutual understanding for an amnesty to the troops and other forces engaged upon either side in the recent conflict between Ireland and England; and whether any steps have been taken to ensure the fulfilment by the English Government of their side of the bargain.</P>

      <P>Mutual undertakings of amnesty and indemnity in respect of matters arising out of the Anglo-Irish trouble were exchanged between the British and Irish Governments at the time of the handing over of control by the British.  These undertakings will need to be covered by appropriate legislation on both sides.  It is our intention to submit a Bill to the Oireachtas for this purpose as soon as the Constitution is through.  We will request the British Government to cover their undertaking by like legislation so far as may be necessary to give effect to it.</P>

The question of compensation to the owners of the Hibernian Hall for any loss sustained by the commandeering of their premises, is one for the Minister of Defence, to whom this portion of the question should be addressed.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that great distress exists at Howth because of the failure of the fishing industry there, in conformity with the failure of the same industry throughout Ireland; and whether, in view of this failure, he will put the recommendations embodied in the Fishing Report of the Commission of Inquiry, 1921, into effect.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the results of the past season's fishing at Howth have proved very unprofitable to the fishermen&mdash;as to the drift net fishery because of the unsatisfactory market conditions, and as to the line and trawl fishery because of a shortage of fish on the fishing grounds.  It is the case as the Deputy suggests, that fishing as an industry has been a failure on the Irish coasts in the last couple of years, and this is also true of many other countries where the fisheries are of economic importance. The rehabilitation of our national fisheries is one of many matters urgently calling for attention; and when, in the near future, a general scheme comes to be formulated, first consideration will naturally be given to the recommendations embodied in the report to which reference is made.</P>

Longford, Record No. 9873, Ordnance Sheet No. 19, was divided in 1916, and that one of the tenants was named Joseph Keane.  And whether it was with the sanction of the Estates Commissioners a Sub-Commissioner, on June 3rd, 1920, changed the boundary between the lands of Joseph Keane and Mrs. Kate Keane, without notifying the former; <Col N="2289" /> and whether in the change some of Joseph Keane's land was allotted to Mrs. Keane, and the fall of water off Joseph Keane's land stopped, thereby causing considerable annoyance; and whether the Minister would see that Joseph Keane gets his full right to the land he is paying for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In the division of untenanted land acquired on the More O'Ferrall estate under the Land Purchase Acts, the Estates Commissioners allotted parcels to Joseph Keane and Mrs. Kate Keane, the occupiers of small holdings in the neighbourhood.  The boundary between the parcels is a wide bank with dykes on each side, and the centre of the bank is the boundary.  There was subsequently a dispute between the parties as to the ownership of the bank, and an Assistant Inspector visited the lands and explained the position to both parties. He suggested as a settlement of the dispute that one party might agree to take the entire bank for half its length, and the other the remaining half, and the representatives of the parties appeared to approve of the proposal.  It is understood that Joseph Keane subsequently applied to the District and afterwards to the Circuit Courts, and that they decided in favour of the settlement proposed by the Inspector.  It is not apparent how such a settlement could interfere with the drainage of the lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had correspondence with the representatives of the United Irish Plotholders' Union with reference to allotments in Dublin and immediate neighbourhood.  The plotholders have requested that certain land which was let voluntarily for plots for last season should be acquired compulsorily for the coming season by the Department of Agriculture.  I have replied to the Union <Col N="2290" /> that it is premature at present to conclude that sufficient land to meet the requirements of plotholders next year will not be available through voluntary lettings; that the power of taking land compulsorily for this purpose was derived from measures hurriedly enacted by the British Parliament during the European War in order to provide against a threatened shortage of food, and that the emergency then anticipated has passed away.  If there is to be permanent provision for allotments in this country it should be made under an Act passed after due consideration by the Dáil.  I appreciate the advantages of the Plotholding Movement and hope to see legislative proposals on the subject placed before the Dáil in the coming year.  In the meantime, persons who desire to obtain land for allotments should endeavour to do so by negotiation with the owners concerned.</P>

      <P>(replying for Minister for Industry and Commerce): The Great Northern Railway Company states that it has not held any open competitive examination for male clerkships since 1918 for the reason that such clerical vacancies as it has been necessary to fill have been given to men who served in the European War and were out of employment or to the sons and near relatives of the Company's own employees. The Company asserts that its right to fill vacancies by appointing sons and relatives of its own employees has always been definitely recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we pass to the Orders of the Day there was a question of ruling on a matter of privilege that I wanted to bring before your attention.  When this Dáil last rose a certain question came up with regard to the shooting of four men.  I was not in the Dáil at the time and subsequently on reading the debate&mdash;both in the press and in the official debates&mdash;I notice in both places that some words were used that appear to me to reflect upon the case that was to be tried the following day&mdash;the case of the late Mr. Erskine Childers.  I do not desire to confuse this matter by introducing any question of names, so that it may not be said that a question of party or a question of personalities entered into the matter in the least.  I am aware also that it might be held that the reflection upon the case to be heard was of a nature that might possibly be allowable, although it is true that the reporters of one of the Dublin papers declined to print the sentences that were used in the fear less the privileges of this Dáil might not protect that paper from an action for contempt of court.  That did occur in one of the papers and it shows that the thought was present at least in the minds of others than my own.  I have the actual quotations here, the actual references here which presupposed that the case to be tried had been tried and that the person was found guilty and was about to be executed.  I do not quote the exact words, I do not refer to the speeches, because I want to keep the question as purely and as abstractly as possible upon what I submit to be a breach of the privileges, perhaps even a breach amounting to a perversion of privilege. I would like to think that there would be some method taken whereby this Dáil would come to the conclusion that whereas it was itself the only judge of <Col N="2295" /> anything said here, and that all matters referred to here were subject to the privilege that it extended over these words, nevertheless anything that reflected upon the case to be heard in a Court of Justice and still sub-judice would be called to order and would not be permitted to be proceeded with.  It is a matter that I think is of some importance as touching the dignity of this Dáil and the dignity of its debates.  And I would like to bring it before you in order that there may be ruling, that such comments in advance of a case were not comments that should be made.  I am perfectly sure that the words were used in inadvertence and I am assuming that in advance, and for that reason I am not quoting them here.  But just as a matter that requires some kind of decision I like to raise it here now.</P>

      <P>The last batch of Estimates presented caused some criticism to be directed against them on account of the lack of details generally in many of the Estimates as compared with the full details published in a number of them. There is substance in the criticism, but Members will realise the difficulties under which the staff of the Ministry of Finance, whose duty it is to see that these Estimates are properly prepared, labour.  Now, the setting up of all this machinery was complicated and it has proved physically impossible to give the information which has been desired, and the absence of which has given rise to much criticism.  It is hoped that when presenting the Estimates for the coming year, 1923-24, sufficient information will be given to satisfy the Members on that point at any rate.  The first one is the Ministry of Finance.  I am moving:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil in Committee having considered the Estimates for the Ministry of Finance in 1922-23, and having passed a Vote on Account of £55,000 for the period to 6th December, 1922, recommend that the full Estimate of £68,100 be adopted in due course by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

They have a Ministry of Finance which costs nearly as much, and they have been able to give all the details that are required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">

      <P>I wonder if they have given them from the beginning.  If my recollection is correct, the Northern <Col N="2297" /> Government referred to by Mr. Johnson was set up by an Act of 1920.  We came into operation, practically speaking, on an Act passed in 1922, so that they have arrived at a little more efficient stage than we have.  They have had a good start.  Now, with regard to this particular Ministry of Finance, the only thing I have to draw attention to is, it is practically an administrative office for salaries, and so on, and I do not think that it raises any particular question that requires explanation.</P>

      <P>I think it would be well if we had a statement even in a general way from the Minister for Finance as to the relations which exist between the Finance Ministry and the other Ministries.  What power exactly has the Finance Department of holding up legislation or holding up proposals which may be made by Ministers of other Departments?  I have several instances in my mind in connection with a particular Department which I know a good deal about, where, under the old regime, proposals which were made by this particular Department, and which they believed were good proposals, were turned down without any, or very little, preliminary <Col N="2298" /> consideration; and we would like to know if, under the new order of things, the power rests with the Finance Department to turn down any scheme which may be proposed by, say, the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Education, and that the only consideration would be the question of cost.  Now, I can quite well understand that if the Minister goes into new schemes, or the cost of the proposed new schemes, it is necessary to find out from the Minister for Finance whether there is money there to meet this.  But it is not so much exactly under that head I would complain as the turning down of them on the matter of details.  I know that in the Education Department, under the old British regulations, they could scarcely make the simplest rule for the administration of their Department without getting the consent of the Treasury, which generally meant the consent of a clerk or official in Dublin Castle at the time who knew absolutely nothing as to the necessity for these particular regulations or rules.  It would be well if we had a statement on that point from the Minister.  Now, under the third section here, Estimates are presented in connection with the Teachers' Pension Office, and that particular Department is under the control of the Ministry for Finance.  There is just one or two matters I think it necessary to draw attention to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw special attention to the way in which the teachers' pensions have been treated by the particular Department responsible. No class in Ireland, I think, no other body of people in Ireland, have been treated so badly, and I think that is pretty generally admitted by those on the Government side, who are best qualified to know the position in which they are.  I shall not go into details now, except to say that over 2,000 or 2,500 <Col N="2299" /> of these people have a pension which amounts, on the average, to only £40 per year or a little over it, and that of every class which was receiving money from public funds this is the only one which got no increase whatsoever up to 1920.  Old Age Pensions were increased and the pensions of the Police were increased, but up to the year 1920 these got no increase.  Now, in England and Scotland the pensions of the retired teachers were increased in 1917 and again in 1918.  In 1919 the Pensions Increase Act was passed in England and this applied to Ireland.  Under that Act a certain percentage of increases were given to the teachers but owing to a technicality that we need not go into now, but which the Minister for Education is fully aware of, practically all the advantages that might have come under that Act to the Irish teachers were taken away from them.  This matter was brought under the notice of the Minister for Education in the Provisional Government&mdash;Deputy Finian Lynch&mdash;immediately he took over the office, and he admitted the justice of the claim that was made on the retired teachers' behalf, and even went so far as to make a public announcement, that in the near future he would have it adjusted.  He was quite sincere and quite honest in that, but possibly he was speaking without his book.  He had not at that time the experience which he has now; he had not come up against the Finance Department. In May, in any case, the matter was thrashed out, I understand, with the Finance Department, and a certain offer was made.  It was not at all anything like what was expected and what would have met the case, but such as it was it would have been something. This technicality I speak of was overruled by the Irish Treasury.  Since May nothing has been done and we are now in November, and these people have still got nothing, and I think it is necessary to urge that this matter should be attended to immediately.  There is just another matter, and that is the question of the regulations which the Treasury have made, or are insisting on making in connection with teachers who are now retiring.  There is a regulation under which the pension is calculated on the salary, but it seems strange that teachers who now retire cannot, as in all branches of the Civil Service, take advantage of their salary up to the date of retirement; <Col N="2300" /> for instance, teachers who retire in January and February must calculate their salary up to the previous 31st March only, and that is a very great grievance especially just at present, and I hope that it will be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am asking is that the Finance Minister, in his statement, has made no reference to this matter which is of great importance, and as we are very much concerned with the financial position, I wish to place a few matters before the Dáil. As far as I can understand the receipts for this year, if anything, would be in the neighbourhood of twenty-seven millions.  The fourteen twenty-fifths of 48 millions is what we should receive here in this portion of Ireland known as Saorstát Eireann.  The Minister for Finance has stated that the deficit at the end of this year will only amount to ten millions, but in my calculation, as a private member, I make out that it will amount to £20,000,000; the Excess Profits Tax amounted to seven millions and our proportion of that would be four million, but I do not think that will be collected at all because times are very bad.  The Income Tax will not materialise to the extent it did last year, and if you take from that twenty-seven million the amount to be paid for War Debt, <Col N="2301" /> I imagine the amount will be twenty millions, leaving us eighteen to twenty millions in deficit, and I am surprised that when this tremendous amount of money was being voted away that some effort was not made to let the people understand the position we were in. We are Twenty-Six Counties and each of those Twenty-Six Counties has to bear a burden of one and a half million for taxation and half a million in local rates, and of the people of those Twenty-Six Counties, three millions or so, there are nearly two millions out of the three not three weeks away from starvation, and it puzzles me to know where all this money is coming from.  I would like to ask an explanation from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements of Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Wilson are to some extent contradictory. On the one hand they raise the matter regarding teachers' pensions which require supplementing, and on the other there is an objection to the enormous expenditure that is incurred by reason of those Estimates, and it is rather difficult to please both sides.  Deputy O'Connell wants to know what is the duty of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance exercises paternal solicitude over all the other Ministers, and, just as one who is sick calls in a doctor, when Ministries want money they come to the Minister for Finance. If each Ministry were to be only the consideration of the Minister concerned it would be easy to settle things, but each particular sphere of activity must be considered in relation to the whole, and if Members take the trouble to look up the Dáil Debates they will find that there were not many opportunities for the distribution of any more money than we are at present administering unless some other source of revenue be tapped. We are not tapping that source and consequently the administration of the various Ministries must be kept within the limits of our capability to discharge the liabilities for the year.  The late General Collins had agreed to certain increases under the Pensions Increase Act on pensions calculated under the 1914 Act, and this question is now under the consideration of the Law Adviser. <Col N="2302" /> There are many more things other than that under his consideration.  We are clearing up and building up and administering at the same time.  This would come under the question of ordinary administration, and although I admit these pensions are as serious to the persons involved as any question of financial adjustment between the two countries, we have only to consider the importance of questions with relation to their significance to the whole country. I do not know why he should make an onslaught upon the Finance Ministry in connection with the reduction of expenditure, and I suppose it was simply for the purpose of raising it that such a reduction was proposed.  I suppose we could get on without that £100, but within the last two months I gave a fairly exhaustive account of the whole matter in this year's revenue returns. I am speaking now from recollection. There is no sum included under Excess Profits Duty that we have received within the first six months of this year.  I take it that the Members on those benches will admit that it was not a very sound proposition.  We have received ten millions, and it is reasonable to expect we will receive more than ten million in the second half of the year, because Members being conservative themselves with regard to the handing out of money know that the majority of people wait until the last moment to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In addition, you have the security of the Auditor and the Accountant-General, who view all these things in a cold, detached manner.  In the compilation of the Estimates everybody knows that to a certain extent there cannot be that degree of exactitude that most people imply, and the common function of the Ministry of Finance is certainly not to precipitate finance, and it has been found most successful in other countries.</P>

      <P>With regard to this special type of school, I think it would be well that we would know something or have some statement from the Ministry as to the measure of control which the Government has offered these institutions, and what action is taken to see that they are carried out in a proper way.  We want to know whether they are private or semi-private or public institutions or charitable institutions, or profit-making institutions.  As I understand, they have in addition to the Government grant, a grant from the County Councils.  Then they have the earnings of the workshops and they have, of <Col N="2305" /> course, farms and gardens, and I am informed that their lay employees&mdash; manual teachers, say, teachers of carpentry, tailoring, shoe-making and such, are paid under the ordinary Trade Union wages in the particular district.  We do not know what regulations are made by the Government to see that full value is given for the grants which are given for these schools.  I put that question some time ago to the Minister for Local Government with regard to the pensions, or rather the want of pensions to people employed in these schools.  His reply was to the effect that while provision was made for them under the Children Act of 1908 the schools were not in a financial position to give pensions.  I do not know, of course, how the Minister arrived at that, but I can assure him that there are a great many people who will differ with him in that opinion.  That is why I asked if the Accounts&mdash;the income and expenditure of these schools&mdash; are audited or is there any standard by which they are determined.  I believe from what I can learn that the lay employees of some of these schools are rather badly treated; they have no pensions, as I have said, and they have very long hours&mdash;over 51 hours per week.</P>

      <P>To some people, yes.  They have no sick leave, and I think it would be well if we had some opinion on these matters.  I may say, generally speaking, I think it is an anomaly to have institutions of this kind &mdash;Industrial Schools&mdash;under the Local Government Board, and I would be glad to see them under the Education Department. As for Reformatory Schools, I very much doubt whether they should be there at all.</P>

      <P>As far as Reformatories are concerned, they certainly cannot afford any expenditure beyond what they already have.  They are paid on a capitation basis and as long as they keep open at all their overhead expenses cannot be cut down.  In recent years there have not been the number of committals there had been previously Very considerable numbers of young ruffians who ought to be in them are now Commandant-Generals in what they call the Republican forces or Irregulars. <Col N="2306" /> Consequently when these people are not in the places they ought to be, the Reformatories are in a very bad way financially. The only way in which they can be put in a position to do something for their employees would be by very considerably increased grants in order to enable them to carry over temporarily.  It may be necessary to do something in the way of a special grant.  I daresay a good deal of the same thing applies to the Industrial School.  I know that the Reformatories are being carried on to some extent out of the resources of the ecclesiastical authorities which are concerned with the control of them.  A good deal might be said in the same way with reference to Industrial Schools.  It would probably be well if there were a greater expenditure on them.  This whole matter is under consideration.  I think myself Reformatories if continued&mdash;and it might be well to substitute something in the nature of Borstal Institutions for them&mdash;should go to the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Industrial Schools are very largely agencies for the keeping of children who might otherwise be destitute and who in former days to some extent were kept in the Workhouses.  There is a sort of controversy going on between boarding-out and the conduct of Industrial Schools on enlightened lines.  In some parts of the country, as far as my own experience went, the boarding-out system was exceedingly successful.  In other parts of the country the boarding-out system has been the reverse of successful and it has been thought it would be very much better to use Industrial Schools.  For that purpose the Industrial Schools ought to be separated entirely from the Reformatories if Reformatories are continued, and the whole Association ought to be ended.  That is a thing I think is agreed upon and will be accomplished before long.</P>
      <P>Motion made and question put: &ldquo;That the Dáil in Committee, having considered the Estimates for Reformatory and Industrial Schools in 1922-23 and having passed a Vote on Account of £73,500 for the period to the 6th December, 1922, recommend that the full Estimate of £97,613 for the Financial Year, 1922-23, be adopted in due course by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

They have been engaged in improving jails damaged by some people not interested in good order in this country, and making accommodation for public offices and prisoners in jails, and they have been engaged generally in assisting various other Departments of the Government that require somebody to deliver goods, at very short notice on many occasions, in the best possible condition and at the cheapest price.</P>

      <P>The next Estimate deals with Railways and the amount is £31,860.  This Estimate is for contributions which the British Government made or promised to make many years ago to Railways; in some cases they were to be payments by Local Authorities.  This particular system was inaugurated to encourage the construction <Col N="2311" /> of railways in various parts of the country where it was know the revenue derived from the working of the railways would not be sufficient to meet the working expenditure and the capital expenditure, and it was arranged, when the scheme was originally put into operation, that the Treasury&mdash;that is, the British Treasury&mdash; would come in to the extent of 2 per cent. of the capital cost, paying about one-half, and the Local Authorities had to contribute in order to provide for either the working expenses or the interest on capital.  As regards sub-head (b), during the war the British Government built three small railway lines in Ireland to expand the supply of coal from Irish pits.  Those were lines to Wolfhill, Castlecomer, and Arigna.  The first two connected the collieries with the Great Southern and Western Railway, and the third connected Arigna with the Cavan and Leitrim Railway. These lines were the property of the British Government and they passed to the Provisional Government.  They cost £340,000 to construct.  They have never carried enough coal to pay running expenses. The Government has to pay the loss, and the sums mentioned under sub-head (b) make provision for this. The hopes of the Finance Ministry are that when conditions improve there may be enough coal carried to pay expenses.</P>

The Commission finished its work about a month or six weeks ago, and the recommendations in the two reports have been in the hands of the members of this Dáil since that time.  I would like to know, arising out of this Vote, if the Government have yet taken any steps to determine what their policy will be arising out of the recommendation of that particular Commission, and when, if ever, they will give an opportunity to the Members of this Dáil to discuss the future of the railways.  When that discussion takes place I am sure, especially if the recommendations of the Commission are acted upon, that it will relieve, I hope at any rate it will, the grievances that have been referred to by Deputy Wilson. I would like to ask if the Government has given any consideration to the recommendations of that Commission, and if and when they will bring in a recommendation in regard to their policy.</P>

      <P>The particular railway line that Deputy Wilson mentions came into the European War with somewhat less satisfactory rolling stock and railway line than they had when they came out of the war.  In other words, the control, or, at least, the management of the Dublin Country Council was rather good.  I am told it improved very much.  The loss, however, is pressing very heavily upon the ratepayers of the County of Wicklow.  It is a peculiar sort of arrangement by which the deficit in the working is raised.  Half this falls upon the Co.  Wicklow and half upon Dublin, or rather upon the rate-paying area that is liable for the upkeep of that railway.  I am speaking entirely from memory, but the valuation of the Wicklow area on which the line is a charge is £13,000; and the valuation of the area in Dublin for which the line is a charge <Col N="2313" /> is £50,000, although the sum which has to be made up is equally divided between the two areas.  In other words, the ratepayers in the rate contributing area in Wicklow will pay four times the amount that the ratepayers in the rate contributing area in Dublin will be liable for. That is a case which certainly would require some special consideration.  The railway is an unfortunate one.  The part of the railway in the Co. Wicklow is expensive. It is expensive because of the very irregular level, and the line has many twists and turns which make it very expensive to run.  I understand that it would be possibly line ball if it were only to run from Dublin to Tallaght.  But if the ratepayers of Wicklow repudiate the undertaking given forty years ago by not now paying for the upkeep of that line I do not think that will be fair.  If it presses too heavily upon them there ought to be some means of relieving them, but I do not think it is wise for them to say, &ldquo;we do not accept any liability at all.&rdquo;  I do not think there is anything else I have to say on these Estimates except that this is certainly one that cannot be reduced.</P>

One of them perhaps as much <Col N="2314" /> concerns another estimate which will be put before us later on, namely the Criminal Investigation Department. Some of us are not at all clear to what extent the old duties of the D.M.P. are to be carried out by the D.M.P. under the present regime.  There are, I think, some of the activities that used to be carried out by the old D.M.P. being at present carried out by the C.I.D.  We would like to have, if possible, a definition of the respective spheres of the two forces.  There is another question, and that arises out of a clause in the Treaty and in the 1920 Act.  That question concerns the resignation and the right of the members of the D.M.P. to resign under this clause.  I should like the Ministry to tell us how many applications, if any, have been made by the members of the D.M.P., whether any of these applications have been granted or whether they are likely to be granted?</P>

      <P>The division of functions between the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the Criminal Investigation Department may be roughly defined as that the functions of the Dublin Metropolitan Police are preventive and the functions of the other institution are detective.  The D.M.P. as you know are an absolutely unarmed force, and crime has armed itself to a very considerable extent within recent years.  There is at the moment a good deal of armed crime in the Capital and in the suburbs.  It should be obvious that some institution other than the D.M.P. had to be forged to meet that situation.  For some months the C.I.D. was run as a semi-military institution, but within the past three or four months it has passed to the supervision of the Ministry of Home Affairs. If there is overlapping, it only appears in one division of the D.M.P., and that is what was known as the G. Division. There will have to be a certain amount of re-organization, a certain amount of co-ordination between these various institutions and departments, but I think that few will deny that there is a definite place and scope at the moment at any rate in the City and suburbs for an institution such as that at Oriel House. As to the numbers, I could not give without notice the numbers of members of the D.M.P. who have sent in notices of resignation because of the change of Government.  I have been told that that <Col N="2315" /> was done largely to safeguard their own positions and I think that a great many such notices have been sent in, that will not in fact be carried out, or acted upon.  The police themselves had some doubt as to whether that Force would not be entirely abolished and demobilised. They had the idea that it was a decaying force, because certain promotions had not been made, and because it was below strength and recruiting had not gone on.  Now the explanation of that was that the late British Under-Secretary in Ireland&mdash;I think Mr. Cope was Under-Secretary&mdash;some time towards the end of last year&mdash;I think about October&mdash;realising that a change of Government was imminent and that they were passing out, closed down further recruiting and further promotions in the Police Force.  That was a very proper line for him to take at the time, as representative of a Government that was passing out.  He did not wish to do anything that would prejudice the situation for the first native Administration. The first indication I got that there was any feeling that the D.M.P. would be abolished, or demobilised, came from within that force itself.  I never heard any such rumour or suggestion in Provisional Government circles, and I can state very definitely, so far as my own personal view goes, that there is no such intention, and I think that the police realise that, when normal recruiting and normal promotion starts, a good many will withdraw these notices that they have served of their intention to resign under Article 10 of the Treaty.  I have no very definite grounds for that statement. It is merely an expression of opinion.  On the question of the demobilisation of that force, it is, I believe, a popular force.  It did not share to any considerable extent the odium that the R.I.C. incurred in the particular duties which were assigned to them by the British Government in this country. What I think the citizens would most like, and what they are most inclined to demand, is simply fuller, more efficient, and more alert service from that particular force, but I have not come up against any general demands for its disappearance. I do not know whether there is any different view here amongst the Deputies, but that is my impression.</P>

      <P>When I raised the question of the resignation I understood there were some who are genuinely desirous of changing their jobs, so to speak, and who do not wish to remain any longer in any police force at all, for private, and not for any other reasons. May I take it that the &ldquo;G&rdquo; Division&mdash;the Detective Division&mdash;of the D.M.P. is no longer a detective division, and that its duties are being carried out by the C.I.D.?  I have no intention of arguing against the necessity of an armed detective force in Dublin under the present circumstances.  Quite the contrary. I recognise perfectly clearly that there are many criminal things being done in Dublin which require and can only be dealt with by a force such as the C.I.D. I was, on this Estimate at all events, rather more concerned with the position so that the whole position of the D.M.P. might be made clear to the citizens.  I think the citizens will welcome it if the D.M.P. are to be an efficient civil police force.  The old &ldquo;G&rdquo; Division, I dare say, for a good while past has not been carrying out political activities they used to carry out.  I hope there will not be any such division attached to any police force in Ireland.  I am not quite clear even yet whether all the detectives are trained merely for preventive detection, or whether the detective functions of the D.M.P. are to be carried out by the C.I.D.  There is just another matter in connection with the D.M.P.  I want to refer to briefly&mdash;that is, that the respect which every citizen of Dublin would like to see the D.M.P. worthy of, should not be forfeited by the higher official staff of the D.M.P.  I should like an assurance as to what I may call the higher officialdom of the force&mdash;the old officialdom of which I have complained very seriously here on a certain occasion before in the case of Constable Hogan.  I should like an assurance that the Ministry will see to it that, so far as it is in their power, this higher officialdom will not run amok, as one <Col N="2317" /> of its officers did some time ago, in so far as the working of the ordinary common law is concerned.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will also say whether there is anything in the nature of an Annual Report issued by the Chief Commissioner of the D.M.P. as to the state of the city, and the activities of the police, such as is done by Head Constables in other large cities, and incidentally whether we could be informed as to what the experience of the D.M.P. has been in regard to the activities of the Women Police Force.  There have been comments in police reports in other cities on this question.  Some Head Constables advocated their extension, and some were not favourable to the establishment of women police.  I think it would be well if we could have some information on that point, as to what are the views of the heads of the police force, or the Minister responsible for it, on that question.</P>

      <P>Dealing first with Deputy O'Shannon's question as to whether the &ldquo;G&rdquo; Division exists and functions: at the moment it does exist, and is dealing with ordinary petty crime, that is more or less incidental to the life of any city&mdash;petty larcencies, inspection of pawnbroking establishments and so on.  It is not grappling, or attempting to grapple, with the more serious crime that is prevailing in the city at the moment. As to the possibility of the higher officialdom of that particular force running amok and breaking common law, I do not think there is any grave or imminent danger of anything of that kind occurring. Certainly I have perceived no disposition on the part of the higher officials of that force to do anything of the kind. I do not know whether the Chief Commissioner of the D.M.P. has issued for public perusal any such report as that which Deputy Johnson speaks of.  I get from the police a daily report of occurrences, and so on; and I think if any such thing as a general report for a period were published that it would not be light literature or very cheerful reading for the general public, at the moment at any rate.  The advisability of such a report in the future is a question to consider. I think that yearly or half-yearly reports by the heads of the Metropolitan Police Force would be a good thing, on the whole.  On the question of Women Police, our functions were administrative <Col N="2318" /> up to the present.  It will be for the first Government of the Free State to consider the advisability of new departments, or any far-reaching developments, such as the establishment of an auxiliary or collateral force of women.  That has not existed in this country up to the present, and it will be a matter for consideration as to whether it ought to exist.</P>

      <P>Well, these are not police in the regular sense of the word; they have no power of arrest, for instance.  They are a kind of patrols, semi-official patrols, for the protection of women in the city.  I wonder if Deputy Johnson wants to provoke an expression of opinion from me as to whether there ought not to be women police, because I have not given the question any serious consideration.  I understand in a general way that the predominant feeling in places where that particular experiment was made was against it, but I would undertake to look more deeply into the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My desire is that we should know the view of the Chief Commissioner in the first instance.  I take it formally that the Minister is spokesman here for the Chief Commissioner; but I would urge that he should favourably consider the desirability of such a periodical report as I have hinted at coming from the heads of the Police, because if we are going to consider the police as a function of the society in which we are taking part it is well that the whole society would understand something of the work of that force, and it is a very desirable thing, I submit, that the operations of a police force, not merely its tracking down and prosecution of criminals, but its preventative work, and its work in helping the community, should be emphasised; that as a matter of fact, we should rather come to the conclusion that a police force is a force which is helping the community, rather than being the enemy of the community, or only looking for criminals. The association in the public mind with the police force, through reports of the kind I am speaking of, would be valuable in that respect, and we would then, perhaps, get from the Chief Commissioner his views as to the wisdom or unwisdom <Col N="2319" /> of increasing the number of women police or women patrols, their functions and their powers, and generally understand what we are paying them for, why we are paying them, and whether we get value for the money.</P>

      <P>This is a subject which most members of the Dáil should be, I think, not only familiar with but interested in.  I think there are many things that could be raised on it and I propose to raise one or two, and hope that other Teachtai will raise others.  One of the things I would like to ask the Minister is this: whether he has considered, or whether he is likely to consider, the complete reform of the whole civil prison system in Ireland.  I grant that in the present circumstances it would be very difficult to effect anything like a general reform, but I think there will be complete agreement amongst those Teachtai who have had the fortune, or misfortune, to spend some time in an ordinary civil prison as conducted in the past, not only here but in England, that there should be reform.  The system wants a good deal of overhauling.  It seemed to many of us that one of its defects was that the ordinary person brought in there was rather put into a criminal factory.  I should like to know if the intention of the Ministry is that the prisons are to be merely places of detention or whether they are to be places of punishment.  If I went much further in this I would raise the whole question, which perhaps could better come up on the question of the laws, whether the prisons should be used to deter people from committing crime or for punishing them for committing crimes.  There is another thing <Col N="2320" /> that I hope the Ministry will make clear to us and that is the present position and dispositions of the Military prisons and the civil prisons, whether there are such things as purely Military prisons; whether those prisons are inhabited altogether by what we call general political prisoners or whether these military prisons, if there are such, are also inhabited by purely military prisoners, that is offenders in the ranks of the ordinary regular forces.  I should like to know also whether, in any of the prisons, ordinary civil or ordinary criminal prisoners are kept, political or otherwise, who have not been prosecuted under any of the ordinary laws and are not serving sentences.  One could, if one went into it, raise too, the question of the state of certain prisons.  As has been stated here over and over again, and I think we ought to acknowledge the validity of the argument, the prisons are very much overcrowded, and for that reason the state of the prisons is not as good as it might be.  That, of course, will probably be said by the Minister, but I want to know whether there is any improvement in that condition of affairs. I see it is stated on behalf of the Government that the number of those prisoners is increasing very rapidly.  If that is so, have steps been taken to cope with the rapid increase in the number of prisoners?  And while, I think, on the whole, the Minister very largely answered the other day a number of objections and complaints that were made, I should like to know if, say, in the prison in Dundalk everything is going on swimmingly so far as the ordinary conduct of the prison is concerned, or not? I am informed that in regard to purely civil prisoners the state of things there is not as it ought to be; that the cleanliness of the prison is not all it ought to be.  That may be partly due to the action of the prisoners themselves.  I have no means of knowing, but I want to know if the Ministry, apart altogether from whatever bad things may be happening, or whatever bad state the prisons may be in through the action of the prisoners, if the Ministry is taking steps to see that in the ordinary course the prisons are run properly.  Another thing I want to know is whether the ordinary criminal or civil prisoners or prisoners on remand awaiting trial have still a right to visits from their relatives, or whether they have the privilege, as the <Col N="2321" /> Prison Commissioners put it, of receiving visitors.  I think the term &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; is rather a technical one, but it is the one which used to be hung up on the walls of the cells.  There are other matters arising out of this that I want to express myself upon, and I must express myself with some indignation on them, and that are an astonishment to me.  I may say, before I mention that, that I am very glad to see that the Ministry has had the good sense to release Miss MacSwiney.  I am not arguing for her release, but I am very glad to see that the Government had the good sense to release her.  I think the Ministry showed neither sense nor humanity nor ordinary decency in refusing when Miss Mary MacSwiney was on hunger strike to allow Miss Annie MacSwiney to visit her.  In this matter I do not want the Ministry to come along and give their personal impression of Miss Mary or Miss Annie MacSwiney.  I am not raising the question of personalities at all, but I conceive of numerous cases of prisoners near to the point of death suffering very cruelly in prison, and, owing to the decision of the Ministry in the case of Miss MacSwiney, being refused a visit from their friends.  That, I think, is something that cannot be tolerated in Ireland at all.  On another occasion someone else may raise the same issue in another connection, but I express the indignation of a great number of people throughout the country at that inhumanity, because it was nothing else but inhumanity.  It could not be justified on any ground of policy that the Ministry should refuse the relatives of anyone in danger of death, no matter whether it was Miss MacSwiney or any women or any boy or girl in prison.  They should be allowed the ordinary humanitarian privileges of a visit from their relatives.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Shannon has raised a big question when he speaks of sweeping reforms in the prison system&mdash;a big question and an interesting question, but scarcely a question for a transitional Government.  I think that everyone here would agree that we should aim at improvement and reform in the existing prison system.  There is not a member of this present Government who has not been in jail.  We have had the benefit of personal experience and personal <Col N="2322" /> study of these problems, and although we have never discussed them, I think we would be unanimous in the view that a change and reform would be desirable.  Personally I can conceive nothing more brutalising, and nothing more calculated to make a man rather a dangerous member of society, than the existing system.  But one does not attempt sweeping reforms in a country situated as this country is at the moment. One does not build or try to build in the path of a forest fire.  This question and many other interesting questions will have to be postponed until the situation alters.  If you could cut down the number of jail occupants in this country to something quite small, then it would be possible to start experiments that might lead to better results than simply turning a man out, after eighteen months or two years, a more hardened criminal and a more dangerous man to society than he was when he went in.  I have been promised by the Minister for Defence that in quite a short time&mdash;certainly not running into months&mdash;all civil prisons in the country will be free for civil prisoners.  That is a state of affairs which I certainly will welcome, for I agree that the present condition is bad. It is bad to have too many prisoners crowded into a place such as was the case in Limerick.  Since I gave that particular interview to the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal&rdquo; I think 400 prisoners have been removed from Limerick.  It is hoped to free it for prisoners of the country who are undergoing ordinary civil detention. I have no knowledge that the right of civil prisoners on remand has been limited or restricted; I speak of it as a right rather than as a privilege, because it is a long-established practice.  If it is not allowed in any particular prison, it might be due to the pressure owing to the abnormal situation and owing to the occupation of the prison by the military and by military prisoners.  It might, for instance, be looked upon by the military authority as a danger to have visitors coming into the prison.  The Military Governor might have gone to the Civil Governor in that particular prison and said that the practice was one he would have to stop for the time being as a matter of military necessity.  I think that is probably the explanation if the right of civil prisoners to visits during the remand period is interfered with.  Now, <Col N="2323" /> with regard to the question of Miss MacSwiney. She has been released.  We have no wish or intention to comment upon that matter, or to make any personal remarks about Miss MacSwiney or her sister.  I am dealing with the question that Deputy O'Shannon has raised simply coldly and upon its merits.  Miss MacSwiney was in a state of revolt and in a state of insubordination.  She favoured myself and other members of the Ministry with rather abusive letters demanding, not requesting, that her sister should be admitted to see her to deal with purely business matters.  She did not base that demand on any extreme illness or on any feeling that death was imminent.  She simply said she demanded to see her sister to deal with certain business matters, and on that point she hinted that at a later date she would, of course, require to see her sister again.  I assume that that visit was a visit purely to transact certain business, presumably family business.  Now, military prisoners, even those not in a state of revolt or insubordination, are not allowed these kinds of visits to transact business.  They are not allowed such facilities.  I do not know whether anyone here will put up the view that they ought to be allowed.  At any rate, the fact is that they are not, and this was a case of a prisoner in a state of revolt and insubordination demanding facilities which she would not receive were she not in a state of revolt and insubordination.  This particular demand was not the demand of a dying person to see a relative before death It was strongly and abusively worded and it was a mere bullying demand for this thing as a right.  It was not a right. We cannot take the view that it was the right that her sister should be allowed to go in to transact business when she would not be allowed to go in under normal prison regulations.  I do not want to say anything more on this question. I hope I will not be taken to have referred in a personally offensive way to either of these ladies.  Deputy O'Shannon may feel indignation.  I think that indignation is not well-grounded.  If he will look into the matter as a cold problem for men with tremendous responsibilities he will see that it was not easy or possible to accede to that particular demand that any persons choosing that form of protest are immediately to have <Col N="2324" /> their relatives or friends in to make disposition about family matters for preparation for a death that might be two or three months ahead.</P>

      <P>The point that I raised is not only of particular application in this case, but of general application, and I want it to be made perfectly clear that the point I am raising is a point of general application.  I am not denying the difficulties that the Ministry has, as to the number of prisoners.  I know a certain allowance should be made for those difficulties.  I am not denying the fact, but I disagree with the policy that the ordinary political prisoner in the prison is not allowed a visit for business, or family, or any other reason.  But other cases similar to the one that has arisen may arise, and what I want to object to is what seems to be the policy of the Minister to refuse a relative admission to a prisoner confined in the prison when that prisoner, whether of the prisoner's own volition or otherwise, is in reasonable danger of death.  It is no case to argue that in this case the hunger strike might have lasted for two or three months.  It might have brought death before two or three months or very many weeks, because I do not know that any medical man will claim that the medical profession can say, notwithstanding the extremely long hunger strike of the great Traolac MacSwiney, that death is likely to occur at any particular period, because hunger strikers have died at a much shorter period than he did. Unless I am very much mistaken one who was an ordinary criminal died in a much shorter period in England than Miss Mary MacSwiney has been on strike.  The point I raise is the right. I think it is the duty of any Government to allow a prisoner under sentence and about to be executed or who is likely to die from natural causes, even for business purposes, the visits of some of his friends or relatives, because we can all conceive the case of a breadwinner of a <Col N="2325" /> family who is about to be executed or is about to die from hunger strike, being unable, because he cannot get a visit, to make those ordinary necessary material dispositions of things amongst his family and relatives, and nobody ought to deny to a prisoner to make provision for the future of those dependent upon him, and it is because I believe that this particular example only illustrates a general policy deliberately arrived at&mdash;I think by the Government&mdash;to deny in such cases the right of a prisoner or a relative of a prisoner to come in when there is reasonable cause of death, that I raise this matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise another point&mdash;the sanitary condition, or alleged insanitary condition of Mountjoy Prison.  For a long number of years Dublin Corporation has had the right to appoint Visiting Justices whose duty it was, at regular intervals, to report upon the general conditions prevailing in that prison.  At an early portion of this year a letter was read from the Ministry of Home Affairs at the Dublin Corporation, stating that, in view of the fact that the prison was now a military one, it would not be necessary to appoint such Visiting Justices, and accordingly none was appointed. Recently a number of rather serious allegations, as to the sanitary condition of the prison, have been made, and accordingly the Dublin Corporation requested its Medical Officer of Health to make application to visit that prison and report on its condition.  We were informed that he was told he could not be permitted to enter the prison.  Correspondence followed and the Ministry of Home Affairs persisted in its refusal to allow the Medical Officer of Health to visit the prison.  The Corporation took a very serious view of that matter and, in view of the positive statements that owing to its overcrowding and general conditions an epidemic is likely to break out and possibly spread to the city, they thought that the action of the Ministry of Home Affairs in refusing permission was a very arbitrary and unwise one.  Some years ago, when similar allegations were made regarding Frongoch internment camp, the British Government without admitting that the people here had any such right, allowed the Medical Officer of Health of Dublin to visit that camp and present a report. <Col N="2326" /> We would urge the Minister for Home Affairs to allow the Medical Officer of Health to visit that prison and so be able to reassure the citizens that no such epidemic was likely to break out. Since the statement was made that Mountjoy was a military prison another statement has been made that there are still civilian prisoners there.  If that is so it would seem to the Corporation that they have a right to appoint their Visiting Justices to visit the prisoners accommodated in Mountjoy.  We would be glad to have some information on that point from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I agree in the main with what has been put forward by Deputy O'Shannon and Deputy O'Brien. I had intended to raise the state of affairs in Kilkenny prison to-day, but I will leave it till another occasion.  As regards this question of visits, as most Teachtai know, the British Government, even when they had military prisoners, allowed friends of those whom they had in custody to visit them.  I could even testify to prisoners who were under sentence of death or who were in on the capital charge being allowed three visits per week by the British Government. I think that, in connection with this matter, when we fought so valiantly against the tactics that were used by the British Government, that we ought not to follow in their path.  It is all very well to laugh, but people can see things.  I would say this much, and I hope to deal with matters of this kind on a future occasion, that if you should sentence people to death, the least you could do at any rate&mdash;though I protest against these executions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the same time I would say that you should not have denied people admittance to see their friends who were about being sent into eternity.  I have a statement that was sent to me by the mother of one of those executed boys. I will deal with it at length on another occasion, as the matter may be out of order now.  I would say this, that there ought to be no refusal to allow those prisoners to be visited, and especially where matters of a business nature are concerned.  As a matter of fact, I believe there were special exemptions made <Col N="2327" /> in cases where people wanted to see their friends for business purposes.  If Miss MacSwiney made a demand to see her sister&mdash;even if her sister's death was not imminent, though it looked likely&mdash;she should not have been denied the right to see her.  She was in prison without any charge being preferred against her except the fact that she stood by an oath she had taken.  I will not delay you any further at present, as I will touch on these matters later.  I will only say that so long as prisoners are being kept they should be kept under proper sanitary conditions and facilities should be afforded to them such as we or many of us had been fighting and striving for when we were political prisoners.  If this Dáil does not appoint a Commission to enquire into the state of the prisons, the Irish people will have sufficient intelligence and moral courage to see that there will be a full enquiry into the present system, and especially as regards prisoners of war or political prisoners.</P>

      <P>As regards the request of Deputy William O'Brien, that doctors be allowed to visit the prisons in Dublin, I would ask, if it be granted, that the same right be allowed to the people in the country.  I know a particular gentleman in the town of Moate who went to Athlone last Saturday week to see his son&mdash;a boy of 19 years of age&mdash;who was in hospital.  He would not be allowed to see him.  I also went there and I was refused permission to see the boy.  If the British Government granted the Irish people&mdash;when we were fighting against them&mdash;the right to see their friends in prison, surely this Irish Government cannot do anything less.  If prisoners are sick, or if they want to see their friends on business matters, they should be allowed to do so. Surely to goodness we are Christians, and we must recognise that they are Christians.  We were prisoners and you were prisoners, and you would very much like to have seen friends when you were locked up.  Why now deny the right to others which you yourself demanded?  I appeal to the Ministers to allow these prisoners in the country and in the city to see their friends at least once a week, and to receive letters.  No communications are now allowed, and they are treated just the same as if they were criminals.  If they are political prisoners, let them be treated as such.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I thought perhaps some other member on that bench would be taking up the running, and I do not want to give him more trouble than is necessary. I would like to have heard some analysis of the position that obtains in the prisons is respect of the relations between the military prisoners and the civil prisoners. In this estimate they are both mixed up. We have an item, CC, &ldquo;Pay and allowances for military staff.&rdquo;  Provision is made under this sub-head for the salary of a Governor, a Deputy Governor, and Adjutant of Mountjoy and Portlaoighise, and the detention barracks at Gormanstown and Newbridge, and for the civilian assistance at these institutions.  No details of any kind are given for this sub-head, although under all the other subheadings details are given.  I think some explanations of that is called for.  The total amount required for the military staff of the civil prisons is £9,000.  Now on this civil side we find there are 1,430 prisoners referred to, as compared with 2,000 the previous year.  I assume that this is the number of prisoners estimated to be catered for either right through the year or at an average time.  I do not know how it is worked out, as we do not know what the number of prisoners as between December 1st and April 1st will be.  But at least it is an assumption that there are 570 fewer prisoners in 1922-23 than 1921-22.  That is quite a remarkable fact in the present circumstances. So, are we to assume that the normal number of crimes are being committed, but a considerable portion of the criminals that would normally be stealing or beating their wives, or committing bigamy or other crimes, are being treated as political prisoners or military prisoners?</P>

Whether the Minister, when he says <Col N="2329" />&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; means that they are, for bigamy or wife beating, treated as political prisoners, I do not know; or is it suggested the criminals are &ldquo;here, here&rdquo;?  Coming to this question of overcrowding and insanitation, Deputy O'Brien has referred to the case of Mountjoy, and asked for some explanation why the sanitary officer of the city, who is responsible for the health of the city, is not allowed to follow out his duties and his jurisdiction in the case of Mountjoy.  The Minister has referred to some interview that he has given to the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal.&rdquo;  I have not seen that interview, and I do not know what answer he has made to the very grievous charges that have been submitted to him by the Mayor of Limerick and the Corporation of Limerick with regard to the City of Limerick prison. I am glad to hear from him that there has been a release of 400 from that prison within the last few days.</P>

      <P>Transferred from that prison within the last few days. The very fact that as many as 400 were required to be transferred indicates that there must be very, very serious overcrowding and very grave danger of disease.  We are told that the prisoners in military prisons are responsible to some extent at least for the insanitation. Well on that point I think some explanation is required in regard to the items E and G.  We find that the estimates for clothing, bedding, furniture, etc., are £11,500 for 1922-23 as against £7,500 for 1921-22, an increase of £4,000.  That includes, I take it, renewals, an increased supply of clothing, bedding, furniture, kitchen utensils, crockery, etc., and that is quite understandable.  But when we come to the item of fuel, light, water and cleaning articles, etc., we find there has been actually a decrease in the amount of the Estimate.  Some explanation is required for instance for a decrease of £9,090 for fuel, light and water, where you have so tremendous an increase in the number of prisoners and a decrease of £610 in the cost of soap, scouring and cleaning articles.  Presumably, though it is not certain, a supply of disinfectants will be included in that. But here we are being told that there has been a great increase in the number of prisoners, and yet we are having an <Col N="2330" /> Estimate with a great decrease in the amount required for fuel, light, water and soap, scouring and cleaning articles.  On the face of it, at least, that suggests that the supply has not been ample, and is not sufficient to do the extra work that the very great increase in the numbers would necessitate. I do not know whether we are to assume that the 497 officials accounted for in this Estimate is the normal number required to deal with 1,430 prisoners, or whether there is slackness or whether these prison officials are transferred to deal with the very great increase in the number of prisoners of a military kind. Is this the normal number of officials to deal with prisoners in those prisons?  If it is the normal number, who are dealing with the military prisoners, what is their relation to the Military Governors? What is the relation of the Military Governors mentioned in sub-head (CC.) with the regular Prison Governor?  I should like to know whether the Military Governor is the superior; whether the Civil Governor has to take orders from the Military Governor; whether there is a differentiation of functions as between the military prisoners and the civilian prisoners; whether the prisoner knows, and at what point after his arrest does he know, he is a military prisoner and not a civilian prisoner?  A very large number of innocent men have been arrested, certainly arrested on suspicion.  They are not charged and they do not know what is their offence. They assume, because they are put in amongst the political prisoners, that they are charged with a political offence or that they are detained for fear they may commit a political offence.  But I submit it is necessary for a prisoner to know under what charge he is detained. And that question arises quite naturally from a comparison of the numbers of prisoners mentioned in this Estimate, 1922-23, with previous years.  I hope the Minister will give answers to some of these questions, answers that I hope will be satisfactory.  Whether satisfactory or not, I hope he will deal with them.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether either the prisoners or the officials are as metaphysical as Deputy Johnson.  I do not know, for instance, whether the Military Governor and the <Col N="2331" /> Civil Governor have periodical debates as to which of them is the superior.  I think they are just carrying on and trying to do their best in the circumstances that have arisen.  In the division of functions there is nothing very complicated. There is a civil wing, a wing set apart for civil prisoners in Mountjoy Prison, and I assume that in that wing, and in all that pertains to that wing, the writ of the Civil Governor runs.  With regard to the custody and detention of military prisoners, the Military Governor is supreme; and if the Military Governor thinks that it would in some way make the custody and detention of military prisoners more difficult for him if visitors were allowed freely to enter the prison, then he is allowed to say so.  And in fact everything taking place in this country at the moment is to be regarded in the light of the fact that a state of war or armed rebellion exists.  Military necessity must take precedence.  I did not think that this matter would be raised in an acute form.  I thought people would have learned something by the recent incident in Mountjoy when land mines and revolvers, and so on, were discovered in the possession of the military prisoners.  But it would look as if there are some people that are hard to teach, and slow to learn.  I do not know why the British allowed Sir Charles Cameron to go to Frongoch and inspect the camp.  I take it, it did not arise from any consideration for the health of the citizens of Dublin, or any fear that the germs from Frongoch would play havoc in College Green, or Dawson Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, we have medical officers in Mountjoy in whom we have every confidence, and reports from those medical officers will be at the disposal of any Deputy who is trembling with fear of smallpox, or any other disease, and the prisons are being kept as clean and as sanitary as it is possible to keep them&mdash;in face of the fact that they are occupied by people <Col N="2332" /> who seem to be bending all their energies to see they are neither clean nor sanitary&mdash;occupied by people who ripped the cords out of their mattresses and stuffed them down the lavatories to cause flooding; occupied by people who seem to have lapsed into a degradation and demoralisation which almost makes them have an objection to keeping themselves, or their cells, or their clothes or belongings clean.  I have said that I have been promised within a short time all the Civil Prisons in the country for civil prisoners.  A very energetic attempt is being made to get all the military prisoners into military internment camps, save such as are tried by Military Courts, and sentenced to definite terms of imprisonment.  You will not have, and you cannot expect perfection, absolute machine-like perfection, in a state of affairs such as we are confronted with at the moment.  And it is ridiculous to talk as if we had all the resources at our disposal of an old-established Government; and that the wheels were running in a well oiled efficient way.  That is not the position.  The position is that in its infancy this Irish Government is challenged, and challenged more sternly than ever the English Government was challenged here, and challenged by men who never dared to challenge the English Government here, and would not challenge the English Government if it were here for many centuries or many decades. It is a strange thing and it is an unquestionable fact that there are men in arms to-day against this Government who never took arms against the British and never would take arms against the British.  It is a peculiar psychological problem capable of explanation only on the basis of its being a re-action from great fear&mdash;the drunken mouse out looking for the cat, but not so drunk that it would not find its hole very quickly if the cat came back.  There are no super-men in this Government.  We had a great man and he was murdered.  There are no super-men, but we are doing our best; if the prisoners find the present conditions bad let them try to improve them.  Let them co-operate with the prison officials for their improvement. Let them show any spirit of self help and good will and they will be met.  The men that ripped their mattresses and stuffed the fibre down from the mattresses into the lavatories are deserving of little sympathy here.  And they want <Col N="2333" /> visits!  7,000 military prisoners want visits!  Surely they want to transact their business!  You have the experience of one who was a prisoner with them.  I may say that very little opportunity is given to men to transact their business&mdash;the men they are lying in wait for with their revolvers and with their road-mines.  There would have been great opportunity given to the men travelling to Inchicore that evening to transact business if they had been a few minutes sooner, and there would have been great opportunity for the harmless civilians passing by in the bus.  We have to face this thing with a proper perspective, with a proper sense of proportion, and things that would be serious inconveniences or worthy of attention, or serious abuses in more normal or more settled times, pale into insignificance in view of the situation with which this Government, this Dáil and this country are now confronted.  People who cannot see the forest for the trees, people who come along and say it is a great shame to deny these prisoners an opportunity of transacting their business, show an incapacity for the positions they hold which is striking, and show a lack of appreciation of their real responsibility, which is also striking.  Deputy Lyons exhorted us to remember that these men are Christians. I tried hard and will continue to try hard to remember that these men are Christians.  There are times when it is difficult, but I will try, as Deputy Lyons asks, to remember it.</P>

Those people can transact their business by post and in that respect they have as great an opportunity of transacting their business as any Member of this Government.  We transact our business by post for very good reasons.  I will promise no miracles about these prisoners.  Steps are being taken to try and get them out of the prisons and put into internment camps.  It is to be presumed that in these internment camps their conditions will be somewhat better than they are in the prisons. Solicitude in this Parliament for men who challenge the very basis of Parliamentary government is misplaced; over-solicitude is misplaced.  Parliamentary <Col N="2334" /> government cannot proceed in this country until this thing is beaten, and beaten flat.  I have my own ideas as to the treatment men who hold their doctrines and men who adopt their methods would receive in any other country.  I will not state what they are.  People might strain points and say I was attempting to incite the troops to actions that are not sanctioned here.  I cannot go detail by detail into the points that have been raised, but at any time, if this Dáil makes up its mind that we are not doing our best, or if this Dáil makes up its mind that it can find men to take our responsibilities and do better, then the road is clear.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Vote I wish to focus the attention of the Dáil on the tremendous sum which <Col N="2335" /> is considered necessary to promote agriculture in this country&mdash;one four-hundredth part of the amount of money raised in taxes in Southern Ireland.  This Department is supposed to control, develop, and educate the people engaged in agriculture in Ireland.  Four hundred thousand out of forty millions!  We are an agricultural country, and we are living on the proceeds of agriculture.  It is common knowledge that the system pursued by the Department of Agriculture in the past has ruined the dairying industry in this country, and now the stores which we developed under the aegis of this Department are finding rivals coming from Canada, and on next April every beast raised in Ireland will have to contend with the beast brought over from Canada. Our industry, based on that arrangement, will be ruined, and we have nothing to fall back on but milk.  In this Estimate the sum of £10,000 is put forward for the development of the only section of agriculture we can ever develop in the future, and I say that advisedly. The whole country has been dotted over with beef-rearing sires&mdash;Polled Angus, Scotch Shorthorns&mdash;and our dairy cows, which in a normal country would be yielding milk to the extent of 1,000 gallons per year, are yielding only 360 gallons and are not paying their way. Now, the Minister comes forward with the noble vote of something like £10,000 to revive this industry, which has been lost by mismanagement.  How is he going to establish Milk Testing Associations, how is he going to dot the country with sires calculated to improve the breed, with this money?  He must be a superman, although we are told they are not supermen.  If that is their idea of promoting agriculture in this country, I am afraid that they are very far short of vision and are neglecting the opportunity which this country gives them now of putting agriculture on a proper basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points I want to raise in connection with the subject of Fisheries, which is also under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture, for which an estimate is provided here.  I notice that the grant for the Fishery development is reduced by £3,393 this year.  I regret that very much, for I think this is an industry in which there is <Col N="2336" /> room for great improvement.  Many complaints are being heard from people interested in fishing that the Government is not giving them that aid which might be reasonably expected from them in the development of the fishing industry. I think it would be possible that something could be done in the way of providing better boats and better fishing gear.  Then there is the question of curing stations.  In some parts of the Western and Southern coasts they are not able to get their fish to market when there is a large catch, and the result is that on several occasions the surplus catch has to be dumped into the sea.  Now, it would be well if some arrangement could be made to help on the provision of curing stations.  I do not know whether it would be the duty of this Ministry or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to look after that, but as I see there is a grant here for Fishery Development, I raise that point now.  There is also the question of the provision of markets for fish, but I think that would come more under the Ministry of Industry.  A short time ago I raised here the question of the protection of fishing grounds from illegal trawling, and the Minister for Agriculture was good enough to send me a letter in which he stated the provision he was making, and that will go some distance, no doubt, to prevent illegal trawling on the western coast.  Generally speaking, I think, that one fishery cruiser was never sufficient to meet or to prevent the trespassing of foreign trawlers on the fishing grounds.  I hope that when the opportunity offers the Ministry will see that steps are taken to give the necessary protection, and to do everything that is possible to develop this industry, which, I think, could be made a very profitable and valuable industry for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WalterLeonardCole" hpid="Mr. W. COLE Mr. W. COLE">

      <P>At the present time it is only natural that all the estimates and provisions made in respect of a department such as this should be examined from the point of view of the state of the country.  Probably in regard to administration this Department affects the ordinary life of the people of Ireland more than any other department in the Government.  Undoubtedly, if times were normal, I think, all these proposals would require very much greater consideration by the Dáil than is either reasonable or natural to expect in the <Col N="2337" /> present circumstances.  At the same time, I think it is regrettable that a debate on Estimates of this kind, which cover so many phases of national activity of the ordinary life and industrial work of the people, and which in detail run into anything like 50 to 100 different items and headings, has not been put before the Dáil with some sort of general statement of the views of the Ministry, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, in regard to the way in which he thinks it best that his Department could be worked and administered at the present time.  Deputy O'Connell has referred to the question of the Fishery Development Grant, and I think it would have been very useful for us to know what particularly led to the reduction of that estimate.  I should like to know also, in regard to the salary, wages, and allowances, what prospect there is, if any prospect, of the reduction which is referred to as a possibility in regard, for instance, to the item of Secretary's salary, which is very high, £1,800, and also the salaries of the Assistant Secretaries, £1,200.  It will be noticed that there is an enormous saving in one respect. On page 2 we have a saving shown this year of £86,000; that, of course, includes the reduction of the fisheries grant, and a great deal of saving is also effected by what seems to be the practical abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board, which seems to have gone altogether.  I do not think it is reasonable at the present time that the Minister should be expected to go into very heavy expense in regard to the improvements suggested by the Commission, which was set up by the Dáil a few years ago, in regard to the stock and dairying industry, the horse-breeding industry, and other agricultural industries of the kind.  These are matters which undoubtedly will receive attention when we get to a more peaceful state in the country.  I, for my part, will certainly support the Ministry in refusing at the present time, until we can get the co-operation of all the interests in the country that are concerned, to ask the Dáil to make grants in aid of what would undoubtedly be improvements if they could be carried into effect.  I would like to see them carried into effect, but I do not think that is possible in the present state of the country. For that reason I think the criticism <Col N="2338" /> of Deputy Wilson is hardly fair, considering the circumstances under which the Department has attempted to carry out improvements, and do its work in the existing conditions.</P>

      <P>We recognise the difficulty of the Government in doing anything in face of the state of affairs that obtains in the country at the moment, but we do hope that the country that is going to subsist for a long time on one thing alone, and that is Agriculture, will treat it differently from what it has been treated in the past.  We know that any schemes that have been thought out at the moment, if they have been thought out, by the Government and the Department cannot be put into operation.  We believe in the country that this Department ought to be re-organised altogether from top to bottom, and that its policy should be reconstructed.  Deputy Wilson is perfectly right in what he said, that the feeling of the country is that they do not think that the cattle schemes were carried on in the right lines.  Most men in the country do not think we have improved our stores as beef animals.  We certainly have ruined them as a dairying proposition. You have got to go to the counties of Limerick and Clare, South Tipperary, Waterford, and perhaps part of Cork, for decent dairy cattle.  They are practically speaking, unknown in the other counties.  Deputy O'Connell refers to having to dump fish back into the sea again for want of a market.  Now, my information is that there were plenty of markets, but that the trouble was that they could not get a certain price.</P>

      <P>I remember, not many years ago, that fresh herrings, the most valuable article of food, could be sold at 2d. or 2½d. a dozen forty miles from the coast.  To-day they are 2s. 6d., and you cannot get them at that.  Now, there is a serious question about fish, and that is the destruction of the spawning fish in Ireland.  The fresh water rivers have been depleted of their spawning stocks, salmon have been destroyed wholesale, trout have been destroyed, young fry have been destroyed, and this is one of the greatest national assets this country has ever had.  It gives you a great supply of food, it gives you a considerable amount of money's worth annually running into millions, and this want on destruction has been going on long before this war, and long before any war.  It has been continuously going on, but at the present moment it has arrived at such proportions that there is great danger of the whole stock being exhausted and destroyed. I do not know what the Government can do to stop this.  In some districts it is not as bad as in others; but if the Government can do anything, it is one of the things I desire to draw their attention to.  At the moment we do not want to criticise the policy of the Government in regard to agriculture.  If the times were normal, we would criticise them more severely, perhaps, unless they conformed with our views, but at the moment I do not like to use destructive criticism.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the item of £8,000 for a fishery cruiser.  Is it denied that the Helga has been taken off that very important work, and no other boat put in her place? Deputy Gorey has referred to the destruction of spawning beds.  Those beds were mostly destroyed by foreign trawlers, and if the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; is taken off they will take advantage of that.  As regards the question of looking for exorbitant prices for fish, I may point out that fish was landed within 8 miles of <Col N="2340" /> Dublin, and that no price whatever could be got for it.  The fishermen were out two nights and brought their catch in.  They did not throw them into the sea, but gave them to anyone who would take them, anyone who knew how to cure them.  It is the want of the knowledge as to curing of fish&mdash;that is what is wrong in this country.  A case happened, not very far from a certain Deputy's own place, where fish were brought home, and the way they were cured was to cook them together.  That was the knowledge.</P>

I asked some time ago about the reorganisation, and I think there is very little use in spending money on any Department until it is properly organised, and as one who has very little belief in the working of the Department of Agriculture, as done in the past, I hope that there will be no additional money spent on it until it is properly organised and capable of getting some practical results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not know as much about fisheries as a number of the Deputies who have spoken about them, but this I know, that it has been the policy in Ireland for a good number of years to discourage curing, and if you want fisheries to progress in Ireland you must encourage the curers to work. They will go in for the profit themselves, just the same as any other men.  In recent years since the war the fishing industry has been very poor, not only in Ireland, but in England and Scotland, and that has been due to the state of the exchanges.  Germany and Middle Europe is really the market for herrings, and on account of the exchanges they cannot very well buy as much as they were able to buy formerly.  I think in 1913, from Scotland alone four million barrels of cured herrings were sent to Middle Europe, and that is practically 250,000 tons.  Of course, a great deal could be done, and the Ministry of Agriculture, I am sure, will do it, to encourage the fishing industry, but you need to have fishermen grow up in the country.  Fishermen, as a class, have been dying away; they have been going to other countries, and they have been <Col N="2341" /> giving all their attention to the land when they get larger farms than they had originally, and, as a result, the fishing population has become less and less all the time.  I would like to know really the amount of money the fishery development gets. Now I would like to tell my friends of the farming party something because they are always lecturing the Dáil about farming, and it is this, that they should advise the Minister for Agriculture not to allow any bull to serve in this country without licence, and that is the way to improve their stores.</P>

      <P>I notice that the item for the improvement of the breed of horses in this country is cut down from the figure of £7,500 odd, at which it stood last year, to the figure of £2,000 this year.  That is a very drastic reduction, which in the case of this important industry, I cannot understand. Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture may have an explanation to offer, but I cannot see at present, for the life of me, why such a drastic reduction as that should take place in connection with this branch of the farming industry.  I know there are many classes of horses that are completely off the market at present, but the class of horses we want is a class of horse that should be subsidised by the Department of Agriculture, because that class of horse, namely, the hunter, is bringing in as good prices to-day as ever.  If we could produce hunters to-day as we did in Ireland in the past we would get excellent prices for them.  But it is not by a reduction of nearly £5000 on this Vote that we will be able to procure sires fit to produce hunters at all.  It was for that purpose that the grant was really given, but generally the bulk of it went to produce a different class, such as Clydesdales and heavy cart horses more than to produce hunters.  The Minister may have his explanation, but I do not know how he can defend such a drastic curtailment of that grant as has occurred in this Estimate.  There are many of my friends in our small party with whose views I do not agree at all as regards the breed of cattle in this country.  I hold that the Cattle Scheme of the Department was the only scheme that did any good for the country. The stores produced in Ireland to-day are as good as those produced in <Col N="2342" /> any part of the world, and I think that was mainly because of the introduction of sires which the Department sent through the country.  I take my own Country of Wexford, and I defy anybody to tell me any county that produces better store cattle and that was mainly due to the introduction of the sires by the Department.  They may have made mistakes in some instances in some sires.  It is all very well for some parts of the country to pay particular attention to dairy produce but there are other classes of people to be looked after, and the producers of stores and fat cattle are just as large and as important as the producers of milk.  I do not see that there is any future for a man breeding stores, seeing that all the grants for cattle are now going for dairying purposes.  I believe that should not be.  The Department should be as much interested in those districts where they produce good beef and store cattle as they are in those which go in for milk production. I notice that the cost of administration in this Estimate, £407,949, amounts to a great deal&mdash;nearly one-third of the whole&mdash;so that a very great proportion of this money which should go to help agriculture is spent in salaries here and in the country.</P>

      <P>Just one point, I did not say that the Department of Agriculture were wrong in helping to produce store cattle.  What I said was that they had put all their eggs in one basket. Stores in Ireland are now up against Canadian cattle, and that is likely to continue, and we have to go back to the dairy cow which the Department destroyed.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry to see that the Estimate for Fishery Development is down by £3,393, because I look upon the fishery industry as one of our most important and most valuable industries. In common with all other Deputies and everybody else, I fully appreciate the very difficult position that the Government finds itself in; but I suggest, with all respect to the Government, that something should be done to reinforce the protection of our sea fisheries. I understand that the Helga in the old days and several other vessels used to do duty round the coast.  Now, I understand, we have practically the same number <Col N="2343" /> of boats to keep watch over our fisheries, but whether they are doing so is another matter.  Of course, once these fisheries are interfered with by foreigners coming within the three-mile limit, untold damage is done to the fishery beds, and it would take years and years to get them back again to a normal state of fructification.  I hope the Government will look to that.  As regards the inland fisheries the same is true, and I understand, owing to the times there has been a terrible lot of damage done to these fisheries.  I earnestly exhort the Government to take whatever steps it can in assisting the guardians of the rivers and the fishery conservators, and to give them all the assistance possible in order to protect the inland fisheries.  Though we have an enormous seaboard, the people of Ireland are not a fish-eating people; but if the fish from our sea fisheries could be landed at our people's doors inland, and in the minimum amount of time, I am quite satisfied it would be an enormous source of wealth to our country, and would give much-needed employment.  Now, about the throwing of fish back again into the sea, I have seen it done myself in the city of Waterford.  Anyone who knows anything about sea-fishing knows that at certain times of the year you have shoals of herrings coming into the various harbours. That occurred in Waterford Harbour, and they came right up to the city, and it might be said that in a city with 30,000 inhabitants there should be no necessity to throw the fish back into the sea.  It was not done to raise the price of the fish.  It was done because there was nothing else to do.  Another thing we want for our fish, apart from smoked fish, is a means of preserving them both in the case of the sea and inland fisheries, and for that purpose we want to manufacture plenty of ice in Ireland. As far as ice is concerned I think we are practically derelict.  When we get a proper means of manufacturing ice at a cheap rate we can get fish served to our people inland with celerity and safety and at a low price.  Of course, we all appreciate the abnormal times we are living in.  But the point I would like to make, and it is one of enormous importance at the present time as regards sea fisheries, would be to put, if possible, additional cruisers to watch our sea <Col N="2344" /> fisheries and to rigorously banish any foreigners who fish within the three-mile limit or fish over prohibited areas where the spawning grounds are situated.</P>

      <P>One comment I am constrained to make.  A certain element has appeared in a great number of these Estimates although these were discussed before and are being discussed again to-day.  Retrenchment is a desirable thing and necessary, especially in the present state of the country, but there is retrenchment and retrenchment.  Retrenchment for the sake of cutting down expenditure without regard to a deliberate and definite policy is always a dangerous thing, however desirable it may look at the first flush.  I have been studying this Estimate for some indication of a policy outlined in it in order to discover, when we find that £3,500 have been deducted from Fishery development showing that amount of saving for the Nation, whether it is a saving or not.  I believe it is not a saving and that the money should have been used to a considerable advantage, and that it would have been much more profitable to the country than will be found as a result of its having been saved.  And so throughout there is a tendency natural enough, but which ought to be resisted, that Estimates coming before this Dáil must show a saving in many cases without regard to any definite policy that has been adopted.  Deputy Wilson has indicated one matter and several Deputies have drawn attention to it in the Fisheries Estimate.  The point I indicated is one of great importance. The curtailment of expenditure we make is of such a nature that when we come later on to the actual development of policy we may find production will be so impaired that we will have a great deal of leeway to catch up before we can begin to think of definite schemes for the future.  I mention that in the hope that we may very soon get to the stage when agriculture and fisheries will all have formulated on their behalf some well-considered scheme of policy so that moneys when cut down will be cut down in the right place.  There is another small matter to which I would like to draw your attention, and it is the <Col N="2345" /> amount for telegrams.  I notice the item of telegrams has appeared over and over again as though it was expenditure actually incurred.  I had assumed&mdash;I stand corrected if it is not so&mdash;I had assumed that telegrams incurred on behalf of the Government were not paid for as if they were required in the form of money to be found, unless it be telegrams across the water, but this sum of telegrams appears over and over again and requires, I think, some explanation.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points I should like to ask the Minister about.  Other Deputies have gone a considerable length usefully and necessarily into the Fisheries Estimate. Now the Ministries have some correspondence with reference to the tobacco growers in Meath.  They wanted relief in the way of reduction of taxation, but the Government were unable to grant that.  I would like to know what exactly is the position with regard to experiments in the cultivation of tobacco, particularly as there has been a reduction in the Estimate here of £500. The other matter is in connection with the collection of Agricultural Statistics. How exactly are the statistics collected now or has the Ministry considered the method of collection of statistics?  In the abnormal circumstances of the times comprehensive statistics will be difficult to obtain, but under the older regime there were engaged certain men for the collection of statistics, the R.I.C., and anyone who has seen the R.I.C. at their work knows the whole thing was very largely a sham, because the man on the job generally went a mile or two on the road, had a chat, and very often came home and made his collection of statistics up in the barracks.  I would like to know what is the present method and if the Ministry has considered a future method.  Now, as one Deputy, I should be glad to see much more given for the agricultural development of the country, and I hope when the Agricultural Commission reports we shall be able to say that agriculture will be put in a much better way than it is at present.  But I think there might be allowable reductions, not in the Estimates necessary for the development of agriculture, but in certain other administrative directions. I notice here the Secretary&mdash;I presume that is the Secretary of the old <Col N="2346" /> Department of Agriculture&mdash;and that his salary is to be reconsidered on a vacancy.  I was reading over a list of salaries, wages and allowances under A. I notice a number of what seemed to me to be redundant positions in the Ministry, and I should like to ask the Minister if he thinks it necessary that all the officials are still required and will be required under the circumstances.  I do not doubt at all that if the Ministry and the whole agricultural scheme in Ireland were functioning as we should all like it to function, perhaps many more officials would be required, but I should like if they are required that there would be no superfluous people, not that I want to sack anybody at all, but just the same it seems to me rather anomalous that out of a vote of £407,000 odd that so much as £181,000 odd should go to salaries and allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to differ from my colleague in his last remark. I can imagine a much larger proportion being well spent in salaries and allowances rather than grants.  I am not sure that grants is the best way to do the work of this Agricultural Department. I want to raise two or three question, and I shall begin by asking a question on this item of live stock. Deputy Doyle drew attention to the reduction in H. 3.&mdash;&ldquo;Improvement of Horse-breeding Grant,&rdquo; a reduction of £5,955.  Presumably the Minister will give some explanation of that, at the close of the discussion, instead of doing it, as I think he ought to have done, at the opening of the discussion.  Perhaps we also shall have an explanation of H. 8.&mdash;&ldquo;National Stud, £5.&rdquo;  Nothing is under that item last year, and I am just wondering whether there had been a decision on the part of the Minister to put £5 on a particular horse which lost, or whether some squandering of that kind has found its way into these Estimates as a precedent.  Being a horse-loving country, and encouraging, as the Minister for Finance is doing, sweepstakes, I wonder is this the beginning of an embarkation on a policy of national betting. It might be enlightening to us to know whether this is a precedent for something of that kind.  It is a curious item to appear in the Estimates:&mdash;&ldquo;£5 for 1922 and 1923,&rdquo; and no explanation.  I am very glad indeed to see that while <Col N="2347" /> there are a good many items of decreases there is an actual increase in agricultural education and research, an increase of £7,000.  I would hope that the Minister will explain, and give us some enlightenment on what direction these increases have taken.  I believe it is the right line; that it is through research and education that very much good will be done, and it is, I hope, an indication of the policy that the Minister intends to pursue, to devote a good deal of attention to that particular work of the Department. I do not know whether I am in order in raising the question of the Forestry Stations on this Vote.  It is under the Department of Agriculture, but I am not sure that there is any particular item in this Vote which would allow me to raise that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say in that respect I will not try the patience of the Dáil.  I am informed that there is in the Forestry Stations at Avondale and Ballyhaise a good deal of work to be done in the way of thinning and cleaning the plantations put down 16 or 17 years ago, and to which practically nothing has been done since.  I complained some weeks ago on behalf of Mr. Everett that there had been some dismissals from the Agricultural Stations, but it is apparent from this information that there is a good deal of work to be done, and I would urge wherever it is possible to employ labour during this period on Forestry work through the Agricultural Department, that it should be done.  I want to draw attention to a matter, a little bit apart, but quite in order, on this Vote.  It is the attitude of the Minister towards the question of Canadian Stores; that is the importation into Britain of Canadian stores.  No doubt, this is a matter which excites a tremendous amount of interest in Ireland, and is of great moment to the cattle breeders and agriculturists generally of this country.  But judging by the letter which the Minister for Agriculture sent to a meeting of the Cattle Traders, there is in his mind a sort of regret that it is not possible to bring pressure on the British Ministry of the kind that used to be brought to bear upon the British Ministry.  It seems to me that in reading this letter which he sent to <Col N="2348" /> the Minister for Agriculture in England, he is assuming a right to complain of what they do in England in regard to Irish cattle.  I want to urge that that is not a dignified position for the Irish Agricultural Minister to take, in these days.  We have by our own invitation cut ourselves off from the right to make demands upon the British Ministry of Agriculture.  I am afraid the tone of this communication suggests that there is a regret in the Minister's mind that he has not still the power to bring pressure of a Parliamentary kind upon the British Ministry.  He states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The six days detention for Irish cattle is, however, an entirely different matter, and I have been careful to stress the point that there can be no reason why a change of policy as regards Canada should affect the relations between Great Britain and Ireland in a matter of such vital consequence to this country.  It is but right and fair that the experiment of receiving cattle from the Overseas Dominions should be carried out under conditions erring, if at all, on the side of stringency, but every consideration of justice and expediency demands that Ireland, which is the natural and least precarious source of British supplies, and a depression of whose agricultural industry must react harmfully on British agriculture, should be considered in the future as she has been in the past as occupying in regard to the cattle trade an entirely different position from that of any of the Overseas Dominions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite a number of Clauses of this kind in this letter which seems to me to suggest that we have a right to interfere with the policy of England in regard to the admission of Canadian stores.  We admit that it is right to retain a policy of diplomatic representation, but it is not right and it is going to put Ministers in a very undignified position and open the way to the retort, &ldquo;You have chosen your way, we have chosen ours.  We are going our way, you must go yours and have no regrets.&rdquo;  There is a suggestion, I think, in this communication that you are asking the British Ministry of Agriculture to join with the Irish Ministry of Agriculture in a sort of attack upon the Canadian Ministry of Agriculture&mdash;to league Ireland and Britain <Col N="2349" /> against Canada.  I submit that is a very undesirable state of mind for the Minister to adopt in this stage of our history.  We have decided, for good or ill, to let Britain govern herself without the aid of Irish members of Parliament, and if they can be persuaded that it is a bad thing to put restraints upon the import of Irish cattle&mdash;well, all right; but please do not urge it as something that is desirable in the interests of Ireland, and therefore England ought to do it.  I think it is necessary to draw attention to that, and to submit that we have to leave Britain to her own fiscal policy and to her own policy in regard to her own cattle and imports of overseas cattle, and we must make the best of the position we have made for ourselves. I just say in regard to the habit that has developed in agricultural Ireland and in industrial Ireland and in official Ireland, to denounce at all times the Department of Agriculture, as one who has followed its working a good deal in the last 15 or 18 years, I am not at all convinced that there is justice in that general denunciation.  I believe that it has, in the main, done its work well; and I think that, while in many cases the policy adopted has been inadvisable, it has been done with the assent and consent of the agriculturists, and has proved itself beneficial to the country as a whole. I think there are many departments of its working which can be improved, and which ought to be improved, and will be improved.  There will be changes of policy, but I dissent from the common habit of denouncing the Department of Agriculture high-up and low-down.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite <Col N="2350" /> clear, first, that this Estimate is not the Estimate of a reorganised Department, and it does not presume to be an Estimate for anything new&mdash;any new development&mdash;in Irish agriculture.  The Department, like every other Department, was taken over from the British Government on the 1st March, and since then it has just carried on.  That is the truth.  It is easy to make political capital about that, but that is the fact, and that is, I submit, the only possible procedure in the circumstances.  We have considerably more to do at present, as is freely admitted from every side of the Dail, than mere administrative work.  Between the 1st March and 6th December we had to take over Ireland from England and then we had to make a division between North and South, and into the bargain we have to run a war, and in all these circumstances it is perfectly sound policy, during the transition period, to carry on and lay your foundations before you start to build. Therefore, as I say, there is nothing new in that Estimate, and in the circumstances I make no apology whatever for that and I do not think it would be expected.  Now, I agree with a number of things that have been said, though the speakers on a good many occasions based their remarks on facts which were slightly inaccurate.  There seems to be an impression that the total estimate for the Department of Agriculture is only £407,949.  That, of course, is only this particular estimate.  In addition, if Deputy Doyle will just look at it, there are £62,499 Appropriations in Aid marked M.  In addition, there are £184,738 for Science and Art, and in addition £114,300 Endowment Fund, so the real estimate of sums already passed is nearer £800,000 than £400,000, and that explains a good many difficulties, that Deputies have found for themselves in other items also.  Now, first of all, it has been commented upon that only £11,900 appears on the estimates for the improvement of Dairy Cattle.  Of course, that is not so.  That is just one grant, one item, and if you will look through the estimates you will see there are moneys provided under other heads for that purpose.  For instance, that takes no account of the staff that would be engaged in that sort of work and a number of other items.  With regard to the £5 mentioned by Mr. Johnson. <Col N="2351" /> that is really&mdash;I think the financiers call it&mdash;a token item.  The National Stud referred to there is the Tully Stud, which is not yet legally transferred and which is being run at present under the direction of Colonel Greer, and which we have not taken any account of, or made up the accounts of as yet. £5, I understand, is the thing the Treasury simply put in as a token item. I am not going to put it on any of the good horses raised in that particular stud, and that are being raced this year. Now, I entirely agree that the Department of Agriculture needs re-organisation; and in the circumstances I think it is more useful to consider future policy and future intentions than merely to spend the time going into those items which are items that have appeared in the Estimates of the Department time out of mind.  I have spoken before here, and I still believe that the Department of Agriculture should confine itself to agriculture.  I think there will need to be some division between the educational functions of the Department of Agriculture and what I call its proper functions. I agree that fisheries and fishing in this country is almost as important as Agriculture, and that the treatment which it has got up to this lumped in with agriculture, has been totally insufficient and totally inadequate.  I want to point out that the items which the Deputies refer to here under the headings (K. 1) and (K. 2) do not represent the total amount that has been spent on Fisheries this year.  I have just taken out the actual figures, and they are these:&mdash;There is £10,720 under (K. 1) and (K. 2).  Elsewhere in the Vote there is £10,875, and from the Endowment Fund there is £10,755, so that the total roughly is something like £33,000.  As I am on this particular item, perhaps I might explain this reduction of £3,393.  If you will turn to (K. 1), that is, to the details on page 10, you will see the item, &ldquo;Knockadoon Pier,&rdquo; and you will see that there was £2,333 spent on it.  That was an <i>ad hoc</i> grant made last year, and it is not required this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but I am not dealing with it at the moment.  That explains the £2,333 of this item of £3,393.  To do anything real with the <Col N="2352" /> fishing industry in Ireland, which is even more depressed at the present moment than agriculture, very large sums of money will have to be spent.  They will have to be spent on technical education very largely; on curing stations, marketing, and all these matters that were raised.  I have always thought that fishing and fisheries would be more properly attached to a Ministry like Industry and Commerce than to Agriculture, as it is in every go-ahead country.  With regard to the points raised by Deputy Johnson and his reference to the question of Canadian stores, I entirely agree that it would be an undignified attitude for a Minister for Agriculture of the Irish Free State, whoever he may be, or for the Provisional Government, for the matter of that, to urge anything on England purely putting forward officially the view that it was in the interests of Ireland and that therefore it should be granted.  I agree that we have taken another road and that we must walk that road.  We cannot have it both ways.  I entirely agree with that, and I hope that I have always been very careful to keep that point of view very well to the fore in any dealings I may have had with Ministries on the other side.  I am not complaining about it.  We have got what we wanted and we took it without any complaints or without any regrets.  I have none. These letters to which Deputy Johnson has referred are letters mostly from technical men in one Department to technical men in another Department on a very important subject.  Business is business and they had a perfect right to point out that Ireland was the main supplier of beef for England and the obvious and natural market for the English buyer in the future, and that it was in England's interest to see that special concessions were given to that market.  That is, I think, what any business man would do who is pressing a business proposition.  I hold I have gone no farther than that.  Deputy O'Shannon raised the question of this grant for tobacco growing, and also this question of statistics, and he asked some assurances.  I have had some correspondence in this regard last Spring, when the Department was asked to provide more money for this special purpose, to pay a bonus to tobacco growers, <Col N="2353" /> especially in Meath in connection with Sir Nugent Everard's experiments, and the experiments of Lord Dunraven.  We have given this matter much consideration and there is no doubt whatever that the two men named, Sir Nugent Everard and Lord Dunraven, have spent a lot of money and have made remarkable efforts to introduce tobacco growing as a commercial proposition into this country. And there is no doubt that a public spirit of that sort should be helped.  All I can say is that we have considered it from that point of view, and from every other point of view, and taking all the circumstances, and taking all the other interests that the Department of Agriculture must look after, we could not afford to give any more money this year than the item that appears on the Estimates. With regard to statistics, I know pretty well how statistics were collected in the past.  I agree with Deputy O'Shannon that the police constable went out and met the nearest neighbour on the roadside or in his house and he collected the statistics for the parish.  At present statistics are not being collected in some places.  They are being collected from Department's officials in other places, and we intend to make some arrangement with the Northern Government in connection with the collection of statistics in their area.  It has been found exceedingly difficult to collect statistics this year. It does not require any explanation.  It is obvious on the face of it that it should be so.  This is the normal Estimate, and if the money is not spent it will remain in the Treasury.  There is only one other point, I think, and that is in connection with Canadian stores.  This year, as every farmer knows, Canadian stores have been allowed into England, and that is the particular threat that is being held over the industry for a great many years. Irish agriculture was built on unstaple foundations in so far as it was built on the goodwill of England in keeping out Canadian stores.  They are in now, and experts differ as to what the effect will be.  But, whatever the effect is&mdash;and, personally, I do not think the effect is going to be so terrible as some people think&mdash;there is this to be said, that doubtful item and that particular threat hanging over the head of the Irish farmer for so many years, has at last <Col N="2354" /> fallen.  If I may say so, we will find that we have simply called a bluff, that it will make very little difference, and that we will be able to build our future agricultural policy on a firmer and sounder foundation.  I agree with Deputy Doyle, that dairying must be developed much more extensively in the future than it has been in the past.  If we do feel the effect of the entry of Canadian stores into England, if it does affect the store trade, in one way it may be met by the development of dairying.  As I have stated, I believe it is necessary to reorganise the Department of Agriculture and to reorganise it in the direction of confining it to its own business.  I believe, further, that you can do more for agriculture in Ireland in the future by spending money on agricultural education than you can do by any other two or three methods which might be suggested.  I believe the future of agriculture in Ireland is the future of agricultural education.  I believe that is the direction to develop and spend the money on, and I agree that an Executive department is not the proper department to look after technical education or agricultural education.  I hope to see some institution dealing with scientific, industrial, and agricultural research in the country, and, though it is very important to spend money on education in the primary schools, it is even more important to spend money on the University side of Education&mdash;on research. That is all I care to say at present. The Minister for Agriculture of the Free State will have the re-organisation of the Department and the question of future policy to consider; but, for myself, I think I am quite clear that those are the main lines to develop.</P>

      <P>The Minister has declared with very admirable lucidity what would be his policy with regard to a re-organised Department.  Because I saw the heading &ldquo;Department of Agriculture,&rdquo; I was optimistic enough to think that a beginning had already been made on re-organisation.  Knowing the progressive and reformative instincts and capacities of the Minister in charge, I am very, very much encouraged by what he has said, and I should like to enquire does he speak merely for himself or does he express the considered policy of the entire Cabinet?  Of course, I pay no attention whatever to the deprecatory remarks he made, in which he forecasted another Minister&mdash;a Minister other than himself&mdash;in the Free State Government.  Considering that the Free State Government is already within sight&mdash;it is only a few weeks away&mdash;and that there is no indication whatsoever, so far as one can discern signs of the times, of an alteration of Government, I think it would be really very valuable for us if we were to know on the constructive side of its work if those who are to administer the Free State share the enlightened views which the Minister has just given expression to.</P>

      <P>I desire to take the opportunity of this Vote to ask the Minister for Defence to give to the Dáil his explanation of the execution of Erskine Childers.  Erskine Childers was a man whom I deeply revered, and therefore I have considerable difficulty in speaking calmly and dispassionately upon this matter.  He was one of the noblest men I have ever known, and for that reason, because I feel the matter as I do, I realise that it is incumbent upon me to be scrupulously fair in stating the facts which I wish to state in impugning the action that has been taken in executing Erskine Childers.  I have a deep sense of responsibility in raising this matter, and I consider I am raising it in the highest interests of the State. Every Party in this Dáil has shown very considerable forbearance and tolerance towards the present Government, has refrained from criticising the present Government except upon vital matters, and has passed over in silence many things that might have been criticised at other times, because this Dail, and every Party in it, recognise and feel deeply that the task of Ministers is a difficult and terrible one, and that, therefore, it is only when they go wrong upon vital matters <Col N="2357" /> that they ought to be attacked.  Silence is not possible when an Irish Government executes Erskine Childers for possessing a pistol in a dwelling-house without the authority of the Provisional Government, which is his political opponent.  Erskine Childers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Provisional Government is either the head of this State or it is not, and as the head of the State only it acts in this and in every other case, and I must ask, Sir, that in this case the Deputy withdraws that statement.  It is not a correct statement of the fact, and the Deputy knows it.</P>

      <P>Erskine Childers was a great Irishman, and I emphasise that because he was an Irishman, not merely in law, but also in fact, and because it has been so unscrupulously denied up and down the country, unscrupulously, or ignorantly, if you like. He was an Irishman in fact, because he was born of an Irish mother, and brought up in this country, and consecrated his life in later years to the independence of Ireland.  He was an Irishman in law under the very Constitution which this Dáil has passed, because one of his parents was Irish and born in Ireland, and because he was domiciled in this country.  So let us have no more of this cant about Erskine Childers being an Englishman, as if that were an excuse. If he were an Englishman, the case would be even worse.  Erskine Childers was a distinguished soldier and a distinguished <Col N="2358" /> citizen, a man who knew no fear; a man of perfect sincerity; a man of brilliant intellect; and, withal, a man of extraordinary modesty.  The public knows how, at a greater sacrifice than most of those whom he joined, he threw himself into the movement during the struggle with England, and placed his services at the disposal of the National Government to be used in the field or the council as that Government might think best.  The story of his work for that Government has been told, but I do not think it is generally known that his services were so well appreciated, that at the most difficult period of our struggle in America he was actually selected by the Cabinet to be Ambassador in Washington.  I do not think the public knows the magnificent work, the monumental work that that man did during the Peace Conference in London. That can never be appreciated until all the documents are published, and then Ireland will be astounded at the volume of the work, at the zeal of the worker, and at the extraordinary thoroughness with which he placed himself at the service of the Plenipotentiaries.  But I have no desire here to eulogise him.  That much was due to him to say.  I have no desire to make a eulogy of him here, because the charge which I ask the Minister for Defence to meet would be the same in substance were Erskine Childers a far lesser man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I say this and I emphasise this&mdash;that of all the cases that could have come before the military courts, there was no case in which it was more vitally necessary that the most scrupulous precaution should be taken against doing an injustice, because there is no man in Ireland against whom a more unscrupulous and a viler propaganda, or a more persistent propaganda, has been done during these past months. Many of our people, aye, and many of our soldiers, sincerely believed, as a result of the propaganda, that Erskine Childers was a monster of wickedness, that he was an agent provocateur of the English Government and no fate was too bad for him.  That was sincerely believed up and down the country. Surely, surely in those circumstances the men in authority, even if they did not fully appreciate him, knew well how he had been the victim of such slanders; surely it was their paramount duty to <Col N="2359" /> take quite exceptional precautions to see that in no way should they be influenced against him, that they should not be influenced against him in the smallest degree, except by what was definitely proved in evidence against him before the Court.</P>
    <P>Now, what happened?  The military authorities apparently ascertained that Erskine Childers was living at the home of his childhood in Wicklow; they surrounded the house in the early morning; they found him there and arrested him, as I understand, getting out of bed with a revolver.  They charged him for that he had a revolver without their authority; they sentenced him for that; and they executed him for that; for having a pistol in that private dwelling-house without the authority of the Provisional Government.  That and that alone is his capital offence.  I suppose there was something else against him. I do not suppose that the Minister for Defence will tell us that Erskine Childers was executed merely because he had that revolver without the permission of the Provisional Government.  I suppose there was something else.  Let me pause at that something else.</P>
    <P>Remember that this trial was attended with accompanying circumstances which make it much more difficult than it would have been in any case to justify what has been done.  Remember that you had, first of all, the trial in camera, so secret that all the public were allowed to know on the first day of the trial was contained in this brief announcement from the Press Association: &ldquo;The trial of Mr. Erskine Childers was opened before a Military Court at Portobello; the nature of the charge is not disclosed.  Mr. Childers is defended by Counsel.  The proceedings were private.&rdquo; Even the name of his Counsel must not be given and the crime with which he is charged must not be made known to the public.  That is the kind of thing which is the acme of folly for any Government&mdash;this extraordinary secrecy, this unnecessary secrecy, which seems to pervade the dealings of the authorities with these strange tribunals.  Not only that, remember that Erskine Childers was a prisoner in the hands of the Government, and remember that it is International Law that you do not take the life of a prisoner in your hands unless <Col N="2360" /> you prove him guilty, prove him guilty before a war tribunal, of a war crime, of such a crime as is understood in every country to be punishable by death.  There are many such war crimes.  Not only that, Erskine Childers, who cared nothing about his own life but wanted to save the lives of others, applied for a Habeas Corpus.  He has been derided because he applied to the Master of the Rolls. He applied to the only Court which this Government had left him since they had illegally suppressed our own Courts, and then, when the matter came before the Master of the Rolls, ah!  it was a humiliating thing for the Government to be compelled to rely upon the fact that there is a war; not that they put that up in terms themselves but that the Master of the Rolls decided that he could not go into the merits of the application specifically on the grounds that there is a war.  It was a humiliating thing for the Government to be brought to that, when the case all along is that this is not a war, because if it is a war it is clear that you must treat your prisoners as prisoners of war. Is not that ordinary logic?  These are various minor circumstances.  They would be major circumstances in any other case; they are minor circumstances in a case like this where the fundamental thing that is wrong is that this man is executed on that charge when he had that pistol in what was virtually his own home.</P>
    <P>I have put down notice for to-morrow based on the execution of the first four men, and I do not wish now to traverse the ground dealt with by that motion.  I wish only to refer to it in so far as it is revelant to the present matter. You had a debate here the other day on these first executions.  I was not present, but I have been reading, and reading with amazement, the official report of that debate.  Those men were tried simply and solely for unlawful possession of revolvers.  The Minister for Defence realised that something more than that was necessary to justify the executions before this Dáil, and this is what he said: &ldquo;The men who were executed this morning in Dublin were found on the streets of Dublin at night carrying loaded revolvers and waiting to take the lives of other men, and that is the simple case we have to put before the country for taking action in accordance <Col N="2361" /> with the recommendations that were made here.  It was because these men were found under such circumstances with such intent that it was necessary to execute them here this morning.&rdquo; I wonder if the Dáil realised at the time the grave admission that was. They were charged with the mere possession of a revolver.  They were executed because of the intent to kill other men.  Yes, but they were never charged with intent.  This is not a mere lawyer's point.  Any man of ordinary experience knows that the difference is enormous between the evidence upon which you can convict a man for mere possession and the evidence necessary to convict him of intent.  The difference is enormous.  If a man, in fact, has a revolver and has no permit, the Court is obliged to find him guilty, no matter what the extenuating circumstance is, if the charge is one of unlawful possession. Yes; but if the charge includes intent, the circumstances which would ensure conviction for possession are very far from ensuring conviction for intent.  You are not dealing with a jury which could be swayed by fear or sentiment; you are dealing with your own military officers; and if there are circumstances in a case of this kind which will warrant these officers, in circumstances proved before the Court, in finding the intent alleged, is it not the plain duty of the military authorities to charge the men with intent to murder, to charge men with possession with intent, and not with mere possession.  And if there are no circumstances upon which your own officers will find intent, then you have no business to charge a man with possession and execute him for that.</P>
    <P>I mention this in connection with the case of Erskine Childers.  It is even worse.  He is not found at night in a city, armed.  He is found in a private dwellinghouse, and because he has that revolver&mdash;that pistol&mdash;in his home, in what, for the time being, really is his home, the house of relatives, he is put to death for that.  I refuse to believe that this Dáil pliant as it is to the wishes of the Government in many respects would ever have consented to the passing of the resolution as it was passed, had it realised that such a thing as this would be done by virtue of its action.  I do not believe that a single member of this Dáil realised what he was committing himself <Col N="2362" /> to, and I reflect bitterly that things like this could not have happened if the amendments I urged upon the Minister of Defence had been accepted.  Then you would try and punish, and if necessary execute, people who committed crimes against the Law of Nations, but you would not have done a thing like this. The Minister for Defence is the Minister upon whom this Dáil and the country felt, in view of his great record, that they could count to see that these drastic powers would not be abused, and that is why I specifically appeal for his explanation.  He has to face a strange dilemma if he seeks the verdict of history and the verdict of this country.  Remember that at the very moment that Erskine Childers was being sentenced by a military committee to death, the Recorder of Dublin in this city was sentencing men on a like charge to terms of imprisonment.  Strange justice!  This is the dilemma which I put to the Minister for Defence:&mdash;Either Erskine Childers was executed upon a charge which does not sustain in the public conscience the capital punishment, or else he was tried on that charge but other matters were allowed to influence those who confirmed his execution.  I cannot for a moment suppose that the Minister for Defence will tell us that the first alternative is the case, and that Erskine Childers was executed merely because he had a revolver. But if he tells us that that was not so, then he will be telling us that the authorities have done something contrary to natural justice as understood in every part of the world, because if you had other things against Erskine Childers, Erskine Childers was entitled to be faced with those things, and given an opportunity of answering them.</P>

      <P>I understood, after discussing the Estimates in Committee, that an opportunity would not be afforded to a man, who was afraid of his shadow, of making a speech such as that to which we have just listened.  I certainly feel very much ashamed that any representative in this Dáil should give expression to such a speech as has been made by the Deputy who has just sat down.  We are charged with very serious duties on these occasions, and very serious responsibilities, and we do not care much about empty posturing as to what history is going to say.  What we are concerned about is saving this country from weak-kneed people like <Col N="2363" /> the Deputy who has just sat down&mdash; saving them from that lack of moral courage which has almost submerged the country and in regard to which we are going to do our duty in our time and in our day.  No one Deputy here in this Dáil fears the result of the stern action that we have got to take.  No one man here fears the dagger or the bullet of these irregular gunmen.  We know what we have got to meet; we know the work of these people from the first day they menaced the liberties of this country.  We are dealing with a situation in which only men can take part.  We knew from the very commencement of this struggle that a scheme of assassination was in the minds of the people opposed to us, and that day after day their Press reeked with incentives to their unfortunate dupes to commit that assassination. They have not succeeded so far.  Our Nationals not duped by them stand proof against them, and this gentleman stands up here to tell those people in terms &ldquo;I am not guilty as others are. I take no responsibility for these things.&rdquo; I have never heard in my life the name of Mr. Erskine Childers mentioned during any meeting I was at as a representative of Dáil Eireann at Washington. I may be wrong, but I never heard that.</P>

      <P>I never heard it. We have been told about the law of Nations.  There is a higher law than the law of Nations, and that is the Law of God, and that is the law we are endeavouring to enforce and to carry out in this country.  There is also a higher law, in the opinion of people, than the law of Nations and that is that these regulations made by Nations shall not prevent a Nation which is in the birth pangs at the present moment, from coming to life.  The speech delivered by Deputy Gavan Duffy is, in my view, simply an effort to tear away and to expose to the public everything that transpires at these Military Courts.  It is not for the purpose of giving pain to those people that those Courts are secret.  It is for the purpose of preventing pain.  It is to relieve the public mind of the shock which results from having these things published. It is with a view to letting people see that there is a determination behind the <Col N="2364" /> attitude of every man with a spark of nationality in him to realise his responsibility at the present moment.  The Government have no defence to make in this case, because there is no necessity for defence.  We could publish every scintilla of evidence given at these Courts to satisfy the morbid curiosity of Deputies like the Deputy who has just spoken, but it is not desirable to do it it is not in the public interest to do it. We are as good judges of the public interest as the Deputy.  We were in public life before him, and if God spares us we will be in public life after him. And if there is any constituency in this country in which he would like to challenge me on that I will take him up. Deputy Gavan Duffy was not here when the execution of the four poor citizens of this city was discussed.  It was not worth his while.  He had to wait for an intellectual to be executed.  This is a democratic country and the people responsible for bringing these unfortunate dupes to their doom must take the responsibility for their action.</P>

      <P>It was published that four executions had taken place. The Deputy did not know the people executed.  I did not know where they were from, but I find now that they were from my own parish.  A few days ago I got a letter from a lady, and she had five sons.  One was killed in the Black and Tan war, three were in the National Army and one is in the Irregulars, &ldquo;and I ask you to see,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;before this boy is brought to trial that those responsible for putting him in that position are brought to trial and convicted.&rdquo; Is that a fair statement?  Are we to let off the intellectual&mdash;those people who have money at their back and who have the opportunity of defending themselves&mdash;are they to get everything, and is there to be another law for the unfortunate dupes of these very people?  Every one on these benches regrets, as much as the Deputy who has just spoken, these executions, but they are for the purpose of saving life.  We brought in these resolutions knowing perfectly well what the result would be, <Col N="2365" /> and what the reversionary result would be, which is that no one here would be likely to be safe for a considerable time until the country came to its senses.  I am as satisfied as I am standing here that some temporary madness has taken possession of every one of those Irregulars who have taken the lives of our soldiers, and that what is at the back of their position is the lack of courage of men like Deputy Gavan Duffy. They know they can terrorise and persuade people that there is a case for not treating them as they should be treated. It was a serious responsibility when the Four Courts were attacked after the pact of peace was made, but we attacked it for the preservation of order and to ensure that what a man possessed he could not be dispossessed of and that our officers, when they walked the streets without company, should not be kidnapped. At this moment a gang is at work to intimidate members of this Dáil, and hold up the Treaty that two of the greatest Irishmen that ever lived gave their lives to secure to the country.  And are we to lose all that in order that some intellectual friend of Deputy Gavan Duffy may not get the same law and treatment as some poor man's son who had not the same opportunity of judging what he was doing?  What is the effect of the executions that have taken place already?  I regret them; nobody more so.  I regret them as much as Deputy Gavan Duffy. Already valuable stolen property is being restored; people are tumbling in to pay their debts and Land Commission annuities, and so on, and a regular steadying effect has taken place throughout the country.  What do we want?  We want simply order restored to this country. We want all arms under the control of the people who elected us, and who can throw us out to-morrow if they so desire. We want that the people of this country only shall have the right to say who are to be armed and who are not; and we are going to get the arms, if we have to search every house in the country.  And they are coming in, and the bed of the Liffey has accommodated quite a number of them, and it would not accommodate them if we did not show this strong hand. The Deputy has mentioned the case of some people who have come before the Recorder.  These people should not have been brought before the Recorder, unless they were brought before him by mistake. <Col N="2366" /> People who rob with arms are going to be brought before the Military Courts and found guilty.  Persons robbing at the point of the gun will be executed without discrimination.  This is going to be a fair law, fairly administered, and administered in the best interests of the country for the preservation of the fabric of the society.  We have been through all this business.  No one of us ever trod the carpets in a Continental hotel while there was a very serious war on here at home.  Our homes were visited, and we did not get much peace. We realise the benefits that will accrue to the country from this Treaty.  We know what it means to the country.  We realise its importance.  It is not complete, but its incompleteness is not our fault.  Men who are lurking at the present moment and sending out their messages of death for us and other citizens in this country who do not agree with them gave expression to certain terms of agreement with our Northern fellow-countrymen, and we are going to honour them, whether they like it or not, even if that is one of the complaints that they make about this Treaty. Others of them take up other lines of action and point to imperfections.  We are satisfied.  Greater men than we brought it about, and we are going to carry it out.  In the last few days documents have been captured in which this new organisation called the Cabinet of the Republic was set up, but there are more people in that Cabinet not elected representatives of the people than there are elected representatives of the people. What is to prevent one thousand decent working men at the North Wall, if they do not get employment, coming together and saying that we will set up a Republic of our own?  Not Deputy Gavan Duffy's, not mine, but their own.  Would they not have as good a right as Deputy Gavan Duffy has?  They were never rejected by the country, whereas those posturing as Republicans have brought in non-elected representatives to govern this country, this democracy.  We are going to see that the rule of democracy will be maintained no matter what the cost, and no matter who the intellectuals that may fall by reason of the assertion of that right.</P>

      <P>Since there does not seem to be any disposition on the part of other members to speak, I wish to <Col N="2367" /> associate myself to the full with the remarks that have been made by Deputy Gavan Duffy, and I do so from a sense of duty and not from a sense of moral cowardice, a plea that has been too often advanced here when an argument wants to be made other than by directly repudiating it.  As one who had an intimate acquaintance with the late Mr. Childers, I, at any rate, though I hold Republican views, and I differed in some respects from the views he held, still I hold there was no man in Ireland, nor a man in this Dáil, who held opinions as conscientious as he did, and there was no man in the late Dáil so much imbued with love of country and the intention to free her from any foreign influence as he was.  It has been too often said here in this country that people stoop to certain remarks when they want to try to bring down a person.  It has often been said here, and said elsewhere that Erskine Childers was an Englishman.  There were times when Irishmen looked to the lead of England, and there were Englishmen who, when their brother Englishmen were doing wrong in this country, thought it was their duty to stand by a country that was oppressed.  That was proved in the late war with the Black and Tans.  Erskine Childers was by no means an Englishman. He was born of Irish parents&mdash;or, at least, one of his parents was Irish. He was reared up in his cousin's home in Co. Wicklow, and he was domiciled in Ireland.  And under the terms of your Treaty Constitution, which I voted against, and of which, I believe, no note was taken, you allowed Mr. Childers to be domiciled as an Irishman&mdash;or domiciled as three-quarters Irish.  I believe in the future the work of Erskine Childers&mdash;no matter how much he may be cried down at present&mdash;will be a valuable asset.  It has often happened that the best of men have been cried down, and that their work was only recognised afterwards.  I am sorely afraid that in the trial of Erskine Childers too many matters weighed with those who tried him other than the fact of his possessing an automatic pistol.  I was here on Friday week last, and, owing to my being interrupted in the course of my speech, it was not possible for me to deal with this matter, but I believed at the time, and I do believe now, that the execution of those four other men was meant to pave the way for the execution of <Col N="2368" /> Erskine Childers.  The very fact that in England you had Winston Churchill, and men of his calibre crying down this renegade Englishman, as they sought to call him, should have set us thinking that there was a screw loose somewhere, because when the English people&mdash;and the English Government especially&mdash;begin to praise us, it is high time to examine our consciences.  I believe that there was an appeal lodged in the case of Mr. Childers, and that he was executed in the meantime, and that his wife was refused admission to see him. She was not informed of his sentence; and, furthermore, when he made application to see two revered and well-known Catholic ecclesiastics in Dublin&mdash;Rev. Dr. Browne and Father Albert, it was refused.  I do not know whether it was the intention of the late Mr. Childers to become a convert to the Catholic Church or not; but I know one thing, at any rate, which has been used a good deal through the country&mdash;the fact that when the man was on his deathbed practically, a priest was refused admission to him. It may be argued that these revered ecclesiastics were merely to be brought in for certain purposes of propaganda. but, at any rate, when a man was nearing his last hour his request should have been acceded to.  So much has been said against Erskine Childers at the present time that one would like to ask how much was said against him at the time of the Howth gun-running, and how much was said when he was at the beck and call of the trusted leaders of the country for the last few years, during the regime of the fight with the Black and Tans, when he was consulted on many and most important matters.  A particular matter discussed here to-day was agriculture. One of the greatest losses sustained by this country has been sustained by the execution of Erskine Childers, as I believe that a certain programme he had mapped out would have led to a satisfactory solution of that problem.  The power to execute was given to the military by a majority of the Members, the Labour Party and some other Members voting against it.  I understood that the sentences would at least be laid on the table of the Dáil for a few days prior to any attempt being made to carry them out, as at that time and now, no matter what would be said, civil war prevails in the country.  A pact was entered into, <Col N="2369" /> and that pact was broken, and I believe myself that the ill-advised attack on the Four Courts was responsible for all the trouble.  I do not believe that those who advocated it at the time sufficiently realised what would follow.  There is no doubt at all about that.  If you wanted to have that attack, there was nothing to prevent you waiting until Parliament assembled for two days.  That attack was taken against the wishes of the Members of this Dáil, who were not even consulted.  As a matter of fact, we were treated with contempt, and perhaps we may be treated with more contempt if we do not have the moral courage to speak out, that we agree or that we do not agree.  I believe, if there was an attempt, as was alleged, by the Republican Party to obstruct the Dáil, and I do not see how they could very well do it, as they entered into a Pact with the Treaty Party, and were in duty bound to come into the Parliament and each and every one of us went in&mdash;the Farmers' Group, the Independent Group and the Labour Group.  I say, if Parliament had assembled that that attack on the Four Courts would have been got over.  I believe that many things would have been got over by negotiation, and at any rate it would have been decided whether the Four Courts would have been attacked to put them out or not, as they had been in it some months.  I believe, and I have heard it on pretty reliable authority, that it was the intention of the Republican Party to come into this Dáil.</P>

      <P>I merely mention that in order to show to those who state that it was the policy of the Republican Party to prevent the Dáil from meeting, that that is denied.  There is proof for it at any rate.  This Dáil should have been consulted and have met, so that the views of every member would be taken, and if anything was initiated as a result the blame would be put on the proper shoulders, and men afterwards cannot say that they shirked their responsibility or otherwise.  Some time ago when a motion was brought in to relieve unemployment it was stated, I think by the Minister for Local Government, that there was no law until the Treaty was ratified and the King's signature affixed to it, and until then that it would not be possible to enact any law for the country.  I wonder how the law should be enacted for the execution of people?  If a Civil War prevails, and we must not close our eyes to the fact that it is one, many of the prisoners to-day that are being looked upon as criminals should be treated as prisoners of war, and there is no use of talking of Army Estimates or anything else if things are to be pursued as they are at present.  There is one fact anyhow staring us in the face.  It has been alleged that there are many men now who were not fighting against the British Empire.  It must be recognised that you have them on both sides, and, of course, more or less you may find that at the present time, judging by some of the things that are going on through the country.  Quite recently, we saw in the town of Carlow, two defenceless girls fired at through a window because they refused to put out the lights at 12 o'clock.  Then you have the cases of a few old people in which an attempt was made to throw a bomb, and where a door and windows were riddled with bullets.  The Whelans of Staplestown, I allude to.  I will have questions put down in connection with that.  Along with that you have a man, because he was supposed to express a certain opinion, brought out, bludgeoned and sought to be thrown into the river. Quite recently there was a certain house in Carlow in which four people reside&mdash; a husband, a mother, two daughters, and I think one or two little boys&mdash;and because they were known to have certain views, and because it was put out <Col N="2371" /> that the barrack was attacked, although that is without confirmation, that house was fired into.  Some of the parties who took part in all this are known.  Reports in some cases have been submitted, and in one particular case a report about Donnelly has been submitted, but nothing further has come of it.  There is no use making complaints. The whole cry at the present time, I can see, is to carry on a policy of vindictiveness, and if that policy is pursued, it will not carry you here nor there.  There is one thing, anyhow, let us hope there will be no more executions, and if drastic action has to be taken let it be placed on the people of this Dáil.  Deputy Gavan Duffy has a motion down to-morrow, when we can deal more fully with this matter. I would like to say in conclusion that if you think by executing people and executing them on some of the mild charges brought forward in comparison with the charges which we brought forward when dealing with the British Government; if you think by executing people you will deter them, you will never kill the Republican spirit in Ireland by executions, and nobody knows that better than yourselves.  I am glad to say in conclusion that Miss MacSwiney has been released.  I intended to deal with that matter, but I am spared the pain, but I believe she is in an exhausted state of health.  Certainly if the deaths of the two sisters of one of the noblest men that ever lived in Ireland had to be placed upon your shoulders, there is one thing future generations, at any rate, would curse the day that ever the people in this country sought to govern Ireland for England.</P>

    <P>In speaking on these Estimates I do not wish to continue the discussion that has taken place particularly on the case of Erskine Childers.  To me, and I think to most people, it is not the person high or low, distinguished or undistinguished, able or simply ordinary that is in question at all.  It is a far greater and a far bigger principle that is in question.  I am not <Col N="2372" /> at all afraid or ashamed to pay my tribute to Erskine Childers.  I disagreed utterly and completely and absolutely with him, and his whole policy and his whole tactics and everything else concerned with him since December last.  But that is no reason to me at all why a tribute should not be paid to his services in the past. As Deputy Gavan Duffy has said, his services, his very valuable services, did not begin merely with the truce or merely with 1918 but went away back to 1911 or 1912 to the erection of the Irish Free State through the Treaty of December. But those things apart, the execution of Erskine Childers in the circumstances is to me just the same as the execution and the circumstances of the four younger, less experienced men, those youths who were executed earlier; and the cases of the men who may be executed for all any of us know to-morrow morning or the morning after that or next week or next month.  When the resolution was originally brought before the Dáil I was opposed to it.  I am not now going to allow the President or anybody else to say that merely because I opposed that thing, that I want to wash my hands out of it.  I am prepared to carry any responsibility that lawfully lies on me in the State.  I am quite prepared.  I opposed it on other grounds, and amongst other grounds was this, that whilst not a lawyer I did not believe that the powers that were given to the Military were lawful or were legal, or that they would be exercised in many cases by the Military with that nice sense of judgment which the great powers conferred demanded.  I hold to that still. It was admitted then that there was no such thing as law for these proceedings at all.  It is universally true that the only justification for them was the necessity of the case, the necessity of the preservation of the State.  That was the only justification for any of these executions. I want the Minister for Defence and I want the President to tell me is it necessity that in their view justifies the keeping back from the masters in this country, the general body of the people, the relatives and everybody else concerned&mdash; keeping back from them that certain prisoners under these regulations have been tried, condemned to be executed and are about to be executed?  I have already spoken in an earlier discussion on what to me was the inhumanity of refusing a certain visitor admission to a <Col N="2373" /> certain prisoner in a certain state.  Now the whole manner and circumstances of these executions, so far as my observation up and down the country has gone, have aroused much more indignation and are looked upon with greater detestation than the action of the Government in imprisoning and allowing Miss Mary McSwiney to hunger strike.  Not merely was it because of the natural shock to the people, and I refer to not only the people who are either opponents or citizens of the Free State, but many who are opponents of the Free State and who are not citizens of the Free State and who may not be citizens of the Free State for a considerable length of time, but it was because these things should be done in circumstances of such damnable secrecy.  If the Minister for Defence can convince me that there is absolute necessity for all these things I am willing to reconsider my position. But I can see no necessity for it at all, and it is a monstrous, inhuman thing that when a man is about to be executed that neither his relatives nor the general body of the people are to know that he is to be executed.  But after an hour or two or six or eight hours after the execution the Military authorities will turn round and send a letter or something like that to the nearest relation of the executed person saying that duly at 6 or 7 o'clock or whatever the time was that that person was executed.  There is only one parallel for inhumanity of that kind and that was the inhumanity of the British Command in the European War when a printed postcard was sent notifying the execution of certain soldiers in France and on other fronts.  Nothing in my experience has been more inhumane than this.  Now, as I said before, I am not going to justify the actions of those who are in arms against the Provisional Government.  I do not think on any ordinary grounds of reason that they can be justified.  I do not justify them and I condemn, as much as I deplore, ambushing, assassination or anything like that.  But that is no reason why the Provisional Government or its Ministry of Defence should go out of their way to outrage the whole moral feeling not only of the people but to outrage morality itself, because it is nothing else but outraging morality.  The circumstances here, if a bit extraordinary, are not so much worse than the circumstances in other countries at other times.  I doubt if in the civilised, or for that <Col N="2374" /> matter, in the uncivilised parts of the world you will find anything like a general practice made of executing in the circumstances and particularly in the manner in which these executions are carried out. Deputy Gavan Duffy has raised a point of the utmost importance.  Were these men executed for the possession of these revolvers or not?  I want the Minister for Defence in his reply to say whether they were or not.  Were they executed for the possession of revolvers in accordance with the regulations to that effect? If they were will he explain to us or tell us whether there have been other trials under these courts on this particular charge and whether in those cases the same sentence has been passed and has been carried out or is going to be carried out.  If that is not so will he explain the principle of discrimination?  I also want him to answer&mdash;to give a straight and truthful answer&mdash;whether it was really the record of these men in arms against the Provisional Government that was the cause of the confirmation or the passing of the sentences on them.  On the whole question of executions the point seems to me to be: were these men executed in order to deter other people from having possession of revolvers or was it in order to deter people from attacking the National Forces, or was it in punishment for having revolvers?  If you single out these particular regulations and these particular people, whether they are high people or low people, whether they were dupes or whether they were the dupers, those things are immaterial.  The main thing is, were they or were they not executed on this regulation, and could a <i>prima facie</i> case have been made out against them on much more serious charges&mdash;on charges which, in the ordinary common opinion, apart altogether from the legal opinion, would have justified the passing of sentence on them.  I regret because we are in Committee that I am not able to develop the argument that I would like to develop.</P>
