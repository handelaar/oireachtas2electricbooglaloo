      <P>Claims made by the Motor and Cycling Trade in respect of the pre-truce period may be made to the Compensation Commission in so far as the facts fall within the terms of reference of that body.  As regards cases outside those terms of reference but within the jurisdiction of the War Compensation Court, the Government are endeavouring to have sittings of that Court arranged to be held in this country.  They are still in communication with the British Government on this point.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to the Statistics published in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; of October 27th, 1922, concerning the amount of Irish Bank Notes in circulation and the gold held against those notes, showing that the average amount of gold held for the four weeks ending the 2nd September, was about £10,589,000; whether the notes issued by the Irish Banks, in circulation for the same period, amounted to £17,358,000; whether his attention has also been drawn to the footnote in the same Statistics showing that the amount stated as representing gold held by the Banks against the notes in circulation, <Col N="292" /> does not, in fact, represent gold held by the Banks, but includes Currency notes deposited at the Bank of England, which notes are treated as coin held by the Irish Banks at their Head Offices; and will the Minister state what is the true amount of gold held by the Irish Banks against their notes in circulation, and, further, if he can state what amount of gold is actually held by the Bank of England against the total amount of Bank of England Notes and currency notes in circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acquainted with the statistics referred to, the substance of which is stated correctly in the question.  In interpreting the statistics it should be borne in mind that the currency of this country at the present time is the British currency, the unit of which &mdash;namely, a pound sterling&mdash;is like the unit of currency in most countries of the world at present, below its nominal gold value.  I am not in a position to say what is the amount of actual gold held by Irish banks against their notes in circulation.  The Bank of England, according to its latest statement, holds gold coin and bullion amounting to £125,619,160 against its note issue of £144,069,160.  The latest currency notes return shows that gold coin and bullion amounting to £27,000,000 is held in the currency note redemption account, and the same account also holds £21,150,000 in Bank of England notes, which, as indicated by the figures I have just given, are covered to the extent of over 87 per cent. by gold.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether he will state the intentions of the Government regarding compensation to persons in Westmeath, Longford, and Roscommon who suffered serious injury to property and person from direct enemy action during the late Anglo-Irish war; whether it is true that those who lodged claims in the enemy courts at the time have received compensation under the Shaw Award, and that those who did not recognise these courts have received no compensation; and, further, will the Minister see that such claimants are compensated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the claims for damage done to property before <Col N="293" /> the Truce, the position is that where decrees were obtained after a defence had been made by the County Council concerned, steps for payment are at present being taken.  Where no decrees were obtained, or where decrees were obtained but the County Council of the area where the damage occurred did not make a defence, the claims are subject to adjudication by the Compensation Commission. There is no foundation for the suggestion made in the question that there is a discrimination against persons who refused to recognise the courts of the late Government. In the case of injury to the person, the Government of Saorstát Eireann are responsible for the provision of due compensation to supporters of the National side who suffered injury, and proposals to give full effect to this arrangement are being considered.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the Tipperary Urban Council started a housing scheme over six months ago, and that the contract for same was given to a local builder, but the operations were held up owing, as alleged, to the difficulty of getting the Local Government Board to send an arbitrator to value the land on which it <Col N="294" /> is proposed to build the houses; if such is the case, will the Minister undertake to have the matter seen to at once?</P>

      <P>On the 28th September last, the Ministry approved of house designs and the acceptance of a tender for 11 houses.  The owner of the requisite site granted early entry and the clerk reported so long ago as the 14th of August last that it had been paled in.  It had previously been arranged that the price to be paid for the land should be agreed upon between the parties, or, failing agreement, should be settled by an agreed arbitrator.  The Ministry has not been made aware of any difficulty in the matter, which is clearly one for the Council and the owner.</P>
      <P>The Ministry has done everything possible to assist the Council in pushing on with their housing scheme.  Application for loan and other information asked for months ago has not yet been received.</P>

This money was given as a grant, and no addition in respect of it was made to the purchase moneys of the allottees of the lands.  Of this amount the sum of £576 has already been expended.</P>
      <P>I have been in communication with the Commissioners since the beginning of the month in regard to continuing work on hands with a view to giving the maximum amount of employment.  The Commissioners are acting on this principle in this case as in every other case in which they are dealing.  The balance of the money will accordingly be expended.</P>

      <P>Allowances are payable to mothers who were partially dependent on unmarried sons when those sons enlisted. <Col N="296" /> In such cases the amount of the allowances are at the rate of 7/-, 14/-, 21/-, and (in the case of officers) 28/- a week.  The rate in any particular case is based on the financial loss sustained by the mother owing to her son's joining the Army and on the assumption that her son contributes at least one-third of his total Army pay to the support of herself and her family.  These particulars will be published in orders for the information of the Army in the near future.</P>

      <P>It just occurs to me, though there may be nothing in it whatever, but in view of the discussion that is going on now as to whether the Six-County Area is included in the United Kingdom for the purpose of certain Statutes, it is just possible that a Statute coming under the category of &ldquo;British Statute,&rdquo; may be passed using the words &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; and referable to the Six Counties, would also be brought into operation in Saorstát Eireann by this.</P>

      <P>I am loath to raise difficulties unnecessarily, but I would like to have my mind satisfied as to whether or not the proposed new Clause comes within the scope of the amended title, because this, I submit, is not a Clause whose function is to interpret or to adapt to the circumstances of the Saorstát certain Acts of the British Parliament.  It certainly is not an interpretation or an adaptation of statutory rules, orders and regulations, and though it might be some legal quibble perhaps be brought under the heading of contract, yet it does not seem to belong to any of the contracts that are specifically mentioned in the body of the Bill.  It seems to me that it could be more properly described as a clause to legalise, and give legal authority to, acts of certain Magistrates appointed by the Provisional Government.  Surely we might pass a short Act for that purpose by itself.  It is really coming to the rescue, if I may use an unhappily chosen term, of the Provisional Government, lest any question might be raised as to the legitimacy or the legality of what they have done <Col N="307" /> as regards the appointments of these Magistrates, or what the Magistrates themselves in turn may have done purporting to act under this authority.  I would suggest that we do not include it in the scope of the present measure, and that we leave it over to be a Bill in itself.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Professor Magennis's suggestion, because I think this proposal ought not to come in in this particular Bill.  If this thing is necessary it ought to be done by a short Act by itself.  Now, yesterday, what I think is considered a fairly reprehensible practice in most legislatures was, I think, done, that is to say, a certain thing was done by tacking it on to the Appropriation Bill.  It seems to me you are trying to do the same thing by this adaptation&mdash;tacking on another thing and giving this other matter statutory force by putting it in where I do not think it ought to be. I think these things ought to be kept separate and distinct and done in proper order.  I think everybody in the Dáil is anxious to facilitate the Government in getting this Adaptation Act through, but I do think there would be a good deal of discussion perhaps if this other thing were brought in as a separate Act.  At this stage I think it is altogether out of place.  There was no mention of it in the previous stages, not even in Committee. To bring it in now in the fourth stage is not, I think, fair at all to the Dáil, and I would protest against the practice, as it is now becoming a practice, since yesterday, to tack on to one Bill what should properly be a separate Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join in the appeal of Deputy Magennis and Deputy Cathal O'Shannon in asking the Government not to press this particular amendment?  I think the Government will acquit me of any desire to raise factious opposition to any of their proposals, and I do think it is most desirable that Stipendiary Magistrates or Magistrates of any kind should function throughout the country at the earliest possible moment. I do not think there is any member of this Dáil who would throw any obstacles in their way, but I do submit that an Adaptation of Enactments Act is not the proper place to put in what really amounts to an Act of Indemnity against <Col N="308" /> these ten or fifteen gentlemen for the jurisdiction that they have been exercising for the period since they have been appointed.  Look at the very terms of the amendment: &ldquo;Any judgment or decision given or made, sentence or penalty imposed, or other act, matter or thing done before the passing of this Act since the 28th October&rdquo;&mdash;nearly two months ago&mdash;&ldquo;in purported exercise of any jurisdiction shall be deemed to be lawful and valid to the extent to which the same would have been lawful and valid if such persons had been lawfully appointed under the British Statutes.&rdquo;  I do submit with profound respect to the wishes of the Government, and also with a sincere desire to see that legislation here is conducted in all proper form, that they ought not to sandwich this provision into a general statute for enactment.  If they like to bring this Indemnity in as a Single Clause Bill or anything like that I could almost undertake to guarantee for the people whose party I do not belong to, but whose action in this Dáil I have watched almost every hour since we first sat&mdash;I can almost undertake for almost everybody here that that Bill would go through practically without opposition. But it ought not to go through in the place the Government have inserted it&mdash;in the report stage of a Bill that was presented in print to us yesterday afternoon and that went through all its stages, except its final stage, in the space of about one hour.  I do appeal to the Government to withdraw this Clause in the form in which it is.  As it stood originally, subject to some small alterations, it was not objectionable because the original draft provided that the powers of Justices of the Peace and Resident Magistrates should be exercised in future by Stipendiary Magistrates.  All we want is a definition of Stipendiary Magistrates.  District Justices have all the powers Resident Magistrates and Justices of the Peace had before.  This is an entire innovation, because it is a specific indemnity to name people for acts they have done.</P>

      <P>This amendment appears to have been introduced to meet an objection raised by me yesterday afternoon.  Through the courtesy of the Legal Adviser of the Government I have seen the amendment, and so far as I can form an opinion it meets the objections that have been raised to the section in its original form.  I fancy if passed now it will not be open to the Party opposite, whenever they should happen to sit in the seats of the mighty, to send down a body of Commissioners or a single Commissioner to occupy the positions of the Boards of Directors of the Railway Companies, Gas Companies, and Electric Lighting Companies in the country, and to nationalise all these institutions. I think the Government have very fully met the objections that we raised.  My University colleagues here and Deputy Professor Magennis will agree with me in this.  I rather fancy the National University and the University College, Cork, would fall within the definition of statutory Bodies that are exercising powers in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

The fact that the very same thing is done in another place shows that we have to take some precaution, and really some of the criticisms made and some of the suggestions made here, having regard to the circumstances of the times, would try the patience of a gentleman named Job, who had a very exemplary form of temper.  We are to make regulations to prescribe routes.  What is the suggestion?  Are we to open all roads and take no precaution, and make no regulations, and so on?  There is a time when one can point out the demerits of effective Government, and point out the mistakes, but this is not the time.

I am perfectly certain, and I am prepared to eat my head if I am wrong, that such a thing is not done, and that legislation is not dealt with in this trifling manner.  There they conform to all the forms, and they present a Bill as it is intended to be passed before it reaches a stage corresponding to the fourth stage here.  I do not believe there is a legislature in the world which would attempt to pass Acts like this in this manner.  We have what practically amounts to a fiscal reform measure put before us in this casual manner after two minutes' preparation, and because we attempt to criticise it, the President resents our action.

Otherwise we could send all the goods we liked into the North, and they could send out all the goods they liked to us without paying any duty.

      <P>The whole question involved here, it seems to me, is whether this is a legislature or not. The President on the Fourth Stage is asking us to take his word for certain things, and that is the whole matter. Quite obviously many of the things Deputy Hughes has said are true, but it is still more obvious that these things should come along in their proper place, and that they should be put into the Bill as originally drafted, or if not, that they should have been put in on the Committee Stage.  This is not the Stage for it at all, and this Assembly is not being treated as a Legislative Body at all.  There is no reason that I can see why this amendment could not have come up last evening, when with five or ten or fifteen minutes' discussion we might have disposed of the whole thing. It is now brought forward and no explanation given except what is dragged out of the Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not get away from the difficulty which seems to be in the minds of some of the Deputies if the Government could see its way to insert between &ldquo;of&rdquo; and `goods' the word &ldquo;dutiable,&rdquo; because <Col N="317" /> the clause to &ldquo;prohibit the importation and exportation of all goods or any classes of goods&rdquo; might be construed to prohibit the importation of goods which are not now contrary to law?  I rather gather what the Government are seeking is to prohibit dutiable goods being smuggled across the frontier between North East Ulster and the Free State, or to prohibit the importation of dutiable goods brought in at some port which are not now exciseable, and the Clause was not intended to extend the present powers beyond such goods as are now dutiable by law or may be made dutiable by Act of this Parliament tomorrow or any future date and to my mind it would improve this Clause if the words &ldquo;dutiable&rdquo; or &ldquo;exciseable&rdquo; were inserted in the Clause so that it would read &ldquo;Prohibit the importation and exportation of all dutiable goods or any classes of dutiable goods except by such routes, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor WM. MAGENNIS Professor WM. MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor WM. MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not precisely the point which I had in mind when I raised this question of fiscal law, because I quite recognise as regards the Clause in its present unamended form that it has a very definite purpose and a useful purpose, but let me add that unless either the Minister for Trade and Commerce or the Minister for Finance is authorised to decide through what particular points traffic of a certain kind shall pass, it would be necessary to have the very extensive and practically unworkable arrangement of a series of Custom Houses all along the line of the Northern Boundary, because if only dutiable goods were within the scope of this Clause it would then be open to traffickers to bring in non-dutiable goods by certain routes and the opening for smuggling be at once provided. It would be altogether unworkable if we were to put in &ldquo;dutiable&rdquo; at this stage of the Clause.  Now, it seems to me, perhaps wrongly, that there is an introduction of fiscal law when it is assumed tacitly or taken for granted that there <i>are</i> to be duties.  Sub-section &ldquo;B&rdquo; prescribes the cases and the form and the manner in which entry of goods imported or exported shall be made and duty on goods imported shall be paid.  If the restrictive words, &ldquo;<i>if any</i>,&rdquo; were added after &ldquo;goods&rdquo; it would leave the question of fiscal policy an open question altogether, and I suggest also <Col N="318" /> the omission of what I describe as the Penalty Clause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises the question of the very extended powers that were to go to the Minister for Finance.  There are 240 miles of frontier and innumerable by-roads and main roads as well as railway lines, and we are asked to give the Minister for Finance power to say whether all or any of these roads or by-roads or paths over fields shall be held up by a Customs officer, a sentry or a soldier.  Goods may be grass-seed or cattle, may be whiskey or tobacco, or linen, or any other article of merchandise.  This proposal is to give the Minister for Finance power to say whether any of these roads or paths shall be blocked by a soldier or Customs officer.  I submit that is too much power to give to the Minister for Finance. It is not an adaptation of an existing Act and the Minister for Finance has not power to-day to prohibit or direct which port or creek in Ireland non-dutiable goods shall enter into the Saorstát, and we are asked to extend the powers of the Minister for Finance to prohibit in so far as there is a land frontier importation or exportation of goods where he has not that power in regard to the seafront. Consequently I would press the proposal I suggested at the earlier stage that, in so far as the first part of this Clause 1 is concerned, up to the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; we should pass it, but the extension of those powers should not be granted to the Minister without a very considerable discussion on the principles and details of a separate Bill.  In so far as may be necessary to adapt existing Acts to the new conditions that power would be granted by passing this first Clause without any reference to any particular &ldquo;so and so&rdquo; which is increasing the power of the Ministry for Finance over and above that which he has under existing Acts, and I would move the deletion of all after the word &ldquo;necessary.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do <Col N="319" /> not think the point that Deputy Magennis made against my suggestion is really valuable, nor do I quite follow the Minister for Local Government.  If so you would have to have a Customs officer at every point along the frontier to keep out dutiable goods.  If you are going to put a duty on a cartload of cabbages and potatoes going across the frontier of course you can do so, but if anybody want to send it across, across it will go unless there is an officer there to stop it.  If you are going to keep out goods you must have your barrier, whether a policeman, a preventative officer, or a soldier, to do so.</P>

My amendment is to a portion of the Section that would not be there at all if Deputy Johnson succeeds.</P>

      <P>As to Deputy Johnson's amendment before us, would he explain what he means by omitting these words:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may make regulations to apply to the importation and exportation of any goods into and from the Irish Free State by land, and of the provisions of the Customs Act subject to such modifications as may be necessary?&rdquo; It is left to the discretion of the Minister and the clauses which Deputy Johnson's amendment proposes to eliminate were really only clarifying words to make it clear as to what any particular power was directed towards. I do not think that the purpose which he has in view is served by the amendment. For, as I understood his speech, his contention was that this amendment conferred a new and extraordinary power upon the Minister.  What he moves confers a new and extraordinary power upon the Minister.  Consequently, the position is not consistent.  Further, I would suggest in reply to my question he should consider that the conditions which these are <Col N="320" /> meant to meet are new and extraordinary. Ireland never had a land frontier before.  Consequently, the Customs Acts, whatever application they had, to importation and exportation by sea-ports, will have to be adapted to the new situation of the land frontier.  Consequently, I held from the beginning, and I think on reflection I was right in saying that all of these come under the category of adaptation and implication.  I shall have more to say in regard to implication when Clause 3 comes up.</P>

      <P>Could the President tell us whether the Customs Act applied to any except dutiable goods?  I do not know that the Customs Act prohibited the importation of turnips, potatoes or timber.  I understand it is going to be brought in only by some Finance or Taxing Act later, which says they shall not be brought in.  Then they come under the Customs Act.  I am not aware of any provision in the Customs Act by which the importation of any non-dutiable goods was prohibited, and therefore an extension of the Customs Act would not appeal to me, without a new enactment being passed to prevent a person bringing non-dutiable goods into the country by any route he please.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This position we are in now for the first time creates a land frontier.  The Customs Act, I understand, prescribes certain ports into which dutiable goods could be imported or exported out of.  I seek now to prescribe regulations concerning routes or roads by which goods can be exported or imported on a land frontier, and we are told that that gives too much power to the Minister of Finance.  Very well, <Col N="322" /> give him only a little power, but give him some power if he is going to deal with it.  What is the power proposed? The only power, if this amendment was passed, would be to adopt Acts which deal only with the sea frontier, and unless a channel is to be cut to separate that portion of Ireland that has cut itself off from the Saorstát I do not know how it can be done. As regards the goods, there are two objections.  There are people a long time at this business&mdash;the British Government&mdash;and this is, I understand, practically the same regulation as they have made, or the same statute or law. With regard to the other side of the frontier, if it satisfies them I think it ought to satisfy us.  The other point is, if you have goods on which there are no duties you make them come by the right, and goods on which there are duties make them come by the left, you will have the hard-headed business men sending goods that should go by the left, by the right.  Therefore I do not see the necessity for prescribing the goods which should go by particular routes as dutiable goods.  As regards the other points, if you want to make the thing useless you can pass this amendment.  I think it is necessary to pass this clause as it is.  To talk about regulations that give too much power is a thing that can be said on a platform, but it is not of much use here.  Someone must do it, and if the Minister for Finance is not a fit person, appoint some other person who will see that goods will not come through channels on which there will be no collection of duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is, in fact, to abolish the Dáil, and having set up a Ministry, leave them to do the regulation instead of having the trouble and expense of running a Parliament and wasting Ministers' time.  That is the proposition in plain terms.  The Minister has told us that inasmuch as the Customs Acts were drafted in relation to a sea frontier only they cannot be adapted to a land frontier.  That is exactly the case we are making.  You have introduced this new measure into an Adaptations Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we passed from that, and allowed the matter to go <Col N="323" /> into Committee and we have broken every reasonable rule that should guide a legislature.  I understand the case now from the Minister's last statement, which has only been drawn out after all this discussion, and which, if he had any sense of his position and responsibility to this Dáil he would have explained when introducing the measure, so that we would have had some enlightenment and assistance in passing legislation.  That is the duty of the Minister who introduces a Bill&mdash;to explain to the Dáil what is intended, what is implied in the Bill&mdash;but, instead of that, it is thrown at us and we are supposed to take it on his word, and only after this discussion are we able to extract any explanation.  Now, I understand the meaning of it to be that the Minister for Finance is to have power to decide that cattle, sheep, beer, pigs, porter, or any other commodity must pass through one or other roadway, railway line or field, and that any merchandise going across the border by any other route means punishment for somebody, if that somebody can be found.  It is asking us to give power to the Minister to make regulations which it is quite impossible to enforce and it will be just as impossible for the Northern Minister as it is for himself.  If he contends that it is only possible to carry on the business by these regulations, that he must prohibit the carriage of a sack of potatoes from Clogher to Ballybay by a particular route, because it may contain tobacco, well, I am prepared to allow him to do it.  It is as well, however, that we should have some explanation of the merits of the proposal that is brought before the Dáil for sanction, and that is the object of this protest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Deputy has made a statement for which he has given no proof.  He stated that it would be impossible to maintain a barrier if it was set up; and there he finished with that assertion.  That remains to be seen, but I certainly am very, very glad indeed to see the Minister demanding these powers.  I believe, if we are going to deal effectively with the situation in the North, these powers are essential to the Government of the Irish Free State. The Government, I think, should have power to prohibit the importation or exportation, not only of dutiable goods, but of all commodities to and from the <Col N="324" /> Free State.  There is more in that than reaches the eye at the first glance, and the value of that power, I think, only time will disclose.  But, if we are to be in a position as a Government&mdash;a State&mdash; to maintain our rights, and to create an atmosphere that may be conducive to the eventual unity of the whole country, I believe that power in the hands of the Government is an absolute essential, and I strongly support the Government in their demands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said, after the President's statement, that I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, and I will submit this suggestion for the consideration of the Minister and Deputy Milroy; that one way to help to test the value of this frontier is to reduce the tax upon some easily movable commodity, such as tobacco, by just enough to encourage the Northern people to invite tobacco to be smuggled over the border, and we will test the value of that frontier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I ought to be glad that the amendment is withdrawn. In regard to these amendments, if information was asked for we would give any information we have got.  But what I do object to is being attacked on a wrong front.  Now, as regards the second suggestion&mdash;to reduce taxation on certain items&mdash;I do not think that would be wise; I mean it would appear like a political move rather than the move of a State.  I am perfectly satisfied that these ultimate cordial relations will exist between the people of this country only on sound business lines. I do not think that would be sound and I do not think it would appeal to them. They are very good business people up there and they would see through a thing like that, and I prefer to let them see that if they will not join us, at least we are not prepared to declare war upon them because they will not.</P>

It has not yet been made clear, and I think it ought to be made clear why the Bank of Ireland should be selected out of all the other Banks, as the one which is authorised by this Bill to advance to the Minister of Finance a certain sum.  I submit that, without a clear explanation of the reasons, we ought not to select from all the other Banks the Bank of Ireland for inclusion in this Bill, and for that reason I beg to move that we should amend this clause by adding the words &mdash;&ldquo;or such other Bank or Banks as may be selected by the Minister of Finance.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>My information is that the Bank of Ireland was started in 1782, and they were prohibited by Statute, as far as my information goes, from lending any money to the State except by Parliamentary sanction.  Many years ago I heard that Parliament itself had something to do with the setting up of the Bank.  I take it that the reason <Col N="331" /> for that action at the time was that Parliament received money in the name of the King.  The King it was in whose name the moneys were advanced.  This express prohibition of the Bank lending money was evidently intended to be some restriction or some control over the issue of money to the sovereign at the time. However, the prohibition, I understand, is there, and it is because of that that Parliamentary sanction must be given in this form.  It is not necessary, in the case of the other banks, because no such prohibition exists with regard to them.</P>

      <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Johnson, and seconded by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon, is to insert after &ldquo;Bank of Ireland&rdquo; the words, &ldquo;or such other Bank or Banks as may be selected by the Minister of Finance,&rdquo; so that Clause 2 would then read:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister of Finance may borrow from any person or Banking Corporation in Saorstát Eireann, and the Bank of Ireland, or such other bank or banks as may be selected by the Minister of Finance may advance&rdquo; and so on.</P>

      <P>I believe the position to be that the addition of those words does not really affect the primary intention of the sentence under discussion inasmuch as those other banks and corporations may already do what the Bank of Ireland by this Charter is not enabled to do, and linking two different sorts of bodies together weakens the authorisation given here to the Bank of Ireland.  For that reason I think the amendment should not be pressed.  There is another matter that is, I believe, at the bottom of Deputy Johnson's mind, and that is if this is the removal of a disability this is not the best form or the best way to do it.  There I am inclined to agree with him, but the fact being as it is I think we as an assembly have no alternative but to adhere to the form of words here adopted. If the removal of the disability were modified it would have to take precedence over the Appropriation Bill, or Act, as it will become, in order that the amplification of this sentence in the sense moved by Deputy Johnson, would become possible.  The thing having got into the present position I do urge therefore <Col N="332" /> that this sentence removing the disability and merely putting the Bank of Ireland into the same position as other banks and corporations should, for this reason, be not further pressed.</P>

      <P>I think the sound objection to any amendment such as this is that it adds words without adding substance.  It is really an absurdity to insert words which are not necessary and which have no effect.  I would suggest that perhaps the Bank of Ireland has had by this discussion as much advertisement as the Dáil can give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening Deputy Figgis was not present when I anticipated his argument.  The Minister for Local Government points out a very forcible objection to it, and that is, that to add words which do not add substance is a futility.  I might point out to the Dáil that it adds this, though it does not add substance, namely, the possibility that a Court when called upon to interpret these words may declare that a proper interpretation of the words &ldquo;may advance&rdquo; is to be gathered from the linking of the words &ldquo;may advance&rdquo; with the further words &ldquo;such other Banks as the Minister of Finance may advise.&rdquo;  So that instead of authorising the Bank of Ireland to do that which without the authorisation it could not do, we should use words the possible effect of which would be the decision of a Court allowing this privilege exclusively to other banks and omitting the Bank of Ireland.  The English language is full of ambiguities, as we are all aware, and the phrase &ldquo;the Bank may advance&rdquo; is susceptible of two interpretations.  One &ldquo;is hereby authorised to,&rdquo; which means that there is a permissive value in the words, and the other, an indication of a bare possibility, a potentiality.  I suggested yesterday, and I repeat it, that to put into the third Act that we pass, deliberately, and of malice aforethought, phraseology that is capable of bearing two different meanings, is not a good precedent to establish.  The solid fact remains that the Bank of Ireland will not be in the same position as regards this privilege of lending to the Government unless it is enabled so to do by the removal of a disability. Whether or not that removal should be <Col N="333" /> effected by separate legislation is a question of propriety.  That question will not be settled, nor will the original problem in regard to it be in any way affected by introducing the words now proposed.  If we read that &ldquo;the Bank of Ireland, or such other banks as the Minister for Finance may decide, may advance,&rdquo; we have not put out of court the opportunity and possibility of someone saying, &ldquo;that was rather a strange procedure on the part of An Dáil; they have done under cover of an Appropriation Bill, what more appropriately should have been done under an Act removing the disability.&rdquo;  There is no purpose served by the amendment, and there is a risk of its effect being to preclude the doing of what is necessary to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be recognised that that is Parliamentary sanction.  If it is, then my amendment will not disadvantage the object of the mover of the Bill.  The amendment is to add to Clause 2, a further sub-section to read as sub-section 4:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing in this clause shall be construed as conferring any power, authority or privilege on the Bank of Ireland not derived from existing Statutes or Charters.&rdquo;  It may be that a judge would say that this power granted in an Appropriation Bill is sufficient to <Col N="334" /> authorise the Bank of Ireland to lend money to the Government.  I am not an authority on these things.  I am trying to look upon the questions that come forward with a friendly, critical eye, and to learn as I go along just as Ministers are learning as they go along.  But as I understand it, an Appropriation Bill is practically intended to be an authority under which the Controller and Auditor-General will be empowered to pass certain expenditure.  To my ignorant mind it seems odd that in such a Bill we should have to insert a Clause empowering a particular Bank to do certain things under that Bank's own Act of Parliament.  However that may be, for fear we might be doing more than appears on the surface, and the President is not very definite in his assurances, I think it might be accepted if we add to this clause this further Sub-section&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing in this Clause shall be construed as conferring any power, authority or privilege on the Bank of Ireland not derived from existing Statutes or Charters.&rdquo;  I beg to move that.</P>

      <P>The amendment would be effective up to a certain point in securing that we should not by inadvertence enlarge the privileges of this Bank beyond what otherwise it should not be entitled to.  The ambiguity, or the equivocation of the words, is being utilised because unless you interpret &ldquo;authority&rdquo; in the proposed sub-section (4) as giving permission, will the words &ldquo;the Bank of Ireland may advance&rdquo; in the earlier section have any value whatsoever.  They are utterly ineffective unless you take the dual meaning of &ldquo;authority&rdquo; in sub-section (4).  Again I make the objection that I made to the words &ldquo;may advance.&rdquo;  There is an attempt here to utilise the possibility of a double interpretation of words to effect some purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of the disability of the Bank of Ireland should be dealt with, having some regard to the circumstances in which it arises. I take it the disability was first imposed as a safeguard at a time when the business of the Government was done with the Bank of Ireland.  It was done to prevent improper borrowing by the Government without Parliamentary sanction. In the present circumstance that disability may have become obsolete, and if that is so it may be a good thing to abolish it.  But as it does exist, it should be met in the usual way in the present case.  The Bank of England, as I understand the matter, is under a similar disability, and in every Appropriation Bill that goes through the British House of Commons, that disability is removed to a limited extent&mdash;to the extent of the amount of the Estimates&mdash;in the same way as is proposed here.  They find it desirable that that disability should be continued in the case of the Bank of England, and that it should be removed in each Appropriation Bill temporarily for the period of one year, to the limited extent of the amount of the Estimates. <Col N="337" /> There is probably some case for continuing the disability here in the case of the Bank of Ireland so long as it is the Government Bank; but in any event the matter should be dealt with in that way. It seems to me to be really in the nature of creating a bogey to suggest that we tack on something to an Appropriation Bill that nobody ever heard of in connection with an Appropriation Bill before. This particular phrase is almost a conventional phrase&mdash;a stock phrase&mdash; in connection with Appropriation Bills. It might be that later on the whole system would be altered, and that such a disability on the part of the Bank of Ireland is unnecessary, and that it serves no public purpose and it might be removed. That could be dealt with by a Bill, and if removed the disability would not again appear in this Bill.  If there is some definite public purpose served by having this disability rest with the Bank with which the Government does its business, naturally, it follows that some such clause as this will have to come up in the Appropriation Act year after year. We are up against a situation that is met in the conventional and usual way, and as the whole matter is one that must be dealt with in haste, the right and proper way to deal with it is certainly to my mind along the usual lines and not to take some new departure without some proper enquiry and without understanding the whole situation.</P>

      <P>If that speech was made yesterday after I had invited the Ministry on Second Reading to explain the meaning of the second Clause, a great deal of misunderstanding and perhaps unpleasantness would have been obviated.  But our experience unfortunately has been that Ministers bring forward measures, proposals and estimates, dealing with far-reaching matters, and they do not take the trouble to explain them.  They will not take the Dáil into their confidence and they will not assist the Dáil in legislation.  Consequently we have to criticise and denounce, and then at the end of it all we get an explanation which is perfectly satisfactory. I hope that there will be some improvement in the future and I hope that Ministers will realise that their position is to assist the legislature in legislation as well as to administer their executive offices, and that when they come here with Bills and Resolutions and proposals <Col N="338" /> of any kind they ought not simply to throw them to the Dáil without explaining their import and their purpose.

If we had the Bill through very soon after we met in the New Year, the Seanad could have it passed before the 15th January.  I hope we can take the Second Reading as well as the First on Monday.</P>

      <P>While we are on these asides, might I ask the Minister for Finance if anything is to be done in the immediate future regarding the appointment of a Comptroller and Auditor-General? I take it that that appointment will be made by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I think it would be better to deal with one thing at a time.  The present suggestion is that we should alter the Standing Order by directing a sitting of the Dáil for Monday next, and that cannot be done unless the Dáil shall agree.</P>

      <P>If the Dáil is willing, I shall propose that we adjourn now until Monday.  We have a good deal of work to do on these Bills, and there is also a good deal of administrative work to be done.  Now, as regards the <Col N="340" /> question mentioned by Deputy Johnson, I did intend to bring forward next week a Resolution on that matter with the name of the person who was to be appointed.</P>

      <P>If there is general agreement I move to adjourn now until Monday at 3 o'clock.  In doing so I would like to express the full sympathy of the Dáil with Deputy Sean McGarry in view of the very sad loss he has sustained. The circumstances of his bereavement are very sad and painful to every Irishman and woman, and upon them I make no comment otherwise than to say that he has the deepest sympathy of every single Member of this Dáil.</P>
