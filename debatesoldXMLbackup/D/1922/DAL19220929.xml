      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government why Officials of Local Authorities throughout the Irish Free State who were pensioned under Sealed Order of the Local Government Board, under Section 8 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, are not being paid in full the Pensions granted to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the question relates to pensions which were fixed by the Local Government Board under Section 8 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, in the cases of officials who had been dismissed during the war.  Such pensions were in many cases excessive. The pensions of officials of local authorities are payable by the latter out of the Rates.  The local authorities generally repudiate liability in the cases referred to.  The Government considers that where dismissal was due solely to differences of opinion between the local authorities and officials as to interpretation of the duties of the latter some equitable claim remained for payment.  Pending determination of the matter, and with the approval of the Minister of Finance, advances have been made by the Government in some cases after suitable investigation.</P>

      <P>The Honourable Member is wrong in presuming that the question refers to dismissed Local Government <Col N="950" /> employés.  My question refers to employés who retire, and I may mention that if the Minister wishes I can give him two names of employés of the Dublin Corporation who were promised their pension on retirement and were encouraged to retire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in the case that I have indicated the Local Government Department has no responsibility. There are I should think six, or it may be four, cases of officials of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;in these cases we have decided to make a certain advance because we considered there is an equitable claim; but the Corporation is the body that has the legal liability.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence if his attention has been directed to the report which appears in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of September 14th (Page 5, Col. 5), to the effect that &ldquo;Mr. P. Hynes, Chairman of the Local Branch of the Postal Union, was arrested at his home, Newcastle, Co. Galway, by National troops and taken to Galway Gaol&rdquo;; if he is in a position to say whether or not Mr. Hynes arrest is due to his activities as a Trade Union Official; if not, will he state the cause of arrest, whether Mr. Hynes is still in detention and, if so, whether it is proposed to formulate a definite charge against him and bring him to trial.</P>

      <P>(in a writen reply):&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1).  Mr. Hynes's arrest is not due to any of his activities as a Trades Union Official.</P>
      <P>(2).  His arrest and his continued detention is due to the fact that he is charged with communicating the following instructions regarding the attacking of the Post Office, apparently at Galway, to members of the Irregulars in that area:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I enclose more carefully drawn plans of Post Office premises.  They are not exactly to scale, as only drawn from eye and memory.  If day or morning attack considered not practicable, on account of difficulty in getting away, I have considered a plan for a night attack&mdash;but mind there are men on watch at night time, especially at the back.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Enter O'Halloran's garden either from Abbey Gate side or Mary St. back premises.  The best point to enter Post Office yard, so that a Company could not be observed, is just at back of Murray's house, at a point where there is a Sycamore Tree, or between that or electric light pole, which overhangs the narrow passage of Post Office yard, as shown on diagrams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" />&ldquo;Climb up tree to height of wall. Attach short rope 5 or 6 yards long to strong part of tree.  When on top of wall slide down to floor of narrow passage noiselessly.  No window commands a view of the position, except one or two at top back, marked with red crosses, on top floor.  This view is, however, very, very slight, and they will not be looking out there unless they are aroused by noise.  They are often saying stones are fired at tin shed &lsquo;with object,&rsquo; they say, of getting them out to investigate.  Fire no stones beforehand.  When in yard, one to go to window of store-room which will be closed, but unlocked. Raise slowly and noiselessly.  One to go in, taking care to avoid book-rack on top of big table just inside window. Get off table slowly and noiselessly. The door shown by dots will be locked, but key herewith will open same. When opened slowly and noiselessly, peep out and see if way is clear to open side-door, just beside this (out to passage). The same key will open this and it can only be opened from inside, as the key-hole inside is not opposite the key-hole in lock.  Both doors are shown by dots and blue marks, on the plan.  The door open, the whole Company or as many as thought desirable could rush in suddenly.  The risk, however, is very great, if any of the men are within view.  However, if the door is opened very quickly from the inside they would not have time to think, and if a good time was selected, there might be no one in sight at all.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance how it is expected that taxes on motor cars are to be paid, in view of the fact that their earning powers for the past three years were practically nil, owing to bad roads and the disturbed conditions of the country; further, to ask the Minister for Finance why private owners should be expected to pay such a tax as 10s. per week for the use of a car, and whether he is aware that this is retarding the development of the country, by the non-use of motors, both private and hackney, and also increasing the ranks of the unemployed, by compelling owners of motor cars to dispense with drivers and <Col N="953" /> mechanics, and even, in fact, to close down their garages?</P>

      <P>(in a written answer):&mdash;There is no option but to continue the collection of Motor Tax as of other taxes on the present basis unless and until alterations of the law are made by this Dáil on any points where that course may be thought proper.  Unless the taxes are duly collected the Public Services cannot be maintained and in particular the collection of Motor Tax is essential for maintaining the Road Fund, out of which assistance is given to local authorities for the upkeep of the roads.  The case where a motor vehicle for any reason cannot be kept in use for the whole of any year may be met to some extent by the provision which enables a licence to be taken out in respect of portion of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins):</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, the Motion standing in my name is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of this Dáil the Government should, whenever the military situation so permits, take immediate steps for the consolidation and re-establishment of Civil Administration, and should, to that end, rescind the Decree establishing District and Parish Courts, in so far as it has not already been rescinded.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down with a view to enabling the Deputies to debate rather fully the question of Civil Administration, and in particular the immediate steps that it is proposed to take towards laying the foundation.  Deputies will remember that they cannot be taken now&mdash; permanent, far-reaching steps.  It is not the time for such steps and the proposals which I intend to outline to the Dáil are meant to meet a purely transitory condition of things.  They are proposals put forward with a view to saving the menaced foundations of ordered society in this country, and it is in that spirit and with that outlook that I would ask the Deputies to consider them.  Most of us here are familiar enough with the history of the Courts set up under Dáil Eireann.  And most of us realise that hastily conceived as they were in a time of stress, that they did do work that it was intended they should do; and they <Col N="954" /> very largely achieved the object for which they were set up.  But while we know that, and while we claim that these Courts, to a very large extent, justified their existence, and justified those who set them up, we know that they are not the kind that could remain permanent structures in the administration of justice in the country.  In June, 1919, the provision of Arbitration Courts was first suggested and the motion was carried at the Dáil as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Dáil Eireann decrees the establishment in every County of National Arbitration Courts.&rdquo; In June, 1920, at a Meeting of the Dáil the following was passed:&mdash;&ldquo;Dáil Eireann decrees the establishment of Courts of Justice and Equity and that the Ministry be empowered when they deem fit to establish Courts having Criminal jurisdiction.&rdquo; In the Spring and Summer of 1920 these Courts were set up rapidly throughout the country, until there was scarcely a parish but had its Parish Court, and certainly there was no constituency but had its District Court.  On that front just as on the Local Government front the people took from the British administration the control of their own affairs, and under the supervision and superintendence of Dáil Eireann Department left the enemy machine hanging idle with little or no grist going to that particular mill.  In that sense I claim that these Dáil Courts fulfilled the object for which they were set up.  It was to exhibit to the world the spectacle of a whole people turning from the alien administration to even the rough and hasty administration set up by Parliament and by the Government that was holding its own in the teeth of an armed terror.  We have arrived now at a stage when the entire administration of the country has passed into the hands of the people, and can be moulded by the representatives of the people, freely discussing and considering matters in an open Parliament, and it is not the opinion of those who are primarily responsible for that particular machinery, hastily devised as it was, as adequate to the needs of the time.  I have therefore to put before this Dáil to-day certain proposals.  It is the intention of the Government to appoint with very little delay salaried Magistrates to sit, each in his own area, at a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, having only the jurisdiction of the ordinary Justice in <Col N="955" /> the past.  These Magistrates or District Judges cannot be sent out until the Civic Guard are established throughout the country, and they will be sent out as close as possible on the heels of the police force, which must be their executive machinery.  That proposal will involve the immediate withdrawal of Commissions given in the past by the British, and of the Commissions given in the past with a specific object in view by Dáil Eireann.  I have described this as a temporary measure to meet a purely emergency situation, and it is a measure that is contemplated without prejudice to the report or findings of a Judicial Committee which will be set up to deal with the entire system of justice in the country.  That particular Judicial Committee will deal with the administration of justice from the highest to the lowest Courts, and it will have in view the providing for the people of a more convenient and a more economic system of justice.  It will have in view the removal of the rather glaring defects of the British system, which was cumbrous, expensive, and not at all suited either to the needs or the genius of this country. There will be about twenty-four or twenty-seven at the most of these District Judges appointed&mdash;these temporary salaried Magistrates.  It is thought that one of these stationed in a particular centre, and with about nine Court centres around him, having Courts on about twenty days in the month, that at that rate twenty-six or twenty-seven such Magistrates will be sufficient to meet the requirements.  I have spoken of the Civic Guard, and I think it is a matter on which Deputies will be anxious to receive information.  I have here from the Chief Commissioner of the Civic Guard a report showing that during the last week the Civic Guard were sent out through the country to the following places and in the following strength, viz.:&mdash;</P>

    <P>which would account for about 500 men. At the moment the effective strength of the Civic Guard is 1,500 men and officers.  In addition to that they are guarding 60 banks in Dublin and District and there are small, comparatively small, posts in the following places:&mdash; Swords, Dundrum, Foxrock, Kildare, Newbridge, Clane, Athy, Rathangan, Castledermot, Portarlington.  There is a further programme for next week which will practically exhaust the present strength of that force, and it is proposed to proceed energetically with recruiting. Now, as to what is the Government's conception of what this Force should be I would like to speak briefly.  These men have gone out through the country absolutely unarmed as a civil Police Force for the protection of the rights and of the property of all the people&mdash;of all the people.  We do not want to arm this Force if that can possibly be avoided.  They have been sent out unarmed.  It is an experiment&mdash;an experiment which we at least feel bound to make.  If that experiment fails, and if it is a failure, as clearly demonstrated to the people and to the Force itself, then the Government must consider the new situation and deal with it as it thinks best.  We have no desire to mould this Force on its predecessor, but neither can we agree to place servants of the Government in a position in which they would be shot down defencelessly. I prefer to speak of the future of this Force rather than of its past.  Its past has not been a particularly happy one, and it is not considered that any great good would come of delving back into that past, drawing up details and enquiring into exactly whose fault it was that so and so happened.  An inquiry was held, and certain officers&mdash;wherever the fault lay&mdash;tendered their resignations, and those resignations were accepted.  The Force is starting a new chapter now, under a new headship, and it gives me genuine satisfaction to report to this Dáil that the spirit of the <Col N="957" /> Force is excellent, and that while I feel that it is inevitable that complaints will come in from the country that the standard of efficiency is not high, I feel there will be very few reports or complaints as to the conduct of the men.  That is the thing that matters&mdash;the spirit of the Force and the behaviour of the men.  As to efficiency and experience, these they will learn just as their predecessors had to learn them.  I feel there is in that 1,500 men the germ, the nucleus of a very efficient, highly disciplined, and a self-respecting Force that will be real protectors of the rights and property of the people.  Members were sent into that force to make trouble, to play upon the feelings and prejudices of the men, and material was to their hand, and let us say they used that material skilfully and ruthlessly, and with a certain measure of success, if not all the success that was hoped for by the people who sent them in.  That particular corner is rounded and that particular chapter is closed.  I would ask that in this discussion Deputies should not attempt to reopen it.  No good can come of that, and we should turn our minds, just as the men had turned their minds, to the future rather than to the past.  There were faults inside and outside that Force.  On the whole, reading the report by those who held the inquiry, and reading above all the evidence they took, one could only conclude that it was a very sad and very human story.  We dealt with the situation as we found it, and I am satisfied that particular trouble is over, and well over, and that what has happened instead of being a permanent injury to the Force has been a salutary lesson to the men themselves.  Lately I said that we were standing amidst the ruins of one administration with the foundations of the other scarcely set. That is the position, and I want Deputies here and people outside to remember that that is the position, and that the things we do as transitory or emergency measures do not affect in any way what we would like to do or will do when laying down the permanent measures for the future administration of justice in the country.  But taking the situation as we find it, and starting at the lowest rung of these courts of summary jurisdiction, we feel that a selection of certain men in whom the people will have confidence, and for whom they will have <Col N="958" /> respect, and sending these out through the country with only that limited jurisdiction that their predecessors had, that that at least is a step to holding things together until this Judicial Committee is set up, and reports to Parliament on some secure basis, I hope in better times the situation can be dealt with in a broader way.  The magistrates that are to be selected will be drawn from both the two leading professions, and not otherwise.  It will be their business to administer the existing law strictly and impersonally.  No man will be sent to an area where he himself has any particular ties or associations.  They will go out as the Civic Guard goes out, in the name of the whole people, and for the protection and preservation of the rights of all the people.  For the present it is not proposed to interfere with the sittings of the ordinary County Courts.  That step would only tend to make confusion worse confounded.  There are only certain classes of cases which they have jurisdiction to deal with.  These cases are of urgent importance.  These County Courts will go out on their ordinary autumn session.  I trust the people will have sufficient good sense to realise that it would be a very unwise step on the part of a Government, situated as we are, to play the part of the bull in a china shop, and that we should not interfere with the old arrangements until we are ready with cut and dry proposals for our alternative machinery.  Let there not be that prejudiced criticism about British Courts. We should try to grow out of that. We should try to grow up as a nation and try to develop the capacity for looking facts in the eye and admit them. These are not British Courts.  There are no British Courts in Ireland at present. There are no Courts in this country at the moment that are not Irish Courts, and the authority for making, altering and rescinding of law in this country is now in the hands of the Irish people, through their representatives, and if they have any particular law that the public feel should be repealed or should be altered they have the means at their disposal to repeal or alter it.  When we are building we must build on a sure foundation, and we must not build in a hasty, ill-considered way.  The Judicial Committee that will be set up will consider and report to the Government on all the difficulties of the old system and <Col N="959" /> the respects in which it fell short of the people's needs and in which it clashed with the people's genius, and the Government will build sure and firm on that report, but until that report is made, and until the alternative machinery can be set up I do feel both the Deputies and the people outside ought to exercise a little of that uncommon quality called common sense in considering this whole matter.  This country is, in my opinion, undergoing a test; it is a true test, it is a very severe test, a test which it has not been the misfortune of many countries to have to undergo, but it is none the less a test, and within the next six months we shall know whether or not this country is going to weather that test, whether it is going to take and avail to the full of the opportunities that lie at hand, or whether it is simply going in a fractious, futile way to throw away these opportunities and allow the harvest of the last four years sowing to perish ungarnered in the field.  There is a kind of breaking of ties at present, a kind of loosening of the foundations, and we must attempt to meet and counter that, and we must do it firmly, and do it steadily, while remembering that, on the whole, it is perhaps not unnatural under the circumstances.  Had the whole unanimous Dáil stood for the Treaty Settlement, there would have been a problem, and a very grave problem, for a transitional Government.  There would have been the problem of the reaction from our special conditions of the last three, four or five years&mdash;there would have been the problems of the two reactions of the world war, which every country in the world is feeling to-day, and the reaction from our own special conditions of the last few years, and one man, no doubt an honest man, who loved his country well and not wisely, came with his torch to that barrel of gunpowder and multiplied that problem a thousandfold.  That is the situation with which we have to deal, and which, if we fail to deal with, spells disaster, perhaps permanent disaster, for the land and the people we are responsible to.  A rather general breaking of bands, a disintegration of the moral fibre of the country, a lack of civic sense, a lack of responsibility, a lack of appreciation of the fact that one cannot do things and escape the consequences, and now we are in the position that we cannot blame some other country or <Col N="960" /> people or Treasury for things going wrong We can blame only ourselves.  That is what we are faced with, and we must counter that both in word and in action; and it is the duty of everyone who is thinking straightly now, who is thinking clearly amid all this confusion, to express as far as he can express his clear thoughts upon those who are within his influence.  It does not matter how efficient the Civic Guard become; it does not matter how efficiently, impersonally, and impartially the new magistrates administer. You are driven back always to that which finds expression in the words, &ldquo;Unless the Lord keepeth guard over the house, the watchman watcheth in vain.&rdquo; Unless there is a spirit of charity, a spirit of decency, a spirit of civic responsibility inculcated here, the efforts of the Government to set up a firm and stable administration will not avert that collapse of the social and economic fabric which seems imminent.  It is a matter for the people themselves, and not for any selected body of people, but for all the people, facing facts, to do the best thing for the Irish nation under the circumstances that have arisen.  Padraig Pearse was right when he said that every man and every woman in Ireland carries the Irish nation in his or her heart, and, so far as any man or woman in Ireland departs from decent standards of citizenship the whole nation suffers proportionately, and the whole nation is let down proportionately. Men are standing in the path to-day, armed men, saying to the massed men of this nation, you must not take a certain course.  That is a position which never has been conceded here, which never has been conceded in any democratic country.  It will not be conceded here.  No small section have a right to say, you must go back to war with England. You must, if needs be, make a Thermopylæ of it and go down to the last man.  That is not sanity, that is not patriotism.  They can keep their high principles, they can keep their own political convictions, but some men must be allowed to work that Treaty settlement for the benefit of the Irish nation; and they must drop back, and they will drop back sooner or later, into the position of constitutional opposition in the attempt to convert the majority of the country to their political creed.  But they have not the right to kill this nation, as <Col N="961" /> the nation will be killed if the democratic will of the people is not allowed to prevail.  That, perhaps, is not very relevant to the question of the Civic Guard or the rescinding of the decree of the Dáil Courts, but it is relevant to the entire question of the attitude of the people towards the administration that is set up by the Government&mdash;that Government which is responsible to the Dáil, and this Dáil which is responsible to the people. It is the people's own machinery, and the man who set his face against it is sinning against the people; and we must develop here, and we will I am sure develop, that civic sense, that sense of responsibility that it is not a fine thing now, as it may have been a fine thing in the past, to break the law, because the law is the people's law, and because the Government and the Parliament that administers all this machinery is the Government and Parliament of the Irish people. I am prepared for certain criticism of these proposals.  I am prepared to be told that it is a reactionary measure to send out these salaried magistrates to sit alone and administer, even the very limited jurisdiction that will be theirs.  If there are those here who feel inclined to make criticism of that kind, I would ask them to weigh well all the circumstances of the time, and to weigh well the extent to which that civic sense, and that responsibility has been dissipated by the events of the last eight or nine months.  It is true to say that we have tapped public opinion so far as we could, here and there, through the country, with regard to these proposals, and the consensus of opinion favours the course which we are taking.  It is true to say that we consulted many of the Dáil justices themselves, and they asked to be relieved from an impossible position; they said that if in dealing with cases that came before them they did things which they knew and felt it was right to do, that they could not live on friendly and neighbourly terms in their areas.  That is a pretty serious situation, but it is not a situation which will last. I do not want Deputies to think that these proposals, which we, to-day, lay before this Dáil are proposals foreshadowing the general trend of future administration.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to criticise or advert to any great extent upon the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs.  I think, in the main, he has made out a good case for his motion, but there are a few questions which I think should be answered, and a few points that should, perhaps, be made on the general question.  I think that the country, generally, will agree that there is need for the setting up of the courts, where there will be a Magistrate or a District Judge, who is capable of deciding on questions of law, and dealing with these matters of summary jurisdiction.  But I feel that it would be unwise to forego what I think is really an advance, although, perhaps, some may call it a throw-back&mdash;sometimes it is an advantage to go back.  I think the establishment of local courts, call them arbitration courts if you will, should be maintained, and that the system throughout the country of arbitration courts, even if they are not given power of enforcement, is desirable to be maintained and developed.  There have been, I have no doubt, a good many follies committed by local courts and a good many abuses, but, assuming a settlement of the general question of the country, I would urge upon the Ministry, and the Dáil generally, that it is very well worth while, for the purpose of inspiring confidence, to re-establish, in some form or other, the local arbitration courts for the decision of, shall I say, the smaller matters of dispute. Another question that I would like to have some information upon, is as to the intentions of the Ministry in regard to the Decrees that have been passed by the Dáil, and which are the law in force to-day, and whether it is intended that when the Minister speaks of the existing law he means the existing law minus these Decrees or including these Decrees, and if the Decree amending the previously existing law is the law which now prevails, in his view and in the views of the Ministry, and that the law that will be administered by these magistrates is the law as amended by the Dáil Decrees; and whether it is sound law to say that judgments delivered by these Courts in civil affairs must be enforced, or whether we are asked to go back to the position that the work of these Courts is to be cancelled entirely.  I think that if that is intended it is very retrograde, and will be disastrous.  Whatever mistakes have been made in the <Col N="963" /> kind of machine that was set up I think we should recognise that they were made in good faith.  If there were mistakes made in the setting up of that particular kind of machine we must take the responsibility for the mistakes, but we must enforce the law that was administered through that machinery.  I hope we are to assume that the Judicial Committee which is to be appointed will be appointed after reference to the Dáil, and that any changes in the system of administration will be made by the Acts of the Dáil, and not by the Acts of the Ministry. I am glad to know that the Ministry is willing to face the risk, and I am glad to know that the men are willing to face the risk&mdash;undoubtedly a real risk, and they are brave men to face it&mdash; of going into the country as an unarmed Police Force.  I sincerely hope that the country will recognise the position that these men are going to the country to fulfil their duties as a Police Force and not as a military or semi-military force, and that all that has been hoped for and claimed in the past about the willingness of the Irish people to recognise home-made institutions will be exemplified in this particular at least.  I trust that nobody will have any regrets to utter that the Government and the Ministry decided upon this very valuable experiment, as it is an experiment, in this country.  I would like to hear, further, that it is in the mind of the Ministry that at an early date they will agree to associate in the control or the direction of this unarmed Police Force the local authorities.  The more that that is done the surer, I think, we will come to the point when the law, and the administration of the law will receive the confidence of the people.  I do not want to go into any details about the Civic Guard; others will do that.  But perhaps we should have some enlightenment as to the educational qualifications that are required, whether any change has taken place in that respect, and whether it is the intention of the Ministry to make room&mdash;  I say rather than make room, to give effect to the assurances that were publicly made in regard to those members of the R.I.C. who resigned at the call of the people.  It is, I think, only reasonable, and I think it will appeal to everyone's sense of justice, that these men ought, at least, to be treated as favourably as the men who remained on in the R.I.C., and on disbandment, or when <Col N="964" /> they were about to be disbanded, got favourable, or perhaps preferential, consideration in the formation of this new force.  That is all I have to say.  I hope the discussion will proceed on the lines invited by the Minister, and that we shall not attempt to rake up those things which he hopes and assures us have been relegated to the dead past.</P>

      <P>The Dáil will be aware that I left the Government on a question connected with these Courts. I have no desire to reopen that question here now, because I have stated my grounds fully in the public Press, and my action has been endorsed by those whose opinion I value most.  If I understood the Minister correctly, the same objections do not apply to the Courts now proposed as those which applied, or shall I say which seemed to me to apply, to the action previously taken, and I rise mainly for the purpose of getting a little elucidation.  The first part of the Resolution, in favour of taking immediate steps for the consolidation and establishment of civil administration, is one which I suppose will commend itself to everybody. The second part seems to me to be a little incomplete.  The second part speaks of rescinding the decree establishing local Courts.  I suppose I am right in assuming that there will be laid before this Dáil in detail the scheme under which the new temporary Judges are going out, because you do not get sanction for that scheme by merely rescinding the Parish and District Courts.</P>

      <P>I think it would be desirable that the Dáil should have something more than this resolution in writing to see exactly what it is doing here.  If we are putting in the place of the District Courts more efficient machinery, home-made, as Deputy Johnson said, there is a good deal to be said for it, because everybody realises that the District Courts did their work when the people appointed were properly qualified, but they were unsuitable where the people appointed were not properly qualified. Undoubtedly, some reform is <Col N="965" /> needed at the present time.  I realise we cannot have such a unification of the two systems of courts, as we should like to see, until the Judicial Committee has reported upon what can be done.  Apart from that difficulty, we are not quite clear as to the scheme under which the judges are going out.  I want to put one or two specific questions which, I have no doubt, the Minister can answer quite readily.  First you had a number of people committed for trial by the Dáil Courts a month, two months or three months ago.  By whom are these people to be tried?  What legislation will be introduced to justify their trial?  By what court, not contemplated at the time they were committed for trial, are they to be tried, and generally what procedure is to be adopted?  My impression is that there are some cases of considerable hardship, where men were kept in prison after committal by the Dáil Courts simply because there were no courts to try them.  If they are to be released, by whom are they to be released, and if they are to be detained, by whom are they to be tried, and how is the process to be legalised?  As to the new judges going out, of whom one must suspend judgment until one has more information, what right of appeal will there be from their decisions; under what statute, or is it proposed to pass a new law in that direction; and to what extent will their jurisdiction be alternative jurisdiction to that of the County Court Judges?  I did not hear all the Minister said, and I am not sure of the extent of the jurisdiction to be conferred upon these judges.  One would like a little more light, because the courts functioning now under the Dáil have a concurrent jurisdiction with that of the County Courts. We want to know how far that will be modified, and what will be the exact relation between the jurisdiction and powers of the two sets of courts.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say that the intention both of the Ministry and of the administration of the Civic Guard was to look to the future rather than to the past.  I may say I was rather glad to hear some of the things he said, and I do not want to rake up at all the unfortunate history of the Civic Guard.  But there are one or two things in connection with it that I want information upon, and I think that the Dáil ought to have information on, and I <Col N="966" /> think the country will be interested in. I am in agreement with the Minister that the Police Force should not be an armed force.  Whether this is the particular moment that they should be sent out altogether without arms or not I am not quite so sure, but I am with him in so far as the Police Force should be a genuine Peace Force, and not anything like the old military or semi-military force which the old R.I.C. was.  So if I express a doubt as to the exact wisdom of doing it in the way I would like it done it is only because I do not want to see this experiment failing, and failing altogether in such a way that we would be saddled after a time with a Police Force that would be permanently armed or semi-armed.  I do not want that plea for the arming of the Civic Guard at all. I think the less arming there is about them the better, and I should also say I do believe that under the new regime in the Civic Guard there have been big improvements&mdash;that discipline is being maintained and an effort is being made with a good deal of success to put that Guard on something like the footing it ought to be on.  But to my mind there are several things we require &mdash;fundamental things&mdash;in such a Force as this, and one is that, like the Judiciary and other services, it should not be in any sense of the word a political force or organisation.  That is to say, it should not be, in the sense in which the R.I.C. was, a political organisation, and appointments to it should not be made on political grounds.  From what I hear of his administration of the Civic Guard since he took it over, I have a good deal of respect for the present Chief Commissioner, but I think it is wrong&mdash;wrong in principle and wrong in essence&mdash;that the head of such a force should be in any sense of the word at all a politician.  I object to a member of the Dáil having or holding, even at this present moment, such an office.  I do not think, with the best will in the world, that one who belongs to a definite and distinct political party, and as such is a public representative of the people and takes his place in this Dáil, should at the same time have control and sole direction of the Civic Guard. Now, it may be that he is only temporarily employed.  I do not know, but I hope it will be only temporarily, or else that he will resign his seat in the Dáil. <Col N="967" /> Let me be clearly understood.  I am not making in any sense a personal attack on the gentleman who happens to occupy the position.  I am speaking about the fundamental necessity, to my view, in the Civic Guard.  I am sure a good many things that have happened have been got over, but there is still need for a good deal of care and a good deal of caution.  I am especially against arming the Guard with rifles.  Whatever may be said for temporarily arming them with revolvers at the moment, I am dead against arming them with rifles.  If my information on the following matter is altogether incorrect, I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me.  I have been told that the Civic Guard, up to the present, at all events, has not got that training in police duty which it requires. It has not gone through the process of police training in so far as it concerns a policeman&mdash;the administration of the law, and so forth.  There may be a police code for the Civic Guard.  If there is, we ought to know there is, and we also ought to know its nature.  It is an elementary fact that it is a much more difficult job to make a policeman than it is to make a soldier.  The functions of the two are quite definite and distinct. It requires a peculiar kind of training to make a policeman.  I should like to know if that training is being given to the Civic Guard.  My information is that, on the whole, it was not, and that they were not getting the training necessary. It may be that they are now, but my information is that they are not. There is another matter upon which I would like some information.  The other day the Minister, in reply to a question, gave us certain figures dealing with the salaries of officials of the Guard and the salaries of the members of the Guard. I should like to know whether the weekly wage paid to the Guard is the bare wage, with nothing found, or whether there are what we might call perquisites.  I know that in the case of the officers there are lodging and other allowances, but whether or not these apply to the ordinary men in the Guard I do not know, and I should like to know.  There is another thing that would require some explanation. Amongst the officers are some who, if my information is correct, did not come out of the R.I.C. until three months after they had joined the Civic Guard.  I am not at all sure that a good <Col N="968" /> deal of the trouble in the Guard was brought about in the manner in which the Minister suggested.  I think there was some other trouble, and there may be more trouble, unless I am again misinformed, on account of the position of the disbanded, as distinct from resigned, members of the R.I.C.  It is commonly reported that a good many of those who resigned from the R.I.C. joined the Civic Guard as raw recruits.  That may have been necessary. I think in a good many cases it would be necessary if the Civic Guard were to be the body I should like it to be, and that is a body that would scrap all the traditions, practically, of the R.I.C., and start on a new basis.  A very difficult job no doubt, especially in present circumstances. It is alleged that of the men who resigned from the R.I.C. between 1919 and 1921 and joined as raw recruits, together with those of other police forces who were disbanded after the signing of the Treaty, a good many, if not most, got rather higher and better jobs than other members of the force, and were considered rather eligible for the officer class in the Civic Guard.  I want to know whether that is true or not.  Now, as to the arming of the Guard.  I think recent instances demonstrate that the handling of arms by these men will want some looking after.  There was an unfortunate incident the other day&mdash;that of Eastwood. I think that kind of thing is inevitable to a certain extent.  In the Army there has been much of that.  I hope we are not going to have a repetition of it in the Civic Guard.  There was another incident reported, and I hope the new Commissioner, with whatever new disciplinary measures he will introduce, will see to it that there will be no recurrence of such an incident, or that there will be no reason or excuse for it.  I am told that three or four weeks ago a certain officer of the Guard in; I think, the Castle, was so fond of getting salutes from his men that he made himself rather a nuisance, and so much of a nuisance that one of the men fired at him.</P>

      <P>That is the kind of thing that I would have expected from the Guard as it was originally constituted, but I hope that the new regime is doing away with that kind of thing, <Col N="969" /> and doing away not only with the spirit that provokes men to turn like that on their officers, but also the spirit that makes an officer act in such fashion as to provoke the men.  I am more concerned with getting out of the officer that rather cocky spirit, because it is one of the things that was prevalent in the R.I.C. and in many military or semi-military organisations.  It is really the root of a good deal more trouble than many of us imagine.  I should like to plead along with Deputy Johnson that some consideration should be, if it has not already been, given to the men of the R.I.C. who resigned.  Now, no doubt some of them resigned through sheer cowardice; others of them resigned because they thought it was an easy way of getting out of an awkward job. I think a great many of them resigned because they were called upon to resign by the National organisation, with the backing of the National Government at the time, and many of them had done great service.  I am not saying any man should be rewarded for any service that he has done to the country in the National fight.  I do not think that should be the understanding on which a man would do a service.  But I remember that at the time these resignations were asked for there were assurances that the men who resigned would not be neglected by the people.  That was, I think, in 1919.  I have a letter which I received to-day from one of these men.  I know there are many cases where these men were not able to get any employment afterwards, and a good many of them have been living a more or less hand-to-mouth existence since.  Some of them may have got jobs.  A good many of them are married men with families to support.  I would like there would be some assurance given to those men that the obligation of honour that the whole nation owes to them because of this public promise is as strict as any other obligation of honour, and that they will be looked after.  This is hardly the time for experimenting, but I would like to express an opinion against a centralised Police Force.  I think the time has come, or ought to come, when the Police Force should be a local force rather than a centralised force.  There may be arguments in favour more or less of the centralised Police Force at the moment, but I think the Police Force should be <Col N="970" /> a local force, and I think the President, who is Minister of Finance, will find with the local force that spirit of civic and local responsibility for which he asked the other day.  I do not mean to say there should not be some kind of central direction.  There should be a common training afforded to all recruits right through the Force, but that the immediate direction and administration of the Police Force should rather be local.  The people should really be in a position to say for themselves: &ldquo;This Force is not merely the Force of the Government sitting in Dublin as the Army is, but it is our local people's Force that we have immediate control over, and that we can exercise that immediate control over,&rdquo; that it is really not anything like the old R.I.C., but that it is for the protection of the people of the district or the county, or whatever might be the local administrative unit, that as a matter of fact the policeman in Ireland might be what he is in other countries, the guardian, the guide and the friend of everyone in his locality rather than the man with the baton, whose job is to hit people on the head when they do wrong, that he should be the peace officer, friend, and guardian, rather than the schoolmaster or the warder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two or three questions I would like to put to the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to this important resolution which has come before us.  It is very far from my desire that this debate should decline from the very high and somewhat slumbrous level to which it has attained. I think one assumes that the measure put before us is one that deals purely with local circumstances, and is merely an <i>ad interim</i> measure.  It means that no final magistracy will be created in this country until this Dáil has put before it in the Constitution a proper Judiciary Act, and presumably a proper Constabulary Act, whatever the titles of these Acts may be at the time.  But between this time and then these measures are put before us merely to tide over this interim period, because the old system was very largely broken up by Courts set up under the authority of this Dáil, and these Courts themselves have also been set aside, and we are asked to give them the final <i>coup de grace</i> in this <Col N="971" /> resolution.  There is no question, sir, but that during a certain period of time those local Republican Courts served a very useful purpose and maintained a very high level of judicial administration. They aroused public confidence.  But I think that subsequent experience proved that Courts organised as these Courts were could only be maintained and could only prove ultimately efficient when they were supported by a very considerable state of national exaltation.  Because directly there came any kind of division into the country, as, for example, immediately after the division created last December, those of us who had any experience of those Courts know very well that judgments became, not indeed indifferent and impartial judgments, but extremely partial judgments.  Whereas before they had filled the country with a certain amount of confidence, it became necessary on their own merits then that they should cease to exist.  I am glad that this comes before us in this form, in order that the Legislature itself may set aside a legislative act, and that a legislative act should not be set aside merely by an Executive decree.  So that we deal then with that period that intervenes between the present moment and the final system, whatever that may be, as it will be finally decided. Pending that period I would like to urge one or two considerations upon the Minister for Home Affairs and upon the Ministry.  A great deal of unrest is now being created by a matter to which Deputy Johnson has referred, and that is the enforcement of the decrees already passed by the old Republican Courts. There are a large number of such decrees which, whether they are good or bad, are nevertheless judicial decrees, and there seems to be some great difficulty in getting those decrees enforced.  Some of those, I think, are hard cases, and I can give plenty of details to the Minister, but no doubt he has enough cases brought under his attention to make him aware of their existence.  I have heard of cases where decrees have been brought to the attention of the Police Officials under the Provisional Government at the present time, and the answer has been made that they did not know they could give enforcement to such decrees.  If that be the case, litigants have gone to some considerable trouble and expense in getting a decree, actually greater expense <Col N="972" /> than if they had gone to the other enemy Courts that existed at the same time.  The decrees have been furnished &mdash;decrees that should be executed in order that the continuity would be maintained. In the same connection I would like to enforce also the plea that to some measure even now the local authorities might have some responsibility placed upon them in respect of these Civic Guards, who are going out, as Deputy Johnson has said, with great courage to undertake their duties.  A number of other Deputies in many different debates in this Dáil referred to the lack of responsibility for the government of this country that has been too marked during the past few months.  I believe that the act of courage of these men going out unarmed to undertake police duties in different parts of the country will arouse a certain sense of moral responsibility, and I believe that as soon as that moral responsibility would be aroused it would be strengthened and confirmed.  If local authorities had it brought home to them that for the maintenance of these unarmed men, and for the procurance of peace, they were asked to accept a certain measure of responsibility&mdash;I know it would be extremely difficult to do&mdash;it would call forth a certain measure of administrative courage.  I do not think it would call forth any greater administrative courage than the sending out of these unarmed men.  If the two things could be conceivably linked together, I believe then we would get what everybody desires to see, and that is the country accepting responsibility for the maintenance of order in this country which, perhaps, in some parts the people have been somewhat reluctant to assume.  After all, we know very well there is no greater sense; there is nothing that will more greatly inspire courage, and courage is the ultimate quality to which I refer&mdash;that there will be nothing to call forth greater courage than the frank imposition of responsibilities, and I do think, if it could be done, and if administratively possible, that it should be done.  And I would like that the Minister for Home Affairs would give them assurance on that matter as to what the views of himself and his advisers are on that matter.  One final matter&mdash;with regard to the Commissions held hitherto.  A number of Commissions have been held by those who have acted <Col N="973" /> in the courts set up by the earlier Dáil. I do not know, but I should conceive that the people who held those Commissions should be very glad to be rid of them. They have meant a very great deal of time, but there are some who held these Commissions, who are, and who would be anxious, having the quality of civic spirit, energy and courage, would, I say, be anxious to continue holding those Commissions.  And that is equally true with regard to some of those who held Commissions of the same kind before these Dáil Courts were set up.  Here I touch upon a subject that is obviously one of considerable difficulty.  I do know that we have started in upon a new era, and those old people who are known as these English justices of the past&mdash;some of them were persons of accepted standing in their country and district; men who did stand on good relations with their neighbours; men whose judgment was known to be impartial; men who sought, at any rate, to deliver justice to the best of their ability. I do not know, but I presume that all these authorities would be swept aside by the new Judges that will be sent down. But I have been in touch with both of these sorts of men, and I would like to bring their cases before the Ministry in order that there should be, as far as possible, as great a continuity with the past as can be maintained.</P>

      <P>With regard to the power asked for in this Order, I am heartily in accord with the spirit that underlies it, and I congratulate the Minister for Home Affairs upon his energy in preparing and equipping and regulating things in such a way that he could send these men on to the different counties where they can reasonably undertake the work of police.  It is very necessary, when people have been looking forward to these men going down to help them to get on with the civil side of affairs, and I am glad the time has come when we are commencing to work, and it has been in arrears a long time undoubtedly. And I think the Home Minister is entitled to the highest commendation of the Dáil for his energy in this matter.  With regard to setting up, on behalf of the people of Longford and Westmeath, counties which I have the honour of representing in this Dáil, the Courts there will get a hearty welcome and the loyal support of the people in <Col N="974" /> these two counties.  But while that is so, I take exception, and very decided exception, to the class of person he has mapped out in this scheme, or outlined in his address in the Dáil a few moments ago, as the class from which he is going to draw his magistrates.  It seems now that there is a little money in the Courts. There was none heretofore.  But now that there is going to be a decent salary for the position which is equal to that of what used to be a Resident Magistrate, the lawyer is on the job.  It does not seem any qualification for appointment to these positions at all that a man risked his life and fought for the freedom of this country, or who sat on the Benches and strove in great difficulties to carry on the civil side of affairs while the Army was at work on the other side.  It does not seem or appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs to consider the claims of those men.  Not at all.  That is no qualification.  The work that a man did for the nation seems not to be a qualification now in the appointment of District Magistrates.  He must come from the lawyers' side, because it is a paid job. I protest against that, and I do say that these positions should be reserved for men who did give good services for the last four or five years to the nation; and these positions should not be conserved, and a ring should not be drawn round them.  Nor should they be made preserves for this useless class of drones&mdash; the men who are ready to pop in after the danger is gone and the salary is there.  But when the danger was there these men were not to be met with on the Bench.  No, they were in their offices or giving information to the enemy about Frank McGuinness or others, who were striving to &ldquo;carry on.&rdquo; I protest against reserving those positions for lawyers.  I also protest, on behalf of my constituency, in sending down some of the old Judges to the Quarter Sessions Court. I think that will be a failure, and I am sorry for the Minister for Home Affairs that he did not take a little advice from the representatives of these counties.  If he sends some of the old Judges, some of the old Castle hacks, it will be a failure.  He may talk about efficiency, I am out for efficiency.  I do say that no one should be appointed to these positions without a decent standard of common sense&mdash;at least no Magistrate&mdash;and that no one should be appointed a County <Col N="975" /> Court Judge or a Judge corresponding to it without being a trained lawyer of some standing.  I am with the Minister for Home Affairs in that.  But I ask him why does he retain those old Judges?  Is it not as natural for us to retain the old R.I.C. men?  Why were they shoved out?  Why had they to go? Because the people of Ireland were sick of them.  They pushed them out.  The people of Ireland are sick also of those old County Court Judges, those men who never gave a legal decision in their lives on its merits, and simply acted according to the orders they got from Dublin Castle.  Take, for example, their conduct in the Courts during the past few years in dealing with malicious injury cases. Did they decide these on their merits? Rather not.  They decided them on the instructions of Sir Hamar Greenwood and Dublin Castle.  Is it not known to every member of this Dáil that these decisions were outrages?  Is it not known that they were inequitable, unjust, and unfair to the people, to the ratepayers, and the taxpayers?  But, simply to carry out the orders of their masters, they went away from the legal points, and they simply gave a verdict in accordance with the instructions from Hamar Greenwood and his satellites in order to show the people that they were going to be decimated; that they were going to be beggared for standing up, or daring to stand up, against the foreign army in this country.  Now, if such a man comes down to the county to which I belong I am afraid that he will not get that respect which I would like a Judge in that capacity to get from the people. And I say that honestly too.  And I would ask the Minister to reconsider that point, and to appoint at least new blood, men with some National record as well as legal training.  Deputy Gavan Duffy said the Parish and District Judges were unsuited to their positions.  There was nobody else to do the work, for this reason, that no one else had the courage.</P>

      <P>The qualification was the National standard at the time, and you required men of courage, and men who loved their country down deep in their hearts, to sit in these Courts at <Col N="976" /> the time, and I say there are plenty of men amongst these who could be very well reappointed to those positions; several of them of high moral courage, good education, and sound National principles; men who would not give a wrong decision if they knew it.  But those other hacks come down with their legal training, and do exactly what their paymasters tell them to do, and particularly so within the last two or three years.  I protest against this, and, while not using any threat, I am afraid it will hardly succeed in some counties to which they may be sent.  I do not wish to go very much further into the matter; but I cannot see what the young men of Ireland were fighting for; I cannot see what they died for; I can not see what I risked my life for for years in the National struggle, and, having fought and won up to a certain point, when we go down to Longford or another county, and see the old County Court Judge sitting there, the old Crown Solicitor taking his place, the old Clerk of the Crown and Peace in his robes, the same old County Sheriff, the same old County Sub-Sheriff, the same old County Coroner; what were they fighting for?</P>

Why should these men be retained? Why should they be resurrected?  They have been withdrawn for some time, and why should we now send them down the country?  Why should we, while this Parliament is quite young, as the very first act, take these men, who had been hated, and are hated at the present time, to administer justice, moryah? There is no justice in these men; never has been, and cannot be now.  As General Sean McKeon said yesterday, they saw through British glasses in everything they did and have done, and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion of the Minister for Home Affairs: &ldquo;That, in the opinion of this Dáil, the Government should, whenever the military situation so permits, take immediate steps for the consolidation and re-establishment of civil administration.&rdquo; I think not only in this Dáil, but the Nation, and every right-thinking citizen right through the country, is of opinion that the time has arrived, and that, in fact, we have overstepped the time limit long ago.  At all events, I must now express, on my own behalf and on behalf of my constituents, satisfaction that the Minister for Home Affairs is going to tackle this question.  I have had some little experience in the working of these Republican Courts for the past twelve months, and I am sorry to say that they did not command the respect from the people that they should, for the very simple reason that we could not get the decrees of these Courts executed.  We established these courts, and we told the people we would execute their judicial decrees and accepted their money.  In hundreds of cases these decrees still remain unexecuted, and it will be one of the first duties to see that they are executed. I expect there will be some sifting process, and that the decrees will not be taken as they are found.  It may be necessary to sift them, as I understand many irregularities have occurred in these Republican Courts.  All was not plain sailing.  We have no civil administration at the moment.  The administration we had up to recently has fallen to pieces, and with it came irregularism, and I believe if the courts were allowed to function, and if the people who established these courts&mdash;the Republican H.Q.&mdash;if they took the serious interest in the functioning of these courts which they should have taken, I believe you would not now have that amount of irregularism that we find in the country. The very moment these institutions fell to pieces, irregularism came along by leaps and bounds.  There is a good deal in what Deputy McGuinness has said about sending out Castle hacks, but the Minister for Home Affairs has told us that it is only a temporary measure, and I am sure the Minister for Home Affairs and his colleagues in the Ministry are just as anxious as we would be to send <Col N="978" /> down men of good National standing to do this work.  He has told us, and we must accept the statement, that he cannot find suitable men with the requisite training, to undertake the duties at the moment.  Consequently, when the people in the country realise this, they will accept the statement in the spirit that we accept it.  I think they will be very glad of it as a temporary expedient, to get over the difficulties.  Any court is better than no court.  How many people are there throughout the country at the moment who cannot get their ordinary bills paid?  How many robbers are going through the country to-day?  There is no Court before which they might be arraigned.  Surely, it is necessary to set up some Court, even a Castle hack, provided that he would be an impartial hack, and that his decrees would be executed, and that the people would get some satisfaction for their money.  I have no love for these Castle hacks, never had, and never will, but I will accept them, at all events, as a temporary measure, and the moment we get our Government firmly established I am sure the Minister for Home Affairs and the Ministry will take into consideration the claims of men of good National standing, the men who worked with us in the past.  Let us hope that time will soon arrive.  I am also very glad to hear the Minister state he is sending out the Civic Guard.  I hope he will not forget my constituency if he has a few men to spare.  We have not, thank goodness, very many Irregulars down there.  We never had a large number of them, as we never entertained them. If we had the guns in time we would not have asked for the National Army.  We have no sympathy with the Irregulars or their methods.  The Minister for Home Affairs can hold his tribunals in the open, and I trust that to Youghal, Midleton and Cobh he will be able to send his Civic Guard.  They will be welcomed there.  They need not have any great training.  All they want is ordinary, common courtesy.  These are the principal matters I have to deal with.  I have to express my satisfaction that the Minister for Home Affairs is about to establish some sort of institutions in the country where the grievances of the people of the country will find some redress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate, but I do not like to remain silent after the speech of Deputy McGuinness.  I know almost all the County Court Judges in Ireland.  Some are personal friends, and some are acquaintances and some I do not know at all.  They are of all political beliefs, but I do not believe there is any single one among the lot who has been or is capable of being false to his oath or duty as an administrator of law, or that he would act at the orders of any paymaster in Dublin Castle or elsewhere.  I do not believe there are in this Assembly many people who believe that charge to be true.  I do not deny that the effects of the Malicious Injuries Act and the decrees given under it may be most distasteful to all those who had to pay these decrees, amongst them myself in my capacity as a ratepayer, but these decrees were not given by the orders of anybody in Dublin Castle, but according to statutory regulations dealing with malicious injuries compensation, which regulations were altered by the British Parliament on two or three occasions within the last couple of years.  The decrees were given in accordance with the altered statutory conditions by the County Court Judges. So much for that.  With regard to the conduct of the Minister for Home Affairs in selecting members of the legal profession to perform legal duties, that is, of course, a business for the new Irish era. To my old-fashioned mind, it seems not unreasonable that a lawyer should be selected to administer the law.  I believe on many occasions one of the criticisms directed against the Resident Magistrates was that they were retired Army officers and ex-District Inspectors of the R.I.C., and were in other respects without proper legal training.  If I might throw out one suggestion to the Minister for Home Affairs, he will probably consider it.  In appointing twenty-five or twenty-six gentlemen qualified by legal experience to take the place of the Resident Magistrates who have disappeared, I rather imagine that the trend of affairs in the future will go more towards an increase in the jurisdiction of County Courts and in bringing the administration of law to the people, and that they will be saved the expense of having comparatively trivial cases tried in Dublin.  If that reform should come <Col N="980" /> in the course of the next couple of years, it would be rather unfortunate if it came when a number of these men had been pensioned and the country was burdened with the pensions of these men who had been put out of action by the reform.  I have no doubt that the Ministry are considering, in making these appointments, whether the men who, through no fault of their own, may be removed, should not be considered capable of being promoted to higher duties, in the event of the Government agreeing to set up largely increased County Court jurisdiction. Now, if they had to scrap twenty-five or twenty-six people at the end of two or three years, I do not think the Minister will command the services of qualified men who would perform the responsible duties, because no men of reasonable standing at their profession &mdash;in either branch of that profession&mdash; would be willing to throw up their present positions and go to a job out of which they might be turned in two or three years.  Therefore, I trust the Minister has his eye on the possibility of making further use of the men, under whatever newly reformed system of justice he may introduce into this country; otherwise he might scarcely find men better qualified than the men whom he would replace.  I do trust this Dáil does not share the belief of Deputy McGuinness as to the performances of the unfortunate gentlemen he has described to us as Castle hacks.</P>

      <P>This, to my mind, is a very important resolution, and the spirit of the Dáil is entirely behind it. If carried out, it will bring back to this country a condition of normality quicker than any military activity that has taken place, or will take place.  The tone of the discussion has been very proper, with the exception of Deputy McGuinness. I think everybody realises what we are faced with in this country.  The Minister for Home Affairs has laid it down that so far as county court jurisdiction is concerned, it is only a temporary measure.  The statement is a <Col N="981" /> very fair one, and I take it, has satisfied the Dáil.  We are entirely behind the Government, once again, in their efforts to set up a proper system of civil administration.  What is wanted at the present time is a feeling of security for the people of the country.  It is because there is a lack of that at the moment, that there are so many Irregulars all over the country.  I happen to know something about civil administration.  I accept to the full the statement of the Minister for Home Affairs.  I am very glad to hear him say that the Civic Guard are to be sent out as an unarmed body, but I would impress upon him the importance of the request made by the Deputies from these Benches&mdash;Deputies O'Shannon and Johnson&mdash;that there should be some control given over the Civic Guard by the Mayors and Chairmen of District and Urban Councils in the different parts of Ireland, because if you want to make the people feel that these Civic Guards are their own peace officers this is the only way you should bring it about.  This is a good time now for this step because the people have got sick of the chaos that exists at the present moment.  If you want to get proper civil administration and save the country from chaos, to my mind you are only going to do it by giving control to the various Councils operating in Ireland. Deputy O'Shannon raised the question of the resigned R.I.C.  He said consideration should be given to these men. A number of these men, indeed a lot of them, did splendid work before they came out of the R.I.C., and the late Commander-in-Chief, before his death, gave an assurance to these men before they left the old R.I.C., that it should be honoured by the Government.  There is also talk of men who acted as Registrars of the old Republican Courts; they courted danger and imprisonment from day to day, and they should receive recognition from the Government.  The tone of the discussion was perfectly splendid.  In a matter of this kind every deputy in this Dáil seems to be determined in his efforts to bring about a state of normality.  I ask the Minister of Home Affairs that the question of the pensions of the old R.I.C. will receive every attention.  As to the functioning of the Civic Guard I might mention that under the old British system <Col N="982" /> Mayors and Chairmen of Urban Councils were allowed to take part in civil administration and preside over courts which are formed, Courts of Conscience&mdash;and I think these Mayors and Chairmen should at least have some control over the Civic Guard sent to operate in their particular areas.</P>

      <P>I see that the Minister for Home Affairs is about to rise to close the debate.  Would it be too much to ask him in his reply when the Ministry set up this Commission to deal with the judges and the courts will the personnel of the Commission be put before the Dáil, and will the nominations be subject to discussion or be solely decided by an executive act.  I would like also to know if the terms of the reference to the Commission will be submitted to this Dáil&mdash;if so, I should like to suggest that part of the reference be the consolidation of the two branches of the legal profession.  In every small country that is efficient in its administration of government, the two branches are combined. It means the cheapening of the law for the poor, which is most important, and had in every way satisfactory results.</P>

      <P>I would not have got up at all were it not for some of the references here with regard to the old judges.  Deputy Fitzgibbon has assured us that no members of the legal profession will be guilty of doing anything outside ideas of fair play and outside the law.  Well, we had up and down the country claims for compensation for malicious injury, for deaths of Black and Tans and others, and anybody who claimed to be dependants of them got a verdict in many cases for sums much greater than those they claimed.  Now, will Deputy Fitzgibbon deny that?  It may be in his view fair play and law, but to my mind it was not law but vindictive damages which were given in these verdicts.  I was sorry at the note Mr. McGuinness struck when he said that we fought the war in this country for something other than National independence.  I know he he did not mean that we fought for jobs, and so on.  I know he did not mean that, but I hope he will be as honest as Sean McKeon was, when he said yesterday evening we will not descend to be mere politicians and not be bolstering up corruption. <Col N="983" /> We know that some of these County Court Judges were not honest but were corrupt.  In my own district we had nothing to complain of, but in other districts there were malignant and corrupt judges who gave decisions which could not come within the four walls of any law.  I am glad that the Civic Guard has been sent out.  I know they will be a success.  I know some of them, and I hope the country will rise to the occasion, and that every man in the country will become a policeman.  In my own county they formed Parish Guards, with the object of acting and co-operating with the Civic Guard when they come down.  I hope every man in this country will rise to a proper sense of citizenship, and that they will make the country worth living in, will realise their responsibility, and put an end to the looter, the robber, and the man who is carrying a gun to-day, not because he believes it would tend to nationality, or that it would tend towards a Republic, but because it is the best paying item on the agenda.  We know, of course, that there are good men carrying guns who are idealists, but the majority of them are not anything of the sort.  But they are out because it is the best paying proposition at the moment. Now, if Deputy Corish is right, and the people are sick of chaos, well, I must say they have been a long time sick of chaos, and it is about time they were convalescent, and let them come out like men and do their duty as citizens in their various districts.</P>

    <P>I beg to support the motion that has been proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs.  I think that the people through the country will be delighted to see that the law is being established again throughout the country, and especially when they come to realise that it is not the old English law that is being established, <Col N="984" /> but the people's own law.  I think it is only right and fair to make a clear sweep of all the officials that were connected with the administering of the old English law, because there is a lot of confused thinking in the country at the present time, and it must be brought home straight and direct to the people that it is the Irish people's law that is being established, and that it is their duty to support it.  I hope that some of our misguided friends, who at the present time are out in arms against the Irish Government, will lay down their arms and give general support to the law that is being established; and where that law has not advanced as far as their ideas would wish it, they could help us to strengthen the position.  That is their duty; that is the patriotic course for them to follow.  As regards the old Judges, as far as the ordinary Court were concerned they gave impartial and fair judgment, but in political cases they were simply partisans, and they did not give justice.  I think it is the intention of the Minister for Home Affairs&mdash;at least I hope it is&mdash;that as soon as possible all those Judges who administered the old English law will be pensioned off, the good as well as the bad, because you cannot differentiate between them.  As regards the control of the Civic Guard, I do not agree with some of the Deputies who have spoken here that they should be under some of the local bodies.  I think, in order to maintain proper discipline, you must have a unified force, because if you send an undisciplined force into any county, instead of improving the law, they will be helping to create disturbance.  As regards taking ex-R.I.C. men into the Civic Guard, I do not at all agree with that.  I think you want to get away from the old traditions.  If there are ex-R.I.C. men who did useful work for the country, there ought to be other employment found for them.  I think it would not be at all a good principle to take them into the new force.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that to-day, at any rate, I have had a much smoother crossing than I expected. That is a thing for which I am grateful, in view of the importance of the matters we were discussing here to-day.  I am particularly grateful for the restraint and the sympathy that came from the benches opposite, because support from <Col N="985" /> behind is, I suppose, expected even in the rockiest measures.  It is gratifying and pleasing to find that members opposite know when they can depart, and when they should depart, from the rigidity of the political maxim that it is the business of an Opposition to oppose.  Certain points were raised in the course of the debate that should not be passed over without reference.  Deputy Johnson asked with regard to Decrees that have been passed by Dáil Eireann in the past.  It seems to me that it will he necessary in the future Parliament to incorporate or to consider how much of these Decrees can be incorporated into the system of law in the country and to legalise them by an Act of the future Parliament.  I have been, at any rate, so advised, and the matter is under consideration.  Now, as regards the judgments given by Dáil Courts in the past, that raises a very difficult question, because unfortunately you have to face the fact that Dáil Courts in the past did not always adhere to the jurisdiction that was properly theirs, but in many cases went far beyond their jurisdiction, and you had Parish Courts sentencing men to longer terms of imprisonment and fining people amounts altogether in excess of the amounts that their jurisdiction was limited to.  Also it is a regrettable truth that in some cases findings were given that conflicted rather radically with the evidence before the Court, and one cannot get up here and take the stand that absolutely all the judgments given by the Dáil Courts in the past should stand. Neither could one, with any appreciation of the enormous work ahead, get up and suggest that all the judgments given by the Dáil Courts in the past should be reviewed.  I think possibly the best thing we could do would be to send around a Commission to wind up and straighten out any tangles there may be in particular counties, and, while I point out these things, as of course it is my duty to point them out, I want to say that, taking all circumstances into consideration, the men who worked those particular Courts worked them with remarkable success, and that the Courts did, in fact, achieve the objects for which they were brought into being.</P>

      <P>Questions were raised of the association of Local Authorities with the Civic Guard.  That is certainly a point which we would undertake to consider very carefully.  I have only to point out that countries that have not a centralised Police Force very much wish they had, and that a purely local Force has very definite disadvantages which a little reflection will probably indicate. But the association, to some extent, of the Local Authorities with the Police Force of the country, is a thing that certainly should be, and will be, very carefully considered.  There were questions raised as to the educational qualifications of the Civic Guard. On that matter I am glad to say that practically every member of the Force has sat lately for an examination and that on the result of those examinations they were segregated into different classes.  The men who got less than 50 per cent., the men who got more than 50 per cent., the men who got 75 per cent. and over&mdash;they have been classified that way.  This system of examination will continue, and will be the test for promotions in the Force.</P>

      <P>There will be always in the future.  As to the condition of the Civic Guards' training, I think perhaps I could not do better than read an extract from a letter I have had from the Chief Commissioner.  This is the extract:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In all cases the Guard is being sent out as an unarmed force, whose sole duty will be police work, viz.:&mdash;the protection of life and property, and the establishment and maintenance of order &mdash;not as the supporters or nominees of any particular section, but as the servants <Col N="987" /> and protectors of the people of every creed, rank and class.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be remembered that the Civic Guard was called into existence only six months ago, and that the facilities for training a Police Force have been, up to the present, extremely limited. Apart from this, various other causes&mdash; chief amongst which were the regrettable incidents at Kildare Training Depot&mdash;have contributed to hamper and interrupt the training of the recruits, but these are gradually being overcome, and it is hoped that progress at a greater rate will now be made.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is admitted that the men have not arrived at that stage of efficiency which will ultimately be reached, but animated with the motive of serving the people faithfully, it is hoped their shortcomings will be criticised with charity, that the many difficulties that have to be surmounted will be borne in mind and that the public, without exception, will extend to the new Force their moral and material support.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I understand there has been little instruction in actual police duties in connection with the Courts&mdash;prosecutions in cases, and things like that, which require a general knowledge of procedure.  All of these things are as important a part of the duties of a police force as instruction in ordinary police duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. K. O'HIGGINS Mr. K. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is being attended to, and two appointments will be made of legal people to instruct the police as to how to put forward evidence, and generally their whole duties and the limits of their powers, because policemen not so instructed may very easily let themselves in for charges of burglary and things like that.  Reference was made to ex-members of the R.I.C.  It is not unknown to Deputies that the trouble there has been in the Civic Guard was raised over that very point.  I will not say it sprung from that particular point, but it was raised on that point by people sent in to make trouble. Now, a certain amount of inflammation occurred, and I do not think it is wise that we should risk further trouble upon that point, and alternative proposals to the admission of ex-R.I.C. men into the force are under consideration at the moment, and it is probable that we will bring some measure before the Dáil to make alternative provision for these people.  I admit the claim made by Deputy Johnson and Deputy O'Shannon, that these men who resigned &mdash;some after very long service&mdash;and gave up their prospects of large pensions, have a certain claim on the Parliament that came into being as a result of the trouble of the last few years.  But I think we must seek a solution along other lines than that of admission to the Force.  And also, whatever terms are arrived at, and whatever proposals are put forward those <Col N="989" /> ex-R.I.C. men at present in the Civic Guard will get the opportunity of availing themselves of these new proposals, should they wish to leave the force.  Deputy Gavan Duffy raised certain questions. He wanted to know under what scheme the new justices are going out. They are going out under the same Act under which their predecessors were appointed, and only with the jurisdiction of their predecessors&mdash;that is, they will have merely the jurisdiction of ordinary justices.  They will not have that Special Crimes Act jurisdiction which two R.M.'s sitting together had in the past, and which some of us remember.  He asked what would happen to people committed for trial by the Dáil Courts.  Now, certain people have been released by the Executive authority of the Home Affairs Department, who were committed for trial by Dáil Courts, because it was found some of them had been in for quite as long as any sentence that would be passed upon them in the ordinary way by a court.  There were cases of undeniable hardship, where more than the excess of jurisdiction was exercised by the courts that sentenced them, and if we cannot devise a perfect way out of the welter, we can only take what seems to us humanly the best way, and go ahead in that spirit and work out all the tangle that is inevitable when you have one administration smashed down, and another raised up from its debris.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. O'HIGGINS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  These cases will be taken up, and they will be considered on their merits, and I will undertake that consideration of them will be pressed forward.  Deputy O'Shannon referred to the head of the Civic Guard, and said it was objectionable that he should be a politician.  I agree absolutely, and I think that the Deputy will know that he has, in fact, ceased to be a politician, and his early resignation from this Dáil may be accepted.  He has not intervened here, and he has, indeed, kept away, and the only other member of the Civic Guard who was a member of this Dáil has also kept away, and not interfered in discussions.  We have faced the position that a man cannot be a good policeman and a good politician, or a bad politician, at the same time. <Col N="990" /> There was a question raised regarding the wages of an ordinary Guardsman; if the Deputy will just write to me raising that question I will get the answer straight from the Office.  I do not know if an ordinary Guardsman gets any lodging allowance.  In answer to a question the other day I stated what his wages were.  Deputy O'Shannon expressed the hope that these men would not be men imbued with the idea of hitting people on the head with their batons whenever they do wrong.  I share that hope.  These men have not that idea, and they are not in that spirit being sent out.  On the other hand, may I express the hope that there will be very few, after a while, deserving of being hit.  Now we come to Deputy McGuinness.  Deputy McGuinness struck a discordant note in an otherwise harmonious debate.  He generally joined issue on the whole question of lawyers, and he objected to the new Magistrates being selected from the legal profession.  He said there were no men with a decent National outlook in that profession; then he came on to deal with County Courts, and said the existing &ldquo;Castle hacks&rdquo; should be dismissed, but men of decent National outlook, from the profession, of course, should be appointed; so that the two things did not quite fit in.  I do not know what Deputy McGuinness risked his life for during the last four years, but we can only do our best according to our lights, or as some might say our twilights, and set up the administration of justice in the country that we believe will work.  We cannot, within the first few weeks&mdash;or even the first few months &mdash;of the establishment of this Government start simply smashing down old institutions with no scheme ready to replace them, and we have no intention of doing that even under pressure of such very strong and very ill-informed criticism as Deputy McGuinness treated us to to-day.  I will certainly, in making appointments to these responsible positions, endeavour to avoid appointing anyone who might have given information as to the dark deeds of Deputy McGuinness during the last few years. Speaking of the County Court Judges, he says they never gave a legal decision in their lives.  Of course, that is obviously untrue.  If Deputy McGuinness will bring me a list of fifty illegal decisions given by County Court Judges I <Col N="991" /> will be grateful to him.  Then Deputy Professor Magennis, speaking about the new Judicial Commission, asked if the personnel and the reference would be discussed here.  The reference will certainly be discussed here.  It is questionable whether it is desirable to have the personnel discussed here, or to ask men to accept a position where they would be more or less a cockshot for public criticism.  It is certainly desirable that the reference should be discussed. I think that fairly covers the ground of the debate.  In this new departure, and in this new situation that is being created, with an unarmed police force going out through the country, determined simply to enforce the law and protect the rights of everyone and the property of everyone, it is gratifying that this debate was marked with such a spirit of appreciation of the gravity of the times, and it is gratifying, too, that these men will know that the feeling expressed here to-day is reflected throughout the country and that they will have the moral support of the people in practically every area in the country.</P>

      <P>The Government statement, or at least the agreed statement, which was published this morning, describes the situation as it was understood last night by the Government and by those who acted for the men; but in this evening's Press appears a statement from the Headquarters of the Postal Union at 4, Cavendish Row. That statement reads: &ldquo;The official announcement regarding the Post Office wage settlement, which appears in this <Col N="992" /> morning's Press is a classical example of the art of face-saving.  The terms of the agreement under which the strike has been called off are: three-eighths of the total cut to take effect from the 1st September, and the balance on the 1st December.  The actual effect of this agreement is that our members continue to hold the Douglas award.  The Postal Commission will resume its sittings at once with a view to having the Final Report available before the 1st December.  The staffs on strike are hereby instructed to resume work on Saturday, the 30th instant, or as soon thereafter as the Executive's instructions reaches them.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. President,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My attention has been drawn to the statement issued by the Postal Unions, and I wish to point out that their reference to face-saving is ridiculous in view of the fact that I have the signatures of their leaders agreeing to the issue of the statement setting forth the agreement exactly as published in the Press to-day.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While it is true that the Postal Commission will resume its work at an early date, I would like to make it clear that I gave no undertaking as to the date of the Report, and I explained that the agreement reached was in no way contingent on the report of the Commission.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the statement made by the President, as I had a good deal to do with the settlement of the Post Office strike.  I regret that this statement, which appears in the evening paper, has been published.  I consider it, in the circumstances, an unwise statement, as when a strike is over and settled, it should remain settled, and the least said about it on one side or the other the better. We know, of course, that when we are parties to a fight, each side will fight its best to see that it wins, and we must, I think, make certain allowances for that human failing.  There are two statements, to which the President has drawn special attention, and I think they need special attention.  One is to the effect that the official statement published this morning is a classical example in the art of face saving.  I think Mr. Douglas's letter to the President has disposed sufficiently of that, inasmuch as he (Mr. Douglas) states, and I agree with him, that notwithstanding this evening's statement, the men saw the statement before it was published, and knew what was in it.  The second statement to which reference is made in Mr. Douglas's letter is the following:&mdash;&ldquo;The Postal Commission will resume its sittings at once with a view to having a final report available before 1st December.&rdquo; Mr. Douglas has said in his letter that he gave them no undertaking that the Commission would do its best to report as soon as possible.  Now, I consider the issuing of the statement by the men as unwise, but if I do so, I consider the action suggested <Col N="994" /> by the President equally unwise, and, in my opinion, not at all a punishment suited to the alleged crime.  I think it is, in my opinion, attaching altogether too much importance to it for the President publicly to victimise or humiliate three men who signed this statement. After all, if we examine the statements, we will find that they are not of the serious import that the President attached to them: &ldquo;The official announcement with regard to the Post Office wage settlement which appeared in this morning's Press is a classical example of the art of face-saving.&rdquo; It might be argued that it is saving the faces of the men. It does not say that the Government are saving their faces.  There may be some face-saving from the point of view of the men, and I think the statement with regard to the Commission does not stray sufficiently far from the facts of the case to warrant the importance that the President attached to it by stating in this Dáil that these three man would not be taken back to work.  I put it to the President, is it, at this stage of this dispute, a wise thing to take this action with regard to these three men of having done what is at most a foolish act?  I respectfully suggest that it is not of sufficient importance to make it a State affair in this way.  The men in their statement have practically contradicted themselves, although they do open out with this flourish of face-saving.  They go on to say: &ldquo;The staffs on strike are hereby instructed to resume work on Saturday, the 30th instant, or as soon thereafter as the Executive's instruction reaches them.&rdquo; They have called off the strike. Some of the men are going in at 12 o'clock to-night, and they will all be at work to-morrow morning.  If the Government persists in the action announced by the President, we are in for more trouble, and I do not think there is anyone in this Dáil or this country wants more trouble in this Postal business, and I respectfully suggest that the President, having made this statement, thereby attaching a certain gravity to it, should withdraw the latter part of the statement, and not take any notice of the matter further than publishing Mr. Douglas's letter to him, which sufficiently justifies the action of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall not unduly startle the Dáil after the equanimity that has settled upon it to-day by speaking plainly on this matter.  I <Col N="996" /> am moving that the Draft Constitution taken to London by our representatives be placed in the hands of the Deputies. I am not asking that any confidential document should be disclosed.  But when I first put the motion on the paper I did so simply because it is a matter of right that this Parliament, to which the Provisional Government is responsible, and to which alone it is responsible&mdash;that we, the principals of that Government, ought to know exactly what our agents have done on our behalf.  Since then we have had some debate on the Constitution, with the result that I have a further reason for pressing this motion, and it is that, in dealing with the Constitution there has been exhibited a want of candour, a disingenuousness that make it more essential than ever that the Dáil should know what was the original draft of the Government.  I feel that the men who are loyally supporting the Government because they realise the necessity of getting the Treaty implemented, are being imposed upon&mdash;that this Dáil is being imposed upon, and that the country is being imposed upon.  Let me remind the Dáil before I give a little evidence of that of a question which I asked the President the other day.  I asked him whether he would produce the Draft in question.  He said no, that he had refused on Thursday last, and he added&mdash;&ldquo;There has not been any change in our decision in the matter up to now.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Do you foreshadow that there will be?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Now, the President misinterpreted my answer to him as meaning that I intended to give publicity to this document, whereas what I meant was that I believed that the pressure of opinion in this Dáil would bring the Government to see that it was necessary that they should publish this Draft.  The President replied to me &ldquo;If there is (that is if there is publication) it will be a breach of confidence, and no person outside these Benches has the right to publish it, as it would be a breach of confidence.&rdquo; I agree with that&mdash;that it is a matter of honour for people who have been in the Ministry&mdash;people who have been on the Expert Committee of the Government, not to publish, without consent of the Government, the private Draft which had been prepared.  I agree, subject to one qualification, and that is, that this matter of honour is reciprocal, and that the Government must maintain <Col N="997" /> on their side their standard of honour. Now I ask the Dáil to observe what has happened.  When the Debate on the Constitution&mdash;I think it was on the second reading&mdash;was on (I quote from No. 11 of our Report) the Minister for Home Affairs singled me out for a curious attack, and one which he could not have made had that Draft been in the hands of the Members.  It was not an attack made in the heat of the moment, because he was opening the debate and, presumably, had thought over what he was going to say, and I refer you to it, not on account of the personal matter involved, but as it will lead up to the conclusive evidence of the fact that this Draft ought to be in the hands of the Members to prevent the Dáil being misled.  The Minister said &ldquo;Deputy Gavan Duffy said here some time ago &lsquo;this is a contract,&rsquo; and he said it in a tone of exultation, with the suggestion that because it was a contract, you could avail of any little loophole that you saw to evade the honourable implications of this Treaty&mdash;to evade the implications which, beyond all doubt, were present in the minds of the signatories at the moment when they became signatories.&rdquo; And then he went on: &ldquo;Now this Government will not dishonour the signature of Deputy Gavan Duffy, even at the invitation of Deputy Gavan Duffy, because when he signed the Treaty he signed it on behalf of the Irish Nation.&rdquo; I treated the matter with contempt at the time, because I put it down to the schoolboy insolence to which we are getting accustomed from this particular Minister, and I rather fancy that my honour stands out of the reach of the shafts of a Minister who is fast bringing his office into disrepute by his continuous habit of acrimony and want of scruple in his attacks on opponents.  He returned to the charge again, being enabled to do so because the Members of this Dáil had not the document in their hands which they should have, and I find, in Vol. 12 of this Report, some further observations of the Minister which are illuminating.  Let me very briefly refresh the mind of the Dáil as to what the Deputy said.  I had proposed to leave the expression &ldquo;the King&rdquo; out of the phrase which defines our Parliament.  I may have been right; I may have been wrong.  At all events, that is a serious matter, and the Minister treats it in this way in opening Article 12: &ldquo;There is an amendment down in <Col N="998" /> the name of Deputy Gavan Daffy which, in the opinion of the Government, is practically equivalent to an invitation to this Dáil to proclaim a Republic, and I trust that this Assembly will give that amendment all the consideration it deserves.  The proposal is to leave out the King.  Now, unfortunately, we consider that within the terms of the Treaty it is not possible to leave out the King.&rdquo; And then he proceeds to quote the Canadian Act, the African Act, and the Australian Act, but he took jolly good care not to quote to this Dáil the Irish Draft that these men took over to London, and well he knows it.  After that he went on to say: &ldquo;We who had the duty of working out an interpretation of the Treaty could only take it that we were bound to work out a Constitution which would fit within the limits of those first two Articles of the Treaty, and we could not see, still less could we maintain across the table with the British representatives, that there was anything in these two Articles of the Treaty which would enable us to leave out the King, as Deputy Gavan Duffy desires.&rdquo; And then, after some sneers about Robert Emmet, he says: &ldquo;We propose to accept the King because we have a mandate from the people to accept the Treaty, and we cannot maintain, and we were unable to maintain in the past, that within the four corners of the Treaty you could draft a Constitution which would leave out the King.&rdquo; Now that means that a man who, having been in the Ministry and knowing what were the possibilities in the draft of our Constitution and who came down to this Dáil and proposed to leave out the King, was either a fool or a rogue&mdash;probably the latter.  That is what those expressions mean, and they cannot have meant anything else.  I moved my amendment immediately after that, and I, thereupon, challenged the Minister to produce to this Dáil the Draft which he had taken over to London of these particular clauses. And finding himself in a very considerably embarrassed position as I went on, he decided that as he did not want to produce the Draft, he would execute a <i>volte face,</i> and this is what he said, interrupting my speech: &ldquo;On a point of personal explanation, I would like to know through you, Mr. Chairman, whether the Deputy is trying to establish that we did not try to leave out the King.&rdquo; Two <Col N="999" /> minutes before he had been telling this Dáil that none but a fool or a rogue would try to leave out the King.  And now when he is challenged to produce the Draft he turns completely round and tries to convey to the Dáil that he did his best to leave it out.  In other words that his advisers told him he could leave it out.  And I tell the Dáil, and I tell the country, that when he tried to convey that impression he was conveying the truth.  The reason I moved that Amendment is because I know that this same Ministry last June maintained that we were entitled to leave out the King&mdash;and they knew it very well&mdash;maintained it after the advice they had got from the various experts&mdash;maintained it in the Draft they took to London.  I shall pass from this unsavoury episode, and I hope I shall not have to return to it.  I think Deputies will realize that I am exercising considerable forbearance in not qualifying the conduct I have described as one would be inclined to qualify it, in these circumstances. What I want to put to this Dáil is this: Are we going to have as our standard in the public life of this country that kind of chicanery, or are we going to have a standard of public morality of which we can be proud?  It is for this Dáil to decide which it is to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been very easy for the Government to come to this Dáil, anxious as we all are to support it, in implementing the Treaty properly, come and say: &ldquo;Here is the Draft we took to London last June.  There were certain things in that Draft that did not commend themselves to Downing Street in relation to Clause A, B, or C, which we specify to the Dáil. Mr. Lloyd George informed us that if we insisted on our interpretation of the Treaty and what we were advised was the legitimate interpretation of the Treaty, he would tear up the Treaty in shreds and in the face of that insistence we felt it our duty to come away and to yield to the English interpretation.&rdquo; The Government could have said that and have gone on to say &ldquo;we recognise we were rather precipitate in our yielding, but whether we were right or wrong then, we tell the Dáil, that at the moment, when civil war is raging in this country, it is impossible for the Government to do otherwise than to accept these interpretations which are thrust upon it at the pistol <Col N="1000" /> point.&rdquo; If the Government said that, and made it clear to the country, that they are accepting what they believed three months ago to be a wrong interpretation, on a threat of tearing up the Treaty, if they had said that, &ldquo;we cannot stand up to the people in London,&rdquo; they would have been saving the National dignity, and I, for one, would have gone nine tenths of the way with them.  But what I object to is, the misrepresentation of the position, which would convey to the Dáil and to the country that the Draft, which we were told we must swallow, many parts without examination, is a just and proper and right Constitution for us to accept without question under the Treaty.  Saving the face of Lloyd George and Winston Churchill!  The other policy would have been just as easy, far more honourable, but it wanted just that little moral courage necessary to make it sufficiently easy for the Ministers to adopt.  When I spoke of moral courage the other day the President said, &ldquo;you objected to the Treaty, a man of moral courage would not have signed it.&rdquo; I can tell the President that it required a great deal more moral courage to sign the Treaty than to refuse to sign it.  Why did they not have the moral courage or commonsense to come to this Dáil, put their cards on the table and take every man here into their confidence and say &ldquo;we cannot help it, there is civil war on; and in face of that war whether we are right or wrong, England says in respect of such clauses you must take them and we are not able to make a stand by certain clauses.&rdquo; We have not yet been told that there was a threat of war, or a threat of tearing up the Treaty, or any other threat in respect of specified clauses. And the whole attitude from beginning to end has been wrong, and that is why I feel it my duty to insist that the facts shall come out before this Assembly, which is entitled to have them.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Government of what happened when Australia passed a Constitution in 1900.  The Australians came over to England with a Constitution they had drafted, and the English said &ldquo;you have got no Appeal to the Privy Council in this.  Put in an Appeal to the Privy Council.&rdquo; The Australians said, &ldquo;we shall have no Appeal to your Privy Council; we decline to put in anything of the kind.&rdquo; The English said &ldquo;that Appeal must go in or you will have no Constitution for <Col N="1001" /> your Federation.&rdquo; The Australians said, &ldquo;very well&rdquo;&mdash;and mind you they had no Treaty which could not be altered,&mdash; the Australians said &ldquo;very well, there is our draft, take it to your Parliament.  If you alter a comma in it you will alter it in the light of day and everyone will know if we accept your Privy Council that we do so, because you forced us to it.&rdquo; That was a dignified attitude, and I think our Ministers might learn a lesson from Colonial Ministers in days when that Colony had not become a Sovereign State, and if the Ministers here showed the same dignity now, and laid their cards on the table, and told us why we must accept this or that clause, that they were doing it, that they were asking us to accept this or that clause, because we must do it; because there is civil war in the country, and we cannot resist England, that would be the dignified, straight course.  They have not done so, and I ask the Dáil to say that the Ministry in the circumstances, after the conduct I have described, should produce the Draft they took to London before we proceed with the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the resolution.  I think the Irish draft of the Constitution should be produced in justice to the dead President and the dead Commander-in-Chief. They above all men may be blamed for the present Draft Constitution, which is an English draft.  In justice to their honour, the Irish draft should be produced, as their interpretation of the Treaty.  It was often said, that the late President Griffith was an '82 man, a Constitutional man, that he was not a Separatist, and all the rest of it.  I do not believe it.  The present Constitution will be submitted to the detriment of the honour of the late President Griffith, as proof, that he was never so advanced as he was supposed to be.  We have to consider the people of this country, as well as the people of England&mdash;peace in this country is more essential than peace with England.  If the publication of the Constitution before the election was known it is my belief that it would be one of the straws that drew away those who are now in opposition from acceptance of the Treaty.  If it was known that this Constitution was forced on President Griffith under duress, there might be a different view taken of it.  I submit that the <Col N="1002" /> Constitution we should consider is the Draft Constitution submitted by the Provisional Government.  It was an Irish interpretation of that Treaty.  I have never seen that, and perhaps I could have done so if I wished, but I do not think there was much reference in it to the noodle they call the king.  I do not think they have any respect at all for that noodle the English call their king, or want him in that Constitution that is forced upon us.  It does not make it a Republic Constitution, nor would it if the king were left out.  Neither did ex-President De Valera's document No. 2 make us a Republic.  If the Constitution as drawn up and accepted by the Provisional Government was put on the table with the statement, here is our Constitution and here is the Constitution the English want to force on us, here are the clauses the English say we must accept, or accept war, or tear up the Treaty, I think, so far as I am concerned, I would receive the Constitution in a different frame of mind.  We were told on the discussion on the Treaty by the late President Griffith that the Constitution was a question for the Dáil, but that he had promised to submit to the English Parliament a Draft Constitution, and he kept that promise, but he did not say so that the world should know that there had been an insistence on certain clauses being put into that Constitution, that they had been accepted under threat of war and the breaking of the Treaty already signed.  There is no good in going back on what has been done.  I think it is futile, but I cannot help saying that the Government selected a very inopportune time for submitting the draft.  It was after the assassination of Sir Henry Wilson and the De Valera-Collins pact&mdash;that pact, and I had letters from outside Ireland confirming this view &mdash;was accepted as scrapping the Treaty.</P>

      <P>It was only natural that the English should have had some fears at that time, and consequently took the first opportunity of assuring themselves that the Treaty had not been scrapped, and the opportunity presented itself in the Constitution.  I think, if we had not presented it at the time we did, there would not be so many changes in the <Col N="1003" /> Constitution.  They were afraid we were going to break the Treaty and they wanted to secure themselves.  If this Irish interpretation of the Treaty had been submitted to this Dáil and the English proposal submitted, and the acceptance depended on this Dáil, I think the English would have accepted more on the original draft than they have done on the draft now submitted to the Dáil.  They did not know we were going to fight for the Free State, and they did not think there was any opinion in Ireland that would fight for the Free State.  If the Government had come out and said: these things are most objectionable to Irishmen, and particularly objectionable to the men who are in arms against the Government, it would make for peace in this country, which is more important than peace with England.  If the Government were wise and took their courage in both hands, they would do it, and the fact that they will not do it makes me suspicious that they have got something in return for the surrender.</P>

      <P>I will not directly reply to many of the things that Deputy Gavan Duffy said, because the passage of time will answer them.  This Dáil will get to know him as well as the Ministry know him.  I was candid about the Constitution, that is the original draft, and Deputy Gavan Duffy did not like it. This matter is one about which nobody who thinks of the country and who is wishful to do his best for the country can have any two minds.  The people who will want it produced are the people who will really want it produced to achieve a personal object.  There are negotiations which bring good fruit, and the processes and the attitudes that have been taken from time to time, in the progress of these <Col N="1004" /> negotiations cannot be exposed without public damage.  Half a year ago all in this Dáil, I think, were agreed that a certain matter would not be a matter for discussion here in public.  When a matter has been discussed and closed, it is often a fact that the disclosure of the processes and progress of negotiations would be as harmful as publicity during them.  It is not an unprecedented thing that this draft should not be produced.  In South Africa a Constitution was drafted by a committee which sat for two years or thereabouts, and no documents connected with the work of that committee have yet been made public.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there is any reason for treating this matter in any different way from any other business with which the Government is charged. We come here with the policy frequently to recommend to the Dáil that we arrive at that policy.  We sometimes have to negotiate with outside people, and if we have not to negotiate with outside people, we have to settle and compose differences of view amongst ourselves.  Nobody in his senses would say that the good of the country would be served in any way by disclosing how we arrived at the policy we recommended to the Dáil. Can any person honestly think any person who does not want to get party advantage and does not want to serve some little personal object and save his face and try to run away in a most cowardly sort of way from something, that this should be disclosed.  There has been no attempt to point out how the interest of the country would be served by producing this Constitution.  There has been no attempt whatever to show how the position would be improved, how the interests of Ireland would be served by producing it.  For myself, if it were only a personal thing, or if it were not a matter that would create a precedent which would be harmful in the administration of the country, I would not give a snap of my fingers whether the Draft Constitution sent to London was laid on the table of this Dáil, or not.  I have stated what I believe about it.  For my part I regarded it frankly as a &ldquo;try on.&rdquo; While the members of the Government may have had different views about it, <Col N="1005" /> I do not think there was any member of the Government who was prepared to give way in anything which he did not believe the Treaty compelled us to give away.  I do not think there was any member of the Government, except perhaps Mr. Gavan Duffy, who thought that we would not have to give away something.  As far as I am concerned, I believe that the Draft Constitution as it stands is an absolutely fair interpretation of the Treaty.  I believe that the tactics followed in sending over the Constitution, which is not strictly within the terms of the Treaty, was justified by the fact that there were several advantages in this Constitution which the British have conceded to us, and which by the terms of the Treaty they were not obliged to concede to us.  I believe this is an interpretation which is fair to us, an interpretation in which the British have not insisted upon their pound of flesh, as they might have insisted upon it.  It is just as well to be frank about that.  When I decided to vote for the Treaty, I decided to work for it, and it is only by working it in the fairest way we will get the objects of the Treaty.  I do not think any National good will be obtained by trying to evade it.  I believe it contains the principle of growth, and because of that I believe through the Treaty position Ireland can work forwards to complete Nationhood. But with regard to getting anything by pretending we had not to give up things in the Treaty which we had to give up, is wrong.  I put it to one member of the Government, as far as I am concerned, my position is this that this Constitution is put before the Dáil as a fair interpretation of the Treaty.  No National purpose, no good purpose can be served by bringing up previous documents, and there were many of these documents, and there was nothing in particular to distinguish the one which was taken over to London from some of the documents which preceded it.  Nothing at all. No good purpose whatever can be served by disclosing the precise way by which we arrived at this joint agreement, especially in view of the fact that we were not pressed to the last inch in that interpretation of the Treaty.  I think that I need say no more, but that this is not a matter in which the Dáil will ask for a thing out of curiosity, or will ask for it to see what the Ministry thought of it, or things had been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> I am sure this Dáil will not ask for this document, unless it is convinced that some good purpose, some benefit to the Nation will accrue; and I submit that nothing of that nature can follow the production of the document.  I think that the Dáil will not produce it for the purpose of enabling Deputy Gavan Duffy to run away from the responsibility which he took when he signed the Treaty, and which he has since consistently tried to run away from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this particular subject, I would like to say a word or two in order to explain my position.  I am not sure that it is wise to say that we should not proceed any further with the discussion until the document is produced, but I say that the attitude that has been adopted by the Ministry in regard to this Constitution is not the attitude that we were led to expect, and is not in consonance with the position of this Dáil as a Constituent Assembly.  The late President, Arthur Griffith, wrote to me and assured me that this Assembly would be a sovereign body.  He wrote&mdash;&ldquo;This Assembly will be a sovereign body, and no one recognises more clearly than I that it is not for us to bind or diminish its sovereignty in advance.  Clearly, an Assembly empowered to pass and prescribe a Constitution has also title to pass and prescribe it in the form most agreeable to itself.&rdquo; The Minister will tell us it is still within our power, but the implication there is that this Assembly would be the body responsible for the production of that document, and while we all knew there was a committee at work to examine into the Constitution and produce the draft, we presumed it was all for the assistance of this Dáil as a Constituent Assembly.  Now the Government conception is a different one apparently. Their conception is, as a Ministry, that they were bound to produce a Bill which would embody a draft Constitution, and present it to the Dáil as a Government measure.  Now that was an entirely different position, and was not the position we were led to expect, or the position that was insisted upon by President Griffith when he spoke of this Assembly being all powerful in its power to prescribe and pass this Constitution in the form most agreeable to itself.  And so I support the demand for the production of this draft, and all other drafts; and if it were <Col N="1007" /> possible, to produce the preliminary drafts of the Constitutions of every other Assembly in the world bearing upon their Constitutions.  I would say these should also be placed upon the table in order to assist the Dáil in producing a Constitution most agreeable to itself.  Now that view is not held by the majority of this Dáil, and I am forced to make this confession. My conception of our function as an Assembly to produce a Constitution most suitable for this country according to our judgment is a wrong one.  When I thought that was our position and function I held that the Constitution we would produce in these conditions would be superior to any document, any Act, any Treaty that this country would lay its hand to.  But in view of the Government's position, in view of the Ministry's position, in view of the position held by the majority of the Dáil, I am sorry to say I am forced to accept the conclusion of Deputy Magennis and the Ministry that the Constitution is quite a subordinate incident, that it is comparitively trivial, and that the Treaty is a much more important document.  In view of the situation the Dáil is placed in by the action of the Government, we are not being assisted, as a Constituent Assembly, to produce the best Constitution in the form most agreeable to this Dáil.  In that case it is, by far, better that we should look upon this Constitution as a much less important thing than we have hitherto looked upon it.  It is in draft and it is the draft that is going to be substantially carried.  It is much inferior to the Treaty, in the powers that are conceded to this country.  Therefore let us stand on the more important document and place that in the premier position.  I am sorry that that is the case. I would like this Dáil to have issued of itself the Constitution most fitting in its view to the Government of this country, recognising frankly, recognising honestly, the Treaty we have entered into, but interpreting that in its fullest sense and to the fullest possible advantage to the Irish people.  Once that were done, if the form of ratification by the British Parliament, or confirmation by the British Parliament, has to be gone through, if that confirmation were not conceded, if we had to challenge the British Parliament to alter or wipe out this or that or the other Clause, in our chosen form of Constitution, then we would know where <Col N="1008" /> we are and the world would know where we are.  But as things are it seems to me we have to frankly recognise that the Treaty is a more important document and that the Constitution is quite inferior in so far as it does not come up to the standard set by the Treaty.  Quite apart from its repugnancy, in so far as it does not come up to the standard set by the Treaty, it is amendable and alterable at will.</P>

      <P>As I had something to do with these negotiations about the Constitution, it is perhaps just as well that I should say something on this Motion of Deputy Gavan Duffy. This Constitution Committee which sat, to advise the Government, was even more fertile than was expected of it.  It produced, not one Draft Constitution, but three Draft Constitutions, and it is true to say that it was not any one of those Draft Constitutions that was brought to London, but another Draft Constitution that was arrived at by a kind of eclectic process, a process of taking what we considered the best and the strongest from one or other of the Constitutions.  It was such a Draft Constitution that was brought to London.  It was our duty&mdash;we regarded it as such&mdash;to get into the Constitution all that the Treaty gave. Let us admit here, if we could have got into the Constitution more than the Treaty gave we would also have considered it our duty to get that and to take that. That is a point to remember, that if we could get into our Constitution more than the Treaty gave, more than the strict, or even fair, interpretation of the Treaty gave, we would have been delighted to get it, because none of us is perfectly satisfied with what the Treaty gave. Therefore, to be quite frank, we did what the Minister for Local Government described as a &ldquo;Try on&rdquo;; we brought over something which we felt ourselves we could not get and which if the position were reversed&mdash;if we were in the English position and the English were in ours&mdash; we certainly would not concede.  We went over, perhaps, with the spirit of a man who knows well that he is not going to get all that he is asking, for and therefore aims high.  We aimed high and we got what I have already described here, and what in my judgment is a strict but fair interpretation of the Treaty. <Col N="1009" /> I take it, it was strict because of the circumstances of the time.  I am sure if circumstances were otherwise, that we would have got a more pleasantly worded Constitution, but I do not believe that we would have got a Constitution differing, in any material respect, from the Draft Constitution that is now before the Dáil. Now there is a cry for the Draft Constitution. Our duty was to bring before this Dáil a Draft Constitution which they might consider.  Further, we were pledged to a certain political section in this country to produce, before the elections, the Constitution in its final form. That is the Constitution by which we intended to stand or fall as a Government. We went over and arrived at what is an agreed Draft Constitution.  Now I regard it as part of the functions of the Government to act towards the Parliament, to which it is responsible, pretty much as we are told the whiskers act to the cat. Someone told me, when I was young, I do not know whether it is strictly true or not, that the cat measures with his whiskers whether the hole is big enough for it to pass through; the whiskers report back to the cat the hole is too small. That is pretty well what we did.  We went over and we tried whether a certain passage was big enough, and we found it was not.  We are reporting that back to this Dáil, and if this Dáil thinks we are wrong it can try the passage, and we only hope that it does not get stuck half-way through and land itself in a mess.  Certainly anything we can do in the way of a back shove we will do&mdash;while we would not accept primary responsibility, anything in the way of a back shove we would do.  We have said that we consider that certain clauses in that Constitution ought not to be tampered with because we do not believe that you are at all likely to get better terms, and we do believe that you are very likely to seriously endanger the whole position. If that advice were not accepted we would no longer accept primary responsibility for the direction of the political affairs of the country.  Deputy Gavan Duffy wants the draft.  I think he wants the draft simply to say this is what your Government ought to have got&mdash;to use it as so much ammunition against the Government.</P>

It is in that spirit we put it to the Dáil, and it is not our duty to come in here to confuse the minds of the members with different drafts.  Deputy MacCartan said it would clear the air.  It would not clear the air; it would simply lead to confusion and danger and doubt.  Anyone who does not like this Constitution can express his views to the Dáil and attempt to get the Dáil to alter it in any way he can.  And, if he has sufficient persuasive powers, he can get the Dáil to put it in the fire and get power to produce another, but it is not the duty of the Government to bring forward before the Dáil confidential documents which are not, in fact, relevant. This is the Constitution before the Dáil and no other, and as long as we are in the position of being the responsible Government of the country we will insist upon a certain amount of Government privacy and Cabinet confidence, and we will not be bullied from that position.

    <P>In supporting Deputy Gavan Duffy's motion there are just one or two little things I would like to say, and one is that Teachtai should not be scared into taking up this request because one Minister has said that someone wants to <Col N="1011" /> use this document for personal or private reasons.  That is untrue.  It may be true of some Deputies.  I do not know whether it is or not, but it is not true of any Deputy upon this side of the Dáil, and we have repeatedly asked for these documents.  We want these documents because we want to get everything that is relevant to the present Draft Bill. Ministers say this document is not relevant. It might as well be argued, and argued as a matter of fact with a good deal more force, that the Constitutions handed round, including the Three Dominion Constitutions, are not relevant to this Bill, but of course they are relevant to this Bill.  And of course this document itself is of prime importance as relevant to this Bill.  The Ministry says that if this Bill is not carried they will resign or do something like that.  Now, the majority of this Dáil will take that up because the majority of this Dáil does not, in my opinion, want to put in an alternative Government, but if we on these Benches had anything like the numbers we would like to have here we would have no hesitation at all, if we got the assistance of a similar Committee as the Constitutional Committee in taking up the challenge of the Ministry to try it out and let them resign. We are not in that position of a comfortable majority, but we hope we will not always be in a minority.  One Minister has said&mdash;I do not know whether he said there was any precedent for anything like this, or that there was a precedent for keeping information back, but he mentioned something about South Africa.  Will any Minister tell me that, say, in the Treaty concluded between Great Britain and the South African Republics when they were defeated, that the proceedings of the Convention of South African delegates who appointed plenipotentiaries to come to terms with Kitchener have not been made public, and that these delegates were not informed step by step of the course of the negotiations.  Now, we on these benches have good reason to blame not only this Dáil but the last Dáil, because in everything that came along there was no information given step by step.  As far as precedents are concerned, I think there is a good precedent in the case of the British North-American Act.  I am just wondering whether the reluctance of the Ministry to produce this document has <Col N="1012" /> anything to do with the fact that in connection with the eighteen or twenty Constitutions, including the Three Dominions, the necessary information about these&mdash;namely, the circumstances in which these Constitutions were drawn up, have not been presented to us, because in the case of the British North-American Act it is well known that McDonald, the leader of the Canadian Delegation, had in the Canadian draft certain clauses which the British Colonial Office would not agree to, and one of these clauses&mdash;and it goes a little bit further than the Ministry is prepared to go in the draft before the Dáil&mdash;wanted to set up the Kingdom of Canada, although Canada at that time had not developed anything like the national consciousness it has developed now, and, although the people of Canada were made up of emigrants of two or three nationalities, and were not an historic nation like the Irish nation; he wanted to put it into a position with all the up-to-dateness of the position, without the out-of-date things that applied here in 1782.  These clauses were not kept back from Canada or the Canadian people.  They were not kept back from the world, but the documents that were drawn up by the expert advisers of this nation, apparently only for the assistance of the Ministry, are kept back.  We want them because we want to see how they fit in with the scheme of things.  The Ministry says the document before the Dáil is a strict and fair interpretation of the Treaty, and challenges the Dáil to disprove that. You may as well challenge the Ministry to disapprove that clause.  I have not seen the document that Deputy Duffy has moved on.  It would be as fair for us to ask the Ministry to disapprove that these documents were deciding points of the Treaty&mdash;just as fair.  Let us see them, and let us see if they will be of any assistance to us in making a better Constitution. I agree with Deputy Johnson that some of us, at all events, are disillusioned about the powers of this so-called Constituent Assembly.  I agree with him it was not the duty of the Government to bring in a Government measure for the Constitution.  Some of us went and asked for mandates for certain things in the Constitution.  I hope we got them.  We asked that we should not be elected unless by people who supported the things that we put in our programme. <Col N="1013" /> We expected to come here to have a free and open discussion on a draft that might be brought before us. That has not been the position at all. The Government produces a Government measure, and, like every other Government measure, put it through the Dáil in the ordinary way.  This is not a Constituent Assembly, and it is not a Sovereign Assembly.  I support Deputy Duffy.</P>

      <P>I do not think since this Dáil began its session, that I have listened to a more unnecessary and more wasteful discussion.  It was very much reminiscent of the wrangles that were characteristic of the old Dáil.  What is the object of it?</P>

      <P>Inflammation? Yes, I think the object is to inflame the minds of the Deputies here, and to render the calm, dispassionate tone of the debate, which, on the whole, has been a feature of the proceedings, no longer possible.  We are asked that, before we can proceed with this Constitution, the materials which were used by the men who were acting for this country should be produced before we can form an opinion whether this present Constitution that we have before us in the form of a Bill is a good or a bad Constitution.  That seems to me like a man who, before he will give his opinion about the character of some edifice, whether it is good or bad, would demand to see the scaffolding poles which were used in the construction of that building before he would form his opinion. After all, all these original drafts were, so far as I can get a simile, nothing more than the scaffolding poles used by those who are trying to build up or evolve a practical Constitution which would fit in with the necessity of reconciling the points of view of the two parties to the contract which is known as the Treaty. We have before us now the definite result of their interchange of opinion&mdash; what the representatives of both parties to the contract are agreed is fair, equitable interpretation of the Treaty.  That is practically the thing before us, and I think the practical work to do to-day is to get ahead with the Constitution, and let the country have the benefit of any advantages or <Col N="1014" /> possibilities of progress that it may be possible to get out of it.  I do not want to go into these rather irrelevant exchanges or reminiscences of Deputy Duffy.  They do not help, in my judgment, to throw any enlightenment upon the matter which he brought before the Dáil.  The only effect it had was, I think, to convince the Dáil of the fact that Mr. Duffy's opinion of the Government is a very melancholy one.  That may be very well in Deputy Duffy's judgment, but it is not the business this Dáil is concerned with.  The business of this Dáil is to do the work of the country, and not waste the time of the country by acrimonious discussions that lead us nowhere except into a morass of doubt and mutual distrust and suspicion.  We want to get on with the work.  We want to place the country in a position where it can discharge the ordinary duties that any people have to discharge. Now the honour neither of the late President Griffith nor of the late Commander-in-Chief is in doubt or in danger.  There is no man in Ireland who has any doubt of the fact that both the late President Griffith and the late Commander-in-Chief stood sentinel over Ireland's honour and Ireland's interest, till the last moments of their lives, and I think that this Dáil and this Treaty will perhaps be a monument that will stand out as a light burning, to keep their memories alive.  For it has been as a result more than anything else except perhaps of the heroic valour of Ireland's soldiers, of the superhuman work of these two valiant and illustrious men that this Parliament meets to-day to decide the future of the Nation.  Their honour is safe, and I hope when the history of this period is written, the honour of the members of this Dáil will stand one tithe as high in the minds of the people of Ireland.  I think it is not becoming to drag in the names of those two men as an argument to buttress this particular object that this motion stands for.  We had, as most people in Ireland are aware, a long rambling discussion that has almost rent the country into fragments on a certain Document No. 2.  Are we now going to have a similar wrangle on Constitution No. 2, because it seems to me that the value of a discussion on Constitution No. 2 or Draft No. 2 is not a whit more valuable to the country, and will not lead us one fraction nearer to <Col N="1015" /> National freedom, than the discussion on Document No. 2 did.  Deputy Gavan Duffy said when a certain reference to the British King was made by himself that the Minister for Home Affairs quoted the Constitution of Canada, of South Africa, and the Constitution of Australia, but, he added, that he took good care not to quote the draft Constitution that went across to London.  Why should he quote that?  I take it that the Minister for Home Affairs was quoting Constitutions that were in being, not one that was in the nebulous state of not having come to the final stage of passing through the hands of the draughtsman.  He was arguing about the Constitutions that were definite accomplished facts, not about Constitutions that were not accomplished facts, but were mere matters of speculation. The same argument was made by the Deputy who preceded him, and there was also a considerable amount of discussion about what was the function of the Assembly in dealing with this Constitution. While the point of view ventilated by Deputy Johnson was an interesting one, and a fairly legitimate speculation as to what this Assembly might have been, yet to-day we ask, not what might have been&mdash;what we are confronted with is the practical fact of what the Assembly can do.  The Assembly must take the draft before it, make what it can of it, make it an accomplished fact, and have an end to this useless, mischievous discussion. <Col N="1016" /> Let the country get on with the work.  &ldquo;Get on with the work&rdquo; was the cry the late Commander-in-Chief gave to the country, and I think it should be the keynote of our discussion here. So, get rid of those petty, bickering, miserable things which are disgusting this country and deflecting the discussions of this Assembly from the clean, commonsense line which up to the present in the main it has adhered to.</P>
