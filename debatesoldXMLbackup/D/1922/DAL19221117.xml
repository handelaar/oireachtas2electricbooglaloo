      <P>To ask the President if the statement which he made in replying to the Deputy for Sligo and Leitrim some time ago, that he understood that the accounts in connection with the Mater Hospital Sweep would be submitted to a reputable firm of Chartered Accountants for audit, has been verified; and that he is satisfied that all the books, vouchers, etc., in connection with the Sweep will be examined and a public statement subsequently issued, showing the total number of tickets printed, the total number circulated, the total number returned as sold, and the aggregate money value of same, with the view of arriving at a correct idea of the surplus or profit remaining after all legitimate expenditure&mdash;hospital donation, £10,000, prize money £10,000, organising and other expenses (whatever sum these amount to) has been defrayed.  And whether he, the President, on behalf of the Government, will see that the person or persons who benefit by the said surplus will pay their proper individual share of income tax assessable thereon, and thus help the State, at present so badly in need of money for housing schemes for the workers, the relief of unemployment, and other social reforms of pressing urgency.  Further, if he (the President) is aware that several similar sweeps are in contemplation, and if he can state if the same or similar facilities will be extended to the promoters as those conferred on Mr. R.J. Duggan and his confreres?</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add to the reply given by me in this Dáil on 10th October, 1922, to the question on the subject asked by Deputy Tomás Mac Artuir.  I do not, on behalf of the <Col N="2214" /> Government, see that any particular person pays his income tax&mdash;that is the duty of the income tax officials.  I have been informed of the proposed holding of only one other sweep of a somewhat similar nature.  Facilities for the holding of Sweeps are not extended by the Government to the promoters&mdash;the question which arises in such a connection is whether or not the power under the Lottery Acts of prohibiting the holding of the Sweep should be exercised.</P>

      <P>A grant has been approved for the restoration of this school building.  The Manager was notified of the grant and of the conditions under which it was sanctioned on the 17th October, 1921.  Subsequently, as <Col N="2215" /> it was found that the building could be erected for less than the amount originally estimated, the grant was adjusted and the Manager was notified on the 11th October, 1922, of the amount of the revised grant.  From a report received from the Board of Works it appears that the Manager is not disposed to contribute labour and materials which he had agreed to supply as the local contribution towards the cost of the works, and that the contractor has not been able to proceed with his contract in consequence.</P>

After the award of the Scholarships two of the successful candidates were found not to be within the prescribed age.  The Co.

Under these circumstances I did not feel justified in withholding approval from the Council's action, especially as the marks of the excluded candidates were rather low.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe),</NameTxt>
      <P>replying for Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash; The depression in the cardboard box and paper bag industry is due partly to the general industrial depression and partly to the fact that cross-channel competitors are able to put their products on the Irish market at prices considerably lower than Irish manufacturers.  Until the latter have put themselves in a position, by improved methods of production and in other ways, to reduce their prices, restrictions on the importation of cardboard boxes and paper bags would unduly handicap Irish consumers of these products. Some firms have already installed new machinery, but the depression in trade has made it difficult up to the present to judge of the results.  If the interested parties wished me to receive a deputation on the matter I would be glad to do so.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the fact that the regulations compelling foreign fishing trawlers to fish outside a three-mile limit from the Irish Coast are continually being broken by such trawlers, to the detriment of the Irish fishing industry, and as the patrol steamer for the prevention of illegal trawling is now out of commission he will consider the advisability of utilising the Government motor launches for the enforcement of those regulations, and also the advisability of increasing the present maximum fine of £100 for the infringement of the regulations to a maximum of £500?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan) MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that the Deputy is under a misapprehension as to the relation which the so-called &ldquo;three mile limit&rdquo; bears to the line within which steam trawling is prohibited. That line is determined by various fishery by-laws, each of which deals with a &ldquo;specifically defined area.&rdquo; In some cases, including one off the Waterford coast, these &ldquo;defined areas&rdquo; extend far beyond the &ldquo;three mile limit.&rdquo; During the past twelve months there have been twelve convictions obtained against persons contravening such by-laws, and there are four prosecutions still pending.  Although the regular patrol vessel has been temporarily deflected <Col N="2217" /> from her normal duties, it must not be assumed that cases of illegal trawling will not be promptly dealt with. I do not, however, consider that motor launches are the most suitable craft for such work.  In other countries (e.g., Norway) increased penalties are imposed for successive offences by the same person, and it is possible that with us a higher scale of fines would be desirable; but this, of course, would involve special legislation.  The Justices, however, have frequently failed to inflict even the present £100 maximum fine when convictions were obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. WM. SEARS Mr. WM. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word about the good work done by the Congested Districts Board in many respects in the congested areas of Ireland. They have done extra good work for the fisheries.  They have done also excellent work in improving breeds of cattle and establishing cottage industries, but I think they have neglected the most important part of their work, and that is land settlement.  They have not neglected it altogether, however, because they commenced it and did some excellent work in several counties.  They bought estates from the landlords, and in selling them to the tenants they increased the size of the holdings.  Thus they set up a line to the whole countryside showing what could be done, but as they did not carry out the work to any extent they only created more discontent by the inadequate way they went to work.  For instance, in estates which they bought and resold, I take one return in the report which says: &ldquo;That of these estates 3,500 holdings were re-sold to the tenants, and no increases made on the size of them, and the holdings were only increased in 750 cases.&rdquo; In this Dáil we have heard a great case put forward for organised workers of various kinds, and with that case I have great sympathy. We all wish to see men getting a decent living wage.  In the Congested Districts because of the disgracefully small size of the holdings there are hundreds of thousands of men, not getting a living wage, in a deplorable condition.  These little <Col N="2219" /> holdings are the nursing grounds for emigration. The people have no outlook, and they have nothing to do for their children but to send them over to America, and some of them are so poorly circumstanced that they have not even the fares to buy a passage to America, and you are in the humiliating position of seeing thousands of those men going every year to do spring work and harvest work for farmers who will be competing with Irish farmers.  I am sure there is not a member in this Dáil who does not feel the humiliation of that.  Those poor people cannot go out on strike, they are the most patient and long-suffering men in Ireland, and I am glad to hear from the Minister for Agriculture that he has a Land Bill.  I hope he will be able to say soon something that will give hope to those people in the West of Ireland.  Now, anything that has been done so far about the question of migration has proved successful.  I have only to read a few lines from the Congested Districts Board own report to show you how any State action has turned out well.  In the report of the Congested Districts Board for the year ending 31st March, 1919, I find this stated in it: &ldquo;Families have been settled in good farms sufficient for a comfortable life, with healthy dwellinghouses. In the year 1891 the people whose condition has been improved were struggling for a living on little holdings of cutaway bog, moor, or exhausted land of poor quality, while tantalisingly close to them were tracts of land used only for the grazing of cattle and sheep.  The marvellous change where the Land Purchase operations of the Board have been finished can hardly be understood without personal inspection by those who knew the country before the Board purchased the estates.  But even those who had not such previous knowledge can see new or improved houses, with compact well-fenced farms, tilled and grazed in a manner that is highly creditable in the first years of occupancy by those who, a few years before, lived in unhealthy hovels with little plots of unproductive soil that obliged the men to go as labourers to England and to leave their crops to be attended to by wives and children.&rdquo; I quoted that to show you that the Congested Districts Board had before them the real problem of the congested districts.  Now in this report they <Col N="2220" /> quoted what Michael Davitt said: &ldquo;That in a certain number of years £10,000,000 were expended in State aid to those people and they say that owing to their work that money is not now necessary.&rdquo; I say if there is not the same want in the West of Ireland for the last few years it was due to the good prices which prevailed and it was due to land purchase to this extent that the land was taken from the landlord and handed over to the tenants, who improved their land and bettered their own circumstances. It is not due to what the Congested Districts Board did for these tenants in the great majority of cases, because they did not increase the size of the holdings.  They point out in this report a very unfortunate thing, that is, that near the congested districts there are very few ranches&mdash;very little land to be divided up.  That shows the great difficulty of the problem and it shows you what has to be done later on.  It shows that the Minister for Agriculture who tackles this problem must face it with courage and vision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not continue this story of distress in the West of Ireland.  I am aiming at setting up in the West of Ireland farmers who will be self-supporting and who will live upon economic holdings.  They have enterprise and they are full of energy.  Capitalists come to this country and tell us &ldquo;We cannot start factories because the men have not the industrial skill that is necessary.&rdquo; But here are men in the West of Ireland trained to do their work and as one man told me, cribbed, cabined, and confined so that, as he said, he could put one hand on top of one boundary ditch and the other upon the other boundary ditch, so small was the holding.  And they are ready to till all they get.  The Congested Districts Board have not gone on with that work with the vigour they should. They were held back in the past by some hidden hand that did not allow them to do the work.  They complain that they have not got any land to be divided up, but they have.  They have 140,000 acres that they did not divide up, and they have in their hands for several years 43,000 acres of arable land to divide.  I wish to impress upon the Government the urgency of this question.  If most of the land in Ireland is to-day bought out it was because <Col N="2221" /> the main spring of the agitation that won land purchase started in these very particular congested districts.  It was in the West of Ireland that the Land League started.  It was in the West of Ireland that the United Irish League started.  These things were won through the action of these people but they themselves have not got much out of the agitation of the last few decades. They have looked time after time for increased holdings but they have not got them.  Now the Congested Districts Board says this: &ldquo;We have the land, but we have difficulty in persuading the men to leave one district and to go to another.&rdquo; I cannot understand that excuse and I do not believe that excuse.  I have asked T.D's from other parts of the congested districts the same question and they do not believe it is a genuine or an honest excuse. How can you say that men who send their sons tens of thousands of miles away to America and to California are not adventurous enough to go to Roscommon or some other neighbouring county where the vacant land is?  Whoever has been managing the Congested Districts Board for the last few years before the Provisional Government took it over have been resting on their oars and indifferent to the complaints coming from these districts.  I know myself districts where they have bought out estates from the landlords and they actually took adjacent bogs from old tenants and gave them to new tenants that they settled upon these estates.  They were entitled, of course to give bog to the local tenants&mdash; that I admit&mdash;but was it not strange that they left the other tenants also connected with the congested districts without any turf.  Anyone who knows the West of Ireland knows what a hardship it is for people who have no money to purchase coal or to put in electrical heating apparatus or gas to be without turf.  I know parishes where that has happened.  And here is the strange thing with regard to these bogs, that within five or six miles of the villages where these men live there are the finest bogs in Ireland now in the hands of the Congested Districts Board.  And they take no steps to make these bogs accessible to the people from whom they had previously taken the turf to give to the other tenants, and that certainly is a <Col N="2222" /> very great hardship.  I wrote some time ago to the Congested Districts Board about that, and they stated they would write me about the matter, but I have heard nothing about it since.  These matters are of pressing importance and should be seen to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sears has spoken about the land in the congested districts and the need for enlarging small farms.  I want some assurance about the water in these districts. Upon this question there was last year an estimate for £4,500 for fishery development, but that has disappeared from the estimate of the present year.  It may be that it will be taken up later and will be dealt with in another estimate by the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not know.  We have not seen the other estimates yet, but I would like some assurance from the Minister that the work done by the Congested Districts Board in aid of the fisheries of Ireland is not going to be abandoned altogether, and that if the Congested Districts Board are not themselves going to do these things, they will be transferred to somebody else.  I have some slight acquaintance as to the way in which the fisheries have been developed under the Congested Districts Board and I have never heard any complaints that the Board had not done the best they could and tried to make every penny they spent upon this branch of their activities do the work of twopence because they could not get 1½d., and I have heard it said that they have done wonders to enable the fishermen to buy boats and to equip boats if they had them, and that even with the small sums they had at their disposal they were enabled to do an immense amount of good.  I hope when the Minister comes to reply he will be able to give some assurance that these activities are not going to disappear and that this £4,500 which has vanished from the estimates this year will appear in an estimate later, and I hope in an increased amount, and I also hope he will be able to assure the Dáil that he will continue the work which the Congested Districts Board has already done in the development of the fisheries of the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies may I ask what profit the Congested <Col N="2223" /> Districts Board have made out of these 43,000 acres of land that they have been farming for the past ten or twelve years or more?  I also wish to say that there is a general feeling amongst most people about those Departments here &mdash;the Congested Districts Board, the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture&mdash;as to why a Commission is not appointed to revise the whole system.  We believe, and the feeling is very general amongst the people that the staffs in each of these Departments are doing nothing.  I know some of them who are doing nothing.  There is a multitude of people paid huge salaries doing nothing, and I want to know what the Government is going to do about it, what it is going to do to put the whole public affairs of Ireland on their feet, and to try to get some value for the money that these officials are paid.</P>

      <P>I was not exactly aware that the question of Fisheries came in under this head of the Congested Districts Board.  If it is under that Board, there is just one thing I want to impress upon the Minister.  It is this: The Department of Agriculture in the largeness of their hearts in recent years extended the boundaries of the mouths of the rivers in Connaught and Donegal miles out into the sea water, simply for the furtherance of private interests of one kind or another which it is unnecessary to mention.  But they are private interests and not national interests, and I would ask the Minister for Agriculture to review all these decisions of the Fishery Department of his Ministry, and to quash every blessed one of them, because no boundary should have extended farther into the sea than it did by the regulations that already were in force.  Under the laws of Ireland, the Brehon Laws&mdash;I believe we are to make a start now from the Gaelic position&mdash; every man in the country has a right to fish in the salt water so far as it goes, <Col N="2224" /> provided he does not fish with a fixed instrument.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not able to be here yesterday to deal with this question, because I was anxious to deal with it.  Deputy Sears, I think, stated the position very fairly.  The Congested Districts Board, for which we were not responsible until last March, did, I agree with Deputies Sears and Fitzgibbon, very valuable work, especially in the Fisheries, and especially in the beginning they did very valuable work in the acquisition and division of land.  There is no doubt whatever that the machinery has, to some extent, broken down.  That, I think, is not so much due to the personnel of the Congested Districts Board as to the difficulties, the size and the complexity of the difficulties, which were not foreseen when the Congested Districts Board was set up.  As the operations of the Board progressed they found themselves up against difficulties which really the various Acts did not provide for.  In fact, they were set to do a bigger job than they could be expected to do with the powers at their command.  That to a great extent is really the cause and the reason of the breakdown of the Congested Districts Board.  There is an undoubted breakdown. Now, there are many cases of land being held by the Board for five, six and seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about twenty years, but there are certainly cases where the land has been held for a very long time.  Take any one of these cases.  I have a few in my mind at the present moment.  There is an estate in Mayo.  There are thirty tenants on it, congested, and the estate itself is only able to deal with twenty; that is to say to give economic holdings to twenty.  And the question immediately arises&mdash;what to do with the other ten?  It is, as is very often the case in other parts, the only estate in that neighbourhood.  The obvious remedy would be the migration of ten.  Now, Deputy Sears said one thing that rather surprised me.  He said that the farmers' and tenants' sons who go to America and go away on such long distances to earn their living would make no difficulty about migrating to new holdings in Ireland.  Well, it is not the case of <Col N="2225" /> the son who is quite willing to go away or willing to have a try at adventure of any kind.  It is the case of the tenant himself.  Everyone who knows the country knows the extraordinary objection that there is amongst tenants even in the poorest districts to leave the places where they were born and their fathers before them were born.  In any event, in the case I have just mentioned&mdash;I am taking it as a typical case&mdash;where you have room for twenty and where ten must be migrated, you may take it for granted that everyone of the thirty thinks it is his neighbour and not himself should be migrated.  And the task of picking out ten tenants who are to be migrated is a task of really extraordinary difficulty, especially in the circumstances that have been in existence for the last few years.  There is only one way of settling that, to my mind. There must be migration from a congested area.  Migration, I know, is not a panacea.  Tenants taken from Mayo and Connemara will not do in the land of Meath very often.  It is not as simple as it looks from that point of view, but at the same time there must be migration. The laws passed here in future will be Irish laws, and we really must go on the assumption that laws will be just, and in any future Land Bill that has to deal with the congested areas, the principles and the general rules, if you like, underlying this question of migration must be as definitely stated as far as it is possible to do so beforehand, and without having the specific cases in your mind, the particular Board or Land Commission that is dealing with the matter must have a discretion.  You cannot make laws on the assumption that the laws are wrong, and that the Board that is dealing with it is wrong.  In the future, when the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board are reorganised, if they are wrong it will be our own fault, and the point I want to make is that somebody must have a discretion, but there again it is no use passing the best laws, and it is no use having the most efficient Land Commission if the laws are not respected, and if the Executive is not in a position to enforce the law, and if public opinion is not behind the laws and the legal machinery of the country.  This is a noted example of the fact that you can <Col N="2226" /> do no constructive work, and you can have no justice or equity unless you have law and order.  And though these are words that have been very much abused in the past, I repeat, law and order.  It is to be Irish law and order now, and the fact that it was English law and order a couple of years ago should not blind us to the fact that we can get nowhere unless we have law and order in the country and the confidence and reliance that there should be between the public and the Government. Now, with regard to the future, my view is&mdash;I do not want to be absolutely bound to it, I want to be allowed a certain amount of room to change my mind later&mdash;my opinion is, that there is only room for one Land Commission, for one Body to acquire and divide the land in this country.  And in spite of what Deputy Fitzgibbon has said, I am strongly of opinion at present that the body that is dealing with the acquisition of land should be dealing with nothing else.  The Fisheries Department should deal with Fisheries, the Agricultural Department should deal with Agriculture, and not with Education and other things like that.  Every Department seems to be dealing with just a little bit of the work of every other Department in this country. That is really the position at present. With regard to the other questions that Deputy Fitzgibbon asked about, this £4,500, well, he knows, of course, that this is merely a vote of £169,760 for the Congested Districts Board, and there is besides that sum the Appropriation in Aid £41,850, under the 1881 Act, and the Irish Development Grant of £20,000.  Of course, the Board is entitled to spend some of this money in Fisheries, and in regard to this grant of £4,500 it was an <i>ad hoc</i> grant that was made last year for the purpose of doing some work in Galway, and the work was done.  If you look at the back of the paper on Section B. Fishery Development Fund you will see this.  Now with regard to the Commissions, Deputy Gorey thinks there should be a Commission set up to put the country in order.  That is rather a tall order.  There is a pathetic belief in Commissions. The right body&mdash;I was going to say and perhaps it is the body that will do that ultimately&mdash;is the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The sooner the better. <Col N="2227" /> We seem to be all agreed on these matters, and I congratulate the future Minister for Agriculture of the Free State on the excellent reception his proposals will get when he comes to bring them forward. With regard to Deputy Johnson's point in connection with the case that has recently been tried before the House of Lords, I had better, perhaps, explain the procedure first, in order to make the matter clear, and if I take a specific example I think the point will be more easily understood.  Say the Board buy an estate for £10,000, and they expend £2,000 on improvements on the estate, and then sell it to the tenants for £11,000.  They sell it for a little less than the purchase money, and the amounts spent on improvements.  They then apply to the Land Commission, or rather to the Treasury, for the extra £1,000, and up to 1909 they were getting that money in hard cash.  The money was paid to the Land Commission, but the Land Commission, on the instructions of the Treasury in 1909, ceased to pay cash and offered them Stock. Stock at the present moment&mdash;it depends on the Stock&mdash;is about £60, so that instead of getting £1,000 in hard cash they would get £1,000 worth of Stock at £60.  If it were at £50 it would be worth only £500.  The Board refused to take that, and the dispute has been going on since.  Before the Treaty was signed the case was tried before Mr. Justice Powell, and the Congested Districts Board attitude was upheld.  The Court decided it was entitled to cash. It was then taken to the Court of Appeal in Ireland, before the Treaty was signed, and the decision of Mr. Justice Powell was reversed.  The case was then taken to the House of Lords, as the defendant was the Treasury and in England, it was in England it should be tried.  Mr. Justice Powell's decision was affirmed by the Lords, and it was decided that the Board was entitled to one and a quarter million pounds in cash. In fact that made a difference, between the amount of Stock and Cash, amounting to £500,000, which has to be paid.</P>

      <P>I wish to point out to the Minister that I must congratulate him on the magnificent defence he has made for the Congested Districts Board, simply trying to paint the devil white. We always paint him black.  There are one or two things I want to enquire into <Col N="2228" /> about the stock-jobbing of the Congested Districts Board.  The division of the land, I maintain, is only a side-show. Stock-jobbing is their principal work, and we want to put an end to that in congested districts.  We want the land to be divided immediately.  Another thing I wish to be satisfied about is the fishery rights&mdash;the filching of the nation's rights we will not agree to.  They have been filched by the Congested Districts Board, and we want to have things made right.  The fishermen of whom you are talking, and to whom you are giving your sympathy&mdash;it is nothing more than lip-sympathy&mdash;are being deprived of their livelihood for the benefit of private individuals all over the country.  We want all these things made right.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us if the Congested Districts Board is still in being.  Does the Board meet, and is it still in control of the congested districts?  If so, why is it not going ahead with the important work in hand, even though it is not buying any more estates.  They have estates on hand that require looking after. Should not something be done to press on that work.  The Minister very properly said it is not English law but Irish law we have now.  Well, I can assure him the people thoroughly appreciate that, and any difficulty they had in the past with regard to migration very often arose because of the officials of the Board, which was run largely by a foreign body.  A lot of officials came down&mdash;foreign officials&mdash;and they looked upon the natives as objects of curiosity.  Some of them would nearly want the people to take off their hats and say &ldquo;Your honour&rdquo; before they looked at them.  The people thoroughly appreciate that this is Irish law now, and have the greatest confidence in any Land Act if it is thoroughly aimed at as setting up a self-supporting peasant class in the West of Ireland, where they will be able to live without doles or emigration to England or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>Deputy McBride wants to know when the stock-jobbing is going to stop, and he also&mdash;I am not quite clear&mdash;wants to know about fishing.  The Congested Districts Board is still in being.  It was, as I said, taken over from the English last March, and I want to repeat, that so far as the Congested <Col N="2229" /> Districts Board has sinned, I am not responsible for it.  As I said, in my opinion, there is only room for one body to acquire and divide the land in Ireland. That is to say, there is not room for the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board.  That is my present opinion.  The Land Commission has not come over yet.  We cannot take over the Land Commission until we settle questions in regard to the 130 million pounds' worth of Land Stock issued for Land Purchase.  That is really the big financial question between us and England. Negotiations are going on and so far as they have progressed they are satisfactory.  We must have the Land Commission over by March and must have gone a long way in re-organising the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board by then.  And I expect that we will have our Land Bill through the Dáil or in the Dáil by March.  I did not attempt to paint the devil white.  I am not a good painter, and I did not try to do it.  I disarmed Deputy McBride by agreeing with him, but apparently he did not like it because he has stated I am defending the Congested Districts Board. I am defending them up to a point.  I quite agree that the machinery has broken down, and is not satisfactory at present and must be changed.  They have a lot of land that they cannot divide because they cannot get the people to migrate.  I have letters myself from two or three different T.D.'s&mdash;I do not want to mention any names&mdash;in connection with tenants on the same estate.  One T.D. is quite certain it is Tom, Dick or Harry should be migrated and the other T.D. is certain it is other people should be migrated.  In fact, I am afraid to meet these T.D.'s when I come here. Therefore we have not only the difficulty with the tenants, but also the difficulty with their representatives.  It is a real difficulty and it can only be settled by giving a discretion to the Board dealing with the matter and having some respect for law.  While they have the lands on their hands they must do something with them. They are grazing them, which is better than leaving them idle.  That is all that is to be said in defence of that.  They are setting them for grazing. I think they have set them in small allotments.  There are bullocks all over the lands, but if they are unable <Col N="2230" /> to deal with the land, if the area of land they have in any particular place is too small for the number of applicants, they have nothing else to do, until they settle the question, except to graze them or leave them idle.  It is unfortunate, but it must be done.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil in Committee, having considered the Estimate for the Congested Districts Board in 1922-23, and having passed a Vote on Account of £169,750 for the period to the 6th December, 1922, recommend that the full Estimate of £169,750 for the Financial Year 1922-23 be adopted in due course by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The next Estimate I have to move is the Ireland Development Grant&mdash;£159,500.  I move that.  I may explain, in this connection, that there is a sum of £20,000 paid to the Congested Districts Board under this Vote out of the payments mandatory under the existing law; that is Section 38 of the Land Act.  Until the law is altered this grant must be given.  It has, in fact, already been paid for the current financial year.  The Dáil must understand that these payments are not taken out of any disrespect to it, but in the ordinary way of administration of business.  Certain of these charges become payable at certain times, and in the ordinary course of business the Vote will be asked for early in the year instead of waiting.  That is as regards the £20,000.  Now, as regards the £5,000.  That is in respect of a certain sum levied each year under the Land Act of 1903 to provided a fund for ensuring, I think Trinity College, whatever income was derived by the College out of lands possessed by them previous to the passing of the Land Act of 1903. Now, as regards the £134,500, that is in respect of the interest on what is called Excess Stock, that is, when the price of money is increased, and when more stock had to be issued, in order to provide for cash payments to persons selling their land, the interest on the Excess Stock <Col N="2231" /> had to be provided from some source and the greater part of that sum is paid over to the Guarantee Fund in order to make up the interest on the Excess Stock.  This matter of Excess Stock is at present under consideration between the English and the Irish Governments. We are claiming that it is not a liability which can morally be put on our shoulders, that they have the responsibility of it, that the Land Acts and the Land Stock are chargeable to us in respect of lands for which tenants are paying interest, and that sums over and above that are not properly chargeable to us. This particular vote may be affected by a discussion, and if the money were not required for Excess Stock it would be applicable to purposes of education or economic development or transport facilities, or some other service of that sort.  But this particular vote is simply an Administration Vote in so far as it supplies funds for certain statutory obligations that are placed on the Provisional Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, at this stage, that this particular Fund was a Fund which originally belonged to Education.  It arose in this way.  In 1902-3, under the Education Act passed, the Estimates for education in England were considerably increased. Ireland's share on the equivalent grant basis would have been £185,000, and properly speaking, that £185,000 should have gone at that time to Irish education. The Land Bill of 1903 came on, however, and the Government of the <Col N="2232" /> day, with the acquiescence of our representatives at the time, laid hold of this particular grant in order to help to finance the Land Act.  Some small grants were made from this Fund for other purposes&mdash;a few light railways were built here and there, and this £5,000 was given to Trinity College.  I understand that there was some £50,000 given to education.  Now I just mention this in order to say that if and when there is anything to be got out of this Vote it will be remembered what its origin was and that education will have the first claim on any balance or surplus that may remain.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that I hope that the example of the procedure set in the presentation of these Estimates will not be followed henceforward. I am not quite certain of the procedure in other places, but I think it would be a very good example to show that in presenting these Estimates for particular Departments, the Minister responsible for the Estimates and responsible for the expenditure should make a statement to the Dáil of his policy, and his intention in regard to the expenditure.  It is not satisfactory that the introduction of these Estimates should be laid upon the Minister for Finance who obviously cannot possibly be in a position to give details or explain to the Dáil the purpose of the monies.  It is the only real control that the Dáil has or will have over Departmental administration, and I think the occasion should be availed of by the Minister responsible for the Department, to explain fully the policy of the Department, and any departures from past procedure that he intends to put into operation.  It is only by such means as that that we are able to co-operate in the actual administration of the country's affairs, and if the Parliament is to be the co-operator in that work they must be made acquainted by the Minister responsible with the affairs of the Department, and not wait for criticism for information to be extracted.  It seems to me to be the obvious duty of the Minister responsible for the administration of the department, and the preparation of the Estimates, and the spending of monies that are to be voted, that he should make some statement <Col N="2234" /> in regard to the administration.  I want to put in a formal protest against this procedure, and to ask that in future, at any rate, the Minister responsible shall explain the Estimates, and give some outline of his policy in regard to the Department when presenting these Estimates.</P>

      <P>I would like to say as a private member that it is very difficult for this Dáil to get a thorough grasp of the work of the Departments from reading the bald statements and bald figures like those submitted to us.  Our Government is following the examples of other Governments.  In the British House of Commons, I understand, they submit volumes of figures of this kind, and they are quite satisfied with it.  In America, I understand, a different system is followed.  Now, take the Board of Agriculture: A Committee of the whole House I understand is set up, a small Committee representative of the whole House, and the business of the Board of Agriculture is laid before this Committee.  They know the schemes the Minister has in his hands; they know the policy he is submitting. You can never get into touch with the work of any Minister by asking questions. It is the duty of the Minister for the sake of self-preservation to give the baldest reply he can.  If he does not say the answer is in the affirmative he will go so far as to say that it is in the negative, that is all you know about it. It does not matter if you get at him and you approached him in another direction; he is there, and you will get a shorter answer still.  It is human, and I do not blame the Minister at all.  I think this Dáil should set up a group of Committees, one dealing with law, one dealing with land, one dealing with education, and so on.  The members of this Dáil are entitled to know what is going on, and they are ready to share in it. I am not blaming the Minister.  The system does not allow it.  I suggested at the time that some system of Committees should be provided for in the Constitution.  But there were some obstacles to that.  I would suggest to the Ministers or to the President, that he should introduce some measure setting up some system of Committees like that.  The more closely the members of this Dáil are associated with the <Col N="2235" /> working of the State the healthier and better for the Minister and the country. At present we only ask questions and are getting very little information.</P>

      <P>I just heard the the last few sentences of Deputy Johnson's remarks, and I thoroughly agree with him for the first time in this Session.  I think it is right procedure that when the Estimates are presented, Ministers should survey the whole sphere of their Departments, and explain what progress has been made or is expected to be made, and state the reasons why the monies asked for are required, and to what extent they will be necessary to expedite the work of each Department. Otherwise if the procedure that has been followed in the presentation of these Estimates is adopted, the only information that is given is information that happens to rise out of any question that may be asked.  Now, there may be very important phases of a Department's work that are not at all touched by the questions that are projected at the heads of the Ministers, and therefore we are only getting a very inadequate conception of what is the nature and the scope and the condition of the work of the Department.  I would suggest simply with the idea of making a helpful suggestion, that in future when the Estimates are presented, they will not be put forward in this bald manner, leaving it to members of the Dáil to conjecture what is the meaning of this maze of figures and statistics, but that the Minister shall in presenting the Estimates explain as fully as possible in the time at his disposal the work in which his Department is engaged, and the reason why the monies he asks are demanded from the Dáil.</P>

I think explanatory memoranda would be the best thing to accompany these Estimates from each Department.  In the memoranda particulars could be given as to what has been done in the departments, and what is required.  I think that would be stepping on to the right road.  The people in the country are critical; there are <Col N="2236" /> mischievous people circulating rumours, and if they have plain figures nobody can be deceived.</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember that on introducing these Estimates, on the 6th October, I think it was, I went into some details with regard to them.  It is the first time we have produced Estimates, and it is possible that the old procedure which was in operation in the last Dáil might be considered a useful precedent to be adopted in future.  I do not much approve of that old system, which practically amounted to the Minister in charge of the Department painting the work that had been done&mdash;work in some cases, I should say, that was supposed to be done, or that he would like to have done&mdash;for the consideration of the Assembly.  I recollect some of these reports, which gave a very glowing description, and which I am positively convinced were exaggerated. Now, with regard to those Estimates, we must make up our minds sooner or later upon a definite policy, or upon the adoption of a definite line with regard to our finance.  If the Dáil were to adopt what has been suggested by some Deputies, it is quite possible that the interests of the country would not be best served.  In other words, if you take from a particular department or a particular Minister control which is direct and immediate and which must be of a tight ening character, and spread that control over a great number of shoulders, naturally the purse will not be as tightly held as if it were under the control of a single individual subject to certain regulations which he must carry out.  In the ordinary way the Estimate provides three parts, one of which is the sum involved.  As far as the Dáil is concerned if it votes a sum, the distribution, the expenditure and the correct accounting of it is distributed over a very small number of persons and the Minister for Finance for the time being must exercise considerable control over those funds.  If, on the other hand, it should happen that each Minister would be personally responsible to the Dáil it can be easily seen that the actual tight control does not operate in a case of that sort, and that the road is open for a certain looseness which is certainly very inadvisable at the starting of a new State.  Deputies ought to realise that there were various operations to be <Col N="2237" /> performed before we were in a position to produce these Estimates.  In the ordinary way the administration was to be practical until this provisional or transitory stage should pass.  In addition to that there were, as I have already explained on other occasions, not alone adjustments and arrangements and conferences, closing up of old accounts, arranging new methods and so on, but also a considerable number of visits had to be made to London to regularise matters.  There was no time at our disposal for considering this question of the best method of introducing Estimates, and I do not know if it would have been reasonably possible in the case of the majority of the Estimates to have indicated any line of policy with regard to the Minister in control.  Take, for instance, Local Government.  The Minister there has got certain regulations to attend to.  He has not, at his own sweet will, the right to say, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; with regard to the matters before him.  He is bound by laws, regulations and instructions.  The Minister for Finance is in somewhat the same position.  He can only make payments where they are regularly authorised. If there were in mind, let us say, the establishment of a new currency and so on, any alteration in a matter of that sort would be of such a magnitude as to have been impossible of completion in six or seven or nine months, and I have very little hope of being able to consider such a question in a way in which it would be possible to produce anything in a satisfactory manner within the next twelve or even eighteen months, or possibly longer.  The Dáil, I admit, has been particularly indulgent with regard to the Ministry, but I do not know that the criticisms, in so far as I have listened to them, would serve any useful purpose at this moment if the Government were to consider putting them into practice.  It has been suggested there should be a number of Committees.  I am satisfied that in the fixing up of the Constitution Ministerial control was to a very large extent in the Deputies' minds. I do think that if the setting up of Committees had been at that time in the minds of Deputies it ought to have been introduced into the Constitution.  It is unreasonable to have then indicated that Ministerial control was to have been the order of the day, and to suggest now that <Col N="2238" /> Committees should operate.  If the pressure of business continues as it has for the last few months I do say there would be scarcely any time for a Minister to attend such Committees.  The number of matters requiring attention, the amount of documents to be read, reports to be considered, the various decisions to be given, do not admit, as long as the day continues to occupy 24 hours, of any further experiment with regard to that.  You cannot have Committees of such a sort and at the same time attach responsibility to the Minister.  With regard to the particular financial control that you would have, there are only two or three systems in operation.  Our minds have turned towards the one which has been described as the most perfect.  We are operating on that line. I expect if it be found unsuccessful or unsuitable in this country it will be altered, but I am not now in a position to indicate any great extension on the information that has been supplied by Deputies, until the Ministers have had a good deal more experience of their offices.  Some of the Ministers are in the particular offices which they occupy two or three months only; they were absolutely new to the work, and some of them were unacquainted with the officers in charge of the departments. We must remember this is a legislative assembly, and if the Dáil has to be concerned with so many matters requiring attention by the Legislature, and if the attendance of Ministers here be considered an essential in that connection, and I believe it is, it would be unreasonable to expect Ministers to be in such direct touch with the ordinary operations of their Departments as to submit reports regarding the conduct of these Departments and the policy that is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say that the Ministry has quite misunderstood the import of my remarks. At any rate I am not suggesting any devolution of responsibility from the Minister.  I am suggesting that the Dáil is to have information, if it is to be confided in, as regards the working of the Ministry.  The Minister in introducing a request that the Dáil should vote for his administration a certain sum of money, should give that Dáil some information as to what the money <Col N="2239" /> is for and not a mere bald statement that salaries cost so many thousand pounds. We, at least, should be taken into the confidence of the Minister, when we are asked to vote a certain sum of money, and as I said in the opening of this contention, I am not pressing the matter of criticism with regard to the present presentation, but I hope it will not be taken as a precedent of the future.  The Minister has said that it is not considered possible for the Ministers who were recently placed in charge of particular departments to deal with those matters in the full way that we ask.  That may be so, but it is infinitely more difficult for the Minister for Finance to do so.  He introduced these Estimates and asks for a blank cheque, without any indication of what the intention of the Minister is.  I foresee, unless something like what I am contending for is done, some future Parliament will say: I am not going to give you any more money until you tell us what it is for, and that is the only cure.  The whole object of the presentation of Estimates is to enable the Dáil to be in possession of the policy of the Ministry; otherwise, it has simply to be a case of extraction by force; that is certainly not desirable.</P>

      <P>There are rather more than 20 Estimates to come before this Dáil yet.  May I suggest to you that a procedure worth considering would be that these should be taken henceforward, not necessarily in the order in which they stand here but in departments.  That is to say all estimates affecting the department of one Minister should be taken together.  The Minister need not be here all the time, but while those Estimates were under discussion in the Dáil in Committee, the Minister should be present to meet every criticism made.  Each Minister should be here for just that section of the Estimates that deals with the Votes under his general department.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That inasmuch as the attendance of children at school has of late been notoriously irregular, and as the present compulsory attendance law has proved to be inadequate to deal with the situation thus created, it is the desire of this Dáil that the Compulsory Attendance Clauses of the Irish Education Act, 1892, should, at the earliest available opportunity, be amended, so as to provide, among other things:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  That the Act shall apply to the whole area within the jurisdiction of the Free State.</P>
      <P>(b)  That parents or guardians should be required to cause their children between the ages of six and fourteen years to attend a National or other efficient school on every day in which the school is in operation, except in case of illness or other reasonable cause, or where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Ministry of Education that the child is receiving instruction in some other manner.</P>
      <P>(c)  That no child who is under the age of fourteen years shall be employed for hire or shall be allowed to engage in street trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2245" /> (d)  That the Dublin Metropolitan Police and Civic Guards shall perform all the duties of School Attendance Officers.</P>
    <P>(e)  That the distance which would excuse non-attendance be raised to three miles in the case of children of 10 years and over, and that distance be measured by nearest public path as well as by nearest road.</P>
    <P>(f)  That the procedure of &ldquo;Attendance Order&rdquo; shall be abolished; defaulting parents to be prosecuted after due warning.</P>
    <P>(g)  That the fines inflicted for noncompliance with the provisions of this Act be increased from forty shillings to five pounds in the case of the employer, and from five shillings to forty shillings in the case of parents or guardians.</P>
    <P>(h)  That power be given to the Court to commit to Industrial or Reformatory Schools refractory pupils who are out of their parents' or guardians' control, and in whose cases fines had been inflicted on three separate occasions.</P>
    <P>(i)  That an annual census be made by the School Attendance Committee of the children within its area who are within the prescribed limits of age.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am grateful to you for having made the suggestion and to the Dáil for having adopted it, because I can appreciate while it is possible that there is general agreement as to the subject of the motion, there might be difference of opinion regarding the detailed clauses.  I believe that in moving a question of this kind we should remember that this is one of the questions&mdash; there are few such perhaps in Ireland&mdash; but this is certainly one of them that is not regarded and which I hope will not be regarded as a party matter.  Education is above party and beyond party, and I believe the position is, and I hope it will long remain so, that all of us, no matter what party we belong to are anxious to do what we consider best in the interests of the State, and in the interests of our country.</P>
    <P>Now, I propose in this resolution to show that, as the resolution states, the attendance at school has lately been notoriously irregular.  And I need not spend any time in impressing on the <Col N="2246" /> members of this Dáil that if effective work is to be done in our schools a regular attendance of the pupils is absolutely necessary, I am pleased to say that at the present time very great efforts indeed are being made by the new educational authorities to lay the foundations of what we all hope to see in the near future&mdash;a Gaelic State.  They have made regulations for the introduction of the teaching of the Irish language into the schools.  They have made regulations by which teachers are being prepared to carry out that work, and the teachers and the educational authorities are cooperating, as far as possible, in carrying on this work.  But no matter how good a programme you may have, or how suitable it may be, no matter how good the intention of the education authorities may be, or how enthusiastic the teachers may be, their efforts will be quite useless unless the children are there to be taught. Now, there is no shadow of a doubt that the attendance at schools has lately been irregular.  Statistics are there to prove it, and I hope to give you some figures showing that.  I have here the latest available reports of the English Board of Education, and the figures showing the percentage of attendance.  The percentages of attendances are given for four successive years.  They are 89 per cent and the last year is 90 per cent. In Scotland the figures are 86 per cent. I understand that in such countries as Japan, the United States, Germany and one or two other countries, the percentage of attendance is always something in the nineties.  In this country, according to the latest figures which are available, the percentage of attendance at our National schools is 68.9 per cent. That is a very considerable difference. Now I would like to put this thing in another way.  It is estimated&mdash;I think it is on the whole a fair estimate&mdash;that roughly about 19 or 20 per cent. of the population of the country would be of school-going age, and if we take that for the whole country, because we have not the figures except for the whole country, and any figures that I am giving apply to the whole country, and that does not affect my argument inasmuch as the conditions are the same North and South&mdash;practically so; that would mean that, roughly speaking, there are 900,000 children of school-going age in the country.  Statistics show that 700,000 <Col N="2247" /> are on the rolls of the National schools. And, taking into account the other schools, such as the Christian Brothers' schools, and making due allowance for those attending the primary departments of secondary schools, that would be, roughly, another 30,000.  That means that 730,000 of the 900,000 children are on the rolls, are attending some particular schools.  Now the figures of attendance are that, out of 700,000, 500,000 are at school on any particular day throughout the year.  The percentage would be higher in the case of the other schools, but allowing, say, 75 or 80 per cent. of attendance in the other cases, it would mean that 23,000 of these would be there.  That shows that we have 730,000 children attending schools on the rolls, but the average daily attendance would be 523,000, and if we add to these the number of children who are not on the rolls of any school and which, from the figures I have given, would be 170,000, we find that you have this remarkable position&mdash;that 277,000 children are at home from school who should be in school.  These children are at home every day in the year.  That is what it means.  Now, attention has been called to this position from time to time during the last three or four or five years especially, and it is rather a remarkable thing that the public generally do not seem to have attached the importance that they should to this phase of the life of our country.  The Commissioners of National Education, who are specially concerned with administration of education, deal with this matter during the last two or three years or in the last two or three Reports.  In the Reports for 1917-18 they write as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Early in 1918 we had again under consideration the question of amending the Compulsory Attendance Clauses of the Irish Education Act, 1892, and we have made strong representations to the Irish Government on the necessity of stringent alterations in the Act which are urgently required if a long-needed improvement in the attendance is to be secured.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the year 1918 they again referred to the matter in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As stated in our last Annual Report, we made representations to the Irish Government in 1918 with a view to securing certain amendments in the statutes relating to school attendance, and our proposals have been embodied <Col N="2248" /> in the Education (Ireland) Bill recently presented to Parliament.  Until legislation on the lines suggested by us is enacted there is little probability of any substantial increase in the regularity of attendance at the national schools.  How great is the need for improvement will be seen from the fact that while there are about 700,000 pupils enrolled in the schools only about 500,000 of these are in average daily attendance, so that there are upwards of 200,000 children absent from school every day of the year.  Returns of the Scottish Education Department show that while there were in the year ended 30th April, 1919, 877,016 pupils enrolled in Scottish State-aided schools, 755, 732, or 86.2 per cent., were in average daily attendance.  In no school district in Scotland is the percentage of attendance less than 82.9, which is the figure for the Orkney Islands.  It appears then that although the population of Scotland is not much in excess of that of Ireland, there are almost half as many more children in attendance at the schools of the former country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And in their last available report they speak again.  They say that &ldquo;The law of Compulsory School Attendance to which we have so frequently referred in our recent reports still remains unamended, and we anticipate little improvements until this is done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago a very representative committee was set up to survey the whole field of education so far as it related to primary education It was presided over by Lord Killanin, who was a Commissioner of National Education, and amongst its members were Most Rev. Dr. O'Donnell, Bishop of Raphoe; Dean Macken of Tuam and now of Claremorris; representatives of the teaching profession, and some representative laymen also.  That committee considered this question of attendance, and made recommendations which I may say, and as I hope to point out later on, are embodied in this resolution which I propose.  Last year a representative committee was appointed under the auspices of Dáil Eireann to prepare or draft a National programme.  The Committee consisted of representatives of Aireacht an Oideachais of the General Council of County Councils, the Gaelic League, the National Labour Executive, Secondary Teachers' Association, and the Irish <Col N="2249" /> National Teachers' Organisation.  Having drafted and framed their programme they decided to call attention to the position of school attendance, and this is the recommendation which this National Committee gave in its report: &ldquo;The Conference desire to direct special attention to the question of school attendance.  A child who attends school irregularly, not only fails to make progress himself; he acts as a clog on the class as a whole, and thus hampers the progress of his classmates.  No matter how suitable the programme or how efficient or enthusiastic the teacher the instruction cannot be effective unless the pupils attend regularly.  The statistics with regard to school attendance in Ireland disclose a lamentable and indeed discreditable condition of affairs.&rdquo; It goes on to quote the statistics which I have given you and which I do not wish to repeat.  It says again, &ldquo;The average leaving age is 11 years. The Conference strongly recommends that all children between the ages of 5 and 14 should attend school daily; it further recommends that as soon as practicable legislation should be introduced to remedy the present deplorable state of affairs.&rdquo; The last body that had this question under consideration was the Ard Fheis of the Gaelic League, which met last week and passed a resolution calling special attention to the position of school attendance, and asking that a law should be enacted at an early date to meet a situation that is created by this deplorably irregular attendance. Now I think I have said sufficient to prove that the attendance is undoubtedly irregular.  I think it is only fair to say in this connection, that very great credit is due to the clergy in the majority of cases, who did and are doing their best to see that the children do attend school regularly.  That applies to the majority of them and I think it is only right that it should be stated.  If we want to remedy this state of affairs, what has been found necessary to deal with it in other countries&mdash;in all progressive countries&mdash;must be adopted in this country, and that is a proper and effective scheme of compulsory attendance. So great is the importance which many of the newly established republics in Europe attach to this question of attendance that they have inserted it in their Constitution as a fundamental <Col N="2250" /> principle, that education should be compulsory. Some of us hoped that it would be inserted in our Constitution, but we did not succeed in getting it. However, it can be dealt with by legislation, and it is to express the desire of this Dáil that such legislation should be introduced as soon as possible that I propose this resolution.  The present compulsory law, such as it is, has proved a failure.  The very facts I have stated show that it is a failure, and from the history of it it could be hardly anything else.  It was introduced thirty years ago at a time when the general view of the people with regard to the usefulness of education on the whole, and especially with regard to the rights of the child, and the employment and exploitation of child labour, were very different from that they are now Things have moved forward a good deal in the last thirty years, but even then the Act met with a very considerable amount of opposition in certain quarters in Ireland, because of the suspicion which attached, and possibly very rightly attached, to all attempts made by a foreign Government to introduce educational reform or measures of educational reform into this country.  The result of that opposition was that the Act, such as it was when introduced, was left almost worthless, there were so many loopholes in it, so many ways of getting out of it, that it was found to be practically useless for the purpose for which it was intended.  In face of what I have said I think the only way to meet the situation is to have the law that exists at present with regard to school attendance amended.  The Killanin Committee that I spoke of a moment ago recommended the amendment of this Act, and I notice that a Committee which some time ago was appointed to survey the educational position in the Northern area makes practically the same recommendations as were made by the Killanin Committee showing that in some things, at any rate, North and South are in agreement.  About this time last year the then Minister for Education in Dáil Eireann had this matter under consideration and he was considering whether or not a Decree of the Dáil could be secured to put this recommendation of the Committee into operation.  Well, the Treaty came then, and the Treaty debates, and there was no opportunity <Col N="2251" /> to do so up to this.  This is the first opportunity we have had and I trust that the Dáil will take advantage of this opportunity to pass this resolution and so send it with a strong recommendation to the Government to frame legislation along these lines on the first available occasion.  I now formally propose that the principle of the resolution be adopted.  It does not bind Deputies, as An Ceann Comhairle has explained, to agree with all the details of these clauses. I formally move it and I trust the Dáil will adopt the principle which is embodied in the resolution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution has absolutely my entire sympathy.  I quite realise the necessity for amending the Compulsory Education Act as it stands.  As a matter of fact this question was before the Ministry from its very start&mdash;from the day the Provisional Government was formed.  I had several communications &mdash;amongst others, from Mr. O'Connell himself&mdash;from people in Cork and from others with regard to it.  As a matter of fact, the Cork people led the way with regard to this Act.  Under the old Court system the Committee there took it on themselves to amend this Act for the City of Cork.  And with striking effects.  The average attendance was raised from something about 70 per cent. to close on 90&mdash;or near it&mdash;in a very short time.  A question, therefore, arises right away.  There is the question of providing accommodation for children who are not now attending school.  Of course, I quite agree that accommodation must be provided.  Still, it is one of the things you have to consider, and will have to be prepared for before you actually make this law.  There are a few items down along that will, I am sure, be a bit contentious, and (c) in particular. <Col N="2252" /> Mr. O'Connell also referred particularly to the clause &ldquo;that no child who is under the age of 14 years shall be employed for hire, or shall be allowed to engage in street trading.&rdquo; I think myself that if you had ideal conditions that would be very good, but at the moment I am afraid you would be hitting the very poorest if you took it on your self to enforce anything like that without very careful consideration and discussion. I also agree in principle&mdash;I do not know how it is going to work out &mdash;with (d), &ldquo;that the work of enforcing school attendance should be a matter for the police.&rdquo; They would be far more effective than the persons who were appointed by public bodies heretofore, who were very easily got at.  These persons were dependent, perhaps, for the retention of their positions on the representative in the Corporation or Rural District Council, who represented the district locally.  When the parent was brought up he got at his representative and the representative got at the School Attendance Officer.  That was how it worked out in practice.  That could be avoided, I think, by the principle of getting the police to enforce the school attendance order.  With (f) everybody who knows anything at all about the Act will be in entire agreement.  What was called the Compulsory Order has made a joke of the whole Compulsory Education Act.  A person was brought up, and there was no penalty, no matter how long the child was away from school, until there was, first of all, an order for the parent to send his child to school.  If he did not obey that Order a small fine might be imposed, and once that fine was inflicted there was a period of six months again before the child could be brought up, so that really the Compulsory Attendance Education Act itself was a joke.  So far as the Ministry is concerned I think I know their feelings, and I think it is the intention of the Government to remedy that at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell in moving the resolution has pointed out that its approval by the Dáil does not commit one to any of its details, and, personally, I am glad of that, but I would take this opportunity to discuss that detail which the Minister for Education has referred to.  Paragraph <Col N="2253" /><i>(d)</i> says: &ldquo;that the Dublin Metropolitan Police and Civic Guards shall perform all the duties of School Attendance Officers.&rdquo; Now, I would like to be satisfied before that be formally adopted, that the idea of the civilian committee, with its implied civilian officer had definitely failed, and I feel that for a variety of reasons.  For one thing it is gratifying that the bulk of the adult population of the country has shown by its welcome to the Civic Guard that it realises the fundamental change that has taken place in the administration of the country.  Whether the child-mind will so readily grasp it or not is another matter, and it might be a bad thing to put police on that particular work, because of the traditional attitude of the people to the police.  That attitude, as I say, has changed in the case of the more sensible of the adult population, but it may not yet have changed to the same extent with the children, and the change is not likely to be helped or expedited if you put police on this work, which, human nature being what it is, will be unpopular with the children.  That is something to consider&mdash;first of all, whether it is going to help the object, whether it is going to help the school attendance, to use the uniformed officials of the Government; secondly, whether it is wise to use them in work that will throw the child-mind to a greater or lesser extent in antagonism to them.  The boy who prides himself in youth on his dexterity in evading the policeman in the matter of mitching from school, as it is called, may turn out a very clever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very clever and dangerous criminal in his more advanced years.  Certainly the earlier impressions that his mind forms, and the attitude that he takes up to the officers of the law in his youth, may colour his whole outlook on life and may affect his career when he grows up.  After all, this question of school attendance is a vital question to the community, and it is a thing which, if the community realises it, should be dealt with almost spontaneously, almost without State help, in self-defence, so to speak, and to prevent the results which follow from any great breach.  On that matter of school attendance, it is not too much to ask that a local Committee of each parish <Col N="2254" /> or school area would undertake it, and pay a yearly sum to an officer to carry out the duties of school attendance officer, and if the officer has failed in the past and has not carried out his duty more fully the local committee rather than the officer is, generally speaking, at fault, because generally when there is negligence or incompetence on the part of an employee the fault may lie, and in most cases it does lie, more at the head than with the paid servant.  If the school attendance officers through the country have neglected their work it is because the attitude of the Committee encouraged them in the belief that they could neglect their work with immunity. I would hesitate to accept the view that it is wise or right to employ the uniformed officers of the Government on that particular matter.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Connell will consider that I had made a case against it or not, but I would ask him to weigh well the possible consequences to the community and to society by allowing the youth of the country to form impressions hostile to the police and hostile to what the police stand for, that may recoil seriously later on.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a word in support of what is put forward, the principle of which probably every member accepts, that education shall be compulsory.  Everybody who knows anything about education has been interested in this question for a long time.  I think it should not be discussed now in detail, for not alone shall we have to go over the same ground again when the Bill comes forward, and this is of some little importance, but, apart from that, it is difficult to express an opinion about these isolated clauses, unless you have the Bill before you.  I think we should be not merely wasting time but perhaps expressing opinions which we should like to modify when we see the actual Bill.  If you go into the clauses now there will be considerable discussion about them, because on several of them people may not agree. I agree, for instance, with the Minister for Home Affairs that certain duties should not be done by the Civic Guard or the Police, but by the School Attendance Committee.  I give that point merely in reference to one clause, merely as an instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a surprise to hear that there is universal agreement as to the principle of compulsory education.  When only a few weeks ago Deputy O'Connell and I had the audacity to defend compulsory education we were voted down and not only that, but a leading article in one of the leading newspapers was devoted to us to prove what a poor conception of liberty we entertained, how unenlightened <Col N="2256" /> we were as to the claims of the individual citizen to be allowed to go his own way uninterfered with by perverse legislators. The Minister for Education, who unfortunately is absent, is absolutely opposed to compulsory education.  He claims for the parent the right to do with his child what seems best to himself, and if he has money enough for the purpose, to provide education for his child so that he shall be kept away from the contaminating social influences which the ordinary State school or the Christian Brothers' school might subject him to. I think that if the Minister for Education was here he would admit that what I am quoting is an expression of his own views on this matter.  It may be that these arguments were used against introducing the principle of compulsory Education into the Constitution.  If so the argument should have been expressed as an <i>ad hoc</i> argument.  I quite recognise that the very large vote that was against our proposal was cast, not against compulsory education as a principle, but against the way in which the resolution was worded, which seemed as if we were demanding attendance at the State School for every child in the country.  I know that that is so.  At the same time, at any rate, I feel as Heaven is reputed to feel; there is more joy in Heaven over one sinner that repents than for ninety-nine just men.  It is quite gratifying to know now that our legislation is in favour of securing an educated community in the future.  There are a great number of things in this resolution which are intended to be a guide to whoever is framing the Educational Code.  There is one which deals with what has always been regarded as a physical difficulty in the way of introducing Compulsory Education in Ireland, <i>i.e.</i>, the remoteness in many districts of the school from the home.  Some children have to go a long, long distance, sometimes barefooted and barelegged, badly clothed in very inclement weather, and I am quite sure that the prevalence of tuberculosis in the country is largely due to the fact that attendance has to be made in badly ventilated, badly heated schools, by children who arrive there imperfectly clad, and sometimes absolutely wet through, and there is no facility for drying their clothes or getting them the protection which their tender years require under those unhappy <Col N="2257" /> physical conditions.  Now many, many years ago I had an opportunity of meeting a great number of Clerical Managers of schools and I proposed to them a plan which was afterwards adopted in Alberta, and Saskatchewan, in Canada, and which operated very effectively.  That was to provide not, as some people might expect, such a provision as a larger number of schools, but, on the contrary, to reduce the number of small schools, replace them by large, central and well-equipped schools, and send out each day a motor 'bus, or something of the kind, to collect the children from outlying districts and deliver them, dry shod and happy, in the schools without physical fatigue; if necessary even to provide them with breakfast before the school day began, so that the teacher should have the most receptive material for his work.  That has been objected to on the ground of expense.  It is cheaper to pay dispensary doctors and to keep up workhouses and hospitals and collect statistics of tuberculosis and the average death-rate for children.  That is cheaper and a more congenial way of expending public funds than to secure reforms that other countries can see the advantage of. I need not dwell on the educational advantage there would be in having one great school, properly manned and properly equipped, instead of a large number of schools with irregular attendance and indifferent teaching.  We are really working on a most uneconomical basis and the only thing I dislike, or at least the main thing that I dislike in this resolution, is that it should appear that Deputy O'Connell is complacently disposed towards the existing state of affairs.  I should expect him to be more of an iconoclast and to call upon you to replace practically everything, because there is very little in the machinery of primary education working heretofore that has not been inherently bad.  As regards Clause <i>(c)</i>, &ldquo;That parents or guardians should be required to cause their children between the ages of six and fourteen years to attend a National School,&rdquo; I wonder are the Deputies aware that if they pass a regulation like this they must be prepared to face an angry multitude of teachers, for not all the teachers are so enlightened as their representative in this Dáil.  A little while ago, when I was a member of the National Board, <Col N="2258" /> it was suggested that a great amount of public funds could be saved by insisting on the withdrawal of children under the age of five or six years, because the removal of such children from the schools would remove also from the employment of the Board a large number of teachers. Some Deputies, possibly, are not aware that a continuance of the teacher in his employment depends upon the average attendance in his school, so if you remove children up to the age of five or six years from certain schools in some districts you bring down the average permanently and the teacher must go. Therefore I ask you, when you give your consent to this proposal, which is educationally sound, that you should be prepared to face the consequences of it and see that the teachers are not penalised. As regards the question of the employment of children, I have been provided with the Bye-laws&mdash;&mdash;.</P>

      <P>My object in putting in these definite clauses is this: These are matters that to the members of the Dáil are rather technical.  Deputies may not be acquainted with them, and some have confessed they are not.  I had hoped by a discussion at this stage&mdash;it should not be more than a discussion, for I quite recognise it does not mean legislation&mdash; it would serve a useful purpose, and would expedite matters very considerably when the Bill would come to be proposed.  I had another object in view. I thought it rather necessary, in view of some of the things to which Deputy Professor Magennis has alluded, that I should put down my views so as to show that they were not quite so revolutionary as some parties were anxious to make out.  I recognise there are some of these clauses on which there would be diversity of opinion.  I am quite certain on some of them there would be diversity of opinion, even among my own colleagues on these benches, and even perhaps among members of my own organisation. I would like to say all of the clauses, with the exception of <i>(d)</i>, are practically in substance recommendations of Commissions which have considered this particular Act, and this question of compulsory attendance.  It is usual, of course, when we want to amend any Act or introduce new legislation, to set up a Commission.  There will be no need <Col N="2260" /> for a Commission for this particular item. There may be need for a Commission on the general question.  For this item we have already got recommendations from Commissions.  With the exception of <i>(d)</i>, there is nothing new.  If it will meet with the approval of the Dáil I will be prepared to propose the resolution as it stands, down to the word &ldquo;amended&rdquo; in the preamble.  That contains the principle and expresses the desire of the Dáil that the Act should be amended at the earliest opportunity.  I would like to point out that these clauses are only some of the things I would like to see in the Act. These are the things which are most urgent, and which, in view of the reports to the Commissions to which I have referred, would be likely to meet with the greatest measure of agreement.  I would like to say a word or two as to why I considered it necessary or advisable to put down clause <i>(d).</i>  If the only effect-of it was to secure the two opinions which we have got from the Ministerial Bench, one in favour and the other against, I think it has served a useful purpose.  It is quite possible if members spoke from these Benches we would also have a diversity of opinion on clause <i>(d).</i> Personally, I believe very good arguments could be advanced in favour of it, because one of the reasons why the Compulsory Attendance Act was not universally adopted was on the score of expense. I do not think it would be too much to expect that, in rural districts especially, the Civic Guard would in each station set aside one or two officers to deal with this particular legislation, and to see that the law in this case was enforced.  After all, we are not sending the Civic Guard out to be popular with the people.  They have to maintain the law.  If their object was to be popular of course they would get orders not to enforce any laws, but perhaps to organise dances, parties and concerts.  They would be quite popular if they confined their duties to that.  They are sent out, and are well paid by the State, to see that the laws of the State are carried out and maintained. I think the argument put up by the Minister for Home Affairs that the children would form a certain opinion with regard to the police, that it might not be advisable for them to get, could equally be used with regard to the schoolmaster.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I did not suggest that they should not be employed because it was an unpopular task.  I suggested it was inadvisable to use them on that particular task before children had come to an age when they could reason out things, because it would throw the child mind into antagonism with the police, and that antagonism might survive at a later age.</P>

I am glad to have the opportunity of raising the matter and pointing to it as a possible way in which to administer the School Attendance Act.  With permission, I shall withdraw my present motion.

      <P>Deputy Johnson proposes to raise a question on the adjournment in regard to the announcement in the evening newspaper respecting the execution of four men this morning found in possession of revolvers. I got the notice rather late, but I communicated <Col N="2262" /> with the Minister for Defence immediately.  The question can now be raised on the Order of the Day for the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a newspaper placed in my hands about half-an-hour ago and it contains something that will shock everyone who reads it, namely, that this morning four men have been executed, presumably under the authorisation that the Dáil gave to the Military Courts some time ago.  The offence, as recorded in the announcement, was the possession without proper authority of a revolver in one case, and indeed I think it is the same in each case.  I say it is with something of a shock that one reads such an announcement, and I am raising the question now in the hope that we shall have some more satisfactory explanation as to why four men should have forfeited their lives, or have their lives taken by the military authorities, for the offence of having a revolver.  We know the circumstances of the country; we know what is the trouble in the country, and we know all the arguments that were adduced when we were asked to give authority for the setting up of these Military Courts.  We were told&mdash;we need not have been told, because we were aware, sad to say&mdash;of the many cases of depredation, destruction and murder, and one of the offences that was set out in the orders was &ldquo;looting, arson, destruction, seizure, unlawful possession or removal of, or damage to any public or private property&rdquo; and the third was &ldquo;having possession without proper authority of any bomb or article in the nature of a bomb, or any dynamite, gelignite, or other explosive substance, or any revolver, rifle, gun or other firearm or lethal weapon, or any ammunition for such firearm.&rdquo; The clause went on to speak of the offence of taking part in or aiding or abetting any attack upon, or using force against, the National Forces, but the third of these offences is that of having possession of any revolver without authority.  Now it is two months ago, or nearly so, since these orders were passed, and the first information we get of the trial and sentence of any person under these orders and Military Courts is that of the four men who have been sentenced and executed, and after their execution <Col N="2263" /> we are informed of the fact that four men have been executed for the unlawful possession&mdash;that is, possession without authority&mdash;of revolvers. That is the bald way this announcement is given to the people, and unless there is some very much fuller explanation and justification for the execution of four men contained in that bald announcement I prophesy a deep revulsion of feeling against the Army and against the Government.  I cannot believe that that announcement states facts which would justify the execution of these men.  The possession of a revolver does not justify the execution of a man, lawfully or unlawfully, and no one, I believe, despite the decision of the Dáil, and no one in this Dáil, in his heart of hearts, believes that the possession of a revolver warrants the execution of the man or the woman who possessed it. I think we have the right to ask whether the promise that was given that, in the trial of these men they would be represented by any legal aid was carried out, and whether they were offered the opportunity to have legal assistance, and whether they were entitled or allowed to call, and whether they did call, any witnesses.  I think the country will demand that more information in regard to the circumstances of the trial, the nature of the offence, and the circumstances surrounding the offence, should be dealt with and made known.  It is lamentable, I think, that the announcement of the trial and execution of these men should go out in that bald form as if we were recording the arrival of a visitor from some other country in the <i>Official Gazette.</i>  It is not fair to the country; it is not fair to the expectations of the people, and it is not fair to this Dáil that a mere bald statement of that character should be made that four men have been tried and found guilty and executed for the possession of a revolver in this way.  Some fuller explanation of the circumstances, I say, are needed if the authorities responsible are to be able to justify their action to the public of this country.</P>

      <P>Anything that will shock the country into realisation of what a grave thing it is to take human life is justified at the moment.  The news of men executed in Dublin this morning, <Col N="2264" /> no doubt will shock people and people will regret it, but it has shocked us and we regret that we have had to face the responsibility of dealing with the situation that calls for measures as plain and as drastic as those measures.  The men who were executed this morning in Dublin, were found on the streets of Dublin at night, carrying loaded revolvers, and waiting to take the lives of other men, and that is the simple case that we have to put before the country for taking the action in accordance with the recommendations that were made here.  It was because those men were found under such circumstances, with such intent, that it was necessary to execute them here this morning.  It is the old story: &ldquo;Fuiligeann fuil, fuil den ghorta ach ní fhuiligeann fuil, fuil á dhorta.&rdquo; Blood will suffer blood to die in hunger, but blood will not suffer blood to be spilled. We have got to the stage here in Ireland when we will suffer blood to be spilled, if it is spilled hotly and we find now that we are shocked because blood has to be spilled in cold blood.  We are faced with eradicating from the country the state of affairs in which hundreds of men go around day by day and night by night, to take the lives of other men.  We have people in the country proclaiming that their aim and their object, the immediate aim and object before them, is to unite the people of Ireland, and the way they do it is they put arms into the hands of young men and middle-aged men and they send them out to take the lives of other Irishmen, and there are people in the country who, with the proclaimed aim of bringing the English back, take the very same line of action.  There are people who take it to themselves and to their immediate neighbours and comrades to settle the difficulty of land acquisition, if not land purchase, in Ireland, and their policy is, as disclosed in their orders to subordinate officers, &ldquo;Give him a bullet,&rdquo; and we are faced with dealing with a proposition like that.  We have lost during the last three or four or five years, comrades that were very dear to us, citizens of our country, and we have lost them in circumstances in which perhaps some of them and some of us did not feel that they stood upon as sure and safe a ground, morally and politically, as we to-day feel we stand on. <Col N="2265" /> Throw your minds back to November, 1920, or December, 1920, or any of those months in which we were losing the Kevin Barrys, the Traolac MacSwineys, and the Dick Mackees, and see what was the kernel of strength that our country then had when facing the struggle she was then facing and to maintain a struggle and to hold together the small machinery which was pitting itself against England then?  And ask yourself, had people who shouldered that responsibility then more justification for losing their Kevin Barrys and their Traolac MacSwineys in an effort to save and release their country from bondage, than we have now for endeavouring to save our country from the dangers that can very easily envelop it from outside and inside.  People have to be shocked and people have to take stern measures, and we are absolutely convinced as a Government that unless we take and deal in the strongest possible way with those people who traverse our streets at night, shooting down our people, and going around our country day by day, wrecking our railways, robbing our people, taking their lives, destroying the whole fabric of industry and society in this country&mdash;unless we take very stern measures, we will not throw back the tide of lawlessness and the tide of lust and loot that some mad political leaders have stirred up in their train in this country.  The situation in which these actions were taken is known to every person here and is thoroughly realised by every person in the country, and anybody who goes around with a loaded revolver in his pocket on the street seeking to take the lives of other men must be made face the fact that by doing so he forfeits his own life.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that Deputy Johnson, in raising this matter, dealt particularly with the bald announcement that had been made that these men were executed for having possession of a revolver.  No particulars of any kind were given in addition to that fact.  We think if the facts are as the Minister for Defence has stated&mdash;and, of course, we fully accept that statement&mdash; that, in justice to everyone they should have been published at the same time as was the announcement of the act to the public.  Deputies will remember&mdash;I think I am correct in saying that the first execution of the war opened in 1919 or <Col N="2266" /> 1920, was of a certain Irishman in Cork prison for the possession of firearms; and whatever feeling there may be that persons taken in open warfare&mdash;&ldquo;people who draw the sword shall perish by the sword&rdquo;&mdash;there was certainly an immense shock at that time that the mere possession of arms should have warranted the death penalty, and that was the feeling we had when Deputy Johnson raised this matter.  We think, in justice to everybody, that a statement such as the Minister for Defence has made, should have been made when this awful announcement was given to the public.</P>

      <P>In the few remarks I desire to make, I wish to say I do not agree with the statement made by the Minister for Defence, because when he says these men were caught on the street with a revolver that does not prove them guilty, or prove that they pulled a trigger and killed any of his men. Before they were sentenced I think they ought to have got a public trial, and I would like to know whether these men were allowed to get legal aid, and to call in any solicitor.  The first news we have about it is what is published in the public press this afternoon, and, surely, the Government that the Irish people have been waiting for the last seven and a half centuries ought not to act as harshly as if there was a continuation of the war with the British.  I suppose the next Act that will be brought in will be to provide that if an unfortunate individual is found with a bullet in his pocket he will be executed, even if he never had a revolver. (A Deputy.&mdash;Oh!)  You can say &ldquo;oh,&rdquo; if you like, but these are the real facts, and, as a man returned by the people to this Dáil, I say if you have a charge against a man, you must either prove him guilty or give him a chance of showing he is innocent before you have a right to sentence him. Now, for example, take this particular case here: &ldquo;Peter Cassidy, tried by Military Court held on the 9th November, 1922, charged with being in possession of a revolver without proper authority on the 27th October, 1922, was found guilty on the charge and sentenced to death. The finding of the sentence of the Court was confirmed and the sentence duly carried out this morning at seven o'clock.&rdquo; Now, is that sufficient explanation to offer this Dáil?  We have not been told anything whatever about <Col N="2267" /> these charges, and we do not know, or the Minister has not stated, whether those men charged were allowed to get legal aid, or were witnesses called to prove their innocence.  And I think that this Dáil expects a more solid statement from the Minister for Defence than the one he has already uttered, and I challenge the Minister to give a straightforward answer here&mdash;as to whether these defendants were allowed the aid of a solicitor in order to prove their innocence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>One should consider the end in view when the State and the Government, acting in the name of the people, take such action as was taken at seven o'clock this morning.  One should consider whether punishment is vindictive in its object or deterrent in its object.  That particular punishment was not vindictive.  Somehow capital punishment would be strikingly futile if it were merely vindictive in its object. It would defeat its own end to a very large extent, but that punishment was deterrent.  It was taken because it was necessary to take action of that kind if this Nation is to live, and it was taken in the hope of deterring those who are killing the Nation.  The Nation's life is worth the lives of many individuals. And if this were merely an average case it may perhaps have been because it was better at first to take the average case, to take the cases which had nothing particular, no particular facts about them to distinguish them from the cases of thousands all over the country who are leading the Nation to death. If you took as your first case some man who was outstandingly active or outstandingly wicked in his activities the unfortunate dupes through the country might say, &ldquo;Oh, he was killed because he was a leader,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He was killed because he was an Englishman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He was killed because he combined with others to commit rape.&rdquo; It was better in my opinion, wiser in my opinion, more calculated to achieve the object, to achieve the deterrent object, to take simply the plain or ordinary case of the men who go out with arms to kill their fellow-countrymen, refusing to recognise the ordinary basic principle upon which civilised Government rests everywhere, refusing to recognise the sovereignty of <Col N="2268" /> the majority will of this Nation.  And let no man think that we took action of this kind impetuously; and let no man think that we took action of this kind vindictively or in hot blood.  The contrary stands proved.  Since last December we entreated, coaxed and compromised, and went beyond the safety line in compromising in the hope of adverting this disaster of civil strife.  And all the time the words on the lips of those who stood against us were &ldquo;Is your Treaty worth civil war&rdquo;?  There is something greater than the Treaty at stake here.  The life of the Irish Nation as a Nation, the life of the Irish Nation as a democratic organism, is at stake. The whole question as to whether it is to be a Nation in the future governed by constitutional principles, or whether it is to be a mob dictated to by an armed minority was at stake.  There is a point beyond which we could not coax or compromise. The point came at which it became necessary to strike to save the life of the Nation.  And only then we struck.  Only when it was clear that there could be no peace; only when it was clear that when the political leader had gained his political advantage his military associates were free to dishonour him by denying the price.  Then we struck.  And even after striking we tried simply to wear these men out, we tried to show them the futility, the wantonness, and the waywardness of the whole thing, and we tried to conduct this fight with a minimum expenditure of human life on both sides.  And what has happened?  Mr. de Valera who started, as I said yesterday, with the words, &ldquo;There is a constitutional method of settling our differences, in God's name let us not depart from it.&rdquo; Mr. de Valera has been busy tying more kettles to his tail.  The President he is! The head of a Council of State, and of a Government!  &ldquo;The principles he stands for are by their very nature irreducible and incapable of compromise.&rdquo; Well, this Nation must live.  We have been elected to this Dáil as the Government of it.  We have a tremendous responsibility. If we fail to live up to these responsibilities and to act up to these responsibilities, the children of Ireland in the future would raise their hands and curse us.  There was just one alternative to the policy we are now carrying out&mdash;and one alternative to the kind of act that took place this morning <Col N="2269" /> at seven o'clock, and that is to abdicate; and to say to the British signatories to that Treaty &ldquo;we are not able to carry it out,&rdquo; and to let this country go down in dishonour and futility.  Five Plenipotentiaries signed the Treaty last December, they brought it home, the Dáil passed it, the people accepted it.  We are the Provisional Transitional Government set up pending the formal coming into existence of Saorstát Eireann.  We speak the authentic voice of the people of Ireland.  And if we are not able to make that voice effective, if we are not able to honour the bond of the five signatories of last December, then this Nation fails in a great test and goes down in dishonour and futility.  Now the life of this Nation and the honour of this Nation is worth the lives of many individuals. And we, in grave consultation and in grave Council, have decided that if it is necessary to take the lives of many individuals then the lives of many individuals will be taken.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I share his feeling in that respect, but let me call attention of the Deputy and the Dáil to one instance that indicates in some slight way the situation and conditions which necessitate such stern measures.  It was only within the last few days that a night watchman going to his duty, probably <Col N="2270" /> a member of one of these organisations which Deputy Johnson represents, was held up by armed men, taken down one of the back streets of the city, robbed of the few shillings he possessed, and then told to clear off, and a bullet put through his back.  There was no question raised in this Dáil that any Deputy was appalled at that.  The life of that poor watchman going to his work was surely as sacred as the life of any of the men who were executed this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would allow me I will say this, I am not alleging that any Deputy was responsible for that, but I say it is the conditions existing in the country that allow such things to happen, and that make it necessary for the Government of this country to take measures to bring to an end this rule of the gun which has been bringing a condition of terror and destruction upon the country.  Now, let us understand what we are confronted with. We are faced with a definite, deliberate and avowed attempt to overturn the Government set up by the Irish people, and the means to achieve that have been the utter destruction of the economic life of the country, the breaking of the morale of the people, the midnight assassinations, the ambushing of the National troops, and after the ambushes have taken place and brave men have fallen at the hands of the ambushers, the ambushers have put up their hands and been taken away in safety to some place convenient.  Is that the road to freedom that we are to pursue, and is Ireland to be forced along that path, day after day, month after month, and are the Government to sit still, and do nothing to try and prevent those who are trying to drive Ireland down this path of National destruction?  I say it was necessary that the time should come when stern action should be taken, and, perhaps after all, as the Minister for Defence has stated, it was better that the beginning of that new phase of things should have been brought upon the country in a manner which would bring home to the minds of every man and woman in Ireland the great tragedy we are facing, the stern necessity and the stern means necessary <Col N="2271" /> to avert that tragedy.  For remember, while we sit here day after day talking, the whole fabric of the Nation's life is being shaken, and men have fallen to their death at the hands of men who are up in arms against the country, but there is no word of protest.  Not a word of protest.  Take the case the other day when Lieutenant Leonard was shot by some one of these marauders; there was no one in the Dáil to raise their voices and say this was an appalling state of things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish that the protest of the Deputies opposite had been a little more articulate and a little more emphatic. We are faced with the fact that if we are going to defend the interests of this country, its rights, its liberties, and its very existence, we have got to take measures adequate for that purpose. We are not here as a debating society. We are here with the responsible task of safeguarding the nation.  Are we doing that by allowing the men who form the National Army to be assassinated with impunity, and if when they are assassinated with impunity, instead of denouncing these assassinations or ambushes&mdash;call them what you like&mdash;we speak about the noble ideals with which those who strike them down are animated? It is time that we faced the fact that what we are up against is not a movement of idealists, or at least if they are idealists, who have become deranged idealists, and have degenerated into anarchists.  And whatever compromise or accommodation Ireland may make within any sane movement, Ireland and this Dáil and the National Government can have no accommodation and no compromise with anarchy. I challenge any man in this Dáil to get up and say that this Government ought to make terms with anarchy, to try to conduct the Government and life of this nation with a body of men who, whether <Col N="2272" /> they admit they are anarchists or not, are at least adopting the strategy and methods of anarchists.  Mr. De Valera the other day stated that if he had not his way he and those with him would go down to utter defeat and extermination. If Mr. De Valera is adamant in that, well what is the National Government to do?  Is it to accept that challenge?  It means that these are his terms and that if he does not go down in the manner he prescribes that those he confronts and whose authority he contests, you, the Government of Ireland, must go down into utter extermination and defeat.  Is that the prospect? It is to avert that, I take it, that the Government have taken the terrible and grave step they have taken.  I regret the time should have ever arrived when this should have come to pass.  Since this controversy opened I have no recollection that I have ever said one word that would conduce to such an appalling eventuality. I have tried to adhere in any controversy that has taken place to those methods suggested by Mr. De Valera when he said, &ldquo;There is a constitutional way of resolving our difficulties.  Let us not depart from it.&rdquo; If this tragedy of to-day, if this grave incident that has occurred&mdash;no graver tragedy I think has occurred for a long time&mdash;I think in the sense that it has brought men who perhaps did not realise it before to an understanding of the brink of the tragedy upon which Ireland has been hovering, if this brings home to the minds of those who failed to realise that, that the National Government is determined that the Irish nation shall not go down in utter defeat and extermination, that it shall stand firm, and that it shall survive, as it survived the Black-and-Tan terror and the other terrors projected from England, so shall it survive the terror of the Irregular.  If it brings home to those who are carrying on that later terror the realisation that their efforts are futile and makes him understand that if they argue out differences with the National Government and the Irish people they must argue them out in a constitutional way, then perhaps this may be the last of these sad and tragic events.  Upon their heads will rest the responsibility whether it is or it is not the last. If they desist, if they drop their arms and recognise the right of the Irish <Col N="2273" /> people to rule according to the will of the Irish people, then I believe that this tragedy of this morning may be the last, and that, sad though it is, it may be the milestone that marks the return of the Irish Nation as a whole back to the road of sanity and real National freedom. I hope that this will be the last occasion that such a discussion will arise in this Dáil, but I think that the Government ought to understand that the National Legislature, that the National Parliament of Ireland, stands with them and behind them to a man in all the legitimate steps that they think it necessary to take to save the Irish Nation from destruction, and the Irish people from the terrorism and the anarchy that has not only been hovering over but which has been torturing the life of the Nation for the last few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first to correct the impression which some Deputies may be labouring under, judging from the remarks of Deputy Lyons. The men who met their deaths this morning had a full opportunity of employing legal aid and calling witnesses in their defence.  Every person who will be tried under the Resolutions passed by the Dáil will have a full opportunity for conducting his defence, and I can safely say that no person will be executed except the person who deserves to meet his doom.  We are now coming to a time when it is necessary to open a new chapter.  From January until June we tried to avoid any fighting whatever. From June until now we have been practically demonstrating that we can prevent the people who are opposed to the majority will from holding any section of the country that we can beat them out of; in a word, showing them the futility of their attempt to prevent the majority will from prevailing.  That has been shown clearly enough, but now it is necessary to take all the measures that may be necessary to bring the state of affairs which exist in the country at the present time to the speediest possible close.  We will not prevent bloodshed by shirking stern measures now.  So much terrorism has arisen in the country that there is no such thing in reality as a Republican movement.  There is a definite movement of anarchy.  People who are doing their deeds and committing their crimes in the name and <Col N="2274" /> under the clock of Republicanism are for the most part criminals; people who are out to grab property that is not theirs; people who are out to enforce their will upon the majority, heedless of the rights of their neighbours; people who cannot settle down to ordered life, and who desire to maintain the sort of conditions in which they have power, and in which they can go about exercising authority throughout the country; people who have debts to pay and hope to avoid paying their debts.  In the condition of disorder existing we have actually what is a conspiracy of anarchy throughout the country.  That conspiracy of anarchy can only be put down as such conspiracies are put down in other countries, by taking the measures that are necessary, however stern they may be, to put it down.  The members of the Government take,&mdash;I as a member of the Government take,&mdash;the fullest responsibility for putting these men to death.  I take for myself,&mdash;as others will take for themselves,&mdash;as complete responsibility as if I had passed the sentence, and as if I had carried it myself into execution.  I am convinced that it was a just sentence and that it was a just measure.  It is no palliation of the crime of these men in the state of the country that they had not already succeeded in shooting somebody. We should and we must pass the stage when we are going to be guided in our conduct of affairs by any kind of sloppy sentiment.  If a man has a revolver for an illegal purpose, when men are using them every day for illegal purposes; if a man carries a revolver in the street, when men every day are making attacks on the National Forces, then that man must know that he does it at his own risk, and if he is taken carrying a revolver with the intention of committing a crime, with the intention of committing murder, and he only has a revolver with the intention of committing murder, then that man must get the murderer's doom.  It is time that all of us here should prepare to face the facts, and I think it should no longer be necessary that all the indignation that is expressed about any killing, or about any measure that is drastic and severe, should be expressed only when that measure is taken by the Government for the defence of the common people of the country, for the defence of the great <Col N="2275" /> majority, and that no word should ever be said, or that only the mildest expression of disapproval should come, when actions as severe as killings that have no justification are done by people on the other side.  The whole point of the matter was put very clearly by the Minister for Home Affairs regarding the object of this stern measure that was taken to-day, and that will I am afraid have to be taken again, because at this stage I do not think that the execution of four would suffice.  If there had not been a desire to avoid bloodshed, perhaps less bloodshed would have been necessary, but I, for one, do not regret that every effort was made up to June to avoid it. I do not regret that from June till now every possible effort was made to restrict the loss of life, but I do believe that it is quite possible that that reluctance to take life may make it necessary to take more life now than what would have been the case.  But the one way to avoid unnecessary bloodshed is for all the people concerned to let it be known that they are determined not to shrink from whatever bloodshed may be necessary for the achieving of the object in view.  This Nation is now suffering from the effects of a deadly cancer.  We must use the knife to cut it out, and it would have been better for us never to have begun asserting the will of the majority of the Irish people if we were not prepared to go through with it, and to see that the fruits of our struggle, both against the alien enemy and against the domestic enemy, are garnered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are special, and I want to make my position clear.  The object which I had has been achieved.  We know now what we would not have known from the announcement in the evening papers, that the men executed were taken in arms in the streets, with loaded arms, and obviously with the intention of attacking someone, presumably preparing an ambush. I will assume that that is the case, although the evidence is not very clear.  I have the uttermost detestation of the street ambushes above everything that is happening in this country, and I have not the slightest sympathy, nor <Col N="2276" /> do I want to utter one word which would seem to condone in any way whatever, the action of any man, or woman, who is engaged in the organisation of ambushes in the city streets. The protest, or, at least, the question that I raised was because of the uninformative announcement, and I think the reputation of the Government will have been saved by the statement that that query has educed.  Recent statements that have appeared, recent developments, conclusively prove to me that there is not going to be any life for this nation unless by the taking of stringent measures.  I think we are driven to recognise that life will have to be taken, but I want, at all times, the Government which is going to be responsible, with the rest of us, for the taking of life in defence of the nation, to keep themselves right, in view of the people of the nation, and in view of posterity.  Four executions have taken place, and we might well have thought, from the announcement, that these had been of men who had possession of revolvers in their homes.  It is not right that the chance even of such an interpretation of the action of the military authorities in this matter could have been made by any reader.  It is necessary that full information should be given when any action of this kind is taken.  I believe that stringent measures must be taken. You have been challenged to take these stringent measures.  The country and the majority Government of the country have been defied to take these stringent measures, and men and women, high ideals as they may have&mdash;and we know that idealists are in all ages and in all countries willing to go to their death&mdash;but in the words of the leader, &ldquo;as a principle of order,&rdquo; it is necessary to take up that challenge, and to make it impossible for the destructive element to assume dominance.  That is my position, and I go further and I will say that the people who are challenging a conflict on the physical plane cannot command sympathy when, having been reversed on that physical plane, they fall back on the moral plane.  That is not heroism, it is cowardice.  I applaud and I will applaud the people who are prepared to fight this Government, or any Government, on the basis of non-co-operation and civil disobedience and all the rest. I wish this fight had been conducted on that plane since the beginning, but I <Col N="2277" /> am not going to express any sympathy, or have any sympathy, for people who challenge on the physical plane, and then fell back on the moral plane in the hope that they will, by that higher weapon, defeat the lower which they originally took in hands.  I am glad that we have had the explanation that the men executed this morning&mdash;and I take it that the proof was absolute&mdash;were executed because they were preparing an ambush, but I say that if there will be any more announcements of executions let them be explanatory, so that they will justify to the public mind the action of the Government.</P>

      <P>I have been knocked a little off what I had intended saying. After the announcement, or the plea of justification made for those executions, or rather after the delivery of the address of the Minister for Defence, when that address was applauded it brought me back to the allegations which were made against the Irish Party in Westminster when they were supposed to have applauded the executions of the men of 1916, and which they denied. I may say, to start with, that when the address of the Minister for Defence was delivered there was no clapping of hands from this side, nor from some on the other side, but in order to proceed with my subject I would say that when such a matter of grave importance as that carried out this morning&mdash;such a tragedy, to my mind at any rate&mdash;had been decided upon, this Dáil should have been in possession of the facts and should have been acquainted that such a sentence had been promulgated.  I was under the impression that prior to any of these sentences being carried out, at least for a few days, such sentence would be laid on the Table of the Dáil.  I may not be correct, but at any rate if things were to be done in the right way that should be done.  So far as I see things these executions which unfortunately have taken place appear to me, at any rate, to be the writing on the wall, and if the members of this Dáil think they will be able to put down those who hold Republican views in Ireland by executions of this sort you will have to execute every Republican in Ireland and you will still have the Republican spirit alive.  I am one who holds Republican views, and <Col N="2281" /> I am neither afraid nor ashamed to say it.  My views are the establishment of a Co-operative Commonwealth.</P>

It has not, and time will justify that, as time did justify 1916. The whole of the people of Ireland were supposed to be behind John Redmond and his party in 1916.  The few who started the rebellion in Dublin&mdash;the insignificant few, as they were contemptuously referred to at the time&mdash;were the means of saving the nation from losing its soul, and though at the time, they were condemned for what they did, it came about that the whole country turned.  Many persons took an oath to a Republic that they meant with their life to stand by.  They fought the Black and Tans and everybody else, and when the time came around they went back of their oaths.  If there are men who stand by their oaths, and conscientiously believe they are following the right track, is that the reason why they should be put into gaol and executed, and things made so impossible for them that they cannot live?  In the town of Carlow a man, because he held certain views, and because he was supposed to have made a certain remark, was brought by armed Free State troops&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy knows I stood for the Treaty, and, what is not usual, I said up and down the constituency that I would fight for it.  I think the Deputy got rather excited as to some sort of analogy between what has occurred and Easter Week.  There is no such analogy, and the steps we are taking now are by no means pleasurable steps, but we have taken them in the best interests of the country, after giving timely notice and timely warning of the fact that we had reached the end of a phase in the life of this country when people posturing under the banner of a particular ideal would not be allowed any longer to interrupt <Col N="2283" /> the life of the country, to menace the peace and order and good government of the country, and it is for that purpose, and that purpose only, we brought in those resolutions, and, unfortunately, we have to act on them to-day.  Over two months have passed since the introduction of the resolutions, and every day of that two months has been looked upon as a day of weakness, and we have had to give evidence of the fact that we were in earnest when we introduced these resolutions. We mean to restore order at whatever cost.  If there are people opposed to us who say they are going to win or be exterminated&mdash;that is their election.  We have no desire to exterminate them.  If that be their sentence, we are going to say, as far as we are concerned, that they will not have victory without the consent of the people of <Col N="2284" /> this country, and if, to-morrow, these people at present engaged in arms against the country, surrender those arms and acknowledge the will of the people, we, I believe, will not enforce any humiliating terms upon them.  But, I think every sensible person in this country must admit, if the country is to succeed, there must be ordered government. I move the adjournment of the Dáil until Tuesday week.  We shall not be in a position to have business ready before then.</P>
